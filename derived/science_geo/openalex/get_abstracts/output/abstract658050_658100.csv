https://openalex.org/W3072295979,"Cancer cells, including melanoma cells, often metastasize regionally through the lymphatic system before metastasizing systemically through the blood1-4; however, the reason for this is unclear. Here we show that melanoma cells in lymph experience less oxidative stress and form more metastases than melanoma cells in blood. Immunocompromised mice with melanomas derived from patients, and immunocompetent mice with mouse melanomas, had more melanoma cells per microlitre in tumour-draining lymph than in tumour-draining blood. Cells that metastasized through blood, but not those that metastasized through lymph, became dependent on the ferroptosis inhibitor GPX4. Cells that were pretreated with chemical ferroptosis inhibitors formed more metastases than untreated cells after intravenous, but not intralymphatic, injection. We observed multiple differences between lymph fluid and blood plasma that may contribute to decreased oxidative stress and ferroptosis in lymph, including higher levels of glutathione and oleic acid and less free iron in lymph. Oleic acid protected melanoma cells from ferroptosis in an Acsl3-dependent manner and increased their capacity to form metastatic tumours. Melanoma cells from lymph nodes were more resistant to ferroptosis and formed more metastases after intravenous injection than did melanoma cells from subcutaneous tumours. Exposure to the lymphatic environment thus protects melanoma cells from ferroptosis and increases their ability to survive during subsequent metastasis through the blood."

https://openalex.org/W3060960901,"The accuracy of logical operations on quantum bits (qubits) must be improved for quantum computers to outperform classical ones in useful tasks. One method to achieve this is quantum error correction (QEC), which prevents noise in the underlying system from causing logical errors. This approach derives from the reasonable assumption that noise is local, that is, it does not act in a coordinated way on different parts of the physical system. Therefore, if a logical qubit is encoded non-locally, we can—for a limited time—detect and correct noise-induced evolution before it corrupts the encoded information1. In 2001, Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill (GKP) proposed a hardware-efficient instance of such a non-local qubit: a superposition of position eigenstates that forms grid states of a single oscillator2. However, the implementation of measurements that reveal this noise-induced evolution of the oscillator while preserving the encoded information3–7 has proved to be experimentally challenging, and the only realization reported so far relied on post-selection8,9, which is incompatible with QEC. Here we experimentally prepare square and hexagonal GKP code states through a feedback protocol that incorporates non-destructive measurements that are implemented with a superconducting microwave cavity having the role of the oscillator. We demonstrate QEC of an encoded qubit with suppression of all logical errors, in quantitative agreement with a theoretical estimate based on the measured imperfections of the experiment. Our protocol is applicable to other continuous-variable systems and, in contrast to previous implementations of QEC10–14, can mitigate all logical errors generated by a wide variety of noise processes and facilitate fault-tolerant quantum computation. Quantum error correction of Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill code states is realized experimentally in a superconducting quantum device."

https://openalex.org/W3070670479,"The serum level of iron in humans is tightly controlled by the action of the hormone hepcidin on the iron efflux transporter ferroportin. Hepcidin regulates iron absorption and recycling by inducing the internalization and degradation of ferroportin1. Aberrant ferroportin activity can lead to diseases of iron overload, such as haemochromatosis, or iron limitation anaemias2. Here we determine cryogenic electron microscopy structures of ferroportin in lipid nanodiscs, both in the apo state and in complex with hepcidin and the iron mimetic cobalt. These structures and accompanying molecular dynamics simulations identify two metal-binding sites within the N and C domains of ferroportin. Hepcidin binds ferroportin in an outward-open conformation and completely occludes the iron efflux pathway to inhibit transport. The carboxy terminus of hepcidin directly contacts the divalent metal in the ferroportin C domain. Hepcidin binding to ferroportin is coupled to iron binding, with an 80-fold increase in hepcidin affinity in the presence of iron. These results suggest a model for hepcidin regulation of ferroportin, in which only ferroportin molecules loaded with iron are targeted for degradation. More broadly, our structural and functional insights may enable more targeted manipulation of the hepcidin–ferroportin axis in disorders of iron homeostasis. Structures of the iron transporter ferroportin and the peptide hormone hepcidin suggest how iron homeostasis is tightly regulated."
https://openalex.org/W3072660569,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in human blood are a potential source of biomarkers. To which extent anticoagulation affects their concentration, cellular origin and protein composition is largely unexplored. To study this, blood from 23 healthy subjects was collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD), citrate or EDTA, or without anticoagulation to obtain serum. EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation or by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for fluorescence-SEC. EVs were analyzed by micro flow cytometry, NTA, TEM, Western blot, and protein mass spectrometry. The plasma EV concentration was unaffected by anticoagulants, but serum contained more platelet EVs. The protein composition of plasma EVs differed between anticoagulants, and between plasma and serum. Comparison to other studies further revealed that the shared EV protein composition resembles the ""protein corona"" of synthetic nanoparticles incubated in plasma or serum. In conclusion, we have validated a higher concentration of platelet EVs in serum than plasma by contemporary EV methods. Anticoagulation should be carefully described (i) to enable study comparison, (ii) to utilize available sample cohorts, and (iii) when preparing/selecting biobank samples. Further, the similarity of the EV protein corona and that of nanoparticles implicates that EVs carry both intravesicular and extravesicular cargo, which will expand their applicability for biomarker discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3068292362,"Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most commonly mutated gene in familial Parkinson’s disease1 and is also linked to its idiopathic form2. LRRK2 has been proposed to function in membrane trafficking3 and colocalizes with microtubules4. Despite the fundamental importance of LRRK2 for understanding and treating Parkinson’s disease, structural information on the enzyme is limited. Here we report the structure of the catalytic half of LRRK2, and an atomic model of microtubule-associated LRRK2 built using a reported cryo-electron tomography in situ structure5. We propose that the conformation of the LRRK2 kinase domain regulates its interactions with microtubules, with a closed conformation favouring oligomerization on microtubules. We show that the catalytic half of LRRK2 is sufficient for filament formation and blocks the motility of the microtubule-based motors kinesin 1 and cytoplasmic dynein 1 in vitro. Kinase inhibitors that stabilize an open conformation relieve this interference and reduce the formation of LRRK2 filaments in cells, whereas inhibitors that stabilize a closed conformation do not. Our findings suggest that LRRK2 can act as a roadblock for microtubule-based motors and have implications for the design of therapeutic LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. The structure of the catalytic half of LRRK2 and an atomic model of microtubule-associated LRRK2 suggest that the conformation of the kinase controls the association of LRRK2 with microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W3067151702,"Interfaces in heterostructures have been a key point of interest in condensed-matter physics for decades owing to a plethora of distinctive phenomena—such as rectification1, the photovoltaic effect2, the quantum Hall effect3 and high-temperature superconductivity4—and their critical roles in present-day technical devices. However, the symmetry modulation at interfaces and the resultant effects have been largely overlooked. Here we show that a built-in electric field that originates from band bending at heterostructure interfaces induces polar symmetry therein that results in emergent functionalities, including piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity, even though the component materials are centrosymmetric. We study classic interfaces—namely, Schottky junctions—formed by noble metal and centrosymmetric semiconductors, including niobium-doped strontium titanium oxide crystals, niobium-doped titanium dioxide crystals, niobium-doped barium strontium titanium oxide ceramics, and silicon. The built-in electric field in the depletion region induces polar structures in the semiconductors and generates substantial piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects. In particular, the pyroelectric coefficient and figure of merit of the interface are over one order of magnitude larger than those of conventional bulk polar materials. Our study enriches the functionalities of heterostructure interfaces, offering a distinctive approach to realizing energy transduction beyond the conventional limitation imposed by intrinsic symmetry. A built-in electric field at the interface of metals and centrosymmetric semiconductors is shown to induce polar structures in the semiconductors and generate substantial piezoelectric and pyroelectric effects."

Overall, our results suggest a mechanism of stepwise changes in ESCRT-III filament structure and mechanical properties via exchange of the filament subunits to catalyze ESCRT-III activity. Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a complex endomembrane system that requires membrane remodeling machineries for its maintenance and dynamics. While it is not known how this endomembrane system evolved, it has been proposed that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III), which was presumably inherited from archaea during evolution, is essential to the emergence of endomembranes (Baum and Baum, 2014Baum D.A. Baum B. An inside-out origin for the eukaryotic cell.BMC Biol. 2014; 12: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Uniquely, ESCRT-III has the ability to catalyze membrane fission from within membrane necks and to function on virtually all cellular membranes: it catalyzes formation of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) from the endosome membrane, cytokinetic abscission of the plasma membrane, reformation of the nuclear envelope, and closure of autophagosomes (Schöneberg et al., 2017Schöneberg J. Lee I.-H. Iwasa J.H. Hurley J.H. Reverse-topology membrane scission by the ESCRT proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). ESCRT-III-mediated membrane fission is also involved in the budding of various virions in eukaryotes and archaea and in repairing the plasma membrane as well as lysosomal and nuclear membranes (Vietri et al., 2020Vietri M. Radulovic M. Stenmark H. The many functions of ESCRTs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This repair function was shown to help confine bacterial pathogens to the host vacuole (Vietri et al., 2020Vietri M. Radulovic M. Stenmark H. The many functions of ESCRTs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Its ubiquitous role in vital cellular functions defines ESCRT-III as an essential membrane remodeling complex. Understanding how it performs its function is thus critical. Canonically recruited by ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III assembly starts with Vps20 followed by the core subunits Snf7, Vps2, and Vps24. Vps2 and Vps24 bind Snf7 in tandem and then recruit the AAA-ATPase Vps4 (Babst et al., 2002Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Estepa-Sabal E.J. Meerloo T. Emr S.D.

Attempts to reconstitute membrane fission in vitro using ESCRT-III core subunits have led to conflicting reports regarding the role of Vps4 (Schöneberg et al., 2018Schöneberg J. Pavlin M.R. Yan S.

While further constriction can be achieved by the addition of Vps4 (Maity et al., 2019Maity S. Caillat C. Miguet N. Sulbaran G. Effantin G. Schoehn G. Roos W.H. Weissenhorn W. VPS4 triggers constriction and cleavage of ESCRT-III helical filaments.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5: eaau7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), these dimensions remain far from the theoretical limit of 3 nm required for spontaneous fission (Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2002Kozlovsky Y. Kozlov M.M. Stalk model of membrane fusion: solution of energy crisis.Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 882-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional factors or mechanisms are at play in ESCRT-III-dependent membrane fission. Aside from the core ESCRT-III proteins, accessory ESCRT-III proteins have been proposed to play roles in the context of specific ESCRT-III functions (Schöneberg et al., 2017Schöneberg J. Lee I.-H. Iwasa J.H. Hurley J.H. Reverse-topology membrane scission by the ESCRT proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Two of these, CHMP1 and IST1, contribute to many ESCRT-dependent processes and have a strong loss-of-function abscission phenotype (Agromayor et al., 2009Agromayor M. Carlton J.G. Phelan J.P.

CHMP1B-IST1 co-polymers also form the tightest ESCRT-III helices and are able to constrict membrane tubules (McCullough et al., 2015McCullough J. Clippinger A.K. Talledge N. Skowyra M.L.

To study how ESCRT-III polymers recruit Did2 and Ist1, we incubated Alexa488-Snf7-patches grown on supported lipid bilayers (Chiaruttini et al., 2015Chiaruttini N. Redondo-Morata L. Colom A.

Like Vps2 and Vps24, which bind Snf7 as an obligatory dimer (Mierzwa et al., 2017Mierzwa B.E. Chiaruttini N. Redondo-Morata L. von Filseck J.M. König J. Larios J. Poser I. Müller-Reichert T.

Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Did2 was co-recruited with Vps2 to Snf7-patches suggesting that Vps2 and Did2 form a novel Snf7-binding sub-complex, a notion supported by recent genetic studies (Brune et al., 2019Brune T. Kunze-Schumacher H. Kölling R. Interactions in the ESCRT-III network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 2019; 65: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar; Heinzle et al., 2019Heinzle C. Mücke L. Brune T. Kölling R. Comprehensive analysis of yeast ESCRT-III composition in single ESCRT-III deletion mutants.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 2031-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Did2-binding was, however, strongly enhanced by Vps24. Consistently with its known affinity for Did2, Ist1 recruitment mirrored that of Did2, in that it was recruited with Vps2-Did2 and bound most efficiently to Snf7-patches in the presence of Vps2-Vps24-Did2 (Figures S1C and S1D). Altogether, these findings indicate that ESCRT-III subunits are organized in a recruitment cascade: membrane-bound Snf7 recruits Vps2-Vps24, which recruits Vps2-Did2, which then recruits Ist1 (Figure 1B). This led us to wonder about the binding dynamics of the different subunits. Thus, we extracted kymographs of each subunit from midsections of pre-grown Snf7-patches after simultaneous addition of all subunits (Figure 1C). Strikingly, the recruitment dynamics of the subunits followed the same order expected from our affinity study (Figure 1B).Figure S1Vps2 and Did2 Form a Snf7-Binding Complex, Related to Figures 1, 2, and 3Show full captionA-B.

To better characterize Vps2-Did2, the most poorly described ESCRT-III sub-complex, we performed negative stain electron microscopy of Snf7-coated liposomes incubated with Vps2, Vps24, and Did2 (Figure 1D). As previously reported (Chiaruttini et al., 2015Chiaruttini N. Redondo-Morata L. Colom A. Humbert F. Lenz M. Scheuring S. Roux A.

Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Snf7 formed single-stranded spirals, which upon addition of Vps2 and Vps24, transitioned into multimers of double-stranded spirals suggesting a lateral co-polymerization (see STAR Methods). Interestingly, the further addition of Vps2-Did2 resulted in the formation of three-stranded spirals indicating that Vps2-Did2 forms a third filament along Snf7-(Vps2-Vps24) filaments (Figure 1D). Strikingly, intertwined multi-stranded spiral-like polymers formed upon addition of Vps2-Did2 alone to Snf7-spirals demonstrating that Vps2-Did2 is sufficient to induce Snf7 filament bundling (Figure S1E). To better understand how Did2-Vps2 and Vps24-Vps2 interact within ESCRT-III polymers, Snf7-patches were incubated with Vps2, Atto565-Did2, and increasing concentrations of Vps24. Consistent with the Vps24-mediated enhancement of Did2-Vps2 co-recruitment (Figures S1A and S1B), the Did2 binding rate and level of recruitment were the highest when Vps2, Vps24, and Did2 were added at stoichiometric ratios of 2:1:1 (Figures S1F and S1G). Conversely, higher concentrations of Vps24 reduced binding of Did2 to Snf7-patches. Because competitive binding between Vps24 and Did2 for Vps2 seems unlikely in a scenario where Vps24 also participates in Did2 recruitment, the inhibition of Did2-binding likely resulted from depletion of Vps2 from the soluble protein pool by binding to Vps24. Because formation of a Did2-homopolymer on top of pre-existing Snf7-(Vps2-Vps24) filaments should not be affected by depletion of free Vps2, the inhibition of Did2-binding upon Vps2-depletion strongly suggests that Did2 is recruited to ESCRT-III as Did2-Vps2 heterodimers. Because Snf7-Vps2-Vps24-Did2 forms three-stranded filaments, while Snf7 is sufficient to recruit Vps2-Did2, and Vps2-Vps24 enhances Did2 recruitment, we think that Vps2-Did2 forms a heteropolymer that interacts with both Snf7 and Vps2-Vps24 filaments (Figure 1D). We further speculate that the three strands observed in Snf7-Vps2-Vps24-Did2 spirals are formed by a sequential polymerization that is initiated by an Snf7 homo-filament, along which a Vps24-Vps2 hetero-filament copolymerizes, which then recruits Did2-Vps2 (Figure 1D). Consistent with this sequence, Did2 did not affect Vps2-Vps24 binding to Snf7 (Figure S1H). Because Did2 appears to have similar interactions with ESCRT-III subunits as Vps24, we next compared the functional properties of Vps2-Did2 and Vps2-Vps24. First, we tested Vps2-Did2 for its ability to inhibit Snf7 polymerization, a well described feature of Vps2-Vps24 (Mierzwa et al., 2017Mierzwa B.E. Chiaruttini N. Redondo-Morata L. von Filseck J.M.

Although addition of Vps2-Vps24 arrested growing Snf7-patches, Snf7-patches still grew slowly in presence of Vps2-Did2 (Figure 1E). This partial inhibition of growth could arise because Vps2-Did2 is only a weak inhibitor of Snf7 polymerization, or because Vps2-Did2 has a relatively low affinity for Snf7 polymers (Figure 1C). To discriminate these two possibilities, Snf7-patches were saturated with Vps2-Did2 in absence of free Snf7, before free Snf7 was re-introduced. In this case, growth was fully inhibited (Figure 1E). The addition of Vps2-Vps24-Did2 inhibited growth as efficiently as Vps2-Vps24 (Figure S1I). These results indicate that Vps2-Did2, like Vps2-Vps24, can fully inhibit Snf7 polymerization. However, presumably because of its lower affinity for Snf7, Vps2-Did2 does not reach sufficient stoichiometry in the copolymer to fully inhibit Snf7 polymerization. Most likely, this partial inhibition of Snf7 polymerization by Vps2-Did2 explains the large variation in size and number of strands observed in Snf7-Vps2-Did2 spirals (Figure S1E). The second function of Vps2-Vps24 is to recruit Vps4, which promotes disassembly of ESCRT-III in absence of free Snf7. Interestingly, Vps2-Did2 promoted disassembly of Snf7-patches more efficiently than Vps2-Vps24 (Figure 1F). When both Vps24 and Did2 were present in equimolar amounts, Did2 dominated the disassembly dynamics (Figure 1F). These results show that Vps2-Vps24 and Vps2-Did2, although having seemingly redundant functions in ESCRT-III assembly, possess functional specializations, with Vps2-Vps24 having a stronger affinity for Snf7-polymers, whereas Vps2-Did2 stimulates Vps4 more efficiently. Because Vps2-Vps24 and Vps2-Did2 are sequentially recruited to Snf7-patches, we wondered if their disassembly also follows a fixed order. Thus, we monitored Vps24 and Did2 levels upon Vps4-triggered disassembly of Snf7-(Atto565-Did2)-(Alexa488-Vps24)-Vps2-patches. Interestingly, Vps24 promptly disassembled upon addition of Vps4/ATP, whereas Did2 intensity initially increased on Snf7-patches (Figure 2A) suggesting that Vps4 exchanges Vps24 for Did2 in Vps2 heteropolymers. To test this, the disassembly of Snf7-(Alexa488-Vps24)-(Atto565-Vps2)-patches was monitored in the presence and absence of Did2, and the ratio of Vps24 and Vps2 fluorescence intensities (Vps24/Vps2 ratio) was observed. Similar experiments were performed using Snf7-Vps24-(Alexa488-Vps2)-(Atto565-Did2)-patches to assess the Did2/Vps2 ratio. Intriguingly, the Vps24/Vps2 ratio decreased upon Vps4-induced subunit-turnover in presence of Did2, whereas it remained stable when Did2 was missing (Figure 2B). Conversely, the Did2/Vps2 ratio initially increased and then plateaued, implying that Vps24 is first exchanged for Did2 (initial phase) (Figure 2B), before the Did2-Vps2 filament disassembled (plateau). Taken together, these findings reveal the exchange of subunits within a persistent ESCRT-III polymer that is driven by the different biochemical properties of the subunits themselves. Due to its stronger affinity for Snf7, Vps24-Vps2 is recruited first to Snf7-patches. Vps24 is then exchanged for Did2, which stimulates Vps4 activity to remove Snf7 while Vps2 remains stably bound at the membrane. These dyn"

The proliferation of mHealth has not been accompanied by a corresponding growth in design guidelines for mHealth applications. This paper proposes a framework for mHealth application design that combines the Information Systems Research (ISR) framework and design thinking. We demonstrate a use case for the proposed framework in the form of an app to read the result of the tuberculin skin test (TST), which is used to screen for latent tuberculosis infection. The framework was used in the re-design of the TST reading app but could also be used in earlier stages of mHealth app design. Methods The ISR framework and design thinking were merged based on how the modes of design thinking integrate with the cycles of the ISR framework. Using the combined framework, we re-designed an mHealth app for TST reading, intended to be used primarily in a developing context by healthcare workers. Using the proposed framework, the app was iterated upon and developed with the aid of personas, observations, prototyping and questionnaires. Result The combined framework was applied through engagement with end-users, namely ten healthcare workers and ten graduate students. Through review of the literature and iterations of the app prototype, we identified various usability requirements and limitations. These included challenges related to image capture and a misunderstanding of instructions. These insights influenced the development and improvement of the app. Conclusion The combined framework allowed for engagement with end-users and for low-cost, rapid development of the app while addressing contextual challenges and needs. The integration of design thinking modes with the ISR cycles was effective in achieving the objectives of each approach. The combined framework acknowledges the importance of engaging users when implementing mHealth technologies, especially in developing and under-resourced contexts. Findings from this study support the use of this framework as a guide in the design of user-centred mHealth interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3060426038,"The liquid–liquid transition (LLT), in which a single-component liquid transforms into another one via a first-order phase transition, is an intriguing phenomenon that has changed our perception of the liquid state. LLTs have been predicted from computer simulations of water1,2, silicon3, carbon dioxide4, carbon5, hydrogen6 and nitrogen7. Experimental evidence has been found mostly in supercooled (that is, metastable) liquids such as Y2O3–Al2O3 mixtures8, water9 and other molecular liquids10–12. However, the LLT in supercooled liquids often occurs simultaneously with crystallization, making it difficult to separate the two phenomena13. A liquid–liquid critical point (LLCP), similar to the gas–liquid critical point, has been predicted at the end of the LLT line that separates the low- and high-density liquids in some cases, but has not yet been experimentally observed for any materials. This putative LLCP has been invoked to explain the thermodynamic anomalies of water1. Here we report combined in situ density, X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements that provide direct evidence for a first-order LLT and an LLCP in sulfur. The transformation manifests itself as a sharp density jump between the low- and high-density liquids and by distinct features in the pair distribution function. We observe a non-monotonic variation of the density jump with increasing temperature: it first increases and then decreases when moving away from the critical point. This behaviour is linked to the competing effects of density and entropy in driving the transition. The existence of a first-order LLT and a critical point in sulfur could provide insight into the anomalous behaviour of important liquids such as water. Under high pressure, elemental sulfur shows a sharp density discontinuity that evolves with pressure and temperature and terminates at a critical point, indicating a first-order liquid–liquid phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W3057437418,"During meiosis, crossover recombination connects homologous chromosomes to direct their accurate segregation1. Defective crossing over causes infertility, miscarriage and congenital disease. Each pair of chromosomes attains at least one crossover via the formation and biased resolution of recombination intermediates known as double Holliday junctions2,3. A central principle of crossover resolution is that the two Holliday junctions are resolved in opposite planes by targeting nuclease incisions to specific DNA strands4. The endonuclease activity of the MutLγ complex has been implicated in the resolution of crossovers5–10, but the mechanisms that activate and direct strand-specific cleavage remain unknown. Here we show that the sliding clamp PCNA is important for crossover-biased resolution. In vitro assays with human enzymes show that PCNA and its loader RFC are sufficient to activate the MutLγ endonuclease. MutLγ is further stimulated by a co-dependent activity of the pro-crossover factors EXO1 and MutSγ, the latter of which binds Holliday junctions11. MutLγ also binds various branched DNAs, including Holliday junctions, but does not show canonical resolvase activity, implying that the endonuclease incises adjacent to junction branch points to achieve resolution. In vivo, RFC facilitates MutLγ-dependent crossing over in budding yeast. Furthermore, PCNA localizes to prospective crossover sites along synapsed chromosomes. These data highlight similarities between crossover resolution and the initiation steps of DNA mismatch repair12,13 and evoke a novel model for crossover-specific resolution of double Holliday junctions during meiosis. A new mechanism explaining how double Holliday junctions are specifically resolved into crossovers during meiosis is shown that resembles the initiation of DNA mismatch repair."

Activity from the super-massive black hole at the Galactic Centre, which is coincident with the radio source Sagittarius A*, and stellar feedback from the inner molecular ring1 expel matter and energy from the disk in the form of a galactic wind2. Multiphase gas has been observed within this outflow, including hot highly ionized3,4 (temperatures of about 106 kelvin), warm ionized5,6 (104 to 105 kelvin) and cool atomic7,8 (103 to 104 kelvin) gas. However, so far there has been no evidence of the cold dense molecular phase (10 to 100 kelvin). Here we report observations of molecular gas outflowing from the centre of our Galaxy. This cold material is associated with atomic hydrogen clouds travelling in the nuclear wind8. The morphology and the kinematics of the molecular gas, resolved on a scale of about one parsec, indicate that these clouds are mixing with the warmer medium and are possibly being disrupted. The data also suggest that the mass of the molecular gas outflow is not negligible and could affect the rate of star formation in the central regions of the Galaxy. The presence of this cold, dense and high-velocity gas is puzzling, because neither Sagittarius A* at its current level of activity nor star formation in the inner Galaxy seems to be a viable source for this material. Observations of a cold molecular gas associated with the atomic hydrogen outflow from the centre of our Galaxy indicate that this gas has a surprisingly high mass but unclear origin."
https://openalex.org/W3059618284,"Abstract VHL mutations are the most common tumorigenic lesions in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and result in continued activation of the HIF/VEGF pathway and uncontrolled cancer progression. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors such as sunitinib have been demonstrated to target tumorigenic signaling pathways, delay tumor progression, and improve patient prognosis in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Although several mechanisms of sunitinib resistance have been reported, the solutions to overcome this resistance remain unclear. In our study, we found that increased expression of Y-box binding protein 1 (YB1, a multidrug resistance associated protein) and EphA2 (a member of the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor family, belonging to the RTK family) mediated sunitinib resistance and mRCC exhibited a large phenotypic dependence on YB1 and EphA2. In addition, our findings confirm that YB1 promotes the invasion, metastasis and sunitinib resistance of ccRCC by regulating the EphA2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of EphA2 through the small molecule inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 reduced the proliferation of sunitinib-resistant tumor cells, suppressed tumor growth in vivo, and restored the sensitivity of sunitinib-resistant tumor cells to sunitinib in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YB1 increases the protein levels of EphA2 by maintaining the protein stability of EphA2 through inhibition of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Collectively, our findings provide the theoretical rationale that ccRCC metastasis and RTK-directed therapeutic resistance could be prospectively and purposefully targeted."
https://openalex.org/W3065252392,"In the Late Middle Paleolithic of Central Europe, two main cultural complexes have been distinguished: the Micoquian or Keilmessergruppe (KMG), and the Mousterian. Their differences mainly consist in the frequence of some retouched tools and the presence of bifacial technology. When these industries coexist, one element of discussion is the application of different concepts to manufacture tools with the same techno-functionality. This is particularly true for backed artifacts, such as Keilmesser (backed, asymmetrical bifacially-shaped knives) opposed to flake-tools equipped with a natural or knapped back. We conducted a techno-functional analysis of the backed tools from the G-Layer-Complex of Sesselfelsgrotte, one of the main Late Middle Paleolithic sequences in Central Europe, characterized by a combination of KMG and Mousterian aspects. In order to better understand the morpho-metrical data, 3D scans were used for recording technical features and performing semi-automatic geometric morphometrics. Results indicate that the techno-functional schemes of Keilmesser show a moderate variability and often overlap with the schemes of other typological groups. Within bifacial backed knives, a process of imitation of unifacial flake tools' functionaly was recognized particularly in the cutting edge manufacturing. Keilmesser proved to be the long-life, versatile version of backed flake-tools, also due to the recurrent valence as both tool and core. This is why Keilmesser represent an ideal strategic blank when a mobile and multi-functional tool is needed. Based on these data, it is assumed that the relationship between Mousterian and KMG is deeply rooted and the emergence of KMG aspects could be related to constrained situations characterizing the long cold stages of the Early Weichselian. A higher regional mobility caused by the comparably low predictability of resources characterized the subsistence tactics of Neanderthal groups especially at the borders of their overall distribution. For this reason, Keilmesser could have represented an ecological answer before possibly becoming a marker of cultural identity."
https://openalex.org/W3077461311,"Due to datasets have continuously grown, efforts have been performed in the attempt to solve the problem related to the large amount of unlabeled data in disproportion to the scarcity of labeled data. Another important issue is related to the trade-off between the difficulty in obtaining annotations provided by a specialist and the need for a significant amount of annotated data to obtain a robust classifier. In this context, active learning techniques jointly with semi-supervised learning are interesting. A smaller number of more informative samples previously selected (by the active learning strategy) and labeled by a specialist can propagate the labels to a set of unlabeled data (through the semi-supervised one). However, most of the literature works neglect the need for interactive response times that can be required by certain real applications. We propose a more effective and efficient active semi-supervised learning framework, including a new active learning method. An extensive experimental evaluation was performed in the biological context (using the ALL-AML, Escherichia coli and PlantLeaves II datasets), comparing our proposals with state-of-the-art literature works and different supervised (SVM, RF, OPF) and semi-supervised (YATSI-SVM, YATSI-RF and YATSI-OPF) classifiers. From the obtained results, we can observe the benefits of our framework, which allows the classifier to achieve higher accuracies more quickly with a reduced number of annotated samples. Moreover, the selection criterion adopted by our active learning method, based on diversity and uncertainty, enables the prioritization of the most informative boundary samples for the learning process. We obtained a gain of up to 20% against other learning techniques. The active semi-supervised learning approaches presented a better trade-off (accuracies and competitive and viable computational times) when compared with the active supervised learning ones."

However, how odor object representations are generated in the brain remains elusive. Here, we investigate sensory transformation between the primary olfactory center and its downstream region, the mushroom body (MB), in Drosophila and show that clustered representations for mixtures and groups of odors emerge in the MB at the population and single-cell levels. Decoding analyses demonstrate that neurons selective for mixtures and groups enhance odor generalization. Responses of these neurons and those selective for individual odors all emerge in an experimentally well-constrained model implementing divergent-convergent, random connectivity between the primary center and the MB. Furthermore, we found that relative odor representations are conserved across animals despite this random connectivity. Our results show that the generation of distinct representations for individual odors and groups and mixtures of odors in the MB can be understood in a unified computational and mechanistic framework."

https://openalex.org/W3076755297,"Animal structural body size and condition are often measured to evaluate individual health, identify responses to environmental change and food availability, and relate food availability to effects on reproduction and survival. A variety of condition metrics have been developed but relationships between these metrics and vital rates are rarely validated. Identifying an optimal approach to estimate the body condition of polar bears is needed to improve monitoring of their response to decline in sea ice habitat. Therefore, we examined relationships between several commonly used condition indices (CI), body mass, and size with female reproductive success and cub survival among polar bears (Ursus maritimus) measured in two subpopulations over three decades. To improve measurement and application of morphometrics and CIs, we also examined whether CIs are independent of age and structural size-an important assumption for monitoring temporal trends-and factors affecting measurement precision and accuracy. Maternal CIs and mass measured the fall prior to denning were related to cub production. Similarly, maternal CIs, mass, and length were related to the mass of cubs or yearlings that accompanied her. However, maternal body mass, but not CIs, measured in the spring was related to cub production and only maternal mass and length were related to the probability of cub survival. These results suggest that CIs may not be better indicators of fitness than body mass in part because CIs remove variation associated with body size that is important in affecting fitness. Further, CIs exhibited variable relationships with age for growing bears and were lower for longer bears despite body length being related to cub survival and female reproductive success. These results are consistent with findings from other species indicating that body mass is a useful metric to link environmental conditions and population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3073556877,"Maintaining social relationships depends on the ability to recognize partners or group members against other individuals. This is especially important in animals with relatively stable social groups. The amphisbaenian Trogonophis wiegmanni is a semi blind fossorial reptile that spends its entire life underground where it interacts with mates and social partners. In this environment, visual cues are limited. Chemosensory cues may rather allow conspecific social and partner recognition. We recorded the number of tongue-flick (TF) rates of T. wiegmanni amphisbaenians to scents of both sexes with different pairing social bonds (familiar vs. unfamiliar) presented on cotton swabs to test discrimination of social groups. As seen from a rise in the number of TFs, males discriminated unfamiliar females from unfamiliar males. This suggests that chemical cues may be used by males to locate new mates. In contrast, females detected scent of unfamiliar conspecifics, but did not show sex discrimination. Both males and females discriminated the scent of an individual with which they had formed a pair bond from an unfamiliar individual of the same sex as the partner. Also, males, but not females, were capable of self-recognition, suggesting that scent marks of males in home ranges may provide individual information in intrasexual relationships. We conclude that conspecific discrimination based on chemical cues may allow the maintenance of social relationships and relatively stable pairs in fossorial reptiles inhabiting visually restricted environments."
https://openalex.org/W3050165501,"Objectives As an important public health concern, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is related to lack of knowledge among healthcare professionals. Since the Global Action Plan on AMR highlights the importance of training all healthcare professionals, it is essential to focus our attention on the education related to judicious antimicrobial use. The current study was the first attempt in southeastern Europe to quantify the knowledge about antimicrobial usage and biosecurity measure among veterinary students. Methods This questionnaire-based study was performed between April and May of 2019 on 213 veterinary students of the University of Novi Sad, Serbia and the University of Zagreb, Croatia. Results Veterinary students appeared to be little aware of antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine contribution to overall AMR since only 56.8% have chosen strong contribution as the answer. Of the students surveyed, only 22.1%/35.7% of them strongly agreed/agreed that the amount of teaching time for pharmacology was about right. Students who denied having good knowledge of the pharmacology of antimicrobials showed higher knowledge about systemic use of antimicrobials in different clinical scenarios (p = 0.002). High importance of some antimicrobials for human medicine was not recognized by surveyed students. Only 8.5% of them identified gentamicin correctly, as first-line therapy. Students expected to graduate later were more likely to identify the importance of rating antimicrobials correctly than those who thought they would graduate earlier (p = 0.002). More than half of students gave correct answer at scenario regarding a dog with recurrent pyoderma by choosing culture and susceptibility (C & S) testing. Our students who think they will graduate sooner have higher knowledge level on C & S testing sample submission for range of clinical scenarios (p = 0.004). Moreover, appropriate use of PPE (personal protective equipment) procedure and biosecurity measure were reported for two thirds of our students in case of only for two clinical scenarios. Conclusion This study reveals that among veterinary students from Croatia and Serbia improved undergraduate education is needed on the AMR with emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and appropriate biosecurity."

To be specific, in the past four decades, the spatial distribution center of China’s herbivorous animal husbandry industry has moved towards the northeast, crossing the boundary between agriculture and animal husbandry in China, presenting a clear trend of moving from pastoral area to agricultural area; the gradual narrowing of the spatial distribution range indicates the gradually increased degree of aggregation within the industry; the east-west stretch of spatial distribution has been strengthened, and the azimuth angle shows clockwise change, suggesting that the industrial expansion in the northeast-southwest direction is prominent; the influencing factors of changes in the spatial distribution of the industry reveal that the quantity and production capacity of productive land, people’s income and living standards, and the level of mechanization will promote the development of China’s herbivorous animal husbandry industry, and are essential factors influencing industrial distribution and transfer, while policy factor has small or even not significant impact on industrial aggregation, reflecting that the policy has not played the expected role, and policy support needs to be further intensified."
https://openalex.org/W3050810159,"Background Circulating microRNAs may reflect or influence pathological cardiac remodeling and contribute to atrial fibrillation (AF). Objective The purpose of this study was to identify candidate plasma microRNAs that are associated with echocardiographic phenotypes of atrial remodeling, and incident and prevalent AF in a community-based cohort. Methods We analyzed left atrial function index (LAFI) of 1788 Framingham Offspring 8 participants. We quantified expression of 339 plasma microRNAs. We examined associations between microRNA levels with LAFI and prevalent and incident AF. We constructed pathway analysis of microRNAs’ predicted gene targets to identify molecular processes involved in adverse atrial remodeling in AF. Results The mean age of the participants was 66 ± 9 years, and 54% were women. Five percent of participants had prevalent AF at the initial examination and 9% (n = 157) developed AF over a median 8.6 years of follow-up (IQR 8.1–9.2 years). Plasma microRNAs were associated with LAFI (N = 73, p<0.0001). Six of these plasma microRNAs were significantly associated with incident AF, including 4 also associated with prevalent AF (microRNAs 106b, 26a-5p, 484, 20a-5p). These microRNAs are predicted to regulate genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and myocardial fibrosis. Conclusions Circulating microRNAs 106b, 26a-5p, 484, 20a-5p are associated with atrial remodeling and AF."
https://openalex.org/W3056056718,"Snakes have been important ambush predators of both primates and human hunter-gatherers throughout their co-evolutionary history. Viperid snakes in particular are responsible for most fatal venomous snakebites worldwide and thus represent a strong selective pressure. They elicit intense fear in humans and are easily recognizable thanks to their distinctive morphotype. In this study, we measured skin resistance (SR) and heart rate (HR) in human subjects exposed to snake pictures eliciting either high fear (10 venomous viperid species) or disgust (10 nonvenomous fossorial species). Venomous snakes subjectively evaluated as frightening trigger a stronger physiological response (higher SR amplitude) than repulsive non-venomous snakes. However, stimuli presented in a block (more intense stimulation) do not trigger a stronger emotional response compared to sequentially presented stimuli (less intense stimulation). There are significant interindividual differences as subjects with high fear of snakes confronted with images of viperid snakes show stronger, longer-lasting, and more frequent changes in SR and higher HR compared to low-fear subjects. Thus, we show that humans demonstrate a remarkable ability to discriminate between dangerous viperids and harmless fossorial snakes, which is also reflected in distinct autonomous body responses."

The Mexico City subway is used daily by millions of passengers that get in contact with its surfaces. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiomes of frequently touched surfaces and compare regular and women-only wagons. We also explored the effect of surface cleaning on microbial resettling. Finally, we studied passenger behavior and characterized microbial changes after traveling. Most passengers (99%), showed some type of surface interaction during a wagon trip, mostly with the hands (92%). We found microbiome differences associated with surfaces, probably reflecting diverse surface materials and usage frequency. The platform floor was the most bacterial diverse surface, while the stair handrail and pole were the least diverse ones. After pole cleaning, the resettling of microbial diversity was fast (5–30 minutes); however, it did not resemble the initial composition. After traveling, passengers significantly increased their hand microbial diversity and converged to a similar microbial composition among passengers. Additionally, passenger hand microbiomes resembled subway surfaces in diversity. However, microbial fingerprints were preserved within passengers after traveling."
https://openalex.org/W3062841736,"Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is an important source of meat and milk in countries with relatively warm weather. Compared to the cattle genome, a little has been done to reveal its genome structure and genomic traits. This is due to the complications stemming from the large genome size, the complexity of the genome, and the high repetitive content. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality draft assembly of the Egyptian water buffalo genome. The Egyptian breed is used as a dual purpose animal (milk/meat). It is distinguished by its adaptability to the local environment, quality of feed changes, as well as its high resistance to diseases. The genome assembly of the Egyptian water buffalo has been achieved using a reference-based assembly workflow. Our workflow significantly reduced the computational complexity of the assembly process, and improved the assembly quality by integrating different public resources. We also compared our assembly to the currently available draft assemblies of water buffalo breeds. A total of 21,128 genes were identified in the produced assembly. A list of milk virgin-related genes; milk pregnancy-related genes; milk lactation-related genes; milk involution-related genes; and milk mastitis-related genes were identified in the assembly. Our results will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the genetics of the Egyptian water buffalo which will eventually support the ongoing breeding efforts and facilitate the future discovery of genes responsible for complex processes of dairy, meat production and disease resistance among other significant traits."
https://openalex.org/W3068213804,"Built environments have been cited as important facilitators of activity and research using geographic information systems (GIS) has emerged as a novel approach in exploring environmental determinants. The Active Children Through Individual Vouchers Evaluation Project used GIS to conduct a cross-sectional analysis of how teenager’s (aged 13–14) environments impacted on their amount of activity and influences fitness. The ACTIVE Project recruited 270 participants aged 13–14 (year 9) from 7 secondary schools in south Wales, UK. Demographic data and objective measures of accelerometery and fitness were collected from each participant between September and December 2016. Objective data was mapped in a GIS alongside datasets relating to activity provision, active travel routes, public transport stops, main roads and natural resources. This study shows that fitness and physical activity are not correlated. Teenagers who had higher levels of activity also had higher levels of sedentary time/inactivity. Teenagers showed higher amounts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity if their homes were closer to public transport. However, they were also more active if their schools were further away from public transport and natural resources. Teenagers were fitter if schools were closer to natural resources. Sedentary behaviour, fitness and activity do not cluster in the same teenagers. Policymakers/planning committees need to consider this when designing teenage friendly environments. Access to public transport, active travel, green space and activities that teenagers want, and need could make a significant difference to teenage health."
https://openalex.org/W3056453675,"In this in vitro study, spherical mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticle (MBGN) and non-porous bioactive glass nanoparticle (BGN) were fabricated. The impact of mesopores on dentinal tubule occlusion and bioactivity was compared to examine the potential of these materials in alleviating dentine hypersensitivity (DH). MBGN, dense BGN were synthesized by sol-gel methods and characterized. Bioactivity and ion dissolution ability were analyzed. Twenty-four simulated sensitive dentin discs were prepared and randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 each); Group 1, no treatment; Group 2, Dense BGN; Group 3, MBGN. Then, four discs per group were treated with 6wt.% citric acid challenge to determine the acidic resistance. The effects on dentinal tubule occlusion were observed by FESEM. The microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was also measured. Cytotoxicity was examined using the MTT assay. According to the results, dense BGN without mesopore and MBGN with mesopore were successfully fabricated. Dense BGN and MBGN occluded the dentinal tubule before and after acid challenge. However, only MBGN formed a membrane-like layer and showed hydroxyapatite formation after soaking SBF solution. There were no significant differences in MTBS among dense BGN, MBGN (P>0.05). The cell viability was above 72% of both materials. The higher bioactivity of MBGN compared with that of dense BGN arises from the structural difference and it is anticipated to facilitate dentin remineralization by inducing hydroxyapatite deposition within the dentinal tubule."
https://openalex.org/W3061248167,"Norovirus, the leading cause of non-bacterial food poisoning, is responsible for several outbreaks associated with bivalves and ready-to-eat food products worldwide. As norovirus is resistant to alcohol, which is commonly used in food manufacturing processes, sodium hypochlorite is used for its inactivation. However, sodium hypochlorite has two disadvantages: it cannot be added to foods, and its effect is significantly reduced in the presence of organic compounds. Thus, a novel disinfectant against norovirus is urgently required for food hygiene. Thermally denatured egg white lysozyme inactivates norovirus; however, the optimal inactivating conditions and the underlying mechanism are unclear. In the present study, the inactivating mechanism of heat-denatured lysozyme against norovirus was analyzed using murine norovirus strain 1 (MNV-1). We found that the inactivating effect was enhanced by adjusting the pH of the lysozyme solution before thermal denaturation to 6.5 or higher. The reaction of heat-denatured lysozyme and MNV-1 was irreversible, and norovirus was completely inactivated after exposure to heat-denatured lysozyme. Furthermore, it was found that lysozyme residues 5-39 contributed to the norovirus-inactivating effect. Notably, the hydrophobicity and positive charges in this region contributed to the norovirus-inactivating effect, as evidenced by the norovirus inactivation test using mutated residues 5-39. These findings are novel and highlight the possible application of heat-denatured lysozyme as a disinfectant against norovirus in a wide range of food processes."
https://openalex.org/W3058384887,"In the last decade, house sparrow populations have shown a general decline, especially in cities. Avian malaria has been recently suggested as one of the potential causes of this decline, and its detrimental effects could be exacerbated in urban habitats. It was initially thought that avian malaria parasites would not have large negative effects on wild birds because of their long co-evolution with their hosts. However, it is now well-documented that they can have detrimental effects at both the primo- and chronical infection stages. In this study, we examined avian malaria infection and its physiological and morphological consequences in four populations of wild house sparrows (2 urban and 2 rural). We did not find any relationship between the proportions of infected individuals and the urbanisation score calculated for our populations. However, we observed that the proportion of infected individuals increased during the course of the season, and that juveniles were less infected than adults. We did not detect a strong effect of malaria infection on physiological, morphological and condition indexes. Complex parasite dynamics and the presence of confounding factors could have masked the potential effects of infection. Thus, longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to understand the evolutionary ecology of this very common, but still poorly understood, wild bird parasite."
https://openalex.org/W3059168338,"To function effectively, a lower limb prosthetic socket must remain securely coupled to the residual limb during walking, running and other activities of daily living; this coupling is referred to as suspension. When this coupling is insufficient longitudinal pistoning of the socket relative to the residual limb occurs. Increasing friction of the socket/liner interface may improve socket suspension and textured sockets may be fabricated relatively easily with 3D printing. The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal displacement of sockets with different types of textures under two suspension conditions: passive suction and active vacuum. In order to do this, we developed a mock residual limb and mechanical testing protocol. Prosthetic sockets, 14 textured sockets and an Original Squirt-Shape (OSS) Socket, were fabricated from polypropylene copolymer using the Squirt-Shape™ 3D Printer and compared to a smooth socket thermoformed from polypropylene copolymer. Sockets were mounted onto a dual durometer mock residual limb and subjected to four levels of distraction forces (100 N, 250 N, 500 N and 650 N) using a hydraulic material testing system. There was a statistically significant three-way interaction between suspension, force level and texture (p < 0.0005). Longitudinal displacements between textured and reference sockets, for all force levels and both suspension conditions, were significantly different (p < 0.0005). Using these newly developed mechanical testing protocols, it was demonstrated that texturing of polypropylene copolymer sockets fabricated using Squirt-Shape significantly decreased longitudinal displacements compared to a smooth socket. However, none of the novel textured sockets significantly reduced longitudinal displacement compared to the OSS socket under passive suction suspension."
https://openalex.org/W3072380181,"It remains debatable whether slash-and-burn practices were adopted in rice cultivation by the Neolithic Kuahuqiao culture in the Ningshao Plain, one of the birthplaces of rice farming. Here, we established charcoal-based indices to reconstruct the history of fire and vegetation in the Ningshao Plain since the last glacial period. We collected representative modern vegetation and conducted combustion and fragmentation experiments to simulate fire and depositional processes, respectively. Charcoals from modern vegetation show clear morphological differences between herbaceous and woody plants. In particular, the length to width ratios (L/W) of herbaceous charcoals were systematically higher than those of woody charcoals, and the associated end-member values were 4.50 and 1.94, respectively. These values were then applied to sediment cores (KHQ-14/15) collected in proximity to the Kuahuqiao archaeological site. Results show that the amount of combusted herbaceous plants increased sharply after the Holocene, and the most remarkable rise occurred around 8550 yr B.P. This observation may reflect local environment (sedimentary and/or climatic) changes or small-scale early human activities. During the Kuahuqiao cultural period (8250−7450 yr B.P.), the relative abundance of woody charcoals increased, but the overall fire intensity decreased. This finding suggests that the Kuahuqiao farming was restricted to a small geographic area and large-scale slash-and-burn farming activities were not adopted."
https://openalex.org/W3059361574,"The largest dinosaurs were enormous animals whose body mass placed massive gravitational loads on their skeleton. Previous studies investigated dinosaurian bone strength and biomechanics, but the relationships between dinosaurian trabecular bone architecture and mechanical behavior has not been studied. In this study, trabecular bone samples from the distal femur and proximal tibia of dinosaurs ranging in body mass from 23–8,000 kg were investigated. The trabecular architecture was quantified from micro-computed tomography scans and allometric scaling relationships were used to determine how the trabecular bone architectural indices changed with body mass. Trabecular bone mechanical behavior was investigated by finite element modeling. It was found that dinosaurian trabecular bone volume fraction is positively correlated with body mass similar to what is observed for extant mammalian species, while trabecular spacing, number, and connectivity density in dinosaurs is negatively correlated with body mass, exhibiting opposite behavior from extant mammals. Furthermore, it was found that trabecular bone apparent modulus is positively correlated with body mass in dinosaurian species, while no correlation was observed for mammalian species. Additionally, trabecular bone tensile and compressive principal strains were not correlated with body mass in mammalian or dinosaurian species. Trabecular bone apparent modulus was positively correlated with trabecular spacing in mammals and positively correlated with connectivity density in dinosaurs, but these differential architectural effects on trabecular bone apparent modulus limit average trabecular bone tissue strains to below 3,000 microstrain for estimated high levels of physiological loading in both mammals and dinosaurs."

The overall response of plants to Al3+ stress has been documented, but the contribution of protein phosphorylation to Al3+ detoxicity and tolerance in plants is unclear. Using a combination of tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), Al3+-induced phosphoproteomic changes in roots of Tamba black soybean (TBS) were investigated in this study. The Data collected in this study are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD019807. After the Al3+ treatment, 189 proteins harboring 278 phosphosites were significantly changed (fold change > 1.2 or < 0.83, p < 0.05), with 88 upregulated, 96 downregulated and 5 up-/downregulated. Enrichment and protein interaction analyses revealed that differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) under the Al3+ treatment were mainly related to G-protein-mediated signaling, transcription and translation, transporters and carbohydrate metabolism. Particularly, DPPs associated with root growth inhibition or citric acid synthesis were identified. The results of this study provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of TBS post-translational modifications in response to Al3+ stress."
https://openalex.org/W3077710376,"We report the discovery of two very early, basal-amniote fossil trackways on the same bedding plane in eolian sandstone of the Pennsylvanian Manakacha Formation in Grand Canyon, Arizona. Trackway 1, which is Chelichnus-like, we interpret to be a shallow undertrackway. It displays a distinctive, sideways-drifting, footprint pattern not previously documented in a tetrapod trackway. We interpret this pattern to record the trackmaker employing a lateral-sequence gait while diagonally ascending a slope of about 20°, thereby reducing the steepness of the ascent. Trackway 2 consists only of aligned sets of claw marks. We interpret this trackway to be a deeper undertrackway, made some hours or days later, possibly by an animal that was conspecific with Trackmaker 1, while walking directly up the slope at a speed of approximately 0.1 m/sec. These trackways are the first tetrapod tracks reported from the Manakacha Formation and the oldest in the Grand Canyon region. The narrow width of both trackways indicates that both trackmakers had relatively small femoral abduction angles and correspondingly relatively erect postures. They represent the earliest known occurrence of dunefield-dwelling amniotes-either basal reptiles or basal synapsids-thereby extending the known utilization of the desert biome by amniotes, as well as the presence of the Chelichnus ichnofacies, by at least eight million years, into the Atokan/Moscovian Age of the Pennsylvanian Epoch. The depositional setting was a coastal-plain, eolian dunefield in which tidal or wadi flooding episodically interrupted eolian processes and buried the dunes in mud."

Reporting personal location data, for example, may aid efficient traffic flows and sharing one’s health status may be a crucial instrument of disease management. We experimentally study individuals’ willingness to contribute personal information to information-based public goods. Our data provide evidence that—compared to monetary contributions to public goods—information may be substantially under-provided. We show that the degree of information provision is strongly correlated to the information’s implicit (emotional and cognitive) costs. Individual’s reluctance to share personal information with high implicit, in particular emotional costs, may seriously limit the effectiveness of information-based public goods."
https://openalex.org/W3050046250,"Quantitative analysis of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) plays an increasingly important role in assessing airway disease. Depending on the algorithms used, airway dimensions may be over- or underestimated, primarily if contrast material was used. Therefore, we tested a modified integral-based method (IBM) to address this problem.Temporally resolved cine-MDCT was performed in seven ventilated pigs in breath-hold during iodinated contrast material (CM) infusion over 60s. Identical slices in non-enhanced (NE), pulmonary-arterial (PA), systemic-arterial (SA), and venous phase (VE) were subjected to an in-house software using a standard and a modified IBM. Total diameter (TD), lumen area (LA), wall area (WA), and wall thickness (WT) were measured for ten extra- and six intrapulmonary airways.The modified IBM significantly reduced TD by 7.6%, LA by 12.7%, WA by 9.7%, and WT by 3.9% compared to standard IBM on non-enhanced CT (p<0.05). Using standard IBM, CM led to a decrease of all airway parameters compared to NE. For example, LA decreased from 80.85±49.26mm2 at NE, to 75.14±47.96mm2 (-7.1%) at PA (p<0.001), 74.96±48.55mm2 (-7.3%) at SA (p<0.001), and to 78.95±48.94mm2 (-2.4%) at VE (p = 0.200). Using modified IBM, the differences were reduced to -3.1% at PA, -2.9% at SA and -0.7% at VE (p<0.001; p<0.001; p = 1.000).The modified IBM can optimize airway wall segmentation and reduce the influence of CM on quantitative CT. This allows a more precise measurement as well as potentially the comparison of enhanced with non-enhanced scans in inflammatory airway disease."
https://openalex.org/W3065416375,"It is controversial to evaluate the function of hydronephrotic kidneys by renal dynamic imaging (RDI). Our aim was to study the features of renal dynamic imaging (RDI) at different stages after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and to investigate a method that could be reasonably used to evaluate renal function and predict renal functional recoverability.We made UUO models using fifteen adult New Zealand white rabbits and systematically observed the changes in kidney morphology, blood flow, radiotracer distribution and function by RDI. We then compared the differences in terms of imaging features between different periods and analyzed the relationship between blood flow and function in obstructed kidneys.1) Obstructed kidneys gradually became larger than preoperative kidneys and contralateral kidneys (P<0.05) and reached their peak size between days 42 and 56, after which they gradually got smaller in size. 2)The correlation between the blood perfusion of the obstructed kidney and the obstruction duration (r = 0.125, P = 0.045) was very weak. In the initial period of obstruction, the perfusion of the obstructed kidney significantly decreased, followed by a sharp rebound in later days, and then the perfusion declined again. The peak in blood perfusion was on day 7. 3) The uptake rate of the obstructed kidney drastically decreased in the early stage and became lower than that of the contralateral kidney and the kidney before the operation (P<0.05), after which uptake increased gradually; the peak was on day 28. After that, uptake gradually decreased. 4) The grading of the radiotracer distribution in obstructed kidneys was positively correlated with the obstruction duration (r = 0.975, P = 0.000), and a uniform renal distribution was an early feature of obstruction. 5) The blood perfusion of the obstructed kidney and its functioning frequently increased or decreased simultaneously, but sometimes there was also a mismatch. The peak of renal blood perfusion recovery occurred prior to the peak of renal function recovery.In different periods of severe UUO, the imaged features of obstructed kidneys were different. These features are beneficial for determining the degree of hydronephrosis and renal function and predicting renal functional recoverability."

To address this gap, we transplanted hESC-derived human GABAergic interneuron progenitors into the mouse hippocampus, and then characterized their electrophysiological properties and dendritic arborizations after transplantation by means of ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp recording, followed by biocytin staining, confocal imaging and neuron reconstruction software. We asked whether particular electrophysiological and morphological properties showed maturation-dependent changes after transplantation. We also investigated whether the emergence of particular electrophysiological properties were linked to increased complexity of the dendritic arbors. Human neurons were classified into five distinct neuronal types (Type I-V), ranging from immature to mature fast-spiking interneurons. Hierarchical clustering of the dendritic morphology and Sholl analyses suggested four morphologically distinct classes (Class A-D), ranging from simple/immature to highly complex. Incorporating all of our data regardless of neuronal classification, we investigated whether any electrophysiological and morphological features correlated with time post-transplantation. This analysis demonstrated that both dendritic arbors and electrophysiological properties matured after transplantation."

The Late Upper Palaeolithic Magdalenian saw a flourishing of such depictions, encompassing cave art, engraving of stone, bone and antler blanks and decoration of tools and weapons. Though Magdalenian settlement exists as far northwest as Britain, there is a limited range of art known from this region, possibly associated with only fleeting occupation of Britain during this period. Stone plaquettes, flat fragments of stone engraved on at least one surface, have been found in large quantities at numerous sites spanning the temporal and geographical spread of the Magdalenian, but they have been absent so far from the archaeological record of the British Isles. Between 2015 and 2018, ten fragments of stone plaquettes extensively engraved with abstract designs were uncovered at the Magdalenian site of Les Varines, Jersey, Channel Islands. In this paper, we report detailed analyses of these finds, which provide new evidence for technologies of abstract mark-making, and their significance within the lives of people on the edge of the Magdalenian world. These engraved stone fragments represent important, rare evidence of artistic expression in what is the far northern and western range of the Magdalenian and add new insight to the wider significance of dynamic practices of artistic expression during the Upper Palaeolithic."

All isolated colonies on thin layer agar (7H11) were subjected to spoligotyping.One thirty three baseline cultures were positive (133/157, 84.7%), 43(32.3%) had mixture of genotypes. Twenty-four of these patients (55.8%) showed change in genotype while six showed different drug-susceptibility patterns while on treatment. Twenty-three (53.5%) patients with polyclonal infections showed resistance to at least one drug compared to 10/90 (11.1%) monoclonal infections (P<0.0001). Eight patients had recurrent TB, two with a new genotype and two with altered phenotypic DST.The coexistence of different genotypes and change of genotypes during the same disease episode, while on treatment, confirms constancy of polyclonal infections. The composition of the mixture of genotypes and the relative predominance may be missed by culture due to its limit of detection. Polyclonal infections in TB could be a rule rather than exception and challenges the age-old dogma of reactivation/reinfection."
https://openalex.org/W3071574450,"Many recent studies assessing fruit productivity of plants in the boreal forest focus on interannual variability across a forested region, rather than on environmental variability within the forest. Frequency and severity of wildfires in the boreal forest affect soil moisture, canopy, and community structure at the landscape level, all of which may influence overall fruit production at a site directly or indirectly. We evaluated how fruit production in two boreal shrubs, Vaccinium uliginosum (blueberry) and V. vitis-idaea (lingonberry), was explained by factors associated with resource availability (such as canopy cover and soil conditions) and pollen limitation (such as floral resources for pollinators and pollen deposition) across boreal forest sites of Interior Alaska in 2017. We classified our study sites into upland and lowland sites, which differed in elevation, soil moisture, and active layer. We found that resource and pollen limitation differed between the two species and between uplands and lowlands. Lingonberry was more pollen limited than blueberry, and plants in lowland sites were more pollen limited relative to other sites while plants in upland sites were relatively more resource limited. Additionally, canopy cover had a significant negative effect in upland sites on a ramet’s investment in reproductive tissues and leaves versus structural growth, but little effect in lowland sites. These results point to importance of including pollinator service as well as resource availability in predictions for changes in berry abundance."

Of the 179 patients, 158 (88.3%) were classified as having chronic critical illness. Death occurred in 145 cases (81.0%). Multivariate analysis showed that the factors independently associated with mortality were the presence of comorbidities (P<0.001) and the SOFA score of the day of polymyxin prescription (P<0.001). Being a burn patient was a protective factor for mortality (P<0.001). Analysis of the 14-day survival probability showed that mortality was higher among the patients who had sepsis or septic shock at the time of polymyxin prescription (P = 0.028 and P<0.001, respectively). Acinetobacter baumannii was identified as the etiological agent of VAP in 121 cases (67.6%). In our cohort, polymyxin consumption and the incidence density of VAP were quite high.In our study, comprised primarily of chronically critically ill patients, there was a high prevalence of VAP caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, consistent with healthcare-associated infections in low- and middle-income countries. Presence of comorbidities and the SOFA score at the time of polymyxin prescription were predictors of mortality in this cohort. Despite aggressive antimicrobial treatment, mortality was high, stressing the need for antibiotic stewardship."

https://openalex.org/W3077788847,"In cycling, the utilization of the drops position (i.e. the lowest handlebar position relative to the ground) allows for reduced frontal area, likely improved aerodynamics and thus performance compared to the tops (i.e. the position producing the most upright trunk). The reduced trunk angle during seated submaximal cycling has been shown to influence cardiorespiratory factors but the effects on pedalling forces and joint specific power are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of changing handgrip position on joint specific power and cycling kinematics at different external work rates in recreational and professional cyclists.Nine professional and nine recreational cyclists performed cycling bouts using three different handgrip positions and three external work rates (i.e. 100W, 200W and external work rate corresponding to the lactate threshold (WRlt)). Joint specific power was calculated from kinematic measurements and pedal forces using 2D inverse dynamics.We found increased hip joint power, decreased knee joint power and increased peak crank torque for the professional cyclist compared to the recreational cyclists, but only at WRlt where the professional cyclists were working at a higher external work rate. There was no main effect of changing handgrip position on any joint, but there was a small interaction effect of external work rate and handgrip position on hip joint power contribution (Generalized eta squared (ηg2) = 0.012). At 100W, changing handgrip position from the tops to the drops decreased the hip joint contribution (-2.0 ± 3.9 percentage points (pct)) and at the WRlt, changing handgrip position increased the hip joint power (1.6 ± 3.1 pct). There was a small effect of handgrip position with the drops leading to increased peak crank torque (ηg2 = 0.02), increased mean dorsiflexion (ηg2 = 0.05) and increased hip flexion (ηg2 = 0.31) compared to the tops.The present study demonstrates that there is no main effect of changing handgrip position on joint power. Although there seems to be a small effect on hip joint power when comparing across large ranges in external work rate, any potential negative performance effect would be outweighed by the aerodynamic benefit of the drops position."

A total of 459 individuals participated, 264 women and 195 men (Mage = 33.88, SD = 4.39). Child-oriented perfectionism and partner-oriented perfectionism were related to each other and positively correlated with narcissism. Partner-oriented perfectionism turned out to be a specific predictor of difficulties in the romantic relations, whereas child-oriented perfectionism was found to be a predictor of difficulties in parental relation. The results suggest that studies on other-oriented perfectionism should take into consideration concrete individuals at whom perfectionistic expectations are directed (e.g. partner and children). This will enable a more precise investigation of the influence of perfectionism on family life and a better understanding of the social consequences of other-oriented perfectionism."
https://openalex.org/W3071070290,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is an important cause of mortality worldwide. It accounts for approximately half of all deaths from cardiovascular disease. While coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction account for the majority of SCD in the elderly population, inherited cardiac diseases (inherited CDs) comprise a substantial proportion of younger SCD victims with a significant genetic component. Currently, the use of next-generation sequencing enables the rapid analysis to investigate relationships between genetic variants and inherited CDs causing SCD. Genetic contribution to risk has been considered an alternate predictor of SCD. In the past years, large numbers of SCD susceptibility variants were reported, but these results are scattered in numerous publications. Here, we present the SCD-associated Variants Annotation Database (SVAD) to facilitate the interpretation of variants and to meet the needs of data integration. SVAD contains data from a broad screening of scientific literature. It was constructed to provide a comprehensive collection of genetic variants along with integrated information regarding their effects. At present, SVAD has accumulated 2,292 entries within 1,239 variants by manually surveying pertinent literature, and approximately one-third of the collected variants are pathogenic/likely-pathogenic following the ACMG guidelines. To the best of our knowledge, SVAD is the most comprehensive database that can provide integrated information on the associated variants in various types of inherited CDs. SVAD represents a valuable source of variant information based on scientific literature and benefits clinicians and researchers, and it is now available on http://svad.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/."
