https://openalex.org/W1990627393,"Pyramidal cells in the CA1 hippocampal region displayed transient network oscillations (200 hertz) during behavioral immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow-wave sleep. Simultaneous, multisite recordings revealed temporal and spatial coherence of neuronal activity during population oscillations. Participating pyramidal cells discharged at a rate lower than the frequency of the population oscillation, and their action potentials were phase locked to the negative phase of the simultaneously recorded oscillatory field potentials. In contrast, interneurons discharged at population frequency during the field oscillations. Thus, synchronous output of cooperating CA1 pyramidal cells may serve to induce synaptic enhancement in target structures of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1976283234,"Neurons release neurotransmitters by calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. However, the molecular steps transducing the calcium signal into membrane fusion are still an enigma. It is reported here that synaptotagmin, a highly conserved synaptic vesicle protein, binds calcium at physiological concentrations in a complex with negatively charged phospholipids. This binding is specific for calcium and involves the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin. Calcium binding is dependent on the intact oligomeric structure of synaptotagmin (it is abolished by proteolytic cleavage at a single site). These results suggest that synaptotagmin acts as a cooperative calcium receptor in exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2142132827,"The lambda 5 gene is a homolog of immunoglobulin J lambda-C lambda genes, expressed specifically in immature B-lineage cells. Lambda 5-encoded molecules form membrane complexes with mu or D mu proteins in association with an additional protein specifically expressed in immature B cells that is encoded by the Vpre-B gene. We have generated mice in which the lambda 5 gene is inactivated by targeted gene disruption in embryonic stem cells. In these mice, B cell development in the bone marrow is blocked at the pre-B cell stage. However, the blockade is leaky, allowing B cells to populate the peripheral immune system at a low rate. These cells are allelically excluded and able to respond to antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1999288045,Reproducible images of uncoated DNA in the atomic force microscope (AFM) have been obtained by imaging plasmid DNA on mica in n-propanol. Specially sharpened AFM tips give images with reproducible features several nanometers in size along the DNA. Plasmids can be dissected in propanol by increasing the force applied by the AFM tip at selected locations.
https://openalex.org/W2006144062,"A simple and efficient method for synthesizing long, site-specifically modified RNA molecules was developed whereby segments of RNA were joined with the use of bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. A single hydrogen or O-methyl group was substituted for the 2'-hydroxyl group at either splice site of a nuclear pre-messenger RNA substrate. Splicing of the modified pre-messenger RNA's in vitro revealed that, although a 2'-hydroxyl is not absolutely required at either splice site, the 2'-hydroxyl at the 3' splice site is important for the second step of splicing. These results are compared to previous studies of analogous 2'-hydroxyl groups in the self-splicing Tetrahymena group I intron."
https://openalex.org/W2044465435,"Mice lacking in CD8 were generated from homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells at the CD8 locus and bred with the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-susceptible PL/JH-2u through four backcross generations to investigate the role of CD8+ T cells in this model of multiple sclerosis. The disease onset and susceptibility were similar to those of wild-type mice. However, the mutant mice had a milder acute EAE, reflected by fewer deaths, but more chronic EAE, reflected by a higher frequency of relapse. This suggests that CD8+ T lymphocytes may participate as both effectors and regulators in this animal model."
https://openalex.org/W1983551635,"The rational design and biological actions of a new class of DNA-cleaving molecules with potent and selective anticancer activity are reported. These relatively simple enediyne-type compounds were designed from basic chemical principles to mimic the actions of the rather complex naturally occurring enediyne anticancer antibiotics, particularly dynemicin A. Equipped with locking and triggering devices, these compounds damage DNA in vitro and in vivo on activation by chemical or biological means. Their damaging effects are manifested in potent anticancer activity with remarkable selectivities. Their mechanism of action involves intracellular unlocking and triggering of a Bergman reaction, leading to highly reactive benzenoid diradicals that cause severe DNA damage. The results of these studies demonstrate the potential of these de novo designed molecules as biotechnology tools and anticancer agents."

https://openalex.org/W2067992642,"A novel trimolecular mechanism of microbial attachment to mammalian host cells was characterized for the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. Using purified glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and specific GAG lyases, we demonstrated that a heparan sulfate-like GAG present on the surface of chlamydia organisms is required for attachment to host cells. These observations were supported by inhibition of attachment following binding of heparan sulfate receptor analogs to chlamydiae and by demonstrating that chlamydiae synthesize a unique heparan sulfate-like GAG. Furthermore, exogenous heparan sulfate, as an adhesin analog, restored attachment and infectivity to organisms that had lost these attributes following treatment with heparan sulfate lyase. These data suggest that a GAG adhesin ligand mediates attachment by bridging mutual GAG receptors on the host cell surface and on the chlamydial outer membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W2054549445,"Nucleoplasmin is necessary and sufficient for the initial stage of Xenopus sperm decondensation in egg extracts. In this article we show that sperm decondensation is accompanied by loss of two sperm-specific basic proteins (X and Y) and gain of histones H2A and H2B, resulting in nucleosome formation. Purified nucleoplasmin alone removes X and Y and assembles purified H2A and H2B on decondensing sperm chromatin, forming nucleosome cores. Immunodepletion of nucleoplasmin from extract prevents removal of X and Y and addition of H2A and H2B, while adding back nucleoplasmin restores decondensation and X and Y removal. Thus, nucleoplasmin acts as both an assembly and a disassembly factor for remodeling sperm chromatin at fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2110480019,"Fractionation of a transcription-competent HeLa cell extract on a column containing one copy of the heptamer repeat (YSPTSPS) present in the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity. Fractionation of the extracts on columns containing mutations of the heptamer repeat was without effect. Such transcriptionally inactive extracts regained their ability to specifically transcribe different class II promoters upon the addition of human TFIID, recombinant yeast TATA-binding protein (TBP), or proteins bound to the column. Fractionation of RNA polymerase II on columns containing human or yeast TBP resulted in the specific retention of the nonphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II. The phosphorylated form of the enzyme was unable to interact with TBP. The specific interaction of RNA polymerase II with TBP was mediated by the CTD of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1627099483,"We developed a monoclonal antibody specific to phosphatidic acid (PA). Using this antibody, a novel method to quantify trace amounts of PA was achieved. With the method, PA can be measured in the range of 20-500 pmol. We applied this method to quantify changes in PA levels in Balb/c 3T3 cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor. PA contents were very low in quiescent cells and dramatically increased with time up to 15 min. On the other hand, a biphasic diacylglycerol (DG) increase was found. The early phase showed a transient small peak of DG at 30 s followed by a decrease to 1 min. In the second phase, DG accumulated gradually but very markedly up to 15 min. Treatment with propranolol, a PA phosphohydrolase inhibitor, enhanced the accumulation of PA and inhibited the formation of DG in the second phase. However, R59022, a DG kinase inhibitor, did not influence the accumulation of DG or PA, suggesting that platelet-derived growth factor stimulates mainly phospholipase D-catalyzed hydrolysis of phospholipids rather than phospholipase C-catalyzed hydrolysis in the second phase. PA, even after contaminating lyso-PA was removed, could stimulate DNA synthesis, although lyso-PA was 25 times more potent. Moreover, phospholipase D was found to be a much stronger mitogen than phospholipase C. Phospholipase D treatment caused a biphasic accumulation of PA. PA levels reached a maximum at 1 h, and then decreased between 1 and 2 h; finally, there was a gradual elevation up to 10 h. In this case, there was no significant DG accumulation. On the other hand, phospholipase C treatment induced only DG accumulation without any significant change in PA. These results indicate that PA accumulation, rather than an increase in DG, correlates well with mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2128537226,"The RNA polymerase II large subunit carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) plays a role in transcription initiation, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. We have investigated the function of the SRB2 gene, which was isolated as a dominant suppressor of CTD truncation mutations. The allele specificity of this suppressor indicates that SRB2 and the CTD are involved in the same function. Indeed, cells lacking SRB2 and cells lacking a large portion of the CTD exhibit the same set of conditional growth phenotypes and exhibit very similar defects in gene expression in vivo. The SRB2 protein is a novel transcription factor that has an important role in basal and activated transcription in vitro and is essential for efficient establishment of the transcription initiation apparatus. Template commitment experiments suggest that SRB2 becomes physically associated with the transcription initiation complex. We find that SRB2 binds specifically to TFIID. As SRB2 and the RNA polymerase II CTD are involved in the same function, these results reveal a functional link between the CTD and the TATA-binding factor. This study implicates the CTD in recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the transcription initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2166832632,"A conserved positive-acting RNA sequence was found to be required for the neuron-specific splicing of the mouse c-src N1 exon. The sequence lies in the intron between exons N1 and 4, close to the N1 donor site. Normally, only the neural-specific splicing of exon N1 required this sequence. When the intron downstream of N1 was shortened, splicing at the constitutive exon 4 acceptor also became dependent on the activating sequence. The neuronal and nonneuronal patterns of src splicing were reconstituted in vitro. HeLa cell extracts spliced exon 4 to exon 3, skipping exon N1. Weri-1 retinoblastoma cell extracts spliced exon 4 to exon N1 as well as to exon 3. Both patterns of splicing were dependent on the activating sequence. A 123 nt RNA containing just the activating sequence specifically inhibited both patterns of src splicing, indicating that factors bound to the activator were required for its effects."
https://openalex.org/W2046551367,"Current models suggest that tissue-specific genes are arranged in discrete, independently controlled segments of chromatin referred to as regulatory domains. Transition from a closed to open chromatin structure may be an important step in the regulation of gene expression. To determine whether the human α-globin cluster, like the β-globin cluster, lies within a discrete, erythroid-specific domain, we have examined the long-range genomic organization and chromatin structure around this region. The α genes lie adjacent to at least four widely expressed genes. The major α-globin regulatory element lies 40 kb away from the cluster within an intron of one of these genes. Therefore, unlike the β cluster, cis-acting sequences controlling α gene expression are dispersed within a region of chromatin that is open in both erythroid and nonerythroid cells. This implies a difference in the hierarchical control of α- and β-globin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1563651778,"The smg-25A/rab3A protein (smg p25A) is a small GTP-binding protein implicated in intracellular vesicle traffic, particularly in neurotransmitter release from the presynapse. In the present study, we attempted to identify a target protein in bovine brain crude membranes that might be interacted with the GTP-bound form of smg p25A. When the guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-bound form of radioiodinated smg p25A and the crude membrane fraction of bovine brain were incubated with a cross-linker, disuccinimidyl suberate, and the sample was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography, one radioactive band with a M(r) of about 110,000 was detected. This radioactive band appeared to be composed of radioiodinated smg p25A and a molecule with a M(r) of about 86,000. This molecule, tentatively termed here smg p25A target, was extracted from the membranes by a detergent and highly purified by column chromatographies and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The purified smg p25A target was sensitive to heat boiling and tryptic digestion, indicating that smg p25A target is a protein molecule. The M(r) of the purified smg p25A target was estimated to be about 85,000-86,000 from SDS-PAGE and to be about 100,000 from the S value. The cross-linking of radioiodinated smg p25A with the purified smg p25A target was inhibited by the GTP gamma S-bound form of non-radioactive smg p25A with an IC50 of about 8 nM. The GDP-bound form of smg p25A was much less effective. Other small GTP-binding proteins, such as c-Ki-ras p21, rhoA p21, smg p21B, and rab11 p24 were ineffective. These results indicate that a protein with a M(r) of about 85,000-100,000 is a target for smg p25A."

Cajal first described them at the turn of the century. Until recently, their small size has precluded direct measurement of their functional properties. Nevertheless,spines have long been investigated from a theoretical point of view. Experimental and computational studies now seem to be converging toward a common viewpoint - that spines allow biochemical, rather than electrical,compartmentalization within neurons."

Complementarity refers to sizes, shapes, and the weak intermolecular forces involved in molecular recognition between the two subunits. In order to provide a model system for evolution at the molecular level, ""crossover"" or recombination experiments were staged with synthetic replicators. These reactions gave rise to new structural types. The ability (or inability) of the new recombinants to catalyze their own formation is shown to be a consequence of their molecular shapes."

https://openalex.org/W1928163713,"We have exposed mouse thymocytes and P-815 mastocytoma cells to four different conditions reported to cause apoptosis: 1) incubation in the absence of mitogenic factors; 2) incubation in the presence of dexamethasone; 3) stimulation with external ATP; 4) treatment with high concentrations of the K+ ionophore valinomycin. These treatments caused DNA fragmentation to a varying extent in the two cell types. High stringency hybridization with a cDNA probe specific to a mitochondrial DNA sequence revealed that during apoptosis induced by lack of mitogenic factors, dexamethasone, or extracellular ATP, mitochondrial DNA was not fragmented. On the contrary, valinomycin caused extensive degradation of mitochondrial DNA. These results support the notion that DNA fragmentation during apoptosis is a specific nuclear event and suggest that other agents, such as valinomycin, may act less selectively."
https://openalex.org/W1782243518,"We suggest that crystals, when introduced into an organism, may behave as conventional antigens, mediating the production of specific antibodies. These antibodies would bear an imprint of the crystal surface and may consequently behave as a nucleating matrix in a new crystallization event. Thus, they would behave as catalytic antibodies. We show that IgG antibodies isolated from patients suffering from gout, a joint disease caused by crystals of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM), accelerate the appearance of new crystals of MSUM from a supersaturated solution of the salt in vitro. The same effect is not observed for IgG antibodies isolated from the joint fluids of patients with other joint diseases, such as pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoarthritis. Furthermore, IgG antibodies obtained from rabbits injected subcutaneously with crystals of MSUM, were also nucleating towards MSUM crystals."
https://openalex.org/W1998979789,"The enhancers of several distinct viruses contain a common functional element, termed EP. This element binds ubiquitous cellular proteins and generates specific complexes in gel retardation analysis. Ultraviolet cross-linking and Southwestern analysis showed that a 140 kd polypeptide is the major EP DNA-binding protein. Using a combination of DNA binding and immunological techniques, we have identified the c-abl protein in a nuclear complex that binds to the EP element. abl was found to have both a specific and high affinity DNA binding activity. The ability to bind DNA is abolished in the mutant abl protein, p210bcr-abl, consistent with its cytoplasmic localization in chronic myelogenous leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1502121617,"Abstract 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is HIV-inhibitory in human macrophages, which is surprising in view of the low AZT phosphorylation reported in macrophage extracts. To elucidate the mechanism of AZT activation, we studied AZT anabolism as well as catabolism in human lymphocytes and macrophages, and compared it to that of thymidine. Thymidine kinase (TK)-specific activity in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes was 15 times higher than in macrophages. However, the TK activity per cell was only 1.3 times higher, because of the large macrophage cell volume. Total cellular TK activity, but not specific activity, matched the level of intracellular AZT anabolism. The substrate specificity of TK in macrophages strongly suggests that mitochondrial TK2 was the enzyme phosphorylating thymidine and AZT in these cells, whereas it was cytosolic TK1 in stimulated lymphocytes. In vivo thymidine catabolism was extensive, forming thymine and dihydrothymine. In macrophages more than 95% of the added thymidine (0.5 microM) was degraded within 60 min. AZT, in contrast, was not catabolized, which explains the high AZT nucleotide accumulation, a process opposed only by AZTMP excretion. The lack of catabolism together with phosphorylation by TK2 clarifies how AZT can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus in macrophages. The fact that TK2 and not TK1 phosphorylates AZT in macrophages should have important implications for combination chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1585262192,"The human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoter sequence contains two consensus binding sites for the Sp1 regulatory protein. We have determined the effect of intermolecular triplex DNA formation on Sp1 binding to the DHFR promoter. The DHFR Sp1 binding site I (-39 to -48 relative to the DHFR transcription start site) demonstrates concentration-dependent triplex formation with a 19-base pair G-rich oligonucleotide (GR19) which is complementary to the polypyrimidine strand. DNase I footprint analysis demonstrates that GR19 forms a DNA triplex structure with the DHFR promoter fragment in a sequence-specific manner. DNase I footprinting analysis also indicates that the orientation of binding of these G-rich oligonucleotides is antiparallel. CR19, a C-rich complementary oligonucleotide, on the other hand, does not form triplex. The DNase I protection pattern of DHFR promoter fragment incubated with both recombinant Sp1 and triplex-forming oligonucleotide suggests that triplex formation prevents Sp1 binding. This is confirmed by gel shift analysis which demonstrates that triplex formation by the Sp1 binding sequences of the DHFR promoter prevents recombinant Sp1 binding in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that intermolecular triplex formation prevents regulatory protein binding in a sequence-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1596219804,"Sequences between -106 and -42, located immediately downstream of the glucocorticoid response element, are essential for efficient glucocorticoid-stimulated expression of the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) gene. We have used mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides bearing wild type and mutated sequences from segmented portions of this region to characterize the specific interaction of similar binding factors from rat liver and HTC rat hepatoma cell nuclear extracts. One of these factors, AGP nuclear factor 2 (ANF-2), appears capable of dual interaction with the homologous recognition sites, HA (-133 to -104) and HB (-81 to -72), which overlap and are located downstream of the glucocorticoid response element, respectively. Using an affinity matrix containing the HB sequence we have isolated ANF-2 from rat liver nuclear extracts. On the basis of immunological evidence rat liver ANF-2 was confirmed to be highly related and probably identical to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Methylation protection analyses with partially purified, rat liver ANF-2 confirmed HA and HB as recognition sites for C/EBP-related factors and are consistent with the location of a third interaction site for these transactivating proteins at HX (-102 to -93). We propose that the sequences HA, HX, and HB, spanning residues -113 to -72 of the AGP promoter, might serve as recognition sites for a family of C/EBP-like nuclear factors that coordinate the glucocorticoid-mediated induction of the AGP gene."

Two major unknown compounds A and B and a minor unknown compound C were separated, in addition to minor compounds sphingosine and N,N-dimethylsphingosine. This paper describes the isolation and chemical characterization of major unknown compounds A and B, which were found only in the white matter but not in the gray matter of the human brain. Unmodified psychosine (galactosylsphingosine) was essentially undetectable under the experimental conditions. Unknown compounds A and B were identified as novel plasmal (fatty aldehyde) conjugates of psychosine with cyclic acetal linkage at the galactosyl residue of psychosine. Fatty aldehydes were identified as mainly palmital (16:0) and stearal (18:0). Sphingosine was identified as d18:1 sphingosine. Faster migrating compound A had 3,4-cyclic acetal linkage, and slower migrating compound B had 4,6-cyclic acetal linkage (where m is 14 or 16 and n is 12) as shown below. [formula: see text] Preliminary studies showed that compounds A, B, and C had a weak inhibitory effect on protein kinase C (PKC) and had no cytotoxic effect. In contrast, psychosine displayed a strong cytotoxicity and inhibitory effect on PKC. Therefore, the process controlling the addition or deletion of plasmal cyclic linkage to psychosine could be a crucial step in regulation of PKC, src, or other kinases susceptible to psychosine."
https://openalex.org/W2026263658,The subject of the analysis of viral DNA fingerprinting associated with the alleged human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of a number of dental patients in Florida is scrutinized. Reference is made to the recent findings of Ou et al. which are published in this same issue of Science. Scientific and ethical issues are examined as well as the issue of what determines an appropriate level of statistical and scientific reliability for public policy or judicial review. The significance for a resolution of reliability questions is that in the absence of a medical position others unfamiliar will draw conclusions. The public is amenable to changing life styles without necessarily strong statistical evidence. There is agreement among nations however that the HIV-1 evidence is strong enough to recommend use of condoms and medical gloves and invest in research. Legal action mandates the highest statistical significance in the determination of verdicts without a reasonable doubt. In the Florida dental case data a manuscript and the review process became entangled in legal machinations. Out et al. and other scientists involved in legal action have a responsibility to decide in advance appropriate statistical criteria. The difficulties that arise from studies of the transmission of the HIV 1 virus are represented either in Ou et al. and the C2-V3 domain of transmission from dentist to patient or from the Wolinsky study of transmission from infected women to unborn children. The Ou et al. study of the 7 infected dental patients and the 35 local controls (LC) is questioned on the randomness of the LC sample the process of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the statistical tests of significance used (Wilcoxon rand sum statistic the distinction between cloned sequences and direct sequences the appropriateness of the bootstrapping procedure). The phylogenetic relationships among variants varies with modes of transmission and tree building is a difficult art and science. The Ou et al. study is considered a pioneering effort in the use of DNA typing to resolve individual viral transmission events but the issue is complex and statistical flaws have already occurred in the Wilson et al. hypothesis of African Eve.

https://openalex.org/W1565550299,"The pathway for de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides contains two one-carbon transfer reactions catalyzed by glycinamide ribotide (GAR) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) transformylases in which N10-formyltetrahydrofolate is the one-carbon donor. We have found that the antifolates methotrexate (MTX) and piritrexim (PTX) completely block the de novo purine pathway in mouse L1210 leukemia cells growing in culture but with only minor accumulations of GAR and AICAR to less than 5% of the polyphosphate derivatives of N-formylglycinamide ribotide (FGAR) which accumulate when the pathway is blocked completely by azaserine. This azaserine-induced accumulation of FGAR polyphosphates is completely abolished by MTX, indicating that inhibition of the pathway is at or before GAR transformylase (reaction 3; Lyons, S. D., and Christopherson, R. I. (1991) Biochem. Int. 24, 187-197). Three h after the addition of MTX (0.1 microM), cellular 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate has accumulated 3.4-fold while 6-methyl-mercaptopurine riboside (25 microM) induces a 6.3-fold accumulation. These data suggest that amido phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzing reaction 1 of the pathway is the primary site of inhibition. In support of this conclusion, we have found that dihydrofolate-Glu5, which accumulates in MTX-treated cells, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of amido phosphoribosyltransferase with a dissociation constant of 3.41 +/- 0.08 microM for interaction with the enzyme-glutamine complex in vitro. Folate-Glu5, MTX-Glu5, PTX, dihydrotriazine benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and AICAR also inhibit amido phosphoribosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1527022269,"We have designed a novel approach for studying the specificity of neutral phospholipase D from rat brain synaptic plasma membranes for endogenous phospholipid substrates in native membranes. A procedure was established that provides synaptic membranes labeled in selected phospholipids. This labeling procedure exploits the presence of endogenous acyl-coenzyme A synthetase and acyl-coenzyme A:lysophospholipid acyltransferase in synaptosomes for acylating various lysophospholipid acceptors with radioactive fatty acid. With [3H]arachidonate for acylation and optimal concentrations of the respective lysophospholipids, membranes were labeled in either of the following phospholipids: phosphatidylcholine (93% of total label in phospholipids), 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine (87%), phosphatidylinositol (90%), phosphatidylethanolamine (85%), phosphatidylethanolamine-plasmalogen (81%) or phosphatidylserine (59%). These membranes were employed to study the substrate specificity of the neutral, oleate-activated rat brain phospholipase D. This phospholipase exhibited almost absolute specificity for the choline-phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine: 0.34% of the former labeled substrate were transphosphatidylated to phosphatidylpropanol during the assay and 0.28% of the latter. Activity toward other phospholipids was barely detectable and could largely be accounted for by utilization of residual labeled phosphatidylcholine present in those preparations. The phospholipase D exhibited some preference for fatty acids in the C-2 position of phosphatidylcholine in the following order: 2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (0.67% of this labeled phosphatidylcholine were converted to phosphatidylpropanol), 2-myristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (0.60%), 2-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (0.46%) and 2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (0.34%). The present approach of labeling membrane phospholipids in vitro could be useful in studies of phospholipase specificity as an alternative to the use of sonicated vesicles or mixed detergent-phospholipid micellar systems."

https://openalex.org/W1536689362,"A series of biochemical assays were developed and performed to monitor the molecular events that occur during the Hin-mediated DNA inversion reaction. These events can be divided into five different stages: 1) binding of proteins (Hin, Fis, and HU) to DNA; 2) pairing of Hin- binding sites; 3) invertasome formation; 4) DNA strand cleavage; 5) strand rotation and religation. A series of topoisomers of the wild type DNA substrate plasmid (ranging from fully relaxed molecules to those with more than the physiological superhelical density (the physiological superhelical density of pKH336 from Escherichia coli DH10B is -0.072 in this study)) was generated, and the role of negative supercoiling in each step of the inversion reaction was investigated. We found differences in the dependence of the formation of paired Hin- binding sites and of the invertasome formation on the superhelical density of the substrate plasmid. Pairing of Hin-binding sites occurs independently from invertasome formation, and a relatively low degree of negative supercoiling is enough to promote maximal pairing. However, efficient invertasome formation requires higher levels of negative supercoiling."

Both wild-type peptides penetrated phospholipid monolayers up to high surface pressures, and partition constants of 8.0 x 10(4) M-1 and 4.2 x 10(4) M-1, respectively, were derived from the incorporation isotherms of mtl-23 and gut-22 with monolayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine at 32 mN/m or bilayers of the same lipid. The mtl-23 peptide was highly alpha-helical in trifluoroethanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, lysolecithin, or vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylglycerol, with estimated percentages of alpha-helix ranging between 60 and 85%. The interactions with model membranes of several single site mutants (S3P, D4P, and D4K) of mtl-23 which were defective in properly assembling the mannitol permease in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli were also studied. The contents of alpha-helix of these peptides in detergent micelles or phospholipid bilayers were not significantly changed compared with those of the wild type, suggesting that the amphiphilic NH2-terminal membrane-targeting domain could still be formed in these mutants. However, the mutants which contained a proline in positions 3 or 4, i.e. NH2-terminal to the proposed amphiphilic alpha-helix, partitioned into phospholipid monolayers with partition constants that were 2 or 4 times smaller than those of the wild type. Based on these data, a model of the amphiphilic structure of the NH2-terminal domain of the mannitol permease is discussed. This domain may interact physiologically with amphiphilic interfaces of lipids and/or proteins during membrane insertion."

The relevance of these two segments to H2 processing was studied after expression in rat-6 fibroblasts of these two isolates and of artificial constructs containing either only the 57-nucleotide (transfectant-57) or the 15-nucleotide (transfectant-15) region. H2 proteins encoded by cDNAs containing the 15-nucleotide region were intracellularly retained and degraded independently of the presence of the 57-nucleotide sequence. Of proteins derived from clones lacking the 15-nucleotide region, only a fraction was processed through the trans-Golgi, as evidenced by sensitivity to O-glycanase and neuraminidase, and reached the cell surface. The presence of the 57-nucleotide sequence was necessary for protein phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of serine residue(s) was detected in the endoglycosidase H-sensitive and mature forms of H2 protein encoded by transfectant-57. Since the 57-nucleotide region does not encode for serine residues, it per se cannot be the site of phosphorylation but rather constitutes a regulatory element for post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1567444623,"The cDNA encoding mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was incorporated into a transforming vector pTSA-NEO2 carrying a procyclic acidic repetitive protein promoter and a neomycin phosphotransferase gene. The plasmid thus constructed, pMOD300, was introduced into the procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei via electroporation, and the transformants, selected under G418, expressed an ODC activity 100 times above the background level. Contrary to the commonly observed short half-life of mouse ODC in mammalian cells, however, the mouse ODC activity expressed in T. brucei remained stable for at least 6 h when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Pulse labelings and chase experiments with the irreversible ODC inhibitor [3,4-3H]difluoromethylornithine followed by gel electrophoresis, or with L-[35S] methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis indicated that the stable mouse ODC expressed in T. brucei has the same subunit molecular weight as the native enzyme. By an in vitro assay of protein stability in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Loetscher, P., Pratt, G., and Rechsteiner, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11213-11220), the native mouse ODC and the enzyme expressed in T. brucei had the same degree of instability. Thus, the mouse ODC expressed in T. brucei is probably identical to the native mouse ODC. Its remarkable stability in T. brucei must be due to the absence in trypanosomes of the proteolytic machinery present in mammalian cells responsible for rapid degradation of mouse ODC."
https://openalex.org/W1654209200,"The pucBA operon of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides encodes the light harvesting 2 (LH2) apoproteins of the photosynthetic apparatus, and transcription of this operon is markedly depressed under aerobic conditions. The region upstream of the LH2 genes has been subjected to gel retardation analysis, and two distinct bandshifts have been observed. The intensity of the upper bandshift was reduced upon lowering the oxygen tension under which the cells were grown, and this reduction preceded the appearance of LH2 in the cell membrane. Purification of the sequence-specific DNA binding protein responsible for this bandshift activity revealed a protein of M(r) 26,000, and DNase I footprint analysis revealed that the binding site was located 120 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation point. We propose that this protein is an oxygen-regulated repressor of pucBA transcription. This work, therefore, describes the first purification of a transcription factor from any photosynthetic bacterium."

https://openalex.org/W82938227,"The first high resolution maps of the Xenopus laevis ribosomal promoter and its flanking regions (-179 to +14) have been created by assaying point mutants both in oocyte and in vitro. Within the promoter boundaries (-141(-145) to +3(+4)), domains analogous to the Core Promoter and Upstream Control Element (UCE) were clearly detected. The base pairs at -133, within the UCE, and -20, -10, -7, and +3, within the Core, were all shown to be especially important for promotion. Between the Core and UCE, two central promoter elements (CPEs) were also resolved. Surprisingly, these CPEs did not correspond to the highly conserved enhancer homology (approximately -70 to -110), but to CCCGGCC motifs immediately flanking it. Although xUBF was shown to be a limiting component for in vitro transcription, none of the point mutations was found to affect the interaction of this factor with the promoter."

https://openalex.org/W1526889339,"This paper presents data identifying adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate (3',5'-ADP) as the small heat-stable factor essential for the active steroid binding complex of the adrenocortical pregnenolone-binding protein (PBP). Factor activity obtained from the boiled supernatant of partially purified PBP was isolated by high performance liquid chromatography using weak anion-exchange and hydrophobic (C18) chromatography sequentially. The purified material retained characteristic factor activity and presented a UV spectrum identical to that for authentic 3',5'-ADP. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the isolated factor revealed an M-H ion of appropriate mass (m/z = 426) and a decomposition pattern for the M-H ion that was consistent with the structure of 3',5'-ADP. The studies presented here demonstrate that authentic 3',5'-ADP can categorically substitute for factor prepared from the soluble fraction of the guinea pig adrenal. Specifically, 3',5'-ADP potentiated ligand binding of partially purified native PBP and restored binding capacity to alkaline phosphatase-inactivated PBP in a dose-dependent manner. As is the case for adrenocortical factor activity, these effects were negated by pretreating the 3',5'-ADP with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Other nucleotides similarly tested, including ADP isomers, were ineffective as factor substitutes. The sulfated form of 3',5'-ADP (i.e. 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate) demonstrated some potential for restoring binding capacity to phosphatase-inactivated PBP; however, this compound was clearly inhibitory rather than stimulatory for native PBP activity. Taken collectively, the data overwhelmingly demonstrate that 3',5'-ADP is in fact the molecule required by the PBP for high affinity steroid binding complex formation. It is not yet known whether 3',5'-ADP acts allosterically or contributes directly to the structure of the steroid binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1561185354,"Ligand binding reactions and the relation between redox state and ligand binding in the hexa-heme nitrite reductase of Wolinella succinogenes have been studied using laser flash photolysis. On a picosecond time scale, a rapid excursion was observed corresponding to the breaking and reforming of an iron histidine bond. With the CO derivative, a geminate reaction was observed with a rate of 3 ns-1. On a nanosecond time scale, no slower geminate reactions were observed. For the cyanide derivative, no geminate reactions were observed at either time scale. The second order reaction of CO with the enzyme had a time course consisting of two distinct components. This time course changed in form as the enzyme came to equilibrium with CO, and the slower rebinding component was replaced by a faster rebinding component. It is suggested that CO binding enhances reduction of a heme with an unusually low redox potential and opens the structure of the active site to allow a faster second order reaction of CO. The proportion of the geminate CO reaction was unchanged, consistent with changes relatively remote from the ligand binding site. The second order reactions of cyanide also showed that redox effects influence its rebinding reaction. Adding cyanide to the CO complex of nitrite reductase showed that the two ligands have distinct heme binding sites."
