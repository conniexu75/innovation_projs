https://openalex.org/W2347175577,"A scalable and modular LED illumination dome for microscopic scientific photography is described and illustrated, and methods for constructing such a dome are detailed. Dome illumination for insect specimens has become standard practice across the field of insect systematics, but many dome designs remain expensive and inflexible with respect to new LED technology. Further, a one-size-fits-all dome cannot accommodate the large breadth of insect size encountered in nature, forcing the photographer to adapt, in some cases, to a less than ideal dome design. The dome described here is scalable, as it is based on a isodecahedron, and the template for the dome is available as a downloaded file from the internet that can be printed on any printer, on the photographer’s choice of media. As a result, a photographer can afford, using this design, to produce a series of domes of various sizes and materials, and LED ring lights of various sizes and color temperatures, depending on the need."
https://openalex.org/W2346368029,"Although frequently used with older adolescents, few studies of the factor structure, internal consistency and gender equivalence of the SDQ exists for this age group, with inconsistent findings. In the present study, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the five-factor structure of the SDQ in a population sample of 10,254 16–18 year-olds from the youth@hordaland study. Measurement invariance across gender was assessed using multigroup CFA. A modestly modified five-factor solution fitted the data acceptably, accounting for one cross loading and some local dependencies. Importantly, partial measurement non-invariance was identified, with differential item functioning in eight items, and higher correlations between emotional and conduct problems for boys compared to girls. Implications for use clinically and in research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2345425251,"Background It is unclear whether coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor exposure during early adulthood contributes to CHD risk later in life. Our objective was to analyze whether extent of early adult exposures to systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL, HDL) are independent predictors of CHD events later in life. Methods and Findings We used all available measurements of SBP, DBP, LDL, and HDL collected over 40 years in the Framingham Offspring Study to estimate risk factor trajectories, starting at age 20 years, for all participants. Average early adult (age 20–39) exposure to each risk factor was then estimated, and used to predict CHD events (myocardial infarction or CHD death) after age 40, with adjustment for risk factor exposures later in life (age 40+). 4860 participants contributed an average of 6.3 risk factor measurements from in-person examinations and 24.5 years of follow-up after age 40, and 510 had a first CHD event. Early adult exposures to high SBP, DBP, LDL or low HDL were associated with 8- to 30-fold increases in later life CHD event rates, but were also strongly correlated with risk factor levels later in life. After adjustment for later life levels and other risk factors, early adult DBP and LDL remained strongly associated with later life risk. Compared with DBP≤70 mmHg, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 0.8–5.7) for DBP = 71–80, 2.6 (0.9–7.2) for DBP = 81–90, and 3.6 (1.2–11) for DBP>90 (p-trend = 0.019). Compared with LDL≤100 mg/dl, adjusted HRs were 1.5 (0.9–2.6) for LDL = 101–130, 2.2 (1.2–4.0) for LDL = 131–160, and 2.4 (1.2–4.7) for LDL>160 (p-trend = 0.009). While current levels of SBP and HDL were also associated with CHD events, we did not detect an independent association with early adult exposure to either of these risk factors. Conclusions Using a mixed modeling approach to estimation of young adult exposures with trajectory analysis, we detected independent associations between estimated early adult exposures to non-optimal DBP and LDL and CHD events later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2346681142,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most commonly used anticancer drugs in the treatment of hepatoma. However, acquired drug resistance is one of the major challenges for the chemotherapy. In this study, a down-regulation of miR-122 was observed in doxorubicin-resistant Huh7 (Huh7/R) cells compared with its parental Huh7 cells, suggesting miR-122 is associated with the chemoresistance. Meanwhile, luciferase reporter assay proved that the PKM2 is the target of miR-122, and we reported that the glucose metabolism is significantly up-regulated in Huh7/R cells. Importantly, overexpression of miR-122 in Huh7/R cells reversed the doxorubicin-resistance through the inhibition of PKM2, inducing the apoptosis in doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells. Thus, this study revealed that the dysregulated glucose metabolism contributes to doxorubicin resistance, and the inhibition of glycolysis induced by miR-122 might be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome doxorubicin resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2345545607,"Apoptosis is a highly conserved biochemical mechanism which is tightly controlled in cells. It contributes to maintenance of tissue homeostasis and normally eliminates highly proliferative cells with malignant properties. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have recently been described with significant functional and morphological similarities to embryonic stem cells. Human iPSCs are of great hope for regenerative medicine due to their broad potential to differentiate into specialized cell types in culture. They may be useful for exploring disease mechanisms and may provide the basis for future cell-based replacement therapies. However, there is only poor insight into iPSCs cell signaling as the regulation of apoptosis. In this study, we focused our attention on the apoptotic response of Alzheimer fibroblast-derived iPSCs and two other Alzheimer free iPSCs to five biologically relevant kinase inhibitors as well as to the death ligand TRAIL. To our knowledge, we are the first to report that the relatively high basal apoptotic rate of iPSCs is strongly suppressed by the pancaspase inhibitor QVD-Oph, thus underlining the dependency on proapoptotic caspase cascades. Furthermore, wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositid-3 kinase / Akt signaling (PI3K-AKT), dramatically and rapidly induced apoptosis in iPSCs. In contrast, parental fibroblasts as well as iPSC-derived neuronal cells were not responsive. The resulting condensation and fragmentation of DNA and decrease of the membrane potential are typical features of apoptosis. Comparable effects were observed with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). Wortmannin resulted in disappearance of phosphorylated AKT and activation of the main effector caspase-3 in iPSCs. These results clearly demonstrate for the first time that PI3K-AKT represents a highly essential survival signaling pathway in iPSCs. The findings provide improved understanding on the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis regulation in iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2347076396,"Skatole (3-methylindole) is a product of bacterial fermentation of tryptophan in the intestine. A significant amount of skatole can also be inhaled during cigarette smoking. Skatole is a pulmonary toxin that induces the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulated genes, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), in human bronchial cells. The liver has a high metabolic capacity for skatole and is the first organ encountered by the absorbed skatole; however, the effect of skatole in the liver is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the impact of skatole on hepatic AhR activity and AhR-regulated gene expression. Using reporter gene assays, we showed that skatole activates AhR and that this is accompanied by an increase of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 expression in HepG2-C3 and primary human hepatocytes. Specific AhR antagonists and siRNA-mediated AhR silencing demonstrated that skatole-induced CYP1A1 expression is dependent on AhR activation. The effect of skatole was reduced by blocking intrinsic cytochrome P450 activity and indole-3-carbinole, a known skatole metabolite, was a more potent inducer than skatole. Finally, skatole could reduce TCDD-induced CYP1A1 expression, suggesting that skatole is a partial AhR agonist. In conclusion, our findings suggest that skatole and its metabolites affect liver homeostasis by modulating the AhR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2347156108,"Background Both obesity and the metabolic syndrome are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Although both frequently occur together in the same individual, obesity and the metabolic syndrome can also develop independently from each other. The (patho)physiology of “metabolically healthy obese” (i.e. obese without metabolic syndrome) and “metabolically unhealthy non-obese” phenotypes (i.e. non-obese with metabolic syndrome) is not fully understood, but physical activity and sedentary behavior may play a role. Objective To examine objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behavior across four groups: I) “metabolically healthy obese” (MHO); II) “metabolically unhealthy obese” (MUO); III)”metabolically healthy non-obese” (MHNO); and IV) “metabolically unhealthy non-obese” (MUNO). Methods Data were available from 2,449 men and women aged 40–75 years who participated in The Maastricht Study from 2010 to 2013. Participants were classified into the four groups according to obesity (BMI≥30kg/m2) and metabolic syndrome (ATPIII definition). Daily activity was measured for 7 days with the activPAL physical activity monitor and classified as time spent sitting, standing, and stepping. Results In our study population, 562 individuals were obese. 19.4% of the obese individuals and 72.7% of the non-obese individuals was metabolically healthy. After adjustments for age, sex, educational level, smoking, alcohol use, waking time, T2DM, history of CVD and mobility limitation, MHO (n = 107) spent, per day, more time stepping (118.2 versus 105.2 min; p<0.01) and less time sedentary (563.5 versus 593.0 min., p = 0.02) than MUO (n = 440). In parallel, MHNO (n = 1384) spent more time stepping (125.0 versus 115.4 min; p<0.01) and less time sedentary (553.3 versus 576.6 min., p<0.01) than MUNO (n = 518). Conclusion Overall, the metabolically healthy groups were less sedentary and more physically active than the metabolically unhealthy groups. Therefore, physical activity and sedentary time may partly explain the presence of the metabolic syndrome in obese as well as non-obese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2345408402,"To investigate the characteristics of various near work related behaviors among primary students and their associations with changes in myopia related ocular biometric parameters during one-year of follow up.A school-based sample of 4,814 primary 1st to 4th grade students aged 6-10 years old were selected by cluster randomization based on probability proportion to size in 2013. At baseline, students together with their parents filled in a self-administered questionnaire on 9 aspects of near work related behaviors and some important covariants of myopia. A comprehensive set of eye examinations including axial length (AL) and cycloplegic refraction was conducted both at baseline and one year later.With the grade level increase, students did increasingly better at finding various ways to have an eye break, but they were increasingly likely to continuously do long-time near work without an eye break. Keeping a reasonable eye distance and correct hand posture for reading, writing, or watching TV became worse for the first time before grade 2, but then became better at grade 3. In contrast, selecting appropriate lighting environments or situations and keeping a balanced diet became better for the first time before grade 2, but then became worse at grade 3. At one-year follow up, the mean AL increased by 0.32 ± 0.35 mm, the ratio of AL divided by the mean corneal radius of curvature (AL/CR ratio) increased by 0.032 ± 0.054, the myopic spherical equivalent (SE) increased by -0.51 ± 0.51 diopters and the incidence of myopia was 16.0% (237/1,477). After controlling for the confounding effects of parental myopia, student's age, gender, height, daily near work time, daily outdoor activity time and all of the other near work related behaviors, keeping a reasonable distance when reading, writing and watching TV was associated with elongation of the AL [standard coefficient beta = -0.062, P = 0.004], a change in SE [beta = -0.072, P = 0.020] and incident myopia [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-0.96]. Selecting an environment with adequate light for visual comfort to read and write was related to elongation of the AL [beta = -0.039, P = 0.034] and increase of AL/CR ratio [beta = -0.030, P = 0.048]. Also, not continuing to do near work for more than 30-40 minutes without an eye break was related to increase of the AL/CR ratio [beta = -0.028, P = 0.044] and a change in SE [beta = -0.064, P = 0.023].Various near work related behaviors changed according to grade level in primary school students. Independent of hereditary factors, daily near work load and outdoor activity, near work related behaviors such as keeping an inappropriate eye distance for near work, selecting inadequate lighting environments, and continuing to do near work without an eye break were risk factors for myopic shifts."
https://openalex.org/W2345681609,"Fungal species of Armillaria, which can act as plant pathogens and/or symbionts of the Chinese traditional medicinal herb Gastrodia elata (“Tianma”), are ecologically and economically important and have consequently attracted the attention of mycologists. However, their taxonomy has been highly dependent on morphological characterization and mating tests. In this study, we phylogenetically analyzed Chinese Armillaria samples using the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, translation elongation factor-1 alpha gene and beta-tubulin gene. Our data revealed at least 15 phylogenetic lineages of Armillaria from China, of which seven were newly discovered and two were recorded from China for the first time. Fourteen Chinese biological species of Armillaria, which were previously defined based on mating tests, could be assigned to the 15 phylogenetic lineages identified herein. Seven of the 15 phylogenetic lineages were found to be disjunctively distributed in different continents of the Northern Hemisphere, while eight were revealed to be endemic to certain continents. In addition, we found that seven phylogenetic lineages of Armillaria were used for the cultivation of Tianma, only two of which had been recorded to be associated with Tianma previously. We also illustrated that G. elata f. glauca (“Brown Tianma”) and G. elata f. elata (“Red Tianma”), two cultivars of Tianma grown in different regions of China, form symbiotic relationships with different phylogenetic lineages of Armillaria. These findings should aid the development of Tianma cultivation in China."
https://openalex.org/W2346801720,"KYE28 (KYEITTIHNLFRKLTHRLFRRNFGYT-LR), the representative sequence of helix D of heparin co-factor II, was demonstrated to be potent against agronomically important Gram-negative plant pathogens Xanthomonas vesicatoria and Xanthomonas oryzae, capable of inhibiting disease symptoms in detached tomato leaves. NMR studies in the presence of lipopolysaccharide provided structural insights into the mechanisms underlying this, notably in relationship to outer membrane permeabilization. The three-dimensional solution structure of KYE28 in LPS is characterized by an N-terminal helical segment, an intermediate loop followed by another short helical stretch, and an extended C terminus. The two termini are in close proximity to each other via aromatic packing interactions, whereas the positively charged residues form an exterior polar shell. To further demonstrate the importance of the aromatic residues for this, a mutant peptide KYE28A, with Ala substitutions at Phe11, Phe19, Phe23, and Tyr25 was designed, which showed attenuated antimicrobial activity at high salt concentrations, as well as lower membrane disruption and LPS binding abilities compared with KYE28. In contrast to KYE28, KYE28A adopted an extended helical structure in LPS with extended N and C termini. Aromatic packing interactions were completely lost, although hydrophobic interaction between the side chains of hydrophobic residues were still partly retained, imparting an amphipathic character and explaining its residual antimicrobial activity and LPS binding as observed from ellipsometry and isothermal titration calorimetry.

Recent years have seen a profound increase in the occurrence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial strains (1Levy S.B. Marshall B. Antibacterial resistance worldwide: causes, challenges and responses.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S122-S129Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar, 2Hancock R.E. Sahl H.G. Antimicrobial and host-defense peptides as new anti-infective therapeutic strategies.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar). Consequently, infections due to these strains pose a considerable, and increasing, threat to human health and economy. This is the case also within agriculture, where large amount of crops are lost every year due to bacterial infections, putting global food security at stake (3Strange R.N. Scott P.R. Plant disease: a threat to global food security.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2005; 43: 83-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). For example, Xanthomonas species are associated with bacterial spot disease in a wide variety of agriculturally important crops, particularly tomato and pepper. They affect leaves, stem, and fruits (4Potnis N. Timilsina S. Strayer A. Shantharaj D. Barak J.D. Paret M.L. Vallad G.E. Jones J.B.

Plant Pathol. 2015; 16: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and are found to be most destructive to crops that are grown in warm and humid weather conditions, leading to a substantial crop loss on a global scale (5Timilsina S. Jibrin M.O. Potnis N. Minsavage G.V. Kebede M. Schwartz A. Bart R. Staskawicz B. Boyer C. Vallad G.E. Pruvost O. Jones J.B. Goss E.M.

Environ. Microbiol. 2015; 81: 1520-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Xanthomonas has been found to display streptomycin resistance since the 1960s (4Potnis N. Timilsina S. Strayer A. Shantharaj D. Barak J.D. Paret M.L. Vallad G.E. Jones J.B. Bacterial spot of tomato and pepper: diverse Xanthomonas species with a wide variety of virulence factors posing a worldwide challenge.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2015; 16: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), thus directing control and prevention toward large scale use of copper-based compounds, mancozeb and/or maneb (6Marco G. Stall R. Control of bacterial spot of pepper initiated by strains of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria that differ in sensitivity to copper.Plant Dis. 1983; 67: 779-781Crossref Google Scholar). The latter compounds are carcinogenic as well as toxic to the environment (7Makovitzki A. Viterbo A. Brotman Y. Chet I. Shai Y. Inhibition of fungal and bacterial plant pathogens in vitro and in planta with ultrashort cationic lipopeptides.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 6629-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, extensive application of copper compounds has, in itself, led to the development of bacterial resistance in many strains of Xanthomonas (8Abbasi P.A. Khabbaz S.E. Weselowski B. Zhang L. Occurrence of copper-resistant strains and a shift in Xanthomonas spp. causing tomato bacterial spot in Ontario.Can. J. Microbiol. 2015; 61: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Counteracting this, genetic breeding techniques have been successfully applied but are time consuming and suffer from drawbacks that include hybrid weakness and pre- and post-zygotic barriers that prevent attainment of fertile hybrids (9Manzur J.P.

Thus, to reduce both environmental and health hazards, new environmentally friendly compounds are needed. Besides, new approaches of plant disease management are also required to meet the current demand of crops.

AMPs are small peptides, ≤50 amino acids, displaying diverse structures as well as biological functions (2Hancock R.E. Sahl H.G.

Apart from their antimicrobial activities, some AMPs have also been found to display other host defense functions, such as modulation of pro- or anti-inflammatory pathways along with activation of dendritic cells, helping in wound healing and angiogenesis (17Epand R.M.

Central for the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of AMPs against Gram-negative bacteria is their interaction with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key component in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (19Hancock R.E.

Through electrostatic and steric effects, LPS restricts the entry of AMPs to their site-of-action, i.e. the inner membrane (22Bhunia A. Domadia P.N. Torres J. Hallock K.J. Ramamoorthy A.

Furthermore, LPS triggers inflammation, causing deregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (25Cohen J. The immunopathogenesis of sepsis.Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). In contrast to AMP interactions with lipid membranes, AMP-LPS interactions remain poorly understood, despite their importance. Further studies on these are therefore needed. In particular, structural elucidations of AMPs in the context of LPS- and membrane-mimicking environments are key for the identification of specific motifs resulting in potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects against Gram-negative infections. Earlier studies on heparin co-factor II (HC-II) have demonstrated that helices A and D are responsible for its observed antimicrobial property (26Kalle M. Papareddy P. Kasetty G. Tollefsen D.M. Malmsten M. Mörgelin M. Schmidtchen A. Proteolytic activation transforms heparin cofactor II into a host defense molecule.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 6303-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recently, the 28-residue peptide KYE28 (KYEITTIHNLFRKLTHRLFRRNFGYTLR) representing the helix D of HC-II (Fig. 1) has been reported to be highly active against the two Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli (27Kalle M. Papareddy P. Kasetty G. van der Plas M.J. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Schmidtchen A. A peptide of heparin cofactor II inhibits endotoxin-mediated shock and invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e102577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, KYE28 displays immunomodulatory effects, mediating a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines following either endotoxin injection or bacterial infection, although the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear (27Kalle M. Papareddy P. Kasetty G. van der Plas M.J. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Schmidtchen A. A peptide of heparin cofactor II inhibits endotoxin-mediated shock and invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e102577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, the considerations above initiated our interest in studying LPS binding of KYE28, as well as its influence on devastating Gram-negative plant pathogens belonging to the genus Xanthomonas. To place these investigations in a wider context, results obtained on these plant pathogens were compared with those for more widely investigated clinical pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi. Importantly, KYE28 was found to be very active against all tested plant pathogens. In addition to elucidating the membrane disruption underlying this antimicrobial effect through an array of biophysical methods, we also performed NMR studies to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of KYE28 in LPS for better understanding the key residues involved in stabilization of its adopted conformation, and to provide an understanding of the structure-activity correlation. Our studies indicated the importance of the aromatic residues of KYE28 for its interaction with LPS and resulting antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we infer that the aromatic zipper, together with background hydrophobic interactions, is crucial for endowing KYE28 with its bioactivity. Both peptides (KYE28 and KYE28A, the latter with Ala substitutions at Phe11, Phe19, Phe23, and Tyr25) were synthesized by Biopeptide Co., San Diego, CA, and were of >95% purity, as evidenced by mass spectral analysis (MALDI-TOF Voyager). 1 mm stock solutions of peptides were prepared by weighing the peptide in autoclaved distilled water or 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the concentration confirmed by measuring UV spectroscopy with respect to molar absorptive coefficient (ϵ). These stocks were used for all experiments if not otherwise specified. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), E. coli LPS (0111:B4), P. aeruginosa serotype 10 LPS, and E. coli lipid A F583 (Rd mutant) were obtained from Sigma, whereas DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, monosodium salt), DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), E. coli total lipid extract, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, CA) and of >99% purity. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Fungal strains Candida albicans SC5314 and Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii H99 were a gift from Prof. Kaustuv Sanyal, JNCASR, India. The agronomical bacterial strains Xanthomonas vesicatoria and Xanthomonas oryzae were provided by Dr. Christian Lindermayer, Helmholtz-Münich, Germany, and Prof. Sampa Das, Bose Institute, India, respectively. The other bacterial strains, K. pneumoniae and S. typhi, were obtained from ATCC. YPD broth (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose) was used to grow C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, whereas X. vesicatoria, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhi were grown in Nutrient broth and Xanthomonas oryzae were grown in PS broth (1% peptone, 1% sucrose) K. pneumoniae and S. typhi were grown at 37 °C. All other strains were incubated at 28 °C with 150 rpm for 24–48 h. To determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), a microtiter broth dilution method was utilized, as previously described (28Datta A. Ghosh A. Airoldi C. Sperandeo P. Mroue K.H. Jiménez-Barbero J. Kundu P. Ramamoorthy A. Bhunia A. Antimicrobial peptides: insights into membrane permeabilization, lipopolysaccharide fragmentation and application in plant disease control.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, overnight cultures of the indicated microbes were washed twice and re-suspended in either 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, alone or in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, and further diluted to 105 cfu/ml. The peptide was dissolved in the same buffer to a stock concentration of 1 mm. 50 μl of microbial suspension was added to the corresponding well of a 96-well microtiter plate (polypropylene) together with 50 μl of peptide solution to obtain a final peptide concentration ranging from 1 to 100 μm. The plate was subsequently incubated at 37 °C with rotation for 3 h, after which 200 μl of media was added and incubated at the temperature indicated above for 24 to 48 h. The MIC was obtained as the lowest concentration of the peptide where no visual microbial growth was detected. 10 μm Polymyxin B was used as a positive control. Microbial suspension in the absence of peptide was used as the negative control. THP1-XblueTM-CD14 cells (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of E. coli LPS (InvivoGen), with or without the immediate addition of KYE28 or KYE28A. NF-κB activation was determined 20 h later by using the Quanti-BlueTM assay (InvivoGen). In brief, through activation of the cells by various antagonists, NF-κB/AP-1 activation is induced, leading to the secretion of embryonic alkaline phosphatase into the cell supernatant. For detection, the cell supernatant and a secretion of embryonic alkaline phosphatase detection reagent (QUANTI-BlueTM) were mixed and absorbance was measured at 600 nm. Results given represent mean values from quadruple measurements. Sterile filtered MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was stored protected from light at −20 °C until use. THP-1 cells from the above experiment were washed, and 20 μl of the MTT solution was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 h in CO2 at 37 °C. The MTT-containing medium was then removed by aspiration. The blue formazan product generated was dissolved by the addition of 100 μl of 100% DMSO per well, and the plates gently swirled for 10 min at room temperature to dissolve the precipitate. The absorbance was monitored at 550 nm, and results given represent the mean values from quandruple measurements. A Jasco 815 spectrometer was used to study the secondary structures of the peptides in buffer solution as well as in the presence of LPS. Both peptide and LPS stocks were prepared either in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, or in the same buffer with pH 4.5. 25 μm peptide was titrated with increasing concentrations of LPS, ranging between 25 and 75 μm, and the spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 °C) with accumulations of three scans and at a speed of 100 nm/min. Spectra were scanned from 190 to 260 nm, with a data interval of 1 nm. A cuvette having a 0.1-cm path length was used for all measurements. The spectra obtained were corrected using a baseline spectrum in each case. The ellipticity in millidegrees was plotted against wavelength in nm. 1 mm KYE28/KYE28A solution in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, and 10% D2O were used to obtain one-dimensional proton NMR spectra at 25 °C, using Bruker Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm cryoprobe. 4,4-Dimethyl-4-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (DSS) was used as an internal standard (0.0 ppm) in all NMR experiments. A series of one-dimensional titrations were performed upon addition of increasing concentrations of LPS ranging from 3 to 24 μm (E. coli LPS or P. aeruginosa LPS), until line broadening was observed in the proton spectra. Upon significant line broadening (occurring at a LPS:peptide molar ratio of ∼1:25), two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (with mixing time of 80 ms), and transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (trNOESY) experiments with four different mixing times, viz. 75, 100, 150, and 200 ms, were carried out to rule out the possibility of spin diffusion. In addition, trNOESY experiments were carried out for the same sample of the KYE28-LPS complex in 100% D2O for unambiguous assignments of aromatic/aliphatic or aromatic/aromatic NOEs. 24 and 16 scans were performed either for NOESY (peptide in aqueous solution) or trNOESY (LPS-peptide complex with a molar ratio of 1:25) and TOCSY, respectively, per t1 increment. 16 Dummy scans were performed in each case and a spectral width of 12 ppm was maintained for both experiments along both dimensions. 456 increments in t1 and 2048 data points in t2 dimension along with States TPPI (29Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. Rapid recording of 2D NMR spectra without phase cycling: application to the study of hydrogen exchange in proteins.J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) for quadrature detection in t1 dimension and WATERGATE for water suppression were employed (30Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. Gradient-tailored water suppression for 1H-15N HSQC experiments optimized to retain full sensitivity.J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). TOCSY and NOESY or trNOESY spectra were processed using 4K (t2) × 1K (t1) data matrices after zero filling. The experiment was processed with Bruker TOPSPIN software and was analyzed using Sparky. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR experiments were conducted with 0.5 mm KYE28/KYE28A dissolved in 100% D2O, pH 4.5. LPS stock was also prepared in D2O and pH was adjusted to 4.5. A standard STD pulse program (31Bhunia A. Bhattacharjya S. Chatterjee S. Applications of saturation transfer difference NMR in biological systems.Drug Discov. Today. 2012; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Mayer M. Meyer B. Group epitope mapping by saturation transfer difference NMR to identify segments of a ligand in direct contact with a protein receptor.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) using a saturation frequency of −1 ppm and an off-resonance frequency of 40 ppm yielded the spectra. The experiments were conducted at 25 °C. The saturation frequency selectively saturated LPS in solution (on-resonance), whereas the off resonance was such a frequency where neither LPS nor the peptide saw any resonances. An STD experiment was carried out for peptides in the absence and presence of LPS. Total 40 Gaussian-shaped pulses (49 ms, 1 ms delay between pulses) with a saturation time of 2 s was employed (33Bhunia A. Bhattacharjya S. Mapping residue-specific contacts of polymyxin B with lipopolysaccharide by saturation transfer difference NMR: insights into outer-membrane disruption and endotoxin neutralization.Biopolymers. 2011; 96: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subtraction of off-resonance from the on-resonance spectra yielded the saturation transfer difference spectrum (34Mayer M. Meyer B. Characterization of ligand binding by saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). 1024 and 512 scans were performed for both STD and reference spectra, respectively, maintaining a spectral width of 12 ppm in each case. A relaxation delay of 2 s was used and 16 dummy scans were carried out for both STD and reference spectra. Before conducting Fourier transformation, an exponential line broadening function of 3 Hz was multiplied with STD one-dimensional spectra. The two-dimensional trNOESY spectra of KYE28 or KYE28A in LPS, recorded at 150 ms mixing time, were used to obtain the upper bound distance constraints from the NOE build up rate, as it contained no spin diffusion. The upper bound distance constraints were calculated with respect to the NOE intensities between the resolved ring protons of either Phe-11 (viz. Phe11-2H and Phe11-3H for KYE28 and ring protons) or Tyr2 (viz. Tyr2-2H and Tyr2-3H for KYE28A). The 2.0-Å distance was fixed for lower distance constraints. The calculated distance was then categorized as strong (2.5 Å), medium (2.6–3.5 Å), and weak (3.6–5.0 Å) for further structure calculation using CYANA. It is worth mentioning that the folding of the structure depends mainly only on medium- and long-range NOEs. The backbone dihedral angles Φ and ψ were varied from −30 to −120 and −120 to +120, respectively, for all nonglycine residues to reduce conformational search. The anti-parallel dimeric structure was also calculated as previously described (35Saravanan R. Bhattacharjya S. Oligomeric structure of a cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide in dodecylphosphocholine micelle determined by NMR spectroscopy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by connecting two monomer units with a glycine linker consisting of 10 glycines. Sequential, intra-residual, and medium-range NOEs were used to stabilize the monomeric units, whereas long-range NOEs were used as inter-monomeric NOEs. Successive refinements were performed as previously described (36Domadia P.N. Bhunia A. Ramamoorthy A. Bhattacharjya S.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 18417-18428Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 20 lowest energy structures were chosen from the 100 calculated structures to represent the ensemble structure.

Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine peptide interaction with E. coli LPS. A fluorescence emission spectrum of DPH was obtained in the presence of LPS bicelles, as well as in the presence of increasing peptide concentrations. For the preparation of bicelles, 2 mg of LPS from E. coli 0111:B4 was dissolved in buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) along with 1.51 mg of CHAPSO, keeping q ratio = 0.25. The sample was next subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles and used for further assay. Bicelle disruption experiments were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter, using excitation at 358 nm, emission wavelengths of 400 to 600 nm, excitation and emission slit"
https://openalex.org/W2346174724,"Positive strand RNA viruses replicate via a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that uses a unique palm domain active site closure mechanism to establish the canonical two-metal geometry needed for catalysis. This mechanism allows these viruses to evolutionarily fine-tune their replication fidelity to create an appropriate distribution of genetic variants known as a quasispecies. Prior work has shown that mutations in conserved motif A drastically alter RdRP fidelity, which can be either increased or decreased depending on the viral polymerase background. In the work presented here, we extend these studies to motif D, a region that forms the outer edge of the NTP entry channel where it may act as a nucleotide sensor to trigger active site closure. Crystallography, stopped-flow kinetics, quench-flow reactions, and infectious virus studies were used to characterize 15 engineered mutations in coxsackievirus B3 polymerase. Mutations that interfere with the transport of the metal A Mg(2+) ion into the active site had only minor effects on RdRP function, but the stacking interaction between Phe(364) and Pro(357), which is absolutely conserved in enteroviral polymerases, was found to be critical for processive elongation and virus growth. Mutating Phe(364) to tryptophan resulted in a genetically stable high fidelity virus variant with significantly reduced pathogenesis in mice. The data further illustrate the importance of the palm domain movement for RdRP active site closure and demonstrate that protein engineering can be used to alter viral polymerase function and attenuate virus growth and pathogenesis."

Team approaches with the cooperation of various professionals have the power to improve the quality of medical care, utilizing the specialized knowledge and skills of each professional. In our hospital, a multidisciplinary participatory swallowing team was organized. The aim of this study was to clarify the influence of a team approach on dysphagia by comparing the rates of pneumonia in acute stroke patients prior to and post team organization. All consecutive acute stroke patients who were admitted to our hospital between April 2009 and March 2014 were registered. We analyzed the difference in the rate of pneumonia onset between the periods before team organization (prior period) and after team organization (post period). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model to determine the predictors of pneumonia. We recruited 132 acute stroke patients from the prior period and 173 patients from the post period. Pneumonia onset was less frequent in the post period compared with the prior period (6.9% vs. 15.9%, respectively; p = 0.01). Based on a multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model, it was determined that a swallowing team approach was related to pneumonia onset independent from the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (adjusted hazard ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.19–0.84, p = 0.02). The multidisciplinary participatory swallowing team effectively decreased the pneumonia onset in acute stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2346156409,"APOL1, a secreted high-density lipoprotein, is expressed in different human tissues. Genetic variants of APOL1 are described to be associated with the development of end stage renal diseases in African Americans. In human kidney, APOL1 is mainly expressed in podocytes that are responsible for proper blood filtration. Since mice do not express ApoL1, the zebrafish is an ideal model to study the role of ApoL1. Injection of morpholinos against zApoL1 into zebrafish eggs and larvae, respectively, induces severe edema indicating a leakage of the filtration barrier. This was demonstrated in zApoL1 knockdown larvae by intravascular injection of fluorescently-labeled 10- and 500-kDa dextrans and by clearance of the vitamin D-binding protein from the circulation. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR revealed the reduction of nephrin, a podocyte-specific protein essential for blood filtration. Coinjection of human nephrin mRNA rescued the zApoL1 knockdown induced phenotype. Reduced APOL1 and nephrin levels were also found in biopsies of patients suffering from end stage renal diseases. Our results demonstrate that zApoL1 is essential for proper blood filtration in the zebrafish glomerulus and that zApoL1 affects the expression of nephrin."
https://openalex.org/W2346586064,"Ezrin is a member of the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of proteins that links cortical cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. High expression of ezrin correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis in osteosarcoma. In this study, to uncover specific cellular responses evoked by ezrin inhibition that can be used as a specific pharmacodynamic marker(s), we profiled global gene expression in osteosarcoma cells after treatment with small molecule ezrin inhibitors, NSC305787 and NSC668394. We identified and validated several up-regulated integrated stress response genes including PTGS2, ATF3, DDIT3, DDIT4, TRIB3, and ATF4 as novel ezrin-regulated transcripts. Analysis of transcriptional response in skin and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from NSC305787-treated mice compared with a control group revealed that, among those genes, the stress gene DDIT4/REDD1 may be used as a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker of ezrin inhibitor compound activity. In addition, we validated the anti-metastatic effects of NSC305787 in reducing the incidence of lung metastasis in a genetically engineered mouse model of osteosarcoma and evaluated the pharmacokinetics of NSC305787 and NSC668394 in mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that cytoplasmic ezrin, previously considered a dormant and inactive protein, has important functions in regulating gene expression that may result in down-regulation of stress response genes.

https://openalex.org/W2346521219,"Insulin secretory in pancreatic beta-cells responses to nutrient stimuli and hormonal modulators include multiple messengers and signaling pathways with complex interdependencies. Here we present a computational model that incorporates recent data on glucose metabolism, plasma membrane potential, G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCR), cytoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium dynamics, cAMP and phospholipase C pathways that regulate interactions between second messengers in pancreatic beta-cells. The values of key model parameters were inferred from published experimental data. The model gives a reasonable fit to important aspects of experimentally measured metabolic and second messenger concentrations and provides a framework for analyzing the role of metabolic, hormones and neurotransmitters changes on insulin secretion. Our analysis of the dynamic data provides support for the hypothesis that activation of Ca2+-dependent adenylyl cyclases play a critical role in modulating the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and catecholamines. The regulatory properties of adenylyl cyclase isoforms determine fluctuations in cytoplasmic cAMP concentration and reveal a synergistic action of glucose, GLP-1 and GIP on insulin secretion. On the other hand, the regulatory properties of phospholipase C isoforms determine the interaction of glucose, acetylcholine and free fatty acids (FFA) (that act through the FFA receptors) on insulin secretion. We found that a combination of GPCR agonists activating different messenger pathways can stimulate insulin secretion more effectively than a combination of GPCR agonists for a single pathway. This analysis also suggests that the activators of GLP-1, GIP and FFA receptors may have a relatively low risk of hypoglycemia in fasting conditions whereas an activator of muscarinic receptors can increase this risk. This computational analysis demonstrates that study of second messenger pathway interactions will improve understanding of critical regulatory sites, how different GPCRs interact and pharmacological targets for modulating insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes."

In strawberry, only FaWRKY1 (Fragaria × ananassa) has been characterized, leaving numerous WRKY genes to be identified and their function characterized. The publication of the draft genome sequence of the strawberry genome allowed us to conduct a genome-wide search for WRKY proteins in Fragaria vesca, and to compare the identified proteins with their homologs in model plants. Fifty-nine FvWRKY genes were identified and annotated from the F. vesca genome. Detailed analysis, including gene classification, annotation, phylogenetic evaluation, conserved motif determination and expression profiling, based on RNA-seq data, were performed on all members of the family. Additionally, the expression patterns of the WRKY genes in different fruit developmental stages were further investigated using qRT-PCR, to provide a foundation for further comparative genomics and functional studies of this important class of transcriptional regulators in strawberry."
https://openalex.org/W2346811083,"We aimed to develop and validate a risk score to aid in the early identification of laboratory-confirmed dengue patients at high risk of severe dengue (SD) (i.e. severe plasma leakage with shock or respiratory distress, or severe bleeding or organ impairment). We retrospectively analyzed data of 1184 non-SD patients at hospital presentation and 69 SD patients before SD onset. We fit a logistic regression model using 85% of the population and converted the model coefficients to a numeric risk score. Subsequently, we validated the score using the remaining 15% of patients. Using the derivation cohort, two scoring algorithms for predicting SD were developed: models 1 (dengue illness ≤4 days) and 2 (dengue illness >4 days). In model 1, we identified four variables: age ≥65 years, minor gastrointestinal bleeding, leukocytosis, and platelet count ≥100×10(9) cells/L. Model 1 (ranging from -2 to +6 points) showed good discrimination between SD and non-SD, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.848 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.771-0.924). The optimal cutoff value for model 1 was 1 point, with a sensitivity and specificity for predicting SD of 70.3% and 90.6%, respectively. In model 2 (ranging from 0 to +3 points), significant predictors were age ≥65 years and leukocytosis. Model 2 showed an AUC of 0.859 (95% CI, 0.756-0.963), with an optimal cutoff value of 1 point (sensitivity, 80.3%; specificity, 85.8%). The median interval from hospital presentation to SD was 1 day. This finding underscores the importance of close monitoring, timely resuscitation of shock including intravenous fluid adjustment and early correction of dengue-related complications to prevent the progressive dengue severity. In the validation data, AUCs of 0.904 (95% CI, 0.825-0.983) and 0.917 (95% CI, 0.833-1.0) in models 1 and 2, respectively, were achieved. The observed SD rates (in both cohorts) were <3% for patients with a score <1 point, but >50% for those with a score of ≥2 points, irrespective of the day of illness onset, suggesting that our simple risk score can be easily implemented in resource-limited countries for early prediction of dengue patients at risk of SD provided that they have rapid dengue confirmed tests. For patients with other acute febrile illnesses or bacterial infections usually have SD risk score of >1. Thus, these scoring algorithms cannot totally replace good clinical judgement of the physician, and most importantly, early differentiating dengue from other febrile illnesses is critical for appropriate monitoring and management."
https://openalex.org/W2346438918,"Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex display strong preference for human bloodmeals and are major malaria vectors in Africa. However, their interaction with viruses or role in arbovirus transmission during epidemics has been little examined, with the exception of O'nyong-nyong virus, closely related to Chikungunya virus. Deep-sequencing has revealed different RNA viruses in natural insect viromes, but none have been previously described in the Anopheles gambiae species complex. Here, we describe two novel insect RNA viruses, a Dicistrovirus and a Cypovirus, found in laboratory colonies of An. gambiae taxa using small-RNA deep sequencing. Sequence analysis was done with Metavisitor, an open-source bioinformatic pipeline for virus discovery and de novo genome assembly. Wild-collected Anopheles from Senegal and Cambodia were positive for the Dicistrovirus and Cypovirus, displaying high sequence identity to the laboratory-derived virus. Thus, the Dicistrovirus (Anopheles C virus, AnCV) and Cypovirus (Anopheles Cypovirus, AnCPV) are components of the natural virome of at least some anopheline species. Their possible influence on mosquito immunity or transmission of other pathogens is unknown. These natural viruses could be developed as models for the study of Anopheles-RNA virus interactions in low security laboratory settings, in an analogous manner to the use of rodent malaria parasites for studies of mosquito anti-parasite immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2347170512,"Background Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most effective drugs for the treatment of human asthma. However, a subgroup of asthmatic patients with neutrophilic airway inflammation is insensitive to GCs. Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a cytokine upregulated in the airways of a subset of human asthmatic patients, contributes to the recruitment of neutrophils and induces a glucocorticoid resistance in human airway epithelial cells. We hypothesized that IL-17 similarly activates neutrophils and contributes to their persistence in the asthmatic airways in spite of glucocorticoid therapy. Objective To determine whether IL-17 directly activates neutrophils and whether this response is attenuated by GCs. Methods Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of horses and incubated in the presence of recombinant equine IL-17, LPS and dexamethasone. mRNA and protein expression of IL-17 receptors (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) were assessed by qPCR and immunoblot, respectively. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, cell viability and apoptosis were determined by qPCR, Trypan Blue exclusion test, and flow cytometry, respectively. Results Equine neutrophils express both IL-17RA and IL-17RC at the mRNA and protein levels. Neutrophil stimulation with IL-17 increases the mRNA expression of IL-8, which is not attenuated by dexamethasone (p = 0.409). Also, neutrophil viability is significantly increased (p<0.0001) by IL-17 in the presence of LPS when compared to LPS alone. Flow cytometry and light microscopy revealed that LPS-induced apoptosis is decreased by IL-17 (p = 0.02 and p = 0.006 respectively). Conclusion These results indicate that IL-17 directly activates equine neutrophils at 24 hours, and that the expression of IL-8 thus induced is not attenuated by GCs. Additionally, IL-17 increases neutrophil viability and decreases apoptosis. These findings suggest an important role of IL-17 in pulmonary persistence of neutrophils in the asthmatic airways."
https://openalex.org/W2345906842,"Beige adipocytes comprise a unique thermogenic cell type in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of rodents and humans, and play a critical role in energy homeostasis. In this scenario, recruitment of beige cells has been an important focus of interest for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat obesity. PPARγ activation by full agonists (thiazolidinediones, TZDs) drives the appearance of beige cells, a process so-called browning of WAT. However, this does not translate into increased energy expenditure, and TZDs are associated with weight gain. Partial PPARγ agonists, on the other hand, do not induce weight gain, but have not been shown to drive WAT browning. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of GQ-16 on BAT and on browning of WAT in obese mice.Male Swiss mice with obesity and hyperglycemia induced by high fat diet were treated with vehicle, rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg/d) or the TZD-derived partial PPARγ agonist GQ-16 (40 mg/kg/d) for 14 days. Fasting blood glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and lipid profile were measured. WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots were excised for determination of adiposity, relative expression of Ucp-1, Cidea, Prdm16, Cd40 and Tmem26 by RT-qPCR, histological analysis, and UCP-1 protein expression analysis by immunohistochemistry. Liver samples were also removed for histological analysis and determination of hepatic triglyceride content.GQ-16 treatment reduced high fat diet-induced weight gain in mice despite increasing energy intake. This was accompanied by reduced epididymal fat mass, reduced liver triglyceride content, morphological signs of increased BAT activity, increased expression of thermogenesis-related genes in interscapular BAT and epididymal WAT, and increased UCP-1 protein expression in interscapular BAT and in epididymal and inguinal WAT.This study suggests for the first time that a partial PPARγ agonist may increase BAT activity and induce the expression of thermogenesis-related genes in visceral WAT.These findings suggest that PPARγ activity might be modulated by partial agonists to induce WAT browning and treat obesity."

Methods and Results The H9c2 cardiomyocyte cell line were incubated by hypoxic and then reoxygenated for the indicated time (2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h). Cell viability was tested with CCK-8 kit. The expression of endogenous HO-1(RT-PCR and Western blot) increased with the duration of reoxygenation and reached maximum levels after 2 hours of H/R; thereafter, the expression gradually decreased to a stable level. Mitochondrial dysfunction (Flow cytometry quantified the ROS generation and JC-1 staining) and autophagy (The Confocal microscopy measured the autophagy. RFP-GFP-LC3 double-labeled adenovirus was used for testing.) were induced after 6 hours of H/R. Then, genetic engineering technology was employed to construct an Lv-HO1-H9c2 cell line. When HO-1 was overexpressed, the LC3II levels were significantly increased after reoxygenation, p62 protein expression was significantly decreased, the level of autophagy was unchanged, the mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly increased, and the mitochondrial ROS level was significantly decreased. Furthermore, when the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP was applied the level of autophagy after reoxygenation was significantly inhibited, and no significant improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction was observed. Conclusions During myocardial hypoxia-reoxygenation injury, HO-1 overexpression induces autophagy to protect the stability of the mitochondrial membrane and reduce the amount of mitochondrial oxidation products, thereby exerting a protective effect."

Twenty-four Boer bucks were randomly allotted to diet supplemented with 0, 4 and 8% oil blend, fed for 100 days and slaughtered, and the GM muscle was subjected to a 7 d chill storage (4±1°C). Diet had no effect (P> 0.05) on the colour, drip loss, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) value, free thiol, carbonyl, myoglobin and metmyoglobin contents, metmyoglobin reducing activity (MRA), antioxidant enzyme activities and abundance of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin in the GM muscle in goats. The meat from goats fed 4 and 8% oil blend had higher (P< 0.05) concentration of α and γ-tocopherol and abundance of troponin T compared with that from the control goats. The GM muscle from the oil-supplemented goats had lower (P< 0.05) concentration of C16:0 and greater (P< 0.05) concentration of C18:1n-9, C18:3n-3 and C20:5n-3 compared with that from the control goats. Nonetheless, diet did not affect (P< 0.05) the total fatty acid in the GM muscle in goats. Regardless of the diet, the free thiol and myoglobin contents, concentration of tocopherol and total carotenoids, MHC and MRA in the GM muscle decreased (P< 0.05) while carbonyl content, TBARS, drip loss and metmyoglobin content increased over storage. Dietary blend of 80% canola oil and 20% palm oil beneficially altered tissue lipids without hampering the oxidative stability of chevon."

In this study we developed an adenovirus-based transdifferentiation strategy that incorporates an additional chemical compound for the efficient generation of induced PV (iPV) neurons. The chemical compound forskolin combined with Ascl1 induced ∼80% of mouse fibroblasts to iPV neurons. The iPV neurons generated by this procedure matured 5–7 days post infection and were characterized by electrophysiological properties and known neuronal markers, such as PV and GABA. Our studies, therefore, identified an efficient approach for generating PV neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2345948919,"Amphetamine dependence, besides its substantial economical consequence, is a serious cause of mortality and morbidity. By investigations of the neurochemical correlates through which addictive drugs, such as amphetamine, activate the mesoaccumbal dopamine system unique targets for treatment of drug addiction can be identified. This reward link consists of a dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) suggesting that these brain areas are important for reward. The physiological function of gut-brain peptides has expanded beyond food intake modulation and involves regulation of drug reinforcement. A novel candidate for reward regulation is the anorexigenic peptide neuromedin U (NMU). We therefore investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of NMU on amphetamine’s well-documented effects on the mesoaccumbal dopamine system, i.e. locomotor stimulation and accumbal dopamine release in mice. In addition, the effect of accumbal NMU administration on locomotor activity was examined. The effect of NMU, icv or intra-NAc, on the expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) was elucidated. Firstly, we showed that icv administration of NMU attenuate the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation, accumbal dopamine release and expression of CPP in mice. Secondly, we found that a lower dose of NMU (icv) reduce the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Thirdly, we demonstrated that NMU administration into the NAc block the ability of amphetamine to cause a locomotor stimulation in mice. However, accumbal NMU administration did not attenuate the amphetamine-induced expression of CPP in mice. Our novel data suggest that central NMU signalling is involved in development of amphetamine dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2346158912,"The oral streptococci are spherical Gram-positive bacteria categorized under the phylum Firmicutes which are among the most common causative agents of bacterial infective endocarditis (IE) and are also important agents in septicaemia in neutropenic patients. The Streptococcus mitis group is comprised of 13 species including some of the most common human oral colonizers such as S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sanguinis and S. gordonii as well as species such as S. tigurinus, S. oligofermentans and S. australis that have only recently been classified and are poorly understood at present. We present StreptoBase, which provides a specialized free resource focusing on the genomic analyses of oral species from the mitis group. It currently hosts 104 S. mitis group genomes including 27 novel mitis group strains that we sequenced using the high throughput Illumina HiSeq technology platform, and provides a comprehensive set of genome sequences for analyses, particularly comparative analyses and visualization of both cross-species and cross-strain characteristics of S. mitis group bacteria. StreptoBase incorporates sophisticated in-house designed bioinformatics web tools such as Pairwise Genome Comparison (PGC) tool and Pathogenomic Profiling Tool (PathoProT), which facilitate comparative pathogenomics analysis of Streptococcus strains. Examples are provided to demonstrate how StreptoBase can be employed to compare genome structure of different S. mitis group bacteria and putative virulence genes profile across multiple streptococcal strains. In conclusion, StreptoBase offers access to a range of streptococci genomic resources as well as analysis tools and will be an invaluable platform to accelerate research in streptococci.

https://openalex.org/W2346706680,"We investigated the effect of cultivation system (conventional or organic), cooking method, and flesh color on the contents of ascorbic acid (AA) and total phenolics (TPs), and on total antioxidant activity (Trolox equivalents, TE) in Solanum tuberosum (potato) tubers. The research material, consisting of 4 potato cultivars, was grown in experimental fields, using organic and conventional systems, at the experimental station in 2012 and 2013. The analysis showed that organically grown potatoes with creamy, light yellow, and yellow flesh had significantly higher TPs than did potatoes grown conventionally. Flesh color and cooking method also affected AA. The greatest losses of AA occurred in yellow-fleshed potatoes grown conventionally and cooked in the microwave; such losses were not observed in potatoes grown organically. A dry cooking method (baking in a microwave) increased the TP contents in potatoes by about 30%, regardless of the flesh color and the production system. TE was significantly higher in organically grown potatoes (raw and cooked in a steamer) than in conventionally grown potatoes. TE and AA contents showed a significant positive correlation, but only in potatoes from the organic system [R2 = 0.686]. By contrast, the positive correlation between TE and TPs was observed regardless of the production system. Therefore, we have identified the effects of farming system, cooking method, and flesh color on the contents of bioactive compounds in potato tubers."
https://openalex.org/W2346528270,"The Dsb protein family is responsible for introducing disulfide bonds into nascent proteins in prokaryotes, stabilizing the structure of many proteins. Helicobacter pylori HP0231 is a Dsb-like protein, shown to catalyze disulfide bond formation and to participate in redox homeostasis. Notably, many H. pylori virulence factors are stabilized by the formation of disulfide bonds. By employing H. pylori HP0231 deficient strains we analyzed the effect of lack of this bacterial protein on the functionality of virulence factors containing putative disulfide bonds. The lack of H. pylori HP0231 impaired CagA translocation into gastric epithelial cells and reduced VacA-induced cellular vacuolation. Moreover, H. pylori HP0231 deficient bacteria were not able to colonize the gastric mucosa of mice, probably due to compromised motility. Together, our data demonstrate an essential function for H. pylori HP0231 in gastric colonization and proper function of bacterial virulence factors related to gastric pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2346633632,"Detrital subsidies from marine macrophytes are prevalent in temperate estuaries, and their role in structuring benthic macrofaunal communities is well documented, but the resulting impact on ecosystem function is not understood. We conducted a field experiment to test the effects of detrital decay on soft-sediment primary production, community metabolism and nutrient regeneration (measures of ecosystem function). Twenty four (2 m(2)) plots were established on an intertidal sandflat, to which we added 0 or 220 g DW m(-2) of detritus from either mangroves (Avicennia marina), seagrass (Zostera muelleri), or kelp (Ecklonia radiata) (n = 6 plots per treatment). Then, after 4, 17 and 46 d we measured ecosystem function, macrofaunal community structure and sediment properties. We hypothesized that (1) detrital decay would stimulate benthic primary production either by supplying nutrients to the benthic macrophytes, or by altering the macrofaunal community; and (2) ecosystem responses would depend on the stage and rate of macrophyte decay (a function of source). Avicennia detritus decayed the slowest with a half-life (t50) of 46 d, while Zostera and Ecklonia had t50 values of 28 and 2.6 d, respectively. However, ecosystem responses were not related to these differences. Instead, we found transient effects (up to 17 d) of Avicennia and Ecklonia detritus on benthic primary production, where initially (4 d) these detrital sources suppressed primary production, but after 17 d, primary production was stimulated in Avicennia plots relative to controls. Other ecosystem function response variables and the macrofaunal community composition were not altered by the addition of detritus, but did vary with time. By sampling ecosystem function temporally, we were able to capture the in situ transient effects of detrital subsidies on important benthic ecosystem functions."
https://openalex.org/W2345500264,"Background To date, there are no valid statistics regarding the number of full time staff necessary for nursing care in emergency departments in Europe. Material and Methods Staff requirement calculations were performed using state-of-the art procedures which take both fluctuating patient volume and individual staff shortfall rates into consideration. In a longitudinal observational study, the average nursing staff engagement time per patient was assessed for 503 patients. For this purpose, a full-time staffing calculation was estimated based on the five priority levels of the Manchester Triage System (MTS), taking into account specific workload fluctuations (50th-95th percentiles). Results Patients classified to the MTS category red (n = 35) required the most engagement time with an average of 97.93 min per patient. On weighted average, for orange MTS category patients (n = 118), nursing staff were required for 85.07 min, for patients in the yellow MTS category (n = 181), 40.95 min, while the two MTS categories with the least acute patients, green (n = 129) and blue (n = 40) required 23.18 min and 14.99 min engagement time per patient, respectively. Individual staff shortfall due to sick days and vacation time was 20.87% of the total working hours. When extrapolating this to 21,899 (2010) emergency patients, 67–123 emergency patients (50–95% percentile) per month can be seen by one nurse. The calculated full time staffing requirement depending on the percentiles was 14.8 to 27.1. Conclusion Performance-oriented staff planning offers an objective instrument for calculation of the full-time nursing staff required in emergency departments."

In mammalian cells, apoptosis is mainly regulated by two signaling pathways: the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. The extrinsic signaling pathway that initiates apoptosis involves transmembrane receptor-mediated interactions including FAS ligand-FAS/APO1, TNF-TNF receptors, and TRAIL-TRAIL receptors. In the intrinsic pathway, the BCL-2 family BH3-only molecules, Bid, Bim, and Puma, convey apoptotic signals to trigger homo-oligomerization of multidomain proapoptotic Bax and Bak, which in turn permeabilize mitochondria, leading to the efflux of cytochrome c, the assembly of the apoptosome, and the activation of caspases which mediate apoptosis (4Ren D. Tu H.C. Kim H. Wang G.X. Bean G.R. Takeuchi O. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H.

During apoptosis, Bax translocates from the cytosol to insert into the outer membrane of mitochondria, and both Bax and Bak can convert from the non-activated to the activated conformation (5Gavathiotis E.

TaqMan assay numbers were: Hmbs, Mm00660262; Pdx1, Mm00435565; Bax, Mm00432051; and Bak, Mm00432045. The pLKO-Bax shRNA (RMM4533), Bak shRNA (RMM4534) were purchased from Thermo Scientific. Lentivirus was added to the medium on day 1. The blots were probed with antibodies against Pdx1 (07-696; Millipore), cytochrome c (mouse6H2.B4, Millipore), Actin (A-2066; Sigma), Bax (6A7) (2281-MC-100; Trevigen), Bax (N20) (SC493, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Bak (06536, Millipore). To detect BAX activation, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using 1% CHAPS buffer (1% CHAPS, 142.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). Anti-6A7 IP was performed using 1% CHAPS buffer. Antibody detection was accomplished using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer) and LAS-3000 Imaging system (FUJIFILM). Cell death was quantified by propidium iodide (PI) staining (7Boyd V.

The relative β-cell area was measured from anti-insulin-stained pancreas sections counterstained with hematoxylin using ImageJ software. TUNEL and Ki-67 staining were performed as previously described (11Fujimoto K. Chen Y. Polonsky K.S. Dorn 2nd., G.W.

More than 20000 β-cells and 300 islets were counted after TUNEL and Ki-67 staining and at least three mice were counted per group. All animal experiments in this study were performed under protocols approved by the University of Chicago Animal Studies Committee. Formalin-fixed pancreas sections underwent antigen retrieval in boiling citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min before labeling with antibodies against insulin (A0564; DAKO), glucagon (G2654; Sigma-Aldrich), and DAPI (P-36931; Invitrogen). The 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used to assess the statistical significance of differences between 2 sets of data. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. In all experiments, the number of asterisks is used to designate the following levels of statistical significance: ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05 compared with control group or wild type (WT) group. ####, p < 0.001; ##, p < 0.01; #, p < 0.05 compared with Pdx1 KD or Pdx1+/− group. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Pdx1 KD MIN6 cells did not demonstrate a significant increase in Bax and Bak mRNA (Fig. 1A) or protein levels when compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). Since Bax is located in the cytosol until activated by a diversity of stress stimuli to induce cell death through translocation to mitochondria, cellular cytosol, and mitochondrial fractions were extracted to determine if Bax subcellular fractions were altered by Pdx1 suppression. Pdx1 KD induced an accumulation of Bax protein in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1C) but no change in Bak protein levels. Protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV), a mitochondrial marker, were similar in Pdx1 KD and control cells (Fig. 1C). Bax conformation was also examined using the monoclonal antibody 6A7, which only recognizes the N-terminal epitope of Bax (12Kim H. Tu H.C. Ren D. Takeuchi O. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J.

The results showed that the amount of Bax precipitated by 6A7 anti-Bax antibody was increased in Pdx1 KD cells (Fig. 1D). To determine the effect of Bax mitochondrial translocation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured by quantifying the average mitochondrial fluorescence intensity of TMRE. TMRE uptake into mitochondria was decreased from 92.4 ± 4.5% in control cells to 60.7 ± 1.0% in Pdx1 KD cells (p < 0.001) indicating Pdx1 KD significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1E). Bax and Bak mRNA levels were also examined in pancreatic islets isolated from 5–6 weeks old Pdx1+/− mice. mRNA levels of Bax were increased in islets from Pdx1+/− mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1F). Bak mRNA levels did not increase. To define the functional effects of changes in Bax expression on pancreatic β-cell death after Pdx1 suppression, shRNA was used to knock down Bax in MIN6 cells. Lentiviral Bax shRNA suppressed Bax expression by more than 60% and did not affect Bak expression (Fig. 2A). In Pdx1 KD MIN6 cells, Bax suppression inhibited the increase in cytochrome c release from mitochondria, the key event in activating apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Western blot also showed that Pdx1 induced an increase of cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol (Fig. 2C). Bax KD inhibited the cytochrome c release induced by Pdx1 KD (Fig. 2C). Pdx1 KD increased cytochrome c by 93% compared with control group (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). However, Bax KD significantly inhibited cytochrome c release by 42% in Pdx1 KD cells (Fig. 2C). Pdx1 KD increased cleaved caspase 3 protein by 150% compared with control cells (p < 0.001, Fig. 2D). In Bax/Pdx1 double knockdown (DKD) cells the cleaved caspase 3 protein levels were significantly lower than in Pdx1 KD cells (80% versus 250%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, following Pdx1 KD, 50.2 ± 2.7% of the MIN6 cells took up the PI stain. In the Pdx1/Bax DKD group, only 22.7 ± 1.1% (p < 0.001 compared with Pdx1 alone) took up the PI stain indicative of a 44% increase in cell viability (Fig. 2E). Bak knockdown had no effect on β-cell death induced by Pdx1 suppression (Fig. 2E). To determine the effects of Bax deficiency on β-cell death in vivo, we used mice in which Bax is conditionally deleted in islets using MIP-Cre/ERT (here refers to Cre) on a Bak−/− background. The expression of Bax protein in islets from mice fed either a normal chow or a high fat diet was decreased to the extent that it became almost undetectable after tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Bax protein levels in islets from BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice after 4 months on a high fat diet were 5% of the levels in islets from BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice. β-cell mass was reduced by 65% (p < 0.01) in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice and the islets contained reduced numbers of β-cells (Fig. 3C). These islets also demonstrated abnormal architecture in that α cells were distributed throughout the islets compared with islets from BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice that had a central core of β-cells ringed by a mantle of α cells (Fig. 3C). The Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice showed an increase in β-cell mass compared with Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice by 73% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). The proportion of β-cells that demonstrated TUNEL labeling decreased significantly from 0.08 ± 0.01% in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice to 0.035 ± 0.004% in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). To determine whether there was also an effect of Bax ablation on β-cell proliferation, the islets were stained for the proliferative marker Ki-67. Proliferation of β-cells was decreased in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− islets and was significantly increased following Bax ablation in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ islets (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3F). Breeding Pdx1+/− mice on a Bak−/− background did not result in an improvement in glucose tolerance (Fig. 4A). Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice fed high-fat diet developed increased fasting blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. 4B). However, Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice exhibited significantly lower fasting blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance compared with Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− (Fig. 4B). Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice showed significantly improved but not normal glucose tolerance compared with BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice (Fig. 4B). The area under the blood glucose curve (AUC) decreased 27% in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice compared with Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice (p < 0.001). The AUC in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice is higher compared with that in BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4C). The reduction in blood glucose after insulin administration was similar in the four groups of mice (Fig. 4D) indicating that there were no differences in insulin sensitivity. Insulin levels were decreased in the Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice under basal conditions and following glucose challenge compared with BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice (Fig. 4E). In comparison, insulin concentrations were increased in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice (Fig. 4E). We have previously demonstrated that reduced β-cell mass is an essential component of the diabetic phenotype in the Pdx1-deficient mouse (2Johnson J.D. Ahmed N.T. Luciani D.S. Han Z. Tran H. Fujita J. Misler S. Edlund H. Polonsky K.S. Increased islet apoptosis in Pdx1+/− mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and Bim and Puma mediate β-cell death induced by Pdx1-deficiency (6Ren D. Sun J. Wang C. Ye H. Mao L. Cheng E.H. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. The role of BH3-only molecules Bim and Puma in β-cell death in Pdx1 deficiency.Diabetes. 2014; 63: 2744-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, both Bim and Puma can induce Bax or Bak activation and cause cell apoptosis (12Kim H. Tu H.C. Ren D. Takeuchi O. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Stepwise activation of BAX and BAK by tBID, BIM, and PUMA initiates mitochondrial apoptosis.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we demonstrated that pdx1 KD induces N-terminal conformational change in Bax and translocation of Bax to the mitochondria leading to its activation, alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. Knockdown of Bax significantly reduced β-cell apoptosis and increased β-cell survival in Pdx1 deficient cells. In contrast, deficiency of Bak had no impact on these processes. Results obtained in the Pdx1+/− mouse were consistent with the in vitro results. Bak−/− alone had no effect on glucose tolerance in the Pdx1+/− mouse. The reduction in the expression of Bax in islets preserved β-cell mass as a result of a reduction in β-cells apoptosis and an increase in proliferation of β-cells in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice fed a high-fat diet compared with Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice. These data suggest that Bax rather than Bak is the molecule downstream of Bim and Puma that plays a critical role in mediating β-cell apoptosis induced by Pdx1 deficiency. These results are consistent with other studies. One study showed that Bim, Puma, and Bax are required for β-cell apoptosis triggered by high glucose. Loss of the BH3-only proteins Bim or Puma, or loss of Bax markedly protected islets from glucose toxicity (13McKenzie M.D. Jamieson E. Jansen E.S. Scott C.L. Huang D.C. Bouillet P. Allison J. Kay T.W. Strasser A. Thomas H.E. Glucose induces pancreatic islet cell apoptosis that requires the BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma and multi-BH domain protein Bax.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 644-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human type 2 diabetic subjects, expression levels of Bim, Puma, and Bax are increased when compared with non-diabetic donors (14Wali J.A. Rondas D. McKenzie M.D. Zhao Y. Elkerbout L. Fynch S. Gurzov E.N. Akira S. Mathieu C. Kay T.W. Overbergh L. Strasser A. Thomas H.E. The proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma are downstream of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial oxidative stress in pancreatic islets in response to glucotoxicity.Cell. Death. Dis. 2014; 5: e1124-e1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Bcl-2 family members involved in regulating the apoptotic pathway are implicated in β-cell death induced by Pdx1 deficiency, and also suggest possible targets to reduce β-cell apoptosis in diabetic syndromes associated with reduced Pdx1 such as MODY4. Our approach is based on the following line of reasoning. Bak deficiency in the context of Cre expression in BaxF/FBak+/+Cre+ mice should have no impact on these beta cell parameters. We base this conclusion on the observation that the response of Pdx1+/−Bak−/− mice to glucose challenge is the same as Pdx1+/− alone mice, suggesting that Bak deficiency does not have a significant impact in Pdx1-induced beta cell death. Additionally, our experiments show that there are no statistical differences in beta cell mass, TUNEL+ number and Ki67+ number between BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− and BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice (Fig. 3, D–F), thus indicating that even Bax deficiency in beta cells has no impact in these parameters when the mice do not have beta cell death induced by Pdx1 deficiency. Thus we would anticipate that beta cell mass, death, and proliferation would be no different between BaxF/FBak+/+Cre+ and BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice. In our experiments, to rule out the compensation of Bak after Bax deletion in the β-cells, BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice were chosen as control mice because Bax and Bak can compensate for each other in cells. For example, Bax and Bak can compensate for each other in MEF cells, as MEFs that express either Bax or Bak are sensitive to apoptosis induced by expression of BH3-only proteins (15Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. BH3-only proteins that bind pro-survival Bcl-2 family members fail to induce apoptosis in the absence of Bax and Bak.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, Bax Bak double knock-out MEFs are highly resistant to apoptotic cell death stimuli (17Lindenboim L. Kringel S. Braun T. Borner C. Stein R. Bak but not Bax is essential for Bcl-xS-induced apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bak can also compensate for Bax in p53-null cells to release cytochrome c for the initiation of apoptosis (18Mondal S. Bhattacharya K. Mallick A. Sangwan R. Mandal C. Bak compensated for Bax in p53-null cells to release cytochrome c for the initiation of mitochondrial signaling during Withanolide D-induced apoptosis.PloS one. 2012; 7e34277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). But our data indicate that Bak and Bax do not compensate for each other in beta cells. Interestingly, Bax deficiency in Pdx1+/−BaxF/FBak−/−Cre+ mice leads to significantly improved but not normal glucose tolerance and increased β-cell mass compared with BaxF/FBak−/−Cre− mice. One explanation is that although the expression of Bax in islets was reduced by 94%, the residual levels of Bax protein in islets might be enough to induce β-cell apoptosis. Another explanation is that Pdx1 deficiency could induce other forms of β-cell death other than apoptosis such as necrosis and autophagy that are not mediated by Bax expression (6Ren D. Sun J. Wang C. Ye H. Mao L. Cheng E.H. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2343685860,"A gradually increasing number of transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD) cases was recently reported, all of which were associated with inactivating ZnT2 mutations. Here we characterized the impact of three novel heterozygous ZnT2 mutations G280R, T312M, and E355Q, which cause TNZD in exclusively breastfed infants of Japanese mothers. We used the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to provide direct visual evidence for the in situ dimerization of these ZnT2 mutants, and to explore their subcellular localization. Moreover, using three complementary functional assays, zinc accumulation using BiFC-Zinquin and Zinpyr-1 fluorescence as well as zinc toxicity assay, we determined the impact of these ZnT2 mutations on vesicular zinc accumulation. Although all three mutants formed homodimers with the wild type (WT) ZnT2 and retained substantial vesicular localization, as well as vesicular zinc accumulation, they had no dominant-negative effect over the WT ZnT2. Furthermore, using advanced bioinformatics, structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis we found that these mutations localized at key residues, which play an important physiological role in zinc coordination (G280R and E355Q) and zinc permeation (T312M). Collectively, our findings establish that some heterozygous loss of function ZnT2 mutations disrupt zinc binding and zinc permeation, thereby suggesting a haploinsufficiency state for the unaffected WT ZnT2 allele in TNZD pathogenesis. These results highlight the burning need for the development of a suitable genetic screen for the early diagnosis of TNZD to prevent morbidity."

Two SNPs (rs7754840: C>G, rs7756992: A>G) were genotyped via the Taqman PCR method. A total of 798 type 2 diabetic patients were included. HbA1c reduction after use of DPP-4 inhibitors for 3 months was significantly greater in patients with a risk allele for type 2 diabetes (GG -0.4%, CG -0.5%, CC -0.8%, p = 0.02 for rs7754840 and AA -0.4%, AG -0.5%, GG -0.8%, p = 0.01 for rs7756992). Linear regression analysis showed that per allele reductions of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 3 months were -0.10% for rs7754840 (p = 0.02) and -0.13% for rs7756992 (p = 0.0008) after adjusting for clinically influential covariates such as age, sex, BMI, duration of diabetes, baseline HbA1c and concomitant anti-diabetic agents. The results suggested that common variants of CDKAL1 are associated with therapeutic response to DPP-4 inhibitors."

The levels of fourteen API in rhubarb were measured using HPLC. The geographic distributions were collected using GPS and the nutrients in the soil were measured using the methods in the literature. The results showed that the levels of major API vary significantly among plants of different locations according to variance analysis. The species factor has few obvious effect on the overall properties of the rhubarb by the cluster analysis because of the two source species occurring in all divided three groups. However, Rheum tanguticum Maxim.ex Balf. is less effective at synthesizing and accumulating 9 API out of 14 than Rheum palmatum L. The correlation analysis and regression analysis also indicated that a lower latitude should be considered in the accumulation of API and a lower longitude should be considered to produce more compound anthraquinones. Lower levels of total P, rapidly available P and available molybdenum (Mo) and higher available K and available Zn in the soil were significantly correlated to accumulation of API in rhubarb. These results provide a basis for the clinical application and controlling the levels of the major API of rhubarb during artificial cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W2346365185,"Parental caregiving is critical for the survival of our young and continuation of our species. In humans, visual and auditory signals from offspring have been shown to be potent facilitators of parenting. However, whether odors emitted by our young also influence human parenting remains unclear. To explore this, we conducted a series of questionnaire surveys targeting parents with children under 6 years old. First, we collected episodes on experiencing odors/sniffing various parts of a child’s body (n = 507). The prevalence of experiencing events described in those episodes was examined in a separate survey (n = 384). Based on those results, the Child Odor in Parenting scale (COPs) was developed, and subsequently used in the main survey (n = 888). We found COPs to have adequate content validity, concurrent validity, and reliability. Responses to the COPs demonstrated that parents, especially mothers with infants, are aware of odors from their offspring, and actively seek them in daily child-rearing. The factor structure and content of the COPs items indicated that child odors have both affective and instrumental roles. Affective experiences induce loving feeling and affectionate sniffing, while instrumental experiences pertain to specific hygienic needs. The head was the most frequent source of affective experiences, and the child’s bottom of instrumental. Each was experienced by more than 90% of the mothers with a child below 1 year of age. Affective experiences significantly declined as the child grew older, possibly associated with the decline of physical proximity between parents and child. This age-related decline was not prominent for instrumental experiences, except for the bottom, which significantly declined after 3 years of age. The present findings suggest that child odors play roles in human parenting, and that their nature and significance change during the course of a child’s development."

Previous studies have revealed that supplementation with serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) ameliorates colonic barrier alterations in the mdr1a-/- genetic mouse model of IBD. Here, we examine the effects of SBI on mucosal inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice that spontaneously develop colitis. Wild type (WT) mice and mice lacking the mdr1a gene (KO) were fed diets supplemented with either SBI (2% w/w) or milk proteins (Control diet), from day 21 (weaning) until day 56. Leucocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and in lamina propria were determined, as was mucosal cytokine production. Neutrophil recruitment and activation in MLN and lamina propria of KO mice were increased, but were significantly reduced in both by SBI supplementation (p < 0.05). The increased neutrophil recruitment and activation observed in KO mice correlated with increased colon oxidative stress (p < 0.05) and SBI supplementation reduced this variable (p < 0.05). The Tact/Treg lymphocyte ratios in MLN and lamina propria were also increased in KO animals, but SBI prevented these changes (both p < 0.05). In the colon of KO mice, there was an increased production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 (2-fold), IL-6 (26-fold) and IL-17 (19-fold), and of chemokines MIP-1β (4.5-fold) and MCP-1 (7.2-fold). These effects were significantly prevented by SBI (p < 0.05). SBI also significantly increased TGF-β secretion in the colon mucosa, suggesting a role of this anti-inflammatory cytokine in the modulation of GALT and the reduction of the severity of the inflammatory response during the onset of colitis."

As opposed to control mice, βGlud1−/− animals fed a high calorie diet maintained glucose tolerance and did not develop diet-induced obesity. Islets of βGlud1−/− mice did not increase their secretory response upon high calorie feeding, as did islets of control mice. Inhibited adipose tissue expansion observed in knock-out mice correlated with lower expression of genes responsible for adipogenesis. Rather than being efficiently stored, lipids were consumed at a higher rate in βGlud1−/− mice compared with controls, in particular during food intake periods.

Subsequently, the crystal structure of the isolated apo form of EF4 was determined (8Evans R.N. Blaha G. Bailey S. Steitz T.A. The structure of LepA, the ribosomal back translocase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4673-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). EF4 consists of five domains, four of which (I, II, III, and V) are topologically equivalent to EF-G. The N-terminal domain I, also named the G domain, is the GTP/GDP binding site and is universally conserved among the trGTPase factors (3Margus T. Remm M. Tenson T. Phylogenetic distribution of translational GTPases in bacteria.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although EF4 lacks the G' subdomain insertion as well as domain IV of EF-G, it has an additional C-terminal domain (CTD). The additional CTD is a feature that is only observed in two trGTPase families, EF4 and BipA; however, their structures are not only different from one another but also represent entirely novel folds (8Evans R.N. Blaha G. Bailey S. Steitz T.A. The structure of LepA, the ribosomal back translocase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4673-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Kumar V. Chen Y. Ero R. Ahmed T. Tan J. Li Z. Wong A.S. Bhushan S. Gao Y.G. Structure of BipA in GTP form bound to the ratcheted ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 10944-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ∼11-Å resolution, single-particle cryo-EM reconstitution of the ribosome complex resulting from prolonged incubation of the POST complex with EF4 and a non-hydrolysable GTP analog (GDPNP) suggested that EF4 directly interacts with the tRNA in the A site, thereby stabilizing it in a position distinct from the classical A/A tRNA (named A/L tRNA, L for LepA binding), with the acceptor arm shifted away from the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (10Connell S.R. Topf M. Qin Y. Wilson D.N. Mielke T. Fucini P. Nierhaus K.H. Spahn C.M. A new tRNA intermediate revealed on the ribosome during EF4-mediated back-translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The tRNA was predicted to fall back into the classical A site upon EF4 release from the ribosome. Using a centrifugal binding assay, the authors showed that EF4 preferentially binds to the POST complex rather than the PRE complex and concluded that the resulting complex represents a back-translocation intermediate state (10Connell S.R. Topf M. Qin Y. Wilson D.N. Mielke T. Fucini P. Nierhaus K.H. Spahn C.M. A new tRNA intermediate revealed on the ribosome during EF4-mediated back-translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although an ensemble of in vitro kinetic assays showed that ribosome back-translocation proceeded through at least three intermediate states, they also highlighted the relative slowness of the proposed EF4-mediated back-translocation process, thereby raising the possibility that the POST complex is not the main substrate of EF4 (11Liu H. Pan D. Pech M. Cooperman B.S. Interrupted catalysis: the EF4 (LepA) effect on back-translocation.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In support of this view, single-turnover experiments and single-molecule FRET measurements reveal that EF4 prefers to bind to the PRE state ribosomes and that this interaction occurs in a competitive fashion with EF-G (12Liu H. Chen C. Zhang H. Kaur J. Goldman Y.E. Cooperman B.S. The conserved protein EF4 (LepA) modulates the elongation cycle of protein synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 16223-16228Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PRE complex is the main substrate of EF4 during translation. The interaction between EF4 and the PRE complex gives rise to a ribosome state that can be rapidly converted to the POST complex by EF-G (12Liu H. Chen C. Zhang H. Kaur J. Goldman Y.E. Cooperman B.S. The conserved protein EF4 (LepA) modulates the elongation cycle of protein synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 16223-16228Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the EF4-mediated PRE complex-like state arises from its interaction with the PRE complex rather than back-translocation of the POST complex (12Liu H. Chen C. Zhang H. Kaur J. Goldman Y.E. Cooperman B.S. The conserved protein EF4 (LepA) modulates the elongation cycle of protein synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 16223-16228Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Curiously, Fredrick and co-workers (13Balakrishnan R. Oman K. Shoji S. Bundschuh R. Fredrick K. The conserved GTPase LepA contributes mainly to translation initiation in Escherichia coli.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 13370-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that EF4 failed to promote back-translocation under various conditions, including those in the previously reported mRNA toeprinting assay (2Qin Y. Polacek N. Vesper O. Staub E. Einfeldt E. Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. The highly conserved LepA is a ribosomal elongation factor that back-translocates the ribosome.Cell. 2006; 127: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Despite the efforts of several groups, the physiological substrate of EF4 has not been conclusively established. The crystal structure of the GDP form of EF4 bound to the ribosome harboring a P site tRNA was recently determined at 2.9-Å resolution (14Gagnon M.G. Lin J. Bulkley D. Steitz T.A. Crystal structure of elongation factor 4 bound to a clockwise ratcheted ribosome.Science. 2014; 345: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the reported structure exhibited unusual ratcheting, with the 30S subunit rotated clockwise relative to the 50S subunit and a remodeled decoding center. The rotation in the reverse direction from the ones mediated by EF-G (15Pulk A. Cate J.H. Control of ribosomal subunit rotation by elongation factor G.Science. 2013; 10.1126/science.1235970Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Tourigny D.S. Fernandez I.S. Kelley A.C.

Crystal structures of EF-G-ribosome complexes trapped in intermediate states of translocation.Science. 2013; 10.1126/science.1236086Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and BipA (9Kumar V. Chen Y. Ero R. Ahmed T. Tan J. Li Z. Wong A.S. Bhushan S. Gao Y.G. Structure of BipA in GTP form bound to the ratcheted ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 10944-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggests a contrasting interplay between EF4 and the ribosome. Steitz and co-workers (14Gagnon M.G. Lin J. Bulkley D. Steitz T.A. Crystal structure of elongation factor 4 bound to a clockwise ratcheted ribosome.Science. 2014; 345: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) proposed that the structure is consistent with EF4 functioning either as a back-translocase or a ribosome sequester because the opening of the decoding center could either facilitate P-tRNA translocation on the POST complex or help displace the A-tRNA while protecting the P-tRNA from hydrolysis on the PRE complex. The elucidation of structures of EF4-ribosome complexes in various states, such as in the GTP form, and additional biochemical assays would greatly boost our understanding of its precise mechanism and function. Here we present the cryo-EM reconstitution of the GTP form of Thermus thermophilus EF4 in its GTP form bound to the ribosome with tRNAs in the P and E sites. Our structure reveals that the position of the tRNA in the P site and its interactions with the CTD of the GTP form of EF4 are similar to those observed in the GDP form of EF4 bound to the ribosome. Although a clockwise ribosome rotation was observed in the presence of the EF4-GDP complex, our ribosome-EF4-GDPCP (a non-hydrolysable GTP analog) structure is more similar to that of an unrotated state. As a result, the positions of EF4 and a number of contacts formed between EF4 and the ribosome vary in these two complexes. Furthermore, the well defined electron density for EF4, including the functionally important switch 1 region, allows us to model the nucleotide binding and GTPase activation center and to shed light on the GTP hydrolysis mechanism catalyzed by EF4. While our manuscript was in preparation, cryo-EM reconstitutions of Escherichia coli EF4 in complex with the PRE and POST state ribosomes were reported (19Zhang D. Yan K. Liu G. Song G. Luo J. Shi Y. Cheng E. Wu S. Jiang T. Lou J. Gao N. Qin Y. EF4 disengages the peptidyl-tRNA CCA end and facilitates back-translocation on the 70S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The similarities and differences between our structure and these complexes will be discussed. The T. thermophilus ribosome with a C-terminal truncation of the L9 protein was purified as described previously (20Gao Y.G. Selmer M. Dunham C.M. Weixlbaumer A. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. The structure of the ribosome with elongation factor G trapped in the posttranslocational state.Science. 2009; 326: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Selmer M. Gao Y.G. Weixlbaumer A. Ramakrishnan V. Ribosome engineering to promote new crystal forms.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The T. thermophilus EF4 gene was cloned into the PET26M vector (Novagen) and transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta T1R (Novagen) cell line. EF4 protein was overexpressed with an N-terminal His6 tag. The protein was purified using three chromatographic steps. Briefly, EF4 was first purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The His tag was then removed by tobacco etch virus protease cleavage, after which the untagged protein was collected and further purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The protein was finally concentrated to 236 μm and stored in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at −80 °C. The 70S ribosome and GDPCP state EF4 complex was prepared in buffer G (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgAc, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Briefly, the EF4-ribosome complex was reconstituted in the following order. 360 nm ribosomes were incubated with 720 nm mRNA Z4C at 55 °C for 6 min. The Z4C mRNA was chemically synthesized (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) with the sequence 5′ GGCAAGGAGGUAAAAAUGUUCAAAA 3′. The fMet and Phe codons at the P and A sites are shown in bold and bold and underlined, respectively. Ribosome-mRNA incubation was followed by incubation with 720 nm tRNAfMet and 720 nm tRNAPhe at 55 °C for 30 min. In parallel, 9.0 μm EF4 was incubated with 100 μm of GDPCP at room temperature. Finally, the ribosome and EF4 reactions mixtures were combined and allowed to form a complex at 37 °C for 30 min. Four-microliter aliquots of the reconstituted EF4-ribosome complex were incubated on a glow-discharged, 2-nm carbon-coated holey grid (Quantifoil, Großlöbichau, Germany) for 30 s. The grids were blotted for 3 s in 100% humidity at 4 °C and flash-frozen in liquid N2-cooled liquid ethane using Vitrobot (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). The grids were loaded into an Arctica electron microscope (FEI) operated at 200 kV. The data were acquired using FEI automated data acquisition software (EPU). A total of 2251 micrographs were recorded in movie mode as a set of seven frames (total dose of 22 electrons/Å2) on a back-thinned FEI Falcon II direct electron detector at a calibrated magnification of 73,684, resulting in a pixel size of 1.9 Å at defocus values ranging from 1.5–4.0 μm. The contrast transfer function parameters were estimated using CTFFIND3 (22Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The particles were picked using EMAN2 (23Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J. EMAN2: an extensible image processing suite for electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar) and processed with Relion (24Scheres S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). A total of 164,338 particles were used for reference-free two-dimensional classification to discard the bad particles. Then the 147,720 particles selected after two-dimensional classification were used for further three-dimensional classification using a 60 Å-filtered, empty, 70S ribosome (free of tRNAs and factors) as a reference to sort out the heterogeneity in the dataset. The 110,981 particles with strong densities for EF4 and the P site tRNA were used for the final reconstruction with statistical movie processing to correct the beam-induced particle movements using Relion (24Scheres S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). The final reconstruction yielded a 3.8-Å resolution map, as determined with the gold standard Fourier cell correlation criteria in Relion (supplemental Fig. S1). Initial docking of 30S and 50S subunits (PDB code 5AA0) and EF4 (PDB code 4W2E) x-ray crystal structures into the cryo-EM maps was performed in Chimera (25Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera: a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27950) Google Scholar). We also reconstructed the structure of the same ribosome complex with an counterclockwise rotation at 5.7-Å resolution in a similar fashion. Here we report the structure of T. thermophilus EF4-GDPCP bound to the ribosome with tRNA in the P and E sites at 3.8-Å resolution, which was reconstructed by single-particle cryo-EM (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). A comparison with the structure of an unrotated ribosome harboring mRNA and tRNAs (26Selmer M. Dunham C.M. Murphy 4th, F.V. Weixlbaumer A. Petry S. Kelley A.C. Weir J.R. Ramakrishnan V. Structure of the 70S ribosome complexed with mRNA and tRNA.Science. 2006; 313: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) revealed that the present structure is also unrotated (Fig. 1B), representing a ribosome complex in the POST state, despite the presence of a non-cognate tRNA in the E site whose positioning is virtually identical to the cognate tRNA in the E site (27Feng S. Chen Y. Gao Y.G. Crystal structure of 70S ribosome with both cognate tRNAs in the E and P sites representing an authentic elongation complex.PLoS ONE. 2013; 10.1371/journal.pone.0058829Google Scholar). Upon closer inspection, we noticed a small ribosome population that was refined to 5.7-Å resolution and displayed a counterclockwise 30S body rotation with respect to the 50S subunit as well as 30S head swiveling (Fig. 1C). The unrotated and slightly counterclockwise rotated states of our structures are different from the notable clockwise rotation (30S body rotation by 5°) that was recently reported in the crystal structure of EF4-GDP (14Gagnon M.G. Lin J. Bulkley D. Steitz T.A. Crystal structure of elongation factor 4 bound to a clockwise ratcheted ribosome.Science. 2014; 345: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the cryo-EM reconstitution of the minor population of EF4-GDPNP (a non-hydrolysable GTP analog) bound to the ribosome (19Zhang D. Yan K. Liu G. Song G. Luo J. Shi Y. Cheng E. Wu S. Jiang T. Lou J. Gao N. Qin Y. EF4 disengages the peptidyl-tRNA CCA end and facilitates back-translocation on the 70S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the major population of EF4-GDPNP in the recent cryo-EM study and the previous low-resolution reconstitution of the GTP form of EF4 bound to the ribosome with tRNAs both in P and A sites (10Connell S.R. Topf M. Qin Y. Wilson D.N. Mielke T. Fucini P. Nierhaus K.H. Spahn C.M. A new tRNA intermediate revealed on the ribosome during EF4-mediated back-translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) also display unrotated states (10Connell S.R. Topf M. Qin Y. Wilson D.N. Mielke T. Fucini P. Nierhaus K.H. Spahn C.M. A new tRNA intermediate revealed on the ribosome during EF4-mediated back-translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), similar to the major ribosome population in the present structure. The structural parameters of the various EF4-ribosome complexes reported to date are summarized in supplemental Table S1. In addition to the variations in rotation, both the L11 region and the L1 stalk have different orientations in the structures of the GDP and GTP forms. The tip of H23 (the helices of the 50S and 30S subunits are labeled with H and h, respectively) in the L11 region and H78 in the L1 stalk shift away from the A site finger (H38 in 23S rRNA) and the E site tRNA by ∼18 and 6 Å, respectively, compared with the structure of EF4-GDP bound to the ribosome (Fig. 1D). The electron density map clearly shows both the P site tRNA and EF4 (supplemental Fig. S1B). We were able to build a complete model for EF4, including the regions that are crucial for its function: switch 1 (SW1, residues 38–60), switch 2 (SW2, residues 81–104), and the unique CTD (residues 490–610). Although the two switch regions, SW1 and SW2, had been visualized at low resolution based on homology modeling using EF-G and EF-G-2 as templates (10Connell S.R. Topf M. Qin Y. Wilson D.N. Mielke T. Fucini P. Nierhaus K.H. Spahn C.M. A new tRNA intermediate revealed on the ribosome during EF4-mediated back-translocation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), SW1 was partially traced in EF4-GDPNP bound to the ribosome (19Zhang D. Yan K. Liu G. Song G. Luo J. Shi Y. Cheng E. Wu S. Jiang T. Lou J. Gao N. Qin Y. EF4 disengages the peptidyl-tRNA CCA end and facilitates back-translocation on the 70S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, our structure provides a more detailed model for these regions. In addition, we could also fit the nucleotide GDPCP in the nucleotide-binding center. Taken together, our results provide the most complete model of EF4 bound to the ribosome to date. Translational GTPase factors share a common binding pocket in the ribosome, but the detailed interactions with the ribosome vary among different factors and within the same factor in diverse ribosome states. In agreement with the universal trGTPase-binding mode, the EF4-GDPCP in the present structure is held in position by extensive contacts with both the 50S and 30S subunits. The close interaction of the EF4 G domain with the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) in the 50S subunit (Fig. 2A) occurs in a way that is universally conserved in trGTPase factors. The ribosomal protein L6 in the 50S subunit is also involved in the interaction with the G domain (Fig. 2A). Domain II (more specifically residues Tyr-208, Gln-209, and Asp-270) contacts h5 of the 16S rRNA in the 30S shoulder (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in the recent cryo-EM structure of the E. coli EF4-GDPNP bound to the PRE state ribosomes, Tyr-203 (E. coli numbering, equivalent to Tyr-208 in T. thermophilus LepA) is observed to stack with the Ala-55 residue of the 16S rRNA (19Zhang D. Yan K. Liu G. Song G. Luo J. Shi Y. Cheng E. Wu S. Jiang T. Lou J. Gao N. Qin Y. EF4 disengages the peptidyl-tRNA CCA end and facilitates back-translocation on the 70S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similar to the interaction between the EF-G domain III and the ribosome (17Chen Y. Feng S. Kumar V. Ero R. Gao Y.G. Structure of EF-G-ribosome complex in a pretranslocation state.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), domain III of EF4 in the current structure makes bilateral contacts with both the 30S and 50S subunits, namely, the S12 protein in the 30S shoulder, and the SRL in the 50S subunit, respectively (Fig. 2C). Domain V wedges into a cleft formed by the SRL and protein L6 on one side and the L11 region (L11 protein and L11 RNA) on the other side, thereby establishing extensive contacts with the ribosome (Fig. 2D). Finally, the CTD of EF4 deeply projects into the PTC (Fig. 2E) in a very similar way to that observed in EF4-GDP bound to the ribosome (14Gagnon M.G. Lin J. Bulkley D. Steitz T.A. Crystal structure of elongation factor 4 bound to a clockwise ratcheted ribosome.Science. 2014; 345: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Note that our structure (POST) is similar to EF4 bound to the ribosome with both P and A tRNAs (PRE) (19Zhang D. Yan K. Liu G. Song G. Luo J. Shi Y. Cheng E. Wu S. Jiang T. Lou J. Gao N. Qin Y. EF4 disengages the peptidyl-tRNA CCA end and facilitates back-translocation on the 70S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The superposition of our structure with that of the crystal structure of EF4-GDP bound to the ribosome by aligning on the 23S rRNA clearly shows the different orientations of EF4 in the ribosome (Fig. 3A). Note that the 70S ribosome, regardless of the species, prefers to crystallize in a form where the ribosomal protein L9 from one ribosome extends to engage its C-terminal domain to contact the 16S rRNA of the neighboring ribosome. Although this interaction facilitates crystallization, it is incompatible with the binding of the trGTPase factor to the ribosome (20Gao Y.G. Selmer M. Dunham C.M. Weixlbaumer A. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. The structure of the ribosome with elongation factor G trapped in the posttranslocational state.Science. 2009; 326: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Selmer M. Gao Y.G. Weixlbaumer A. Ramakrishnan V. Ribosome engineering to promote new crystal forms.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2012; 68: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the GDP form of EF4 bound to the ribosome was obtained by covalently linking the N-terminal domain of L9 to EF4 (14Gagnon M.G. Lin J. Bulkley D. Steitz T.A. Crystal structure of elongation factor 4 bound to a clockwise ratcheted ribosome.Science. 2014; 345: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). This engineered crystal contact involving EF4 may introduce interference with the conformation of EF4 and its interaction with the ribosome. The β1 strand at the N terminus, to which the N-terminal domain of L9 is attached, is shifted by ∼8 Å toward the 30S subunit compared with our structure. With the engineered EF4, the entire G domain is reoriented by 14°, and the β-barrel of domain II is displaced by ∼15 Å (Asp-226 position) toward h3 and h4 of the 16S rRNA in the 30S shoulder, whereas domain III approaches H71 (a component of the intersubunit bridge B2b) of the 23S rRNA in the 50S subunit by ∼7 Å.

The impact of MPA on immunity is ambiguous and its influence on the canine immune system is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine markers of changes in stimulated peripheral canine lymphocytes after treatment with MPA in vitro. Twenty nine healthy dogs were studied. Phenotypic and functional analysis of lymphocytes was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured with mitogens and different MPA concentrations– 1 μM (10−3 mol/m3), 10 μM or 100 μM. Apoptotic cells were detected by Annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD). The expression of antigens (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD21, CD25, forkhead box P3 [FoxP3] and proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]) was assessed with monoclonal antibodies. The proliferation indices were analyzed in carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled cells. All analyses were performed using flow cytometry. The influence of MPA on apoptosis was dependent on the mechanism of cell activation and MPA concentration. MPA caused a decrease in the expression of lymphocyte surface antigens, CD3, CD8 and CD25. Its impact on the expression of CD4 and CD21 was negligible. Its negative influence on the expression of FoxP3 was dependent on cell stimulation. MPA inhibited lymphocyte proliferation. In conclusion, MPA inhibited the activity of stimulated canine lymphocytes by blocking lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The influence of MPA on the development of immune tolerance–expansion of Treg cells and lymphocyte apoptosis–was ambiguous and was dependent on the mechanism of cellular activation. The concentration that MPA reaches in the blood may lead to inhibition of the functions of the canine immune system. The applied panel of markers can be used for evaluation of the effects of immunosuppressive compounds in the dog."
https://openalex.org/W2346160085,"The chromosomally clustered interferon-induced with tetratricopeptide repeat motif (IFIT) gene family members share structural features at the gene and protein levels. Despite these similarities, different IFIT genes have distinct inducer- and cell type-specific induction patterns. Here, we investigated the mechanism for the observed differential induction of the mouse Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3 genes in B cells and demonstrated that the repressive effect of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), which is highly expressed in B cells, played an essential role in this regulation. Although IRF8 could impair induction of all three IFIT genes following stimulation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), it could selectively impair the induction of the Ifit1 gene following IFN stimulation. The above properties could be imparted to IRF8-non-expressing cells by ectopic expression of the protein. Induction of reporter genes, driven by truncated Ifit1 promoters, identified the regions that mediate the repression, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that more IRF8 bound to the IFN-stimulated response element of the Ifit1 gene than to those of the Ifit2 and the Ifit3 genes. Mutational analyses of IRF8 showed that its ability to bind DNA, interact with other proteins, and undergo sumoylation were all necessary to selectively repress Ifit1 gene induction in response to IFN. Our study revealed a new role for IRFs in differentially regulating the induction patterns of closely related IFN-stimulated genes that are located adjacent to one another in the mouse genome."

A total of 9,210 older persons aged 60 years and older were included. Mobility limitation was defined as self-reporting of ability to perform only with assistances/aids at least one of: walking at least 400 metres; or going up or down a flight of 10 stairs. Severe limitation was defined as complete inability to do at least one of these two functions, even with assistances or aids.At age 60, females compared to males, spent significantly fewer years without mobility limitation (male-female = 3.2 years) and more years with any limitation (female-male = 6.7 years) and with severe limitation (female-male = 3.2 years). For both genders, years lived with severe limitation were remarkably constant across age. Significant regional inequalities in years lived without and with limitation were evident, with a consistent pattern by gender in years free of mobility limitation (Central ranked the best and the North East ranked the worst). Finally, both males and females in the South had the longest life expectancy and the most years of life with severe mobility limitation.This study identifies inequalities in years without and with mobility limitations with important policy implication."
https://openalex.org/W2963609593,"Much of what we do is accomplished by working collaboratively with others, and a large portion of our lives are spent working and talking; the patterns embodied in the alternation of working and talking can provide much useful insight into task-oriented social behaviors. The available electronic traces of the different kinds of human activities in online communities are an empirical goldmine that can enable the holistic study and understanding of these social systems. Open Source Software (OSS) projects are prototypical examples of collaborative, task-oriented communities, depending on volunteers for high-quality work. Here, we use sequence analysis methods to identify the work-talk patterns of software developers in online communities of Open Source Software projects. We find that software developers prefer to persist in same kinds of activities, i.e., a string of work activities followed by a string of talk activities and so forth, rather than switch them frequently; this tendency strengthens with time, suggesting that developers become more efficient, and can work longer with fewer interruptions. This process is accompanied by the formation of community culture: developers’ patterns in the same communities get closer with time while different communities get relatively more different. The emergence of community culture is apparently driven by both “talk” and “work”. Finally, we also find that workers with good balance between “work” and “talk” tend to produce just as much work as those that focus strongly on “work”; however, the former appear to be more likely to continue to be active contributors in the communities."
https://openalex.org/W2345348408,"Schistosomiasis is an important helminth infection of humans. There are few reliable diagnostic biomarkers for early infection, for recurrent infection or to document successful treatment. In this study, we compared serum protein profiles in uninfected and infected mice to identify disease stage-specific biomarkers.Serum collected from CD1 mice infected with 50-200 Schistosoma mansoni cercariae were analyzed before infection and at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-infection using three mass spectrometric (MS) platforms.Using SELDI-TOF MS, 66 discriminating m/z peaks were detected between S. mansoni infected mice and healthy controls. Used in various combinations, these peaks could 1) reliably diagnose early-stage disease, 2) distinguish between acute and chronic infection and 3) diagnose S. mansoni infection regardless the parasite burden. The most important contributors to these diagnostic algorithms were peaks at 3.7, 13 and 46 kDa. Employing sample fractionation and differential gel electrophoresis, we analyzed gel slices either by MALDI-TOF MS or Velos Orbitrap MS. The former yielded eight differentially-expressed host proteins in the serum at different disease stages including transferrin and alpha 1- antitrypsin. The latter suggested the presence of a surprising number of parasite-origin proteins in the serum during both the acute (n = 200) and chronic (n = 105) stages. The Orbitrap platform also identified many differentially-expressed host-origin serum proteins during the acute and chronic stages (296 and 220 respectively). The presence of one of the schistosome proteins, glutathione S transferase (GST: 25 KDa), was confirmed by Western Blot. This study provides proof-of-principle for an approach that can yield a large number of novel candidate biomarkers for Schistosoma infection."
https://openalex.org/W2345537204,"Identifying the genes required for environmental sex determination is important for understanding the evolution of diverse sex determination mechanisms in animals. Orthologs of Drosophila orphan receptor Fushi tarazu factor-1 (Ftz-F1) are known to function in genetic sex determination. In contrast, their roles in environmental sex determination remain unknown. In this study, we have cloned and characterized the Ftz-F1 ortholog in the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna, which produces males in response to environmental stimuli. Similar to that observed in Drosophila, D. magna Ftz-F1 (DapmaFtz-F1) produces two splicing variants, αFtz-F1 and βFtz-F1, which encode 699 and 777 amino acids, respectively. Both isoforms share a DNA-binding domain, a ligand-binding domain, and an AF-2 activation domain and differ only at the A/B domain. The phylogenetic position and genomic structure of DapmaFtz-F1 suggested that this gene has diverged from an ancestral gene common to branchiopod crustacean and insect Ftz-F1 genes. qRT-PCR showed that at the one cell and gastrulation stages, both DapmaFtz-F1 isoforms are two-fold more abundant in males than in females. In addition, in later stages, their sexual dimorphic expressions were maintained in spite of reduced expression. Time-lapse imaging of DapmaFtz-F1 RNAi embryos was performed in H2B-GFP expressing transgenic Daphnia, demonstrating that development of the RNAi embryos slowed down after the gastrulation stage and stopped at 30-48 h after ovulation. DapmaFtz-F1 shows high homology to insect Ftz-F1 orthologs based on its amino acid sequence and exon-intron organization. The sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaFtz-F1 suggests that it plays a role in environmental sex determination of D. magna."
https://openalex.org/W2346068052,"Tests of design fluency (DF) assess a participant’s ability to generate geometric patterns and are thought to measure executive functions involving the non-dominant frontal lobe. Here, we describe the properties of a rapidly administered computerized design-fluency (C-DF) test that measures response times, and is automatically scored. In Experiment 1, we found that the number of unique patterns produced over 90 s by 180 control participants (ages 18 to 82 years) correlated with age, education, and daily computer-use. Each line in the continuous 4-line patterns required approximately 1.0 s to draw. The rate of pattern production and the incidence of repeated patterns both increased over the 90 s test. Unique pattern z-scores (corrected for age and computer-use) correlated with the results of other neuropsychological tests performed on the same day. Experiment 2 analyzed C-DF test-retest reliability in 55 participants in three test sessions at weekly intervals and found high z-score intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.79). Z-scores in the first session did not differ significantly from those of Experiment 1, but performance improved significantly over repeated tests. Experiment 3 investigated the performance of Experiment 2 participants when instructed to simulate malingering. Z-scores were significantly reduced and pattern repetitions increased, but there was considerable overlap with the performance of the control population. Experiment 4 examined performance in veteran patients tested more than one year after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients with mild TBI performed within the normal range, but patients with severe TBI showed reduced z-scores. The C-DF test reliably measures visuospatial pattern generation ability and reveals performance deficits in patients with severe TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2345357070,"Online bingo has seen significant growth in recent years. This study sought to increase understanding of this growth by exploring the appeal of online bingo. Our aim was to examine the content of ten online bingo websites in the UK and analyse a qualitative secondary dataset of 12 female bingo players to investigate the appeal of online bingo. Using two distinct data sources allowed us to assess how the key messages online websites are trying to convey compare with actual players’ motivation to play bingo. Our analysis of bingo websites found a common theme where websites were easy to navigate and structured to present a light-hearted, fun, reassuring, social image of gambling. In addition, the design decisions reflected in the bingo sites had the effect of positioning online bingo as a benign, child-like, homely, women-friendly, social activity. Comparison of the website content with our participants’ reasons to play bingo showed congruence between the strategies used by the bingo websites and the motivations of bingo players themselves and the benefits which they seek; suggesting that bingo websites strive to replicate and update the sociability of traditional bingo halls. Online bingo differs from traditional forms of bingo in its ability to be played anywhere and at any time, and its capacity to offer a deeply immersive experience. The potential for this type of online immersion in gambling to lead to harm is only just being investigated and further research is required to understand how the industry is regulated, as well as the effects of online bingo on individual gambling ‘careers.’"
https://openalex.org/W2345663842,"The lipid- and protein phosphatase PTEN is an essential tumor suppressor that is highly conserved among all higher eukaryotes. As an antagonist of the PI3K/Akt cell survival and proliferation pathway, it exerts its most prominent function at the cell membrane, but (PIP3-independent) functions of nuclear PTEN have been discovered as well. PTEN subcellular localization is tightly controlled by its protein conformation. In the closed conformation, PTEN localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm. Opening up of the conformation of PTEN exposes N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein that are required for both interaction with the cell membrane and translocation to the nucleus. Lack of Pten leads to hyperbranching of the intersegmental vessels during zebrafish embryogenesis, which is rescued by expression of exogenous Pten. Here, we observed that expression of mutant PTEN with an open conformation rescued the hyperbranching phenotype in pten double homozygous embryos and suppressed the increased p-Akt levels that are characteristic for embryos lacking Pten. In addition, in pten mutant and wild type embryos alike, open conformation PTEN induced stalled intersegmental vessels, which fail to connect with the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel. Functional hyperactivity of open conformation PTEN in comparison to wild type PTEN seems to result predominantly from its enhanced recruitment to the cell membrane. Enhanced recruitment of phosphatase inactive mutants to the membrane did not induce the stalled vessel phenotype nor did it rescue the hyperbranching phenotype in pten double homozygous embryos, indicating that PTEN phosphatase activity is indispensable for its regulatory function during angiogenesis. Taken together, our data suggest that PTEN phosphatase activity needs to be carefully fine-tuned for normal embryogenesis and that the control of its subcellular localization is a key mechanism in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2346737099,"IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) is a hormone involved in cell growth and other important processes. In the kidney, IGF-1 has a stimulating effect, increasing the blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Although many experimental animal studies regarding the role of IGF-1 in the kidney have been conducted, few human studies are available in the literature. Obesity is a cause of renal failure, and several glomerular lesions associated with obesity have been described. However, no studies regarding the levels of IGF-1 in morbidly obese patients with renal injury associated with obesity have been conducted.To determine the serum IGF-1 concentrations in morbidly obese patients with normal renal function but with different types of early obesity-related glomerular lesions and to evaluate the possible relationship between IGF-1 and the presence of renal lesions.Eighty morbidly obese patients with renal biopsy, including 11 patients with no evidence of renal lesion, 17 patients with single glomerulomegaly, 21 patients with single podocyte hypertrophy, 10 patients with glomerulomegaly and podocyte hypertrophy, 5 patients with focal segmental hyalinosis, and 16 patients with increased mesangial matrix and/or mesangial proliferation, participated in this study. Biological parameters, including serum IGF-1 concentrations with the standard deviation score for age (SDS-IGF-1), were determined for all patients.Eighty patients (50 women and 30 men) with a mean BMI of 52.63 ± 8.71 and a mean age of 42.40 ± 9.45 years were included in this study. IGF-1, IGF-1 SDS and IGF-1BP3 levels according to the renal injury were compared (normal glomeruli: IGF-1 = 190.17 ± 72.46; glomerulomegaly: IGF-1 = 122.3 ± 50.05; podocyte hypertrophy: IGF-1 = 119.81 ± 60.34; focal segmental hyalinosis: IGF-1 170.98 ± 100.83, increased mesangial matrix and/or mesangial proliferation: IGF-1 117.73 ± 63.87). Statistically significant differences were observed between serum levels of IGF-1 and between the levels of SDS-IGF-1 by comparing the group without glomerular lesion with the group formed by patients with any type of glomerular injury. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with the dependent variable defined as the glomerular injury. In the multivariate analysis, only SDS-IGF-1 was associated with glomerular injury, and low levels of IGF-1 SDS were a risk factor for kidney injury.Our study demonstrates that low IGF-1 serum levels are associated with renal lesions in morbidly obese patients without overt clinical renal manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W2346094259,"The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of the relative importance of the input of geographic and local environmental factors on richness and composition of epigaeic steppe beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) along a geographic (longitudinal/precipitation) gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland. Specifically, we evaluate the associations of environmental variables representing climate and environmental heterogeneity with beetle assemblages. Beetles were sampled using pitfall traps at 25 sites scattered across the full geographic extent of the study biome in 2011-2012. We used variance partitioning techniques and multi-model selection based on the Akaike information criterion to assess the relative importance of the spatial and environmental variables on beetle assemblages. Species richness and abundance showed unimodal patterns along the geographic gradient. Together with space, climate variables associated with precipitation, water-energy balance and harshness of climate had strong explanatory power in richness pattern. Abundance pattern showed strongest association with variation in temperature and environmental heterogeneity. Climatic factors associated with temperature and precipitation variables and the interaction between climate with space were able to explain a substantial amount of variation in community structure. In addition, the turnover of species increased significantly as geographic distances increased. We confirmed that spatial and local environmental factors worked together to shape epigaeic beetle communities along the geographic gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland. Moreover, the climate features, especially precipitation, water-energy balance and temperature, and the interaction between climate with space and environmental heterogeneity appeared to play important roles on controlling richness and abundance, and species compositions of epigaeic beetles."
