https://openalex.org/W1979444649,"When ectopically expressed in animal cells, cytokine response modifier A (CrmA), a product of the cowpox virus, prevents programmed cell death initiated by a variety of stimuli. Since CrmA is a proteinase inhibitor, its target is probably a protease that promotes cell death. The identification of this target is crucial in delineating essential regulation points that modulate the apoptotic program. We have compared the kinetics of interaction of CrmA with five proteases that may play a role in apoptosis. Four of the proteases, all members of the caspase family, are inhibited with widely different rates and affinities ranging over 5 orders of magnitude. One is not inhibited at all under the experimental conditions. CrmA is quite selective in its ability to inhibit caspases, showing the highest affinity for interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and the second highest for the caspase FLICE (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.95 nM), identified as a component of the intracellular signaling complex recruited by ligation of the death receptor Fas. On the basis of comparative inhibitor kinetics, we propose that CrmA is unlikely to inhibit the caspases Yama, Mch2, or LAP3 <i>in vivo</i> but that its inhibition of FLICE is of a magnitude for this protease to be a key target of CrmA during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that FLICE catalyzes a crucial step in the promotion of cell death."

In cotransfection assays the two isoforms were activated to approximately the same extent by known PPARγ activators. Human PPARγ binds to DNA as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer was activated by both RXR agonists and antagonists and the addition of PPARγ ligands with retinoids resulted in greater than additive activation. Such heterodimer-selective modulators may have a role in the treatment of PPARγ/RXR-modulated diseases like diabetes. Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of PPARγ in skeletal muscle, and a sensitive RNase protection assay confirmed the presence of only PPARγ1 in muscle that was not solely due to fat contamination. However, both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 RNA were detected in fat, and the ratio of PPARγ1 to PPARγ2 RNA varied in different individuals. The presence of tissue-specific distribution of isoforms and the variable ratio of PPARγ1 to PPARγ2 raised the possibility that isoform expression may be modulated in disease states like non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, a third protected band was detected with fat RNA indicating the possible existence of a third human PPARγ isoform.

Formation of such a contiguous filament is stimulated by a ssDNA-binding protein. Here, the effects of replication protein A (RPA) on presynaptic complex formation and DNA strand exchange activities of Rad51 protein were examined. Presynaptic complex formation was assessed by measuring ATP hydrolysis. With ϕX174 ssDNA, the ATPase activity of Rad51 protein is stimulated ∼1.4-fold by RPA, provided that Rad51 protein is in excess of the ssDNA concentration; otherwise, RPA inhibits ATPase activity. In contrast, with ssDNA devoid of secondary structure (poly(dT), poly(dA), poly(dI), and etheno-M13 DNA), RPA does not stimulate the already elevated ATPase activity of Rad51 protein, but inhibits activity at low Rad51 protein concentrations. These results suggest that Rad51 protein and RPA exclude one another from ssDNA by competing for the same binding sites and that RPA exerts its effect on presynaptic complex formation by eliminating secondary structure to which Rad51 protein is bound nonproductively. DNA strand exchange catalyzed by Rad51 protein is also greatly stimulated by RPA. The optimal stoichiometry for stimulation is ∼20-30 nucleotides of ssDNA/RPA heterotrimer. The ssDNA-binding protein of Escherichia coli can substitute for RPA, showing that the role of RPA is not specific. We conclude that RPA affects both presynaptic complex formation and DNA strand exchange via changes in DNA structure, employing the same mechanism used by the ssDNA-binding protein to effect change in E. coli RecA protein activity.

https://openalex.org/W1977689971,"Activated macrophages play a critical role in controlling chronic tissue inflammation through the release of a variety of mediators including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, active lipids, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species. The mechanisms that regulate macrophage activation in chronic inflammation are poorly understood. A hallmark of chronic inflammation is the turnover of extracellular matrix components, and recent work has suggested that interactions with the extracellular matrix can exert important influences on macrophage effector functions. We have examined the effect of low molecular weight fragments of the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) on the induction of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages. We found that HA fragments induce iNOS mRNA, protein and activity alone, and markedly synergize with interferon-γ to induce iNOS gene expression in murine macrophages. In addition, we found that resident tissue alveolar macrophages respond minimally, but inflammatory alveolar macrophages exhibit a marked induction in iNOS expression in response to HA fragments. Finally, we demonstrate that the mechanism of HA fragment-induced expression of iNOS requires activation of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor κB. These data support the hypothesis that HA may be an important regulator of macrophage activation at sites of chronic tissue inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2147042017,"Compartmentalization of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is achieved in part by interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). All of the anchoring proteins identified previously target the kinase by tethering the type II regulatory subunit. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel anchoring protein, D-AKAP1, that interacts with the N terminus of both type I and type II regulatory subunits. A novel cDNA encoding a 125-amino acid fragment of D-AKAP1 was isolated from a two-hybrid screen and shown to interact specifically with the type I regulatory subunit. Although a single message of 3.8 kilobase pairs was detected for D-AKAP1 in all embryonic stages and in most adult tissues, cDNA cloning revealed the possibility of at least four splice variants. All four isoforms contain a core of 526 amino acids, which includes the R binding fragment, and may be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. This core sequence was homologous to S-AKAP84, including a mitochondrial signal sequence near the amino terminus (Lin, R. Y., Moss, S. B., and Rubin, C. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27804-27811). D-AKAP1 and the type I regulatory subunit appeared to have overlapping expression patterns in muscle and olfactory epithelium by in situ hybridization.

Although PKA is a multifunctional enzyme with a broad substrate specificity, activation of this kinase permits preferential phosphorylation of specific target substrates (1Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of membrane-bound ion channels modulates the flow of ions into the cell (2Keller B.U. Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Konnerth A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of CREB, a nuclear transcription factor, alters the expression of cAMP-responsive genes (3Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). While the importance of PKA in regulating many cellular processes has long been apparent, the potential importance of compartmentalization for the function and regulation of PKA has only recently been recognized. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-kinase anchoring protein cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit type Iα type IIα polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline. In the absence of its activating ligand, cAMP, PKA exists as an inactive holoenzyme of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. The two classes of R subunits, RI and RII, based on their elution from the DEAE cellulose (4Reimann E.M. Walsh D.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1986-1995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), define the two types of holoenzymes. A significant proportion of the type II holoenzyme associates with the particulate fraction of cell homogenates, while the type I holoenzyme appears to be mostly cytoplasmic (5Deviller P. Vallier P. Bata J. Saez J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 38: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Following an increase in intracellular cAMP, the R subunits bind cAMP, resulting in the dissociation of the holoenzyme and the release of free active C subunits. The free C subunit can then either phosphorylate cytoplasmic substrates or translocate into the nucleus by passive diffusion and phosphorylate nuclear substrates (6Wen W. Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Feramisco J. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32214-32220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the C subunit migrating between compartments, the holoenzyme itself can be anchored to specific sites via interactions of its regulatory subunits with specific anchoring proteins. This may allow for activation of localized pools of the kinase (7Scott J.D. Carr D.W. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 143-148Google Scholar, 8Harper J.F. Haddox M.K. Johanson R. Hanley R.M. Steiner A.L. Vitam. Horm. 1985; 42: 197-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both classes of R subunits contain two tandem cAMP binding sites at the carboxyl terminus that account for approximately two-thirds of the protein. Both R subunits also contain a site that mimics a substrate or inhibitor and lies in the active site cleft of the C subunit in the holoenzyme complex. RI contains a pseudosubstrate site, while RII contains a phosphorylatable substrate site at this region. The N terminus of each R subunit contains a very stable dimerization domain. This domain, which is the region of the least sequence identity between the two R subunits, is thought to be responsible for interaction with the anchoring proteins (9Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several AKAPs (A-kinase anchoring proteins) have been characterized, and all bind specifically with very high affinity to the type II regulatory subunit (RII) (1Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that anchoring proteins may also act as adapters for assembling multiprotein complexes. For example, Scott and co-workers (11Coghlan V. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.H. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 12Klanck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) showed that AKAP79, in addition to binding tightly to RII, also interacts with the calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) and protein kinase C. Targeting AKAP79 to neuronal postsynaptic densities would therefore bring enzymes with opposite catalytic activities together in a single transduction complex. This adds another level of intracellular organization for PKA and also facilitates the diversity of the cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathway (13Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In most cells, the type I holoenzyme appears not to be anchored and is typically cytoplasmic; however, there are cases where RI is compartmentalized. For example, RI subunits in human erythrocytes are tightly bound to the plasma membrane (14Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6135-6139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type I holoenzyme is also depleted from the cytoplasm and accumulates at the “cap” site of lymphocytes when stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies (15Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of a potential dual specificity protein kinase A anchoring protein, D-AKAP1, which binds to both the RI and the RII subunits of PKA. All vectors for the yeast two-hybrid system were from Dr. Stan Hollenberg (Vollum Institute). The following reagents were purchased as indicated: mouse 16-day embryonic cDNA library in λEXlox vector (Novagen); mouse multiple tissue northern blot and mouse embryonic Northern blot (Clontech); Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); Genius labeling system (Boehringer Mannheim); Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad); ECL kit (Amersham Corp.); ATP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, Triton X-100, and GST-agarose resin (Sigma); SSC buffer (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO); nickel-NTA resin (Qiagen); 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside and enzymes used for DNA manipulations (Life Technologies, Inc.); and the DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Antibodies were generated in female rabbits at Cocalico Corp. All oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Peptide and Oligonucleotide Facility at the University of California, San Diego. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to Vojtek et al. (16Vojtek A.B. Hollenburg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA coding for the Ret/ptc2 oncogene, which consists of the N-terminal two-thirds of RIα fused to the c-Ret tyrosine kinase domain (17Luo Z. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into the pBTM116 LexA fusion vector. L40 yeast transformed with this construct was used to screen an embryonic mouse random-primed cDNA library (18Durick K. Wu R.Y. Gill G.N. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12691-12694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). From approximately 2 million transformants, 10 survived nutritional selection and were β-galactosidase-positive specifically for the RI portion of Ret/ptc2. The library plasmids from these co-transformants were isolated, and cDNA sequences were determined by the procedure of Sanger et al. (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Two of these encoded fragments of RIα corresponding to residues 12-120 and 17-117. Four of the remaining eight contained an identical cDNA, coding for a protein fragment designated RPP7. To determine whether the protein coded for by RPP7 binds to RI in vitro, the RPP7 cDNA was subcloned from the pVP16 plasmid into both pGEX-KG, to make a GST fusion protein, and into pRSETb-NotI, to make a polyhistidine fusion protein. pRSETb-NotI was constructed by ligating a linker containing a NotI site into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pRSETb. These RPP7 fusion proteins, designated GST-RPP7 and His6RPP7, respectively, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) at 37°C and purified to near homogeneity using either glutathione resin for GST-RPP7, as described previously (20Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), or nickel-NTA resin for His6RPP7. In short, bacterial cell lysates containing His6RPP7 were incubated with nickel-NTA resin in PBS (10 mM potassium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM benzamidine, and 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol at 4°C for 1 h and then washed with the same buffer with 5 mM imidazole to remove nonspecific proteins. His6-RPP7 was then eluted from the resin with PBS containing 100 mM imidazole. The BL21(DE3) cell strain was a gift from Bill Studier (Brookhaven National Laboratories). RI was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified on a DE52 ion exchange column (21Saraswat L.D. Filutowics M. Taylor S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). His6RII and His6RI(Δ63-379) were purified on nickel-NTA resin as described previously. RII(Δ46-400) was expressed and purified as a polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein. After removing the polyhistidine tag with factor X (22Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the R subunit was further purified to homogeneity by gel filtration using Sephedex 75. Bacterial cell lysates containing GST-RPP7 were incubated with glutathione resin for 2 h. at 4°C in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, and 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and then washed extensively with the same buffer. Full-length and deletion mutants (100-200 μg) of RI and/or RII were added to the resin and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. After washing the resin extensively with PBS, proteins associated with the GST-RPP7 were eluted by boiling in SDS gel-loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All electrophoresis was performed using Mini-Protean II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE reagents were prepared according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Staining. Blots containing 2 μg of immobilized samples of mRNAs from selected adult tissues or total mRNA at different embryonic stages were probed with 32P-radiolabeled RPP7 cDNA. Nitrocellulose filters were prehybridized in 5 × SSC (750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's reagent (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.1% acetylated bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, and 50% formamide for 6 h at 42°C and then hybridized to 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml of denatured radiolabeled cDNA probe in the same buffer. Hybridization was performed at 42°C for 16 h, and nonhybridized probe was removed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C. Hybridizing mRNA signals were detected by autoradiography. A 16-day mouse embryonic cDNA library in vector λEXlox was screened with 32P-labeled RPP7 cDNA. The cDNA fragment RPP7 was excised from the two-hybrid library plasmid pVP16, using the NotI restriction endonuclease, and purified on agarose gel. This purified cDNA was then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random prime labeling. Approximately 1.6 million plaques were screened, and positive clones were plaque-purified. Positive phage clones were converted into plasmids by infection of hosts expressing the P1 cre recombinase, which recognizes the loxP site on the λEXlox vectors and forms the plasmids by site-specific recombination. Plasmids were isolated, and the cDNA inserts were then subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pBluescriptII KS(+). DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis revealed three cDNA sequences, including one 5ʹ sequence and two 3ʹ sequences after composition. These cDNAs all had identical overlapping DNA sequences and were designated N1 splice, C1 splice, and C2 splice, respectively. The 5ʹ 545 base pairs of the 5ʹ clone, corresponding to DNA sequence 5-549 of the N1 splice, were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction and used as a probe to screen the same library. This round of screening yielded a novel 5ʹ sequence with the proper Kozak start site and an upstream stop codon, designated N0 splice. The composite cDNA sequences revealed the possibility of four isoforms, and the deduced amino acid sequences were named D-AKAP1a, D-AKAP1b, D-AKAP1c, and D-AKAP1d, respectively, as will be discussed later (Fig. 4). All sequences were analyzed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software and the BLAST program provided by the NCBI server at the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. To prepare antibodies against purified His6RPP7, the protein was expressed and purified on NTA resin to near homogeneity and then run on an SDS-PAGE gel. Fusion protein was then excised from SDS-PAGE and used as the antigen. The subsequent preparation of rabbit antibodies was carried out at Cocalico Biological Co. according to established procedures. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against His6RPP7 were obtained from 4 ml of serum on a 1-ml Affi-Gel 15 antigen column (10 mg/ml resin). Proteins from different mouse tissues were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked overnight in 5% powdered non-fat milk and then incubated with affinity-purified His6RPP7 antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution. After extensive washing with TTBS buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.5), D-AKAP1 was visualized by 1:10,000 dilution alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies or enhanced chemiluminescence with a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. RNA probes of D-AKAP1 were derived from cDNA sequence 523-3514 of isoform D-AKAP1d. RIα probes were derived from residues 18-169. These cDNA fragments were first subcloned into pBluescriptII KS(+), and digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were transcribed in the sense and antisense orientations following template linearization. Probe synthesis employed the Genius labeling system, and hybridization was carried out on 20-μm cryostat sections of embryonic day 16 Balb/c mice as described previously by Chun et al. (24Chun J.M. Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Jaenisch R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 189-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Hybridized probe was visualized by alkaline phosphatase histochemistry. A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to isolate proteins that associate with the Ret/ptc2 oncoprotein, where the C-terminal domain of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase is fused to the N terminus of the RIα subunit of PKA (17Luo Z. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ret/ptc2 begins with the first 235 amino acids of RIα, which include the dimerization domain, the C subunit inhibitor site, and most of the first cAMP binding domain. Using Ret/ptc2 to screen a mouse embryonic cDNA library, several interacting clones were isolated (18Durick K. Wu R.Y. Gill G.N. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12691-12694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Eight of these cDNA clones coded for three novel protein fragments, designated RPP7, RPP8, and RPP9, that associated specifically with the RI portion of Ret/ptc2. Four of the clones coded for the same protein, RPP7, which was 125 residues in length. To determine whether RPP7 bound RI in vitro, RPP7 was expressed as a fusion protein to GST in E. coli from a pGEX vector containing GST fused to the RPP7 cDNA. GST-RPP7 was then expressed and tested for its ability to bind RI in an affinity precipitation assay. The expressed protein had an apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE of 40 kDa, consistent with a protein of 13 kDa fused to GST. GST-RPP7 was fully soluble. Cell lysates containing either GST or GST-RPP7 were incubated with glutathione resin. Bacterially expressed RI was then added. Proteins associated with the resin after stringent washing were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. As seen in Fig. 1, this construct codes for a stable protein that can specifically pull down nearly stoichiometric amounts of RI. GST alone does not interact with RI. These results confirmed the results of the two-hybrid screen and established furthermore that no other factors are required for the interaction between RI and RPP7 in vitro and in vivo AKAPs identified until now have all bound specifically to the type II regulatory subunit. We therefore tested whether RPP7 could bind to RII. As seen in Fig. 2A, RPP7 also interacted with His6RII in the assay. Thus, in contrast to other AKAPs described so far, RPP7 is the first member of this family demonstrated to bind both RI and RII with high affinity. For this reason, we designate RPP7 as an active fragment of D-AKAP1, for dual specificityAKAP1. To localize more precisely the RPP7 binding site on RI, a series of deletion mutants, summarized in Fig. 3, were used. As seen in Fig. 2B, GST-RPP7 associated with His6RI(Δ63-379), which contains only the first 62 residues of RI. In contrast, RI(Δ1-91), which lacks the N-terminal 91 residues of RI, was not precipitated with GST-RPP7 (data not shown). Most AKAPs have been shown to specifically bind the N terminus of RII (17Luo Z. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Scott J.D. Stofko R.E. McDonald J.R. Comer J.D. Vitalis E.A. Mangili J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether RPP7 also bound to the N terminus of RII, several deletion mutants of RII were tested for their ability to bind GST-RPP7. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-RPP7 interacted with RII(Δ46-400), a construct containing only the N-terminal 45 residues of RII. GST alone does not interact with any of the R subunits we have tested. Thus, the N terminus of RI or RII is sufficient for the interaction with D-AKAP1. To further characterize the interaction between the two types of R subunits and RPP7, competition experiments were performed. When assayed individually, a nearly stoichiometric amount of RI or RII was pulled down by GST-RPP7 based on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A); however, when incubated with both R subunits, GST-RPP7 preferentially bound RII. As shown in Fig. 4, when an equal molar ratio of either full-length RI and His6RII or His6RI(Δ63-379) and RII(Δ46-400) were added in the assay, GST-RPP7 preferentially bound to the two RII subunit constructs. These results indicate that the binding regions of RI and RII on D-AKAP1 are partially, if not completely, overlapping. More detailed mapping of the binding sites on RI, RII, and D-AKAP1 is now under way. Preliminary results using surface plasmon resonance indicated that the affinity between RI and GST-RPP7 is at most 25-fold lower than that for RII and GST-RPP7 (data not shown). To investigate the tissue and developmental expression patterns of D-AKAP1, Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from different adult mouse tissues or different embryonic stages were probed with 32P-labeled RPP7 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 5A, a 3.8-kb mRNA was detected in all tissues except the spleen. D-AKAP1 mRNA expression is highest in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In addition, a strong signal at 3.2 kb was detected only in the testis sample. The 3.8 kb transcript was detected in all embryonic stages with comparable intensity (Fig. 5B), indicating that the mRNA expression level in the embryo was the same throughout different developmental stages. The 3.2-kb mRNA was not detected in the embryonic samples. Since RPP7 was isolated from a mouse embryonic library, the 3.8-kb signal was predicted to represent the full-length message for D-AKAP1. To obtain a full-length clone of D-AKAP1, a mouse embryonic cDNA library was screened using RPP7 cDNA as a probe. After radiolabeling of the RPP7 probe, 13 positive clones containing overlapping partial cDNA sequences were isolated from approximately 1.6 million recombinants. After sequence analysis, three cDNA inserts were identified. These included two, designated C1 and C2, that differed only in their 3ʹ region, and a third, designated N1, in which the 3ʹ end overlapped with the 5ʹ ends of C1 and C2. Both C1 and C2 have identical 5ʹ sequences of 1581 base pairs but different 3ʹ termini. N1 has additional 5ʹ sequence including a consensus Kozak start site (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). The 5ʹ end of N1 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction to generate an additional probe to rescreen the library. Three positive clones were identified and sequenced, and they yielded 810 base pairs of a novel 5ʹ sequence, N0, containing a consensus Kozak sequence and an in-frame stop codon 60 base pairs upstream. This precluded the possibility of using an alternative ATG further upstream. Sequence analysis of these cDNAs revealed a core open reading frame of 526 residues. RPP7 is included within this protein and corresponds to amino acid residues 284-408 in the core sequence (Fig. 6). In addition to this core, cDNAs coding for two N-terminal and two C-terminal splice variants were discovered (Fig. 7). At the 5ʹ end, one splice generated a message coding for 33 residues before the core, designated isoform N1. These additional 33 amino acids include a potential myristoylation site and a potential PKA phosphorylation site. N1 begins its coding region with its first ATG, because the 5ʹ sequence of N1 did not contain another Kozak sequence. The other 5ʹ variant, designated N0, has an in-frame stop codon upstream from its start site, which corresponds to the start site of the core. The two 3ʹ variants, designated C1 and C2, had an additional 18 or 331 residues 3ʹ from the core open reading frame. Therefore, although the mRNA for D-AKAP1 appeared as a single species of 3.8 kb in mouse embryo by Northern analysis, cDNA cloning has identified at least four isoforms, designated as D-AKAP1a, D-AKAP1b, D-AKAP1c, and D-AKAP1d. These potential isoforms contain 544, 577, 857, and 890 amino acid residues, respectively.Fig. 7Schematic representation of the various isoforms of D-AKAP1. Four different splice forms, designated N0, N1, C1, and C2, were discovered in the cDNA screening process. With these splice forms, D-AKAP1 can have as many as four isoforms. Numbers in parenthesis are the total expected amino acid residues for each isoform. RPP7, corresponding to residues 284-408 of the core, is highlighted The N terminus of the N1 splice is a potential myristoylation site, and a potential PKA phosphorylation site (RRCSY) is underlined on the sequence.

This antibody recognized both His6RPP7 and GST-RPP7 specifically in crude cell lysates, as shown in Fig. 8A Proteins were extracted from different mouse tissues, separated on SDS-PAGE gel, Western blotted, and probed with the antibody. As seen in Fig. 8B, two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 86 and 57 kDa were detected in the brain extract, a 64-kDa protein was detected in the muscle extract, and a doublet of 132 kDa was detected in the liver sample. Since the message of D-AKAP1 was not found in the spleen in the Northern analysis, extracts from the spleen were used as a negative control. These bands were not detected in the spleen and, therefore, were predicted to represent D-AKAP1 proteins in the tissue samples. In addition, preincubation of the antigen with the antibody abolished these bands, suggesting that the signal is specific for D-AKAP1. The existence of different protein isoforms of D-AKAP1 is consistent with the identification of various cDNA splice variants. The sizes of 132 and 86 kDa were confirmed by in vitro translation of the cDNAs coding for the C1 and C2 splice isoforms of D-AKAP1 (data not shown). In the tissue extracts and also the in vitro translation, the apparent molecular masses were higher than the calculated ones. This discrepancy has also been observed for many other AKAPs (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar, 28Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for each isoform are currently being raised to further establish whether the isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. To determine the expression pattern of D-AKAP1 in comparison with RI, in situ hybridization was performed using probes for both D-AKAP1 and RI in whole embryonic day 16 mouse embryo sections. Riboprobes were derived from the C2 splice of D-AKAP1. Expression was most prominent in brown fat surrounding the trapezius muscle. Other skeletal muscle, intestine, olfactory epithelium, and numerous regions of the central nervous system (CNS) also showed a significant hybridization signal (Fig. 9A).

In the present study, hsp90 and p23 are shown to form a complex that requires elevated temperature and ATP/Mg2+. Complex formation is strongly promoted by molybdate and by the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40. ADP and the benzoquinone ansamycin, geldanamycin, are potent inhibitors of complex formation. The ATP-dependent process alters the state of hsp90, not p23, and influences the ability of hsp90 to bind to phenyl-Sepharose. Conversion of hsp90 to the ATP-bound state lowers its affinity for phenyl-Sepharose. These results show that hsp90 can exist in at least two functional states, one able to bind p23 and the other with a high affinity for hydrophobic resins. A model is presented where these states are dictated by the binding of either ATP or ADP."

However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms by which IL-1β induces iNOS and Cox-2 expression is obscure. Our current studies demonstrate that IL-1β produces a rapid increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and activation. Serum starvation and SC68376, a drug which selectively inhibits p38 MAPK in mesangial cells, were used to investigate whether p38 MAPK contributes to the signaling mechanism of IL-1β induction of NO and PG synthesis. Serum starvation and SC68376 selectively inhibited IL-1β-induced activation of p38 MAPK. Both SC68376 and serum starvation enhanced NO biosynthesis by increasing iNOS mRNA expression, protein expression, and nitrite production. In contrast, both SC68376 and serum starvation suppressed PG release by inhibiting Cox-2 mRNA, protein expression, and PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis. These data demonstrate that IL-1β phosphorylates and activates p38 MAPK in mesangial cells. The activation of p38 MAPK may provide a crucial signaling mechanism, which mediates the up-regulation of PG synthesis and the down-regulation of NO biosynthesis induced by IL-1β."

https://openalex.org/W2003590725,"In adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II (Ang II) and potassium stimulate aldosterone synthesis through activation of the calcium messenger system. The rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis is the transfer of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This transfer is believed to depend upon the presence of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. The aim of this study was 1) to examine the effect of changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration and of Ang II on intramitochondrial cholesterol and 2) to study the distribution of StAR protein in submitochondrial fractions during activation by Ca2+ and Ang II. To this end, freshly prepared bovine zona glomerulosa cells were submitted to a high cytosolic Ca2+ clamp (600 nM) or stimulated with Ang II (10 nM) for 2 h. Mitochondria were isolated and subfractionated into outer membranes, inner membranes (IM), and contact sites (CS). Stimulation of intact cells with Ca2+ or Ang II led to a marked, cycloheximide-sensitive increase in cholesterol in CS (to 143 ± 3.2 and 151.1 ± 18.1% of controls, respectively) and in IM (to 119 ± 5.1 and 124.5 ± 6.5% of controls, respectively). Western blot analysis revealed a cycloheximide-sensitive increase in StAR protein in mitochondrial extracts of Ca2+-clamped glomerulosa cells (to 159 ± 23% of controls). In submitochondrial fractions, there was a selective accumulation of StAR protein in IM following stimulation with Ca2+ (228 ± 50%). Similarly, Ang II increased StAR protein in IM, and this effect was prevented by cycloheximide. In contrast, neither Ca2+ nor Ang II had any effect on the submitochondrial distribution of cytochrome P450scc and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerase. The intramitochondrial presence of the latter enzyme was further confirmed by immunogold staining in rat adrenal fasciculata cells and by immunoblot analysis in MA-10 mouse testicular Leydig cells. These findings demonstrate that under acute stimulation with Ca2+-mobilizing agents, newly synthesized StAR protein accumulates in IM after transiting through CS. Moreover, our results suggest that the import of StAR protein into IM may be associated with cholesterol transfer, thus promoting precursor supply to the two first enzymes of the steroidogenic cascade within the mitochondria and thereby activating mineralocorticoid synthesis.

Insulin resistance manifests itself in two pathophysiological disease states, non-insulin-dependent diabetes and obesity. In both of these conditions, adipocytes become desensitized to the biological effects of insulin, which is reflected in a reduction of the efficacy of insulin to stimulate glucose transport. This cell type contains two isoforms of a family of proteins that facilitate transport of glucose across the plasma membrane: GLUT1, the constitutive glucose transporter and GLUT4, the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter. Both of these proteins are integral membrane proteins, which share about 40% sequence identity and have a similar predicted secondary structure. 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been used extensively to study the regulation of these transporters.

S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This level of insulin is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than physiological (circulating) insulin in humans (10Olefsky J.M.

No comparable dose-response studies have examined the development of insulin-resistant glucose transport activity or GLUT4 expression in these cells. We describe a procedure that has allowed us to measure glucose transport after chronic exposure to physiological concentrations of insulin. Under these conditions, we show that the concentration of insulin required for 50% desensitization of glucose transport activity was 100 pM. Maximal desensitization in the presence of 10 nM insulin was complete within 8 h. In agreement with Marshall and colleagues (11Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Traxinger R.R.

Correlated to the loss in activity was the loss in GLUT4 expression. A 50% decrease in GLUT4 led to a 50% decrease in translocation. GLUT4 mRNA also declined, but the ED50 was approximately 5 nM. These data suggest that post-translational loss of GLUT4 protein likely underlies the cause of desensitization.

Cells were grown and differentiated following the procedure of Frost and Lane (15Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

For kinetic experiments, cells were refed at time 0 with DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum containing the appropriate insulin concentration as indicated in the figure legends. To define the insulin-dependent dose response, the medium was changed every 2 h to maintain extracellular insulin levels, as 3T3-L1 adipocytes exhibit substantial “insulinase” activity. 2R. Risch and S. C. Frost, unpublished data.To remove insulin prior to the transport assay or translocation analysis, cells were washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRP) containing 5 mM glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin as depicted in Fig. 1. Glucose transport activity was measured as described previously (15Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the difference in the dose response to acute insulin after chronic insulin treatment (Fig. 1C), 0.1% defatted bovine serum albumin was included in the assay buffer to maintain the lower concentrations of insulin in solution. Plasma membrane (PM), high density membrane (HDM), and low density membrane (LDM) fractions were isolated by a modification (16Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of a technique described by Weber et al. (17Weber T.M. Joost H. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. Kahn R.C. Harrison L.C. Receptor Biochemistry and Methodology (The Insulin Receptor). Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 171-187Google Scholar). Briefly, control or insulin-treated cells were scraped into TES (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 250 mM sucrose) at 18°C. The cells were passed over a tungsten ball 10 times in a steel block homogenizer (at 4°C) with a clearance of 0.0025 inch. A crude plasma membrane fraction was collected at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Purified membranes were collected from this fraction by sucrose gradient centrifugation (17Weber T.M. Joost H.

Alternatively, a total membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation of the homogenate at 212,000 × g for 70 min. Membrane fractions were stored in TES at −20°C. Protein was determined by the method of Markwell et al (18Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Lieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of membrane protein were mixed with Laemmli sample dilution buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 6 M urea and 10%β-mercaptoethanol before separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose as described previously (20Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of GLUT1 and GLUT4 utilized antibody dilutions of 1:500 using the enhanced chemiluminescence system as described previously (20Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands were quantitated by video densitometry on a Visage bioscan (Millipore) in the linear range of the film and peroxidase reaction. RNA isolation and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (20Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA were loaded onto a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were probed with cDNAs for GLUT1 and GLUT4 (generously provided by Dr. Maureen Charron, Albert Einstein). The results were quantitated by video densitometry in the linear range of the film. To validate 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model for analyzing insulin resistance, it was imperative to reestablish basal transport after chronic insulin treatment. To this end, we first treated cells with either 10 nM or 1 μM insulin for 12 h, a time frame defined in isolated rat adipocytes as sufficient to complete the desensitization process (11Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then washed the cells in KRP containing 5 mM glucose and 0.1% defatted bovine serum albumin at 20-min intervals over a 140-min time course. At specific times during this washout period, cells were rinsed in glucose-free KRP to assess transport activity in a 2-min pulse. Fig. 1A shows the comparison between control cells (washed in an identical manner) and those treated chronically with either 1 μM or 10 nM insulin. Cells treated chronically with 1 μM insulin showed significantly elevated transport at the start of the washout (time 0) but never achieved basal values over time despite the extensive washing. In contrast, cells treated with 10 nM insulin returned to basal values within 60 min of the initial removal of insulin. These latter cells when subsequently rechallenged with 1 μM insulin (after the 60-min wash) showed a 50% reduction in the rate of glucose transport in comparison with control cells (Fig. 1B). In addition to the decreased rate, the cells were less sensitive to insulin in that the dose response to acute insulin challenge was shifted to the right by an order of magnitude (Fig. 1C). As far as we know, this is the first demonstration of insulin-resistant glucose transport activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes because of the ability to reinitiate stimulation from a “true” basal state. To determine if physiological insulin could establish the insulin-resistant state, we exposed cells to specific concentrations of insulin for 12 h. We refed cells every 2 h to maintain the extracellular insulin levels, particularly important at the lower concentrations of insulin. As shown in Fig. 2A, the concentration of insulin that elicits a 50% reduction in insulin-sensitive glucose transport was approximately 100 pM. This is extremely interesting because the fasting level of insulin in non-diabetic humans is about 40 pM while that in the obese individuals is about 70 pM and in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes is about 200 pM (21Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Hancock J.A. Golichowski A.M. Baron A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 465-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin as low as 1 nM was sufficient to completely desensitize the transport system. At 10 nM, maximal desensitization was achieved whether the cells were refed every 2 h or not. Thus, we chose a concentration of 10 nM to examine the time required for the development of insulin resistance. As shown in Fig. 2B, the phenomenon of densensitization was completely established within 8 h of the initial exposure to insulin. This result is similar to that described in isolated adipocytes (12Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Marshall and his colleagues (11Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20910-20916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown in a series of elegant experiments the requirement of glucose and glutamine, as well as insulin, for the expression of insulin resistance in isolated rat adipocytes implicating the N-acetylglucosamine biosynthetic pathway in this phenomenon. To test if the same is true in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we performed similar experiments. One complication in our experiments that was not encountered in isolated adipocytes is the time-dependent activation of glucose transport activity in the absence of glucose (20Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22van Putten J.P.M. Krans H.M.J. J. Biol.

We hypothesize that this difference between rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes results from higher glycogen stores in the former (25Froesch E.R. Burgi H. Bally P. Labhart A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1965; 1: 280-296PubMed Google Scholar, 26Frayn K.N. Coppack S.W. Humphreys S.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) compared with 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14McMahon R.J. Frost S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 1996: E640-E645Google Scholar), which might provide a metabolic buffer from external glucose deprivation. We therefore minimized the time that cells were exposed to glucose-free medium but suffered in that only 75% of maximal desensitization was achieved in these experiments. Importantly, though, the basal rates of transport were not affected such that true resistance could be evaluated. Fig. 3 shows that in the absence of glucose, insulin was unable to induce desensitization. Either glucose (in the presence of glutamine, Fig. 3A) or glucosamine (in the absence of both glucose and glutamine, Fig. 3B) provided appropriate substrate for the development of the insulin-resistant state. A total membrane fraction revealed that insulin-resistant cells (i.e. cells exposed to 10 nM insulin for 12 h) expressed 2.4-fold less GLUT4 than control cells while GLUT1 increased by 2.2 (data not shown). To examine the distribution of these changes, we took advantage of a membrane isolation technique recently developed in our laboratory (16Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the distribution of GLUT4 and GLUT1 among three membrane fractions (PM, LDM, and HDM) in control and insulin-resistant cells. Each set went through the washout procedure prior to membrane fractionation. Control cells, which were stimulated acutely with 1 μM insulin, showed redistribution of both GLUT4 and GLUT1; GLUT4 increased by about 6-fold in the PM (Fig. 4, A and B) while GLUT1 increased by about 2-fold (Fig. 4, C and D). These data are similar to those that analyzed translocation using the cell surface photolabel, ATB[2-3H]BMPA (2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine) (27Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11726-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells chronically exposed to insulin (followed by washout) showed levels of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane about equal to that of controls (Fig. 4, A and B). However, upon acute insulin challenge, translocation was reduced by about 50% compared with controls, which correlates with the loss of insulin-sensitive glucose transport activity. Cells chronically exposed to 10 nM insulin showed a 2-fold increase in the level of GLUT1 in the PM after washout compared with controls (Fig. 4, C and D), despite the equivalent rates of glucose transport. Acute insulin challenge stimulated translocation but to a much more limited degree than in control cells. As the LDM fraction reflects the loss of GLUT4, we used this fraction to examine the dose-dependent loss in cells chronically treated with specific concentrations of insulin. As shown in Fig. 5A, the level of GLUT4 decreased over time in response to increasing insulin. The dose dependence of this down-regulation (Fig. 5B) was similar to that of insulin-resistant glucose transport (see Fig. 2A). Based on the observation that glucose deprivation prevented the loss in insulin sensitivity (see Fig. 3A), we examined the expression of GLUT4 in the LDM fraction of cells exposed to glucose-free medium. Fig. 6 shows that glucose deprivation blocks the loss of GLUT4 in chronically treated cells. Thus we show for the first time that glucose is important in regulating the expression of GLUT4 in response to chronic insulin. To evaluate the underlying mechanism of the reduction in GLUT4 protein, we measured the level of GLUT4 mRNA after exposure to specific concentrations of insulin. As shown in Fig. 7A, the level of GLUT4 decreases with increasing insulin concentration. However, the concentration of insulin required to elicit a 50% loss of GLUT4 mRNA was about 5 nM (Fig. 7B), which is 15 times greater than that required for equivalent loss of insulin-sensitive glucose transport activity or GLUT4 expression. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that 3T3-L1 adipocytes can serve as a model for studying the development of insulin resistance under conditions that might be realized in a physiological setting. Support for this hypothesis has been gained from the following observations. Chronic exposure to physiological levels of insulin decreased the ability of an insulin challenge to stimulate glucose transport. Interestingly, postprandial concentrations of insulin in normal, obese, and diabetic humans (21Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Hancock J.A. Golichowski A.M. Baron A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 465-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plot along the inflection in the dose-response curve between no change in insulin responsiveness and that of maximal resistance. Thus, we have shown for the first time that 3T3-L1 adipocytes develop insulin resistance in response to physiologically relevant concentrations of insulin. We have extended previous work by demonstrating that insulin challenge of resistant cells promotes translocation, although the extent of recruitment is suppressed relative to controls due to the reduction in the total expression of GLUT4. Second, we have shown that glucose deprivation, which prevents the development of insulin-resistant glucose transport, also prevents the loss in GLUT4. Together, these data suggest that the loss of GLUT4 protein underlies the inability of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to respond to insulin after chronic exposure. This mimics the clinical manifestation of human obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes where loss of GLUT4 protein has been observed in adipose tissue (28Garvey W.T. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 396-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although not muscle (29Pedersen O. Bak J.F. Andersen P.H. Lund S. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 865-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that transporter expression differs in adipose tissue relative to 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In isolated rat adipocytes, GLUT4 represents 97% of the GLUT transporter pool (30Oka Y. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Kasuga M. Kanazawa Y. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13432-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GLUT4 represents only 33% of the pool (6Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) indicating the substantially higher expression of GLUT1 relative to GLUT4 in this cell line. In control 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the PM fraction contains about 25% of the GLUT1 pool. Chronic insulin treatment increases the total pool of GLUT1, which in turn doubles the GLUT1 content of the PM fraction. Despite this 2-fold increase in GLUT1 in the PM of resistant cells, we observed no difference in “basal” transport activity (after washout) compared with controls. Resistant cells treated acutely with insulin show little additional change in GLUT1 in the PM. This argues that GLUT1 plays but a small role in insulin-resistant glucose transport. In contrast, only 3% of the GLUT4 pool resides in the PM of either control or resistant cells (again, after washout). When insulin is added acutely, GLUT4 content in the PM reveals significant translocation; resistant cells show 50% that of controls reflecting the difference in the total pool. To reiterate, this suggests that GLUT4 expression determines insulin resistance, even with the elevated levels of GLUT1 in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line. There are some differences between our data and those reported previously on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Flores-Riveros et al. (9Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that the concentration of insulin required to reduce GLUT4 mRNA was 23 nM in contrast to the value we calculated, which was about 5 nM, close to the Kd for the insulin receptor (31Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1980; 18: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This difference can be explained by our refeeding protocol during chronic insulin treatment to maintain the level of extracellular insulin, particularly important at low hormone concentration, in the face of extensive degradation by these cells. Our cells were exposed as well to insulin for only 12 h compared to the 24-h exposure in the Flores-Riveros study (9Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which further lessens the impact of insulin degradation. This temporal difference (24 versus 12 h of insulin treatment) also accounts for the smaller magnitude of the increase in GLUT1 and decrease in GLUT4 in our study relative to previous studies (9Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the down-regulation of GLUT4 mRNA occurs at insulin concentrations that are not likely to persist in the physiological state. These insulin concentrations also do not correlate with those required for the development of densensitization. Thus, GLUT4 expression appears to be regulated transcriptionally, but this regulation may not be relevant to insulin resistance. Other studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes have shown varying results in transporter protein expression. Tordjman et al. (33Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and Kozka et al. (27Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11726-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that chronic insulin treatment did not affect total GLUT4 protein expression while the studies of Flores-Riveros et al. (9Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Clancy and Czech (32Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed a marked decrease. These latter data along with ours are consistent with the accelerated turnover of GLUT4 in the presence of chronic insulin as measured by Sargeant and Paquet (34Sargeant R.J. Paquet M.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ricort et al. (35Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 42-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed a small decrease in the expression of GLUT4 but also very little translocation to the PM with acute insulin stimulation. These authors interpreted their data to mean that GLUT4 translocation was blocked, which clearly differs from our studies. Kozka et al. (27Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11726-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) interpreted their cell surface ligand binding experiments similarly, even though they demonstrated a 50% reduction in cell surface GLUT4, which would agree with our studies. We can, of course, only speculate as to the cause for the different results. In both of these latter studies, the loss in the GLUT4 pool was determined by analyzing homogenate protein, revealing only modest changes in expression. As the translocatable GLUT4 resides in the LDM fraction, it may be that the loss was substantially underestimated as pharmacological concentrations of insulin were used to induce resistance. Neither study separated the LDM fraction from the HDM fraction; thus we cannot evaluate this possibility. Finally, it is important to point out that our experiments are the first to show that basal transport activity can be achieved after chronic insulin treatment, which allowed us to evaluate true insulin resistance. Data collected under these conditions are consistent with the hypothesis that the onset of insulin resistance (i.e. depressed insulin-sensitive glucose transport) is a reflection of the reduced GLUT4 pool, not a defect in translocation."

We isolated a cDNA that encodes a 50-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase with an expression cloning method using 32P-labeled insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This 50-kDa protein contains two SH2 domains and an inter-SH2 domain of p85α, but the SH3 and bcr homology domains of p85α were replaced by a unique 6-amino acid sequence. Thus, this protein appears to be generated by alternative splicing of the p85α gene product. We suggest that this protein be called p50α. Northern blotting using a specific DNA probe corresponding to p50α revealed 6.0- and 2.8-kb bands in hepatic, brain, and renal tissues. The expression of p50α protein and its associated PI 3-kinase were detected in lysates prepared from the liver, brain, and muscle using a specific antibody against p50α. Taken together, these observations indicate that the p85α gene actually generates three protein products of 85, 55, and 50 kDa. The distributions of the three proteins (p85α, p55α, and p50α), in various rat tissues and also in various brain compartments, were found to be different. Interestingly, p50α forms a heterodimer with p110 that can as well as cannot be labeled with wortmannin, whereas p85α and p55α associate only with p110 that can be wortmannin-labeled. Furthermore, p50α exhibits a markedly higher capacity for activation of associated PI 3-kinase via insulin stimulation and has a higher affinity for tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 than the other isoforms. Considering the high level of p50α expression in the liver and its marked responsiveness to insulin, p50α appears to play an important role in the activation of hepatic PI 3-kinase.

In nontransformed human embryonic fibroblasts, inhibition of DNA methylation with 5-azadeoxycytidine induced a greater than 4-fold increase in transcription from potentially functional L1 elements without increasing the transcription level of the majority of degenerate elements, implicating hypermethylation in the repression of L1 activity. Using bisulfite genomic sequencing to assess the pattern of methylation in a subset of nondegenerate L1 elements, we found 29 sites within a 460-base pair region of the noncoding (top) DNA strand of the L1 promoter in which cytosine methylation was maintained with high efficiency. Of these, 25 were at CG dinucleotides and four were in non-CG sites. When the methylation sites were analyzed for the complementary (bottom) strand, the only highly conserved sites of methylation were in CG dinucleotides. Several of these sites of CG methylation in the bottom (coding) strand were at positions where top (noncoding) strand-derived sequences were unmethylated, suggesting that these sites might be maintained in a hemi-methylated state. Hence, there is a subset of human L1 elements in which methylation is efficiently maintained in asymmetric non-CG sites and further that this non-CG methylation may be part of a wider phenomenon involving hemi-methylation at CG dinucleotides. Maintenance of asymmetric methylation at non-CG sites (and possibly at hemi-methylated CG dinucleotides) could be through a novel DNA methyltransferase activity. Alternatively, the promoter region of L1 elements may be induced by factor binding to form some type of secondary structure that presents as a highly efficient substrate for de novo methylation.

Five to ten percent of the human genome is derived from one transposable element family, the L1 or LINE-1 family (1Hutchison III, C.A. Hardies S.C. Loeb D.D. Shehee W.R. Edgell M.H. Berg D.E.

Nondegenerate full-length mammalian L1 elements are some 6 kilobases in length and contain two evolutionarily conserved open reading frames, the second of which encodes a reverse transcriptase (8Hattori M.

The promoter responsible for the full-length L1 transcript has been shown to be located within the 5′ end of the element and downstream from the transcriptional start site (12Becker K.G. Swergold G.D. Ozato K. Thayer R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This promoter region also contains a strong binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factor, YY1, which has recently been shown to be the nuclear matrix-associated protein, NMP-1 (13Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast to regions normally associated with the nuclear matrix that are high in AT bases (14Cockerill P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the 5′ end of the human L1 element is an atypical CpG island in that it is very heavily methylated in DNA from both the human embryonic fibroblast culture used in the experiments reported here and in stimulated normal human peripheral lymphocytes in short term culture (15Woodcock D.M.

Williamson M.R. Woodcock D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It seems plausible that the hypermethylation of the L1 promoter region is a cellular response to repress a genetic element that could be potentially very damaging if actively transcribed. We were interested in (a) determining whether the hypermethylation of the promoter region of L1 elements might be involved in inactivating potentially functional elements and (b) determining the sequence specificity of this hypermethylation. To these ends, we have employed a sensitive RNase protection assay that allows the quantitation of transcription from a subset of nondegenerate, potentially functional elements in the presence of a high background of transcription from degenerate elements (17Woodcock D.M. Williamson M.R. Doherty J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this latter procedure, denatured genomic DNA is modified by reaction with bisulfite under conditions that convert all unmethylated cytosines to uracils (18Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S.

Nontransformed human embryonic fibroblast culture (HEF) and the human teratocarcinoma cell line Ntera2D1 cells were maintained as described previously (17Woodcock D.M. Williamson M.R. Doherty J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of demethylation on the levels of L1-specific RNAs, cultures of HEF and human teratocarcinoma Ntera2D1 cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium-α and treated with 5-azadC (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 μM, which was previously shown to almost totally inhibit post-replicative DNA methylation (20Woodcock D.M. Simmons D.L. Crowther P.J. Cooper I.A. Trainor K.J. Morley A.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 5-AzadC was added to the media when the cell monolayer was approximately 30-40% confluent and incubated at 37°C until the cultures reached 80-90% confluence. The media was changed every 24 h since 5-azadC has a limited t1/2 in aqueous media (21Cihak A. Vesely J. Hynie S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 2929-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted using the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl method (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Slot blot quantitation of total L1 transcription was performed by RNA immobilization on Bio-Rad Zetaprobe membrane followed by hybridization with 32P-labeled probe (23Linsenmeyer M.E. Jefferson S. Wolf M. Matthews J.P. Board P.G. Woodcock D.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RNase protection procedure for the detection of specific L1 transcripts was performed using published procedures (17Woodcock D.M. Williamson M.R. Doherty J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and hybridization signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. DNA from HEF cells was modified by bisulfite using standard procedures (18Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar), except that the modification reaction was performed at 55°C and was cycled up to 94°C for 5 min every 3 h for varying times ranging up to 48 h (24Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although it was later found that bisulfite modification was essentially complete in 5-6 h when cycled every hour. Bisulfite-modified DNA was recovered using Wizard resin (Promega) and desulfonated (18Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) prior to PCR amplification. PCR primers, designed so as to be able to amplify from the top (noncoding) strand of both bisulfite-modified and native (unmodified) DNAs, were 5′-GGGGGAGGAGTTAAGATGGT(C/T)G-3′ and 5′-CTCCACCCAATTC(G/A)AACTTCCC-3′ and correspond to bases 1-22 and 505-484 of our previously derived L1 consensus (GenBank accession X58075) (16Crowther P.J. Doherty J.P. Linsenmeyer M.E. Williamson M.R. Woodcock D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively. For amplification of the bottom (coding) strand, primers 5′-CAACTCCAATCTACAACTCC-3′ and 5′- GTAAGTTTGGGTAATGGTGGGCG-3′, corresponding to bases 30-50 and 464-441 of the L1 consensus, were used. These primers were designed to amplify the complement of the bisulfite-modified form of the consensus generated from the L1 sequences amplified from native DNA using the top strand primers containing the pattern of methylation observed in the top strand clones from bisulfite-modified DNA. PCR-generated DNA fragments were ligated into the pGEM-T cloning vector (Promega) and electroporated into DH12S cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) using standard protocols. By cloning PCR products amplified from bisulfite-modified DNA using this approach, we generally obtained L1 element-derived insert DNA in 30-70% of randomly selected white colonies. We found that transformation by electroporation was essential for the success of this technique as standard chemical transformation protocols yielded L1 inserts in only a few percent of white colonies, resulting in an unacceptable cloning bias. Plasmid clones were sequenced using either the Pharmacia ALF or the ABI 377 system using forward and reverse M13 primers giving complete or almost complete sequence from both strands. Sequence data analyses were performed using the GCG program suite (Unix version 8). Plasmid DNA containing a truncated human L1 element (clone pA41) (16Crowther P.J. Doherty J.P. Linsenmeyer M.E. Williamson M.R. Woodcock D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was added to HEF genomic DNA prior to each modification reaction as an internal control. PCR amplification of these control sequences was performed as above using the primer corresponding to bases 505-484 of the L1 consensus in combination with a primer (5′- GGAATTCGGTGAATTTGAGTTTGGT-3′) specific for the flanking plasmid vector DNA sequence. Of 20 cloned sequences amplified from this control plasmid (derived from eight separate modification reactions), a total of three unmodified cytosines were found, indicating an overall cytosine conversion efficiency greater than 99.9%. This total excludes cytosine methylation in dcm sites (the inner C of CC(A/T)GG) observed in otherwise fully bisulfite-modified sequences amplified from pA41 plasmid grown in the dcm+ Escherichia coli host DH12S. When the pA41 plasmid was grown in the dcm− host strain GM2163 (25Woodcock D. Crowther P. Doherty J. Jefferson S. De Cruz E. Noyer-Weidner M. Smith S. Michael M. Graham M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3469-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), no dcm methylation was observed in the PCR-amplified control sequences. For the control experiments to test for bias in the cloning step, pA41 DNA was methylated at all CG dinucleotides with M.SssI and mixed with an equal amount of unmethylated pA41 DNA before bisulfite modification. PCR amplification was performed with the 505-484 consensus primer used for both genomic L1 products and pA41 controls in combination with a mixture of two plasmid-specific primers (equal quantities of the primer used above for amplification of unmethylated pA41 in combination with a primer 5′-ATAGGGCGAATTCGAGCTCGG-3′-specific for the M.SssI methylated form of the flanking plasmid vector DNA sequence). The full sets of data from all of the sequences analyzed in this study are available on request from the corresponding author via anonymous FTP. To test whether DNA methylation plays a role in maintaining potentially functional L1 elements in a quiescent state, both nontransformed (limited lifespan) human embryonic fibroblasts (HEF) cells and a human teratocarcinoma cell line (Ntera2D1, in which L1 elements are known to be transcriptionally activated (26Skowronski J. Singer M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6050-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) were treated with the inhibitor of post-replicative DNA methylation, 5-azadC. The effect of 5-azadC on the levels of L1 element transcription was quantitated by RNase protection assay using a probe that only detects transcripts from nondegenerate, potentially functional elements (17Woodcock D.M. Williamson M.R. Doherty J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Treatment of HEF cells with 5-azadC resulted in a >4-fold increase in RNA transcripts from potentially functional L1 elements, whereas 5-azadC treatment of NteraD1 cells, in which L1 transcripts are already relatively abundant, resulted in a >2-fold increase (Fig. 1). Although, with the majority of human cell types, the overwhelming majority of L1 transcripts are from nonspecific readthrough from the promoters of other genes, in Ntera2D1 cells (one of only a few cell lines in which discrete L1 transcripts on Northern analysis can be detected), primer extension experiments show a predominant start site for transcription coinciding with the 5′ end of L1 elements (17Woodcock D.M. Williamson M.R. Doherty J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Skowronski J. Singer M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6050-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test whether this increase in L1 RNA protection products from transcripts corresponding closely to functional L1 elements might be the result of a general stimulation of nonspecific transcription through L1 elements, total levels of sense and antisense L1 transcripts were determined using slot blot hybridization with total cellular RNA. The sense strand probe allowed quantitation of transcripts from all L1 elements (not just those conforming closely to the consensus for functional elements), whereas the antisense probe only detects so-called “junk” L1 transcripts produced by read-through from nearby promoters and is thus a control for nonspecific activation of transcription throughout the genome. These data, shown in Fig. 1, indicate that 5-azadC-induced DNA demethylation causes specific transcription from potentially functional (nondegenerate) L1 elements but has no significant effect on the level of overall transcription or total L1 element transcription in either cell type. To elucidate the sequence specificity of DNA methylation in the promoter region of potentially functional human L1 elements, we employed the bisulfite genomic sequencing method that allows unambiguous identification of sites of methylated cytosines in clones derived from individual DNA strands. In this procedure, genomic DNA is modified with bisulfite under conditions where unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracils (18Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 19Clark S.J. Harrison J. Frommer M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Individual L1 strands are then amplified by PCR. (The two strands are no longer complementary after conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracils.) Following the PCR amplification, uracils derived from the unmethylated cytosines are replaced by thymines, and the size-fractionated PCR products are cloned into a plasmid vector and the DNA sequence of individual clones determined. The top strand PCR primers employed in this study were designed to match our previously derived consensus sequence for the 5′ end of the human L1 element (accession no. X58075) (16Crowther P.J. Doherty J.P. Linsenmeyer M.E. Williamson M.R. Woodcock D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This consensus was compiled from a series of random human L1 clones made using optimally methylation-tolerant (mcr−) E coli host strains so as to eliminate cloning bias. Within the region amplified with these primers, this PCR-derived consensus is 98.8% identical with the sequence of the L1.2b element that was the direct progenitor of a de novo L1 insertion in the factor VIII gene in the germ line of a hemophiliac (27Dombroski B.S. Mathias S.L. Nanthakumar E. Scott A.F. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We were thus aiming to determine the methylation status of potentially functional L1 elements such as those whose transcriptional activity would be detected in the RNase protection assay. The positions of the top strand L1 primers were chosen on the basis of being high in guanines and low in cytosines. Incorporation of appropriate degeneracies at the single cytosine within each of these PCR primers allowed us to use the same primer combination to amplify nondegenerate L1 sequences from either bisulfite-modified or native (unmodified) genomic DNA. While this primer design limited what regions could be targeted for amplification, it avoided any selective amplification of a minority of unusually modified sequences based on some presumption of methylation status. Furthermore, the cloning strategy employed (see below) allowed the unbiased recovery of clones from PCR products from both methylated and unmethylated forms of the target sequence with high efficiency. Twenty-five L1 clones from native (not bisulfite-modified) DNA isolated from HEF cells were sequenced. A representative selection of these sequences have been deposited in GenBank (accessions U68333 to U68349 inclusive). Fig. 2A shows an alignment of a portion of these sequences (bases 161-210) that is indicative of the features of the total sequence alignment. None of the sequences were identical, indicating that they were derived from different individual L1 elements. From these sequences, we were able to generate a consensus sequence for that subset of L1 elements amplifiable using these PCR primers. We later compared this consensus from clones from unmodified DNA with clones from bisulfite-modified DNAs to deduce which bases in these latter clones would likely have originally been unmethylated cytosines before the bisulfite modification reaction. Using bisulfite-modified HEF DNA as a template, we used PCR to amplify from the top strand of the L1 promoter region and determined the base sequences of nine independent clones. Representative segments of each of these sequences (bases 161-210) are shown in Fig. 2B, and the proportion of clones with residual cytosines throughout the whole of these clones are presented in Fig. 3. These modified L1 sequences were isolated from three separate bisulfite modification reactions from which internal control sequences had been isolated and shown to be completely modified (see “Experimental Procedures”). All of the sequences were slightly different suggesting that, like the clones amplified from unmodified DNA, they were each derived from a different L1 element. The sites of residual (originally methylated) cytosines in these sequences were very uniform (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3). Twenty-nine out of the 119 cytosines located within the amplified region (bases 23-483) were found to be consistently unmodified by bisulfite in all nine cloned sequences except for one site that was unmodified in eight of the nine (Fig. 3). This corresponds to 26% of cytosines methylated in this CpG island region, which is consistent with our previous estimate of 18% methylation for the 101-1900-base pair interval of L1 elements from HEF DNA (15Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Diver W.P. Graham M. Bateman C. Baker D.J. Smith S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4465-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Of the 29 consistently methylated sites, 25 occurred at CG dinucleotides and 4 at non-CG cytosines (Fig. 3). There were also four CG dinucleotides in which the cytosines were consistently unmethylated, with one of these sites separated by only 4 base pairs from a site of non-CG methylation (Fig. 2, bases 188 and 183, respectively). Fig. 4 shows aligned sequence electropherograms from representative clones derived from bisulfite-modified human DNA, native DNA, and unmethylated control plasmid from a region containing putative sites of methylation in both CG and non-CG contexts (bases 399-452). This illustrates complete conversion of cytosines in the L1 plasmid control and unambiguous residual cytosines (sites of methylation) in both CG and non-CG dinucleotides in this region of the clone from bisulfite-modified genomic DNA. The sequence contexts of all four of the non-CG methylated bases are presented in Table I. Two of the 9 clones also contained a single cytosine outside the conserved unreactive sites, suggesting that our overall cytosine conversion efficiency at these other sites was at least 99.8% (although these 2 sites equally might represent actual sites of DNA methylation).Fig. 4Alignment of automated DNA sequencing traces corresponding to bases 399-452 of “top strand” clones derived from bisulfite-modified HEF DNA (A), control, unmethylated plasmid control (B), and native (not bisulfite-treated) HEF DNA (C).

Open table in a new tab To analyze the sites of genomic methylation in the bottom (coding) strand of L1 elements, new PCR primers were designed to amplify preferentially from the bisulfite-modified L1 sequences belonging to the same subset of elements that were amplified using the top strand primers. The sequence of these “bottom” strand primers was based on the PCR-derived consensus sequence determined from unmodified DNA and from the conserved top strand methylation sites determined from modified HEF DNA as described above. Using bisulfite-modified HEF DNA as template, we used these primers to PCR-amplify and clone L1 bottom strand sequences from which the base sequence of 19 individual clones was determined. Detailed sequence data are shown for the same representative portion (bases 161-210) of these sequences (Fig. 2C). However, for easier comparison with the other sequence data, the sequences from these modified bottom strands are shown as their complementary top strand sequence. Hence, residual (methylated) cytosines in the bottom strands thus appear as the complementary guanines in the sequences as presented. The occurrence of bisulfite-resistant cytosines in these bottom strand L1 sequences was more variable than was observed with the bisulfite-modified top strand data (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). All 23 of the methylated CG sites in the top strand within the region amplified by the bottom strand primers had corresponding methylated CG sites in the bottom strand (i.e. were symmetrically methylated). Taking the set of bottom strand clones as a whole, there were on average 1.5 sites of non-CG methylation per clone. There were no consistently methylated non-CG sites identified with the possible exception of bases 432,433 where 2/19 clones had 5′-mCmCAG-3′ sequences (as read on the bottom strand). However, there were several CG sites in which 30-70% of bottom strand sequences had bisulfite-resistant cytosines (shown as the complementary guanines in Fig. 2) for which"

This study underlines the importance of cAMP in inhibiting the induction of NO production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines in rat primary astrocytes. Compounds (forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, and (Sp)-cAMP) that increase cAMP and activate protein kinase A (PKA) were found to inhibit LPS- and cytokine-mediated production of NO as well as the expression of iNOS, whereas compounds (H-89 and (Rp)-cAMP) that decrease cAMP and PKA activity stimulated the production of NO and the expression of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes. Forskolin, but not the inactive analogue 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, inhibited NO production and iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner in astrocytes. The inhibition of LPS- and/or cytokine-induced NO production in rat C6 glial cells by forskolin suggest that similar to astrocytes, iNOS expression in C6 cells is also regulated by similar mechanisms. In contrast, in rat peritoneal macrophages the cAMP analogues stimulated the LPS- and cytokine-induced production of NO. In vitro, the PKA had no effect on iNOS activity in LPS-treated astrocytes or macrophages, suggesting that PKA modulates the intracellular signaling events associated with the induction of iNOS biogenesis rather than the post-translational modification of iNOS. The compounds which activate PKA activity, blocked the activation of NF-κβ in astrocytes but stimulated the activation of NF-κβ in macrophages. This differential regulation of NF-κβ activation in two different cell types (astrocytes and macrophages) by the same second messenger (cAMP) indicates that intracellular events or pathways in the activation of NF-κβ may be different. Moreover, this inhibition of iNOS expression in LPS- and cytokine-treated astrocytes by cAMP may be of therapeutic potential in NO-mediated cytotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases.

However, the roles of these protein-tyrosine phosphatases in the metabolic actions of insulin are not well characterized. In this study, we directly assessed the ability of PTP1B and Syp to modulate insulin-stimulated translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in a physiologically relevant insulin target cell. Primary cultures of rat adipose cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type PTP1B (PTP1B-WT), wild-type Syp (Syp-WT), or the catalytically inactive mutants PTP1B-C/S or Syp-C/S. The effects of overexpression of these constructs on insulin-stimulated translocation of a co-transfected epitope-tagged GLUT4 were studied. Cells overexpressing either PTP1B-C/S or Syp-WT had insulin dose-response curves similar to those obtained with control cells expressing only epitope-tagged GLUT4. In contrast, for cells overexpressing PTP1B-WT the level of GLUT4 on the cell surface at each insulin dose (ranging from 0 to 60 nM) was significantly lower than that observed in the control cells. Interestingly, cells overexpressing the dominant inhibitory mutant Syp-C/S also had a small but statistically significant impairment in insulin responsiveness. At a maximally stimulating concentration of insulin (60 nM), cell surface epitope-tagged GLUT4 was approximately 20% less than that of the control cells. It is possible that effects from high level overexpression of Syp and PTP1B constructs may not reflect what occurs under physiological conditions. Nevertheless, our data raise the possibility that PTP1B may be a negative regulator of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, while Syp may have a small role as a positive mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin.

Insulin is an important regulator of growth and metabolism. The pleiotropic actions of insulin are initiated by the binding of insulin to its receptor and the resultant activation of intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity (1Quon M.J. Butte A.J.

Syp (also known as SH-PTP2, PTP1D, SHPTP3, or PTP2C) is a cytosolic PTPase containing two SH2 domains in addition to a catalytic phosphatase domain (17Feng G.S. Pawson T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Binding of the SH2 domains of Syp to phosphotyrosine motifs on either the insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) results in activation of Syp PTPase activity (18Sugimoto S.

They report that microinjection of either the SH2 domains of Syp or anti-Syp antibodies interfered with the mitogenic actions of insulin, but had no detectable effect on the insulin-stimulated translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 (24Hausdorff S.F.

In the present study, we used a similar approach to overexpress wild-type or catalytically inactive mutant forms of PTP1B or Syp to directly test the roles of these PTPases in modulating insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in a physiologically relevant insulin target cell. Our data suggest that PTP1B may function as a negative regulator of the metabolic actions of insulin, while Syp may mediate a small positive effect on the ability of insulin to recruit GLUT4 to the cell surface.

The cDNA coding for human GLUT4 with the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA1) inserted in the first exofacial loop of GLUT4 was subcloned into pCIS2 (GLUT4-HA). An XbaI/SmaI fragment containing the cDNA for human PTP1B (generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Chernoff) was ligated into XbaI/HpaI sites in the multiple cloning region of pCIS2 (PTP1B-WT). An XbaI/SmaI fragment containing the cDNA for a catalytically inactive mutant PTP1B with a cysteine to serine substitution at position 215 (generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Chernoff) was ligated into XbaI/HpaI sites in the multiple cloning region of pCIS2 (PTP1B-C/S). An XbaI/XhoI fragment containing the cDNA for human Syp (generous gift from Dr. Benjamin Neel) was ligated into the multiple cloning region of pCIS2 (Syp-WT). An XhoI/DraI fragment containing the cDNA for a catalytically inactive mutant Syp with a cysteine to serine substitution at position 459 (generous gift from Dr. Benjamin Neel) was ligated into XhoI/HpaI sites in the multiple cloning region of pCIS2 (Syp-C/S). Milligram quantities of the plasmid DNA vectors described above were obtained using a Magic Megaprep kit (Promega). The wild-type and mutant sequences in the catalytic domain of the respective PTP1B and Syp constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. Isolated adipose cells were prepared from the epididymal fat pads of male rats (170-200 g, CD strain, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by collagenase digestion as described (25Quon M.J.

Cell surface epitope-tagged GLUT4 was determined by using the anti-HA1 mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) in conjunction with 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG as described (26Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Quon M.J. Butte A.J.

Cells transfected with the empty expression vector pCIS2 were used to determine nonspecific binding of the antibodies. Typically, the nonspecific binding was ∼30% of the total binding to cells transfected with GLUT4-HA and maximally stimulated with insulin (26Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The actual specific counts were comparable from experiment to experiment (see figure legends). The lipid weight from a 200-μl aliquot of cells was determined as described (30Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used to normalize the data for each sample. Expression of recombinant PTP1B, Syp, or GLUT4-HA was confirmed by immunoblotting extracts of cells that were prepared at the same time and had undergone transfection in parallel with the cells used for the translocation assay described above. Whole cell homogenates were prepared from cells co-transfected with GLUT4-HA (2 μg/cuvette) and either pCIS2, PTP1B-WT, PTP1B-C/S, Syp-WT, or Syp-C/S (4 μg/cuvette). Cells from 15 cuvettes were pooled for each group. After electroporation and overnight incubation, the cells were washed once and resuspended in 3 ml of TES buffer (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 8.73% sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, 18°C). The cells were homogenized by being passed through a 25-gauge needle three times and then were centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g, 4°C, to pellet nuclei. The fat cake and pellet were discarded. For detection of PTP1B and GLUT4-HA, the total membrane fraction was isolated from the whole cell homogenate by centrifuging for 30 min at 400,000 × g, 4°C. The pellet containing the total membrane fraction was resuspended in 600 μl of TES buffer and stored at -70°C until further processing. For immunodetection of PTP1B constructs, aliquots of the total membrane fractions from each group containing equal amounts of protein (500 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The contents of the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the PTP1B protein was detected with a polyclonal anti-PTP1B antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and visualized using an antibody against rabbit IgG in conjunction with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham). For immunodetection of Syp constructs, EDTA and aprotinin (final concentrations of 2 mM and 1.3 μg/ml, respectively) were added to aliquots of whole cell homogenates containing equal amounts of protein (800 μg). The samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was precleared for 30 min at 4°C by incubating with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) that had been prewashed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, and 1.3 μg/ml aprotinin). The samples were then immunoprecipitated by incubating for 45 min at 4°C with a human-specific polyclonal anti-Syp antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by incubation with 20 μl of prewashed protein A-agarose for 45 min at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated samples were then washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted by adding 60 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and incubating at 98°C for 5 min. Twenty μl of each sample was loaded per lane and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The contents of the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Syp protein was detected with a monoclonal anti-Syp antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and visualized using an antibody against mouse IgG in conjunction with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham). To determine relative levels of GLUT4-HA in each group of transfected cells, total membrane fractions were prepared as above, and samples were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GLUT4 antibody as described previously (28Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnowski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the various PTPase constructs as described above. After incubation overnight, cells were stimulated with insulin (60 nM) for 2 min, and cell extracts were prepared exactly as described above for the immunoblotting experiments (except 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol were added to the TES buffer). PTPase activity in the cell extracts was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). Equal aliquots of the cell extracts (80 μg of total protein in 50 μl of TES buffer) were added to 450 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 mM pNPP and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of 2 M KOH, and the amount of product (p-nitrophenyl) produced was measured by determining the absorbance at 405 nM in a spectrophotometer. Nonspecific absorbance was corrected for by subtracting the absorbance at 405 nM determined in the absence of cell extract. Insulin dose-response curves were compared using multivariate analysis of variance. Paired t tests were used to compare individual points where appropriate. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The insulin dose-response curves were fit to the equation y = a + b [x/(x + k)] using a Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares algorithm. When plotted on linear log axes, this equation gives a sigmoidal curve where the parameters are associated with the following properties: a = basal response, a + b = maximal response, k = half-maximal dose (ED50), and x = concentration of insulin. To directly evaluate the role of PTP1B in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4, we overexpressed either wild-type or catalytically inactive mutant forms of human PTP1B in rat adipose cells. We confirmed that PTP1B-WT and PTP1B-C/S were overexpressed at comparable levels in our system by immunoblotting total membrane fractions isolated from transfected cells with an anti-PTP1B antibody (Fig. 1). In the lane containing cell extracts from control cells transfected with the empty expression vector pCIS2, there is a faint band representing endogenous rat PTP1B. The lanes containing extracts from groups of cells transfected with either PTP1B-WT or PTP1B-C/S show that the recombinant PTP1B constructs were expressed at levels that are much higher than the endogenous rat PTP1B levels. Since only ∼5% of the adipose cells that have undergone electroporation are actually transfected (26Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we estimate that there was at least a 100-fold overexpression of PTP1B-WT and PTP1B-C/S relative to endogenous PTP1B in the transfected cells. We also tested the PTPase activity of the recombinant PTP1B constructs by assessing the ability of cell extracts from insulin-stimulated transfected cells to hydrolyze the substrate pNPP. PTPase activity in extracts derived from the group of cells transfected with PTP1B-WT was approximately 3 times higher than that of the control cells transfected with the empty expression vector pCIS2, consistent with a high level of overexpression in the 5% of transfected cells. PTPase activity in extracts derived from the group of cells transfected with PTP1B-C/S was not significantly different from that of the control cells (data not shown). After confirming overexpression of the recombinant PTP1B constructs in transfected adipose cells, we next determined their effects on the ability of insulin to recruit a co-transfected epitope-tagged GLUT4 to the cell surface. The insulin dose-response curve for control cells co-transfected with the empty expression vector pCIS2 and GLUT4-HA showed a 2.5-fold increase in cell surface GLUT4-HA upon maximal insulin stimulation (60 nM) with an ED50 of 0.06 nM. In contrast, the insulin dose-response curve for cells overexpressing PTP1B-WT demonstrated both decreased sensitivity and decreased responsiveness to insulin (Fig. 2A). In the absence of insulin, the basal level of cell surface GLUT4 for cells overexpressing PTP1B-WT was approximately half of that seen in the basal state for the control cells. Furthermore, at every insulin dose the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface of cells overexpressing PTP1B-WT was less than that of the control cells (ED50 = 0.18 nM). At 60 nM insulin, the maximal insulin response for cells overexpressing PTP1B-WT was approximately 80% of the maximal response for the control cells. Thus, the insulin sensitivity of cells overexpressing PTP1B-WT was decreased approximately 3-fold while the insulin responsiveness was decreased by about 20%. When analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance, the difference in the dose-response curve caused by overexpression of PTP1B-WT was highly significant (p < 1 × 10-10). In contrast to PTP1B-WT, we were unable to detect any significant difference in the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4-HA in cells overexpressing the mutant PTP1B-C/S when compared with the control cells (Fig. 2B). It is possible that the lower level of cell surface GLUT4-HA we observed in cells overepxressing PTP1B-WT is due to an effect of PTP1B-WT on expression of GLUT4-HA rather than to an effect on insulin sensitivity or responsiveness. Therefore, we measured total GLUT4-HA in cells co-transfected with pCIS2, PTP1B-WT, or PTP1B-C/S by immunoprecipitating total membrane fractions with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GLUT4 antibody (Fig. 3). We observed comparable levels of GLUT4-HA in all groups. Taken together, our data suggest that overexpression of PTP1B-WT has an inhibitory effect on insulin signal transduction pathways related to GLUT4 translocation. We confirmed overexpression of Syp-WT and Syp-C/S by using a human-specific polyclonal anti-Syp antibody to immunoprecipitate whole cell homogenates of cells transfected with either the empty expression vector pCIS2, Syp-WT, or Syp-C/S in conjunction with immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-Syp antibody (Fig. 4). The lanes containing extracts from cells transfected with Syp-WT or Syp-C/S show that the two recombinant Syp constructs are overexpressed at comparable levels. A specific band representing endogenous rat Syp is not seen in cells transfected with pCIS2 because the samples were immunoprecipitated with a human-specific antibody. We tested the PTPase activity of the recombinant Syp constructs by assessing the ability of cell extracts from insulin-stimulated transfected cells to hydrolyze the substrate pNPP. PTPase activity in extracts derived from the group of cells transfected with Syp-WT was approximately 2 times higher than that of the control cells transfected with the empty expression vector pCIS2, consistent with a high level of overexpression in the 5% of transfected cells. PTPase activity in extracts derived from the group of cells transfected with Syp-C/S was not significantly different from than that of the control cells (data not shown). To gain insight into the ability of Syp to modulate insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4, we tested the effects of overexpressing either Syp-WT or Syp-C/S on the ability of insulin to recruit co-transfected GLUT4-HA to the cell surface (Fig. 5). Control cells co-transfected with pCIS2 and GLUT4-HA had a 3-fold increase in cell surface GLUT-HA upon maximal insulin stimulation with an ED50 of 0.06 nM. Cells overexpressing Syp-WT had an insulin dose-response curve that was not significantly different from that of the control cells (p = 0.43) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, cells overexpressing Syp-C/S had decreased insulin responsiveness when compared with control cells (Fig. 5B). The level of cell surface GLUT4-HA for cells overexpressing Syp-C/S was approximately 20% lower than that of the control cells at the maximally stimulating dose of insulin (p < 0.02). However, there was no significant change in the estimated value of the half-maximal dose of insulin (ED50) for cells overexpressing Syp-C/S when compared with the control cells. To help rule out the possibility that the difference in the insulin dose-response curve for cells overexpressing Syp-C/S is due to an effect of the mutant PTPase on expression of GLUT4-HA, we evaluated total levels of GLUT4-HA in cells co-transfected with GLUT4-HA and either pCIS2, Syp-WT, or Syp-C/S. We immunoprecipitated total membrane fractions from each group of transfected cells with an anti-HA antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GLUT4 antibody (Fig. 3). The results of this experiment demonstrate that there is no detectable effect of overexpressing Syp-WT or Syp-C/S on the total level of GLUT4-HA in transfected cells. Thus, the difference in the insulin dose-response curve of cells overexpressing Syp-C/S is most likely due to an effect on signal transduction pathways related to GLUT4 translocation. Since Syp-C/S is known to behave in a dominant inhibitory manner, our results suggest that Syp may play a small positive role in mediating insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. A large family of PTPases is thought to be involved in modulating signal transduction pathways initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin receptor (31Tonks N.K. Yang Q. Flint A.J.

INTRODUCTIONSynthesis of mRNA by RNA polymerase II requires the interaction of a large array of auxiliary transcription factors that recognize and bind to specific promoter DNA sequences located upstream of eukaryotic genes (1Lewis M.K. Burgess R.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 15B. Academic Press, New York1982: 109-153Google Scholar, 2Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). These transcription factors regulate the initiation of transcription in a temporally ordered manner by assembling and engaging the active transcription complex. Consequently, many of the transcription factors have multiple domains responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation.In order to understand the detailed roles played by each of the domains of sequence-specific transcription factors, efforts were made to fractionate the factors necessary to reconstitute transcriptional activity in vitro (3Kadonaga J.T.

These experiments resulted in the identification of one such promoter-specific transcription factor, Sp1, from HeLa cells (6Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Sci. 1986; 11: 201-203Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Sp1 enhances transcription from a variety of viral and cellular genes by binding to GC-rich decanucleotide recognition elements (GC boxes) within the 5′-flanking promoter sequences (10Kadonaga J.T. Jones K. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 201-203Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 11Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Although Sp1 can bind and activate transcription from a single GC box sequence (12Letovsky J. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2639-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), Sp1 binding sites often occur as multiple repeats (6Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Science. 1985; 230: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, Sp1 binds independently to each GC box sequence; physical interaction between adjacent Sp1 molecules is insufficient to give rise to cooperative DNA binding behavior (13Gidoni D. Kadonaga J.T. Barrera-Saldana H. Takahashi K. Chambon P. Tjian R. Science. 1985; 230: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The multi-domain nature of Sp1 also facilitates Sp1-Sp1 interactions that occur in cases where Sp1 binding sites are widely separated (14Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V.

This self-association and DNA looping phenomenon are proposed to give rise to the observed transcriptional synergism or super-activation of Sp1 (14Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P.

Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).The construction of truncated Sp1 fragments allowed the localization of the Zn2+-dependent DNA binding region to the carboxyl terminus, which was shown by sequence analysis to contain three “zinc finger” domains (7Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 18Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R.

McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar) and adopt the consensus sequence (FYH)XCX2-4CX3FX5LX2HX3HX5 (metal binding residues in bold) (22Jacobs G.H.

These domains are distinct from the Cys-rich motifs found in the steroid receptors (24Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Grönenborn A.M.

This structural unit is now regarded as one of the major structural motifs involved in sequence-specific DNA binding and eukaryotic gene regulation.Our general goal is to understand at the molecular level how the three zinc finger domains of Sp1 can bind with high affinity to a variety of GC box DNA sequences (10Kadonaga J.T. Jones K. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 201-203Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 11Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). We have previously described the overexpression, purification, and characterization of a 92-amino acid peptide, Sp1-Zn92, that contains the three zinc fingers of Sp1 (36Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The DNA binding properties of Sp1-Zn92 were surveyed using a variety of techniques based on gel electrophoresis to quantitatively analyze its interaction with several native and modified DNA sites. Sp1-Zn92 was shown to mimic the DNA binding properties of native Sp1 and, through comparisons with results from other zinc finger systems, a model was developed to explain the distinctive DNA binding properties of Sp1. Our model serves as the starting point for detailed studies of the conformations of the individual domains of Sp1-Zn92 aimed at defining those molecular features that allow Sp1 to recognize promoter sequences that contain the asymmetric GGGCGG hexanucleotide core (GC box) with a consensus sequence of 5′-(G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(G/T)-3′.The distinguishing feature of Sp1-DNA binding is the high degree of sequence variability that is tolerated within the GC box with retention of high binding affinity (10Kadonaga J.T. Jones K. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 201-203Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 11Bucher P. J. Mol.

This raises interesting questions regarding detailed molecular mechanism of Sp1-DNA recognition process and the role which the individual fingers may have to play as “flexible-independent” reading domains in modulating binding to nonidentical DNA sites with near equal affinity. As a first step toward studying Sp1-DNA interactions, we have determined the solution structures of synthetic peptides corresponding to zinc finger domains two and three (N terminus to C terminus) of Sp1 using standard homonuclear NMR techniques. While zinc finger 3 belongs to the well defined Cys-X2-Cys structural subclass, zinc finger 2 is a member of the Cys-X4-Cys structural subclass, which has been defined for relatively few systems (32Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 33Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The refined solution structures of zinc fingers 2 and 3 are compared with each other and with other reported zinc finger structures. Putative DNA binding residues are identified, and the individual roles of conserved residues are analyzed in the context of our previous model (36Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) of Sp1-DNA interactions.DISCUSSIONThe calculated structures exhibit secondary structure elements consistent with the short range NOE connectivity patterns. The overall topology of both peptides conforms to the expected fold of Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains consisting of two antiparallel strands linked by a Cys-Cys loop followed by a reverse 90° turn and an α-helix containing the two zinc coordinating His residues.Observed long range NOEs define the relative orientation of the secondary structure elements. For Sp1f2 the NOE constraints are consistent with an antiparallel orientation for the two β-strands extending from the turn encompassing Trp7-Cys10. Ninety percent of Sp1f2 structures are consistent with hydrogen bonds between Phe3(CO) and Arg14(NH) (distance NH···O = 2.9 Å, angle N-O-C = 163°) and between Cys5(NH) and Lys12(CO) (distance NH···O= 3.1 Å, angle N-O-C = 160°), stabilizing the antiparallel β-sheet. The remainder of the amide and carbonyl groups in this sheet region are oriented as if interacting with the solvent. Long range connectivities in Sp1f3 also define an antiparallel orientation for its two β-strands. The antiparallel β-sheet of Sp1f3, however, seems to be much more open with no backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds evident in the average refined structure, as observed previously in the case of ADR1 and human enhancer proteins (30Klevit R.E. Herriott J.R. Horvath S.J. Proteins. 1990; 7: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Robien M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3907-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Cys-Cys LoopThe results of NMR spectroscopy and Co2+ titration studies show that the increased size of the Cys-X4-Cys chelate of Sp1f2 does not dramatically alter either the local geometry or the metal affinity, relative to the more predominant Cys-X2-Cys subclass. There are, however, some differences in the turn conformations of the two zinc finger domains despite the fact that both turns require the two Cys residues to be positioned for tetrahedral metal binding. The Sp1f2 turn contains the residues Trp7 (i)-Ser8 (i + 1)-Tyr9 (i + 2)-Cys10 (i + 3), and the first metal coordinating Cys is completely excluded from the reverse turn (Fig. 5A). The turn is best classified as a β-type II structural element based on the dihedral angle values observed for the average, refined structure (Table II). Hydrogen bonds are observed between Trp7(CO) and Cys10(NH) (distance NH···O= 3.73 Å, angle N-O-C = 109°) in 50% of the structures. The average refined structure, Sp1f2·avg·min, also shows the Sγ of Cys10 within H-bonding distance of the backbone NH of Lys12 (distance NH···S= 3.4 Å, angle N-H-S = 124°). The turn conformation is further stabilized by the stacking of the Trp7 ring against the His27 imidazole ring (Fig. 6A). The orientation of the Trp indole ring with respect to His27 is borne out by the dramatic upfield shift for His27β-protons due to ring current effects (Fig. 2A).Table IIDihedral anglesTurn typei + 1i + 2ϕψϕψβ-Type I−60°−30°−90°0°Sp1F3−62°−13°−79°−49°β-Type II−60°120°80°0°Sp1F2−86°142°76°5° Open table in a new tab Fig. 6A, the average, refined structure of Sp1f2 (Sp1f2·avg·min) showing orientations of well defined aromatic and apolar residues involved in hydrophobic packing (Phe3, Phe14, Leu20, Trp7), relatively well defined polar residues packing against the hydrophobic core via their alkyl methylene groups (Lys12, Glu19), long polar residues of the α-helix (Arg16, Asp18, Gln21, Arg22, Arg25), and the metal binding residues (Cys5, Cys10, His23, His27).

Gierasch L.M. Smith J.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar) (Table II). The Sp1f3 β-turn shows the expected hydrogen bond between CO of residue i (Cys5) and NH of residue i + 3 (Cys8) in all calculated structures (distance NH···O= 3.2 Å, angle N-O-C = 120°). In addition, the structures place the Sγ of Cys5 within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone NH groups of Glu7 (distance NH···S= 3.6 Å, angle N-H-S = 136°) and Cys8 (distance NH···S= 3.6 Å, angle N-H-S = 157°), thus further stabilizing the turn conformation (Fig. 5B). These NH···S hydrogen bond geometries are similar to those observed in ferrodoxin and rubredoxin (66Adman E. Watenpaugh K.G. Jensen H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 44854-44858Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Also, the putative NH···S hydrogen bonds in Sp1f3 correspond to the σ and τ bonds in the context of the SPXX motif (51Suzuki M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 246: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), except that the Ser residue O atom is replaced by a Cys5 S atom. The ψ angle for the i + 2 Glu7 in Sp1f3 differs significantly from the expected value of 0° (Table II) (67Hutchinson G.E. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), perhaps due to the fact that Glu7 is involved in a long range hydrophobic interaction with His23.While it is not common for NH···S hydrogen bonds to occur in Cys residues involved in disulfide bridges, numerous NH···S bonds, as observed for Sp1f3, are a common feature in proteins coordinating metal ions (66Adman E. Watenpaugh K.G. Jensen H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 44854-44858Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These bonds are hypothesized to play an important role in stabilizing the ligand arrangement required for metal coordination, thereby minimizing the entropy change caused by metal coordination to the apo protein.Hydrophobic CorePacking of the β-sheet and α-helix of zinc finger domains against each other forms a hydrophobic core and places the conserved Cys and His residues toward the interior of the domain in a position to coordinate a Zn2+ ion. The experimental NOE constraints unambiguously determine the absolute chirality around the zinc ion as S, following earlier convention (27Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Several residues (Phe14, Lys12, Trp7, and Lys24 for Sp1f2; Phe12, Lys10, Glu7, and Ile22 for Sp1f3) serve to shield the zinc ion from solvent and may therefore stabilize the metal-ligand interaction by precluding close approach of alternative donor ligands. The occurrence of such hydrophobic shells surrounding metal binding sites is well known and believed to play a key role by not only minimizing the change in conformational entropy upon metal binding by preordering the primary coordination sphere but also by precluding alternative modes of metal binding through the reduction of heteroatoms in the vicinity of the primary coordination sphere.In addition to the expected packing interactions between aromatic and other hydrophobic side chains (Figs. 6, A and B and 7, A and B), alkyl methylene groups of certain long chain polar residues seem to be involved in hydrophobic interactions as well. For instance, in Sp1f2, the alkyl chain of Lys12 packs against the central Phe14 and His23, whereas the polar amine is oriented toward the solvent. Similarly, methylene groups of Glu19 and Lys24 (not visible) pack against Phe14 and His23, respectively, with their charged groups pointing outwards (Figs. 6A and 7A). A similar arrangement is seen for the side chain of Lys10 in Sp1f3 (Figs. 6B and 7B). Thus, despite their relatively small size, the zinc finger domains achieve a relatively high degree of packing and are stable as mini-globular domains in the presence of zinc and other divalent metal ions (Fig. 7, A and B).Fig. 7A, space-filling model of Sp1f2·avg·min with backbone atoms (dark gray), side chain carbons, and nitrogens of the metal binding and other hydrophobic residues (light gray), side chain carbons and nitrogens of long polar residues (white), side chain hydrogens (white), and zinc atom (black) illustrating the well packed mini-globular nature of the zinc finger domain. Note how the putative DNA binding residues Arg16 (−1) and Arg22 (+6) point toward the exterior, whereas the side chain of Lys12, Glu19 pack in with Phe14, and Gln21 is folded in along the backbone. Lys12 and His23 are well positioned to make proposed DNA phosphate contacts via their exposed nitrogen atoms3 (marked with asterisks).

Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Fingers 1 and 3 of Zif268 use Arg residues −1 and +6 to contact the underlined residues of the GCGsubsite, and finger 2 uses residues Arg (−1) and His (+3) to contact the underlined bases of GGGsubsite. An analysis of the Sp1 sequence, considering the residues analogous to the ones involved in DNA binding in the Zif268 structure, reveals striking similarities between the zinc fingers of Sp1 and Zif268 (36Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In light of these similarities, we proposed a model for interaction of Sp1 with DNA based on the Zif268/DNA co-crystal structure which envisaged Sp1f2, by analogy to Zif268 finger 1, using Arg (−1) (residue 16) and Arg (+6) (residue 22) for GCGrecognition and Sp1f3, by analogy to Zif268 finger 2, using Arg (−1) (residue 14) and His (+3) (residue 17) for GGGrecognition (Fig. 8) (36Kriwacki R.W.

Hoffman R.C. Horvath S. Herriott J.R. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4460-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As required by the model, the structures of Sp1f2 and Sp1f3 were found to be very similar to Zif268 fingers 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 9, A and B). The backbone RMSD values for residues 3-25 of Sp1f3 (excluding the residue immediately succeeding the second metal binding Cys) and the corresponding 22 residues of Zif268 finger 2 is 0.90 Å. The backbones deviate significantly at the residue succeeding the second Cys, due to the difference in ϕ angles at this position. Sp1f3 contains a Pro residue at this site that has its ϕ angle restricted to −60°, whereas most zinc fingers, including Zif268 finger 2, exhibit a positive ϕ angle for the residue immediately succeeding the second Cys location (69Bernstein B.E. Hoffman R.C. Horvath S. Herriott J.R. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4460-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The best overlay of Sp1f2 and Zif-268 finger 1 between the first conserved hydrophobic residue to the second His residue (excluding the four residues in the Cys-Cys loop) gives an RMSD value of only 0.68 Å. The residues of the Cys-X4-Cys loop were excluded from the RMSD calculation since these residues were stated to be ill-defined in the crystal structure (32Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar).Fig. 9A, stereo presentation of the superposition of Sp1f2·avg·min (see “Experimental Procedures”) and Zif268 finger 1.

B, stereo presentation of the superposition of Sp1f3·avg·min (see “Experimental Procedures”) and Zif268 finger 2.

Additionally, overlays of both Sp1f2 and Sp1f3 with Zif fingers 1 and 2, respectively, in the Zif268-DNA complex place the Nϵ proton of the first metal coordinating His within hydrogen bonding distance of the 5′-phosphate of base pairs 4 and 7, respectively, as observed for the corresponding positions in the Zif268 complex (Fig. 9, A and B). The preservation of these contacts with DNA backbone (which have been proposed to serve to precisely position the α-helix with respect to their DNA sites in the major groove (32Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar)), upon superpositioning of the structures suggests that the orientation and docking mode of Sp1f2 and Sp1f3 in the major groove of DNA must be very similar to that observed for the analogous Zif268 zinc fingers. This mode of interaction is also consistent with the protection/interference data (7"

INTRODUCTIONConformational maturation of nascent polypeptides is facilitated by transient physical interaction with molecular chaperones. The general consensus is that rounds of binding prevent misfolding and subsequent entrance of partially folded intermediates into nonproductive folding pathways (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, nascent polypeptides destined to traverse compartments of the secretory pathway are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumAATα1-antitrypsinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. during biosynthesis (2Walter P. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1984; 38: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Incompletely folded proteins often exhibit a persistent physical association with one or more molecular chaperones and are retained in the ER prior to intracellular disposal (for a review, see 3Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This mechanism has been termed “quality control” (4Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and apparently functions to ensure transport of only correctly folded proteins beyond the ER.Calnexin (also designated p88 or IP90), a calcium-binding molecular chaperone of the ER membrane (5Wada I.

An important feature of calnexin is that it exhibits an affinity for monoglucosylated oligosaccharides (15Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol.

Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). Importantly, it can also be generated by post-translational reglucosylation of glycans, an event catalyzed by the ER resident protein UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (17Trombetta S.

Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Defective intracellular transport of the aberrantly folded protein through compartments of the secretory pathway can diminish circulating levels of the inhibitor (25Sifers R.N. Finegold M.J.

Proteolytic destruction of lung elastin is associated with severe plasma AAT deficiency and is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease (33Beith J. Front. Matrix Biol. 1978; 6: 1-4Google Scholar).Intracellular retention of most “null” AAT variants results from mutations that cause premature truncation of the polypeptide at its carboxyl terminus (34Fabretti G. Sergi C. Consales G. Faa G. Brisigotti M. Romeo G. Callea F. Liver. 1992; 12: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a phenomenon predicted to prevent formation of specific secondary structural features (32Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct.

In this study, conformation-based quality control of human AAT secretion was investigated in mouse hepatoma cells stably expressing the nonfunctional allelic variant QO Hong Kong (null(Hong Kong)), which is incapable of folding into the appropriate native structure. Null(Hong Kong) exhibits a Ca2+-sensitive physical interaction with the molecular chaperone calnexin during intracellular retention (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and requires release from the molecular chaperone as well as post-translational trimming of its asparagine-linked oligosaccharides for normal disposal. Predicted roles for each of these events in the quality control of human AAT secretion are discussed.DISCUSSIONSince hepatocytes are the major site for biosynthesis and secretion of AAT (28Peters Jr., T. Glaumann H. Peters Jr., T. Redman C. Plasma Protein Secretion by the Liver. Academic Press, New York1983: 1-5Google Scholar, 46Sifers R.N. Carlson J.A. Clift S.M. DeMayo F.J. Bullock D.W. Woo S.L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1459-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), stably transfected mouse hepatoma cells were used to study conformation-based quality control of human AAT secretion. Variant null(Hong Kong) was employed for this analysis because truncation of amino acids at its carboxyl terminus prevents formation of all three large β-sheet structures common to members of the serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily (32Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 35Loebermann H. Tobuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The correctly folded variant PI M1(Val-213) is rapidly secreted from these cells, whereas null(Hong Kong) is subjected to intracellular retention and disposal (37Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, cosedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation analyses indicated that newly synthesized molecules sedimented at 6.8 S, which coincided with their quantitative association with the molecular chaperone calnexin. This indicates that assembly of the complex occurred cotranslationally or immediately following biosynthesis.Interaction with calnexin was prevented by inhibiting asparagine-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin or by arresting cotranslational trimming of attached glucose residues with castanospermine. This indicates that like many other glycoproteins (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 47Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), oligosaccharides may somehow function to facilitate assembly between null(Hong Kong) and calnexin. Intracellular disposal of nascent null(Hong Kong) was accelerated in cells preincubated with either tunicamycin or castanospermine, suggesting that disposal occurs in the absence of the bound molecular chaperone. This idea was consistent with appearance of the 4.5 S species at a time point that coincided with the onset of intracellular disposal. The absence of associated calnexin and sedimentation at 4.5 S suggests that this population of molecules represents the released monomer (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q.-Q.A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No changes in the monomer population were observed when cell lysis was performed under less stringent conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the 4.5 S population does not merely reflect weakening of the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin interaction during retention, but represents unassociated molecules. It should be pointed out that in an earlier report (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an error in our fractionation method, overlap between the 4.5 S and 6.8 S species, and incomplete dissociation of complexes in response to incubation with EGTA led to the incorrect conclusion that an additional sedimenting species was detected under steady-state conditions. It is now apparent that the most abundant forms of null(Hong Kong) are the 4.5 S and 6.8 S species. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional, more transient species exist.Intracellular disposal of null(Hong Kong) was arrested during incubation of pulse-radiolabeled cells with cycloheximide, and this coincided with complete absence of the 4.5 S monomer population. Cycloheximide had no demonstrable effect on the intracellular stability of null(Hong Kong) in cells preincubated with either tunicamycin or castanospermine, which supported the idea that dissociation from calnexin required protein synthesis. Although our experiments have not addressed the mechanism by which dissociation was inhibited, one possibility is that a short-lived protein is required for normal disruption of the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin complex. Cycloheximide treatment had the added effect of preventing post-translational trimming of oligosaccharides attached to null(Hong Kong). At present, we do not know whether this reflects inaccessibility of glycans for trimming while null(Hong Kong) is bound to calnexin. However, previous experiments have suggested that the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin interaction is stabilized by a peptide-peptide interaction (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, incubation with several combinations of monosaccharides has failed to dissociate the complex after coprecipitation, 2R. N. Sifers, unpublished data. suggesting that the glycan moiety is not involved in stabilizing the interaction after assembly. These data are in agreement with a two-step binding model proposed by Tector and Salter (12Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in which the function of the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide is to initiate assembly of glycoproteins with calnexin. However, we cannot disregard the possibility that a lectin-like interaction does exist, but is disrupted during immunoprecipitation.Intracellular disposal of null(Hong Kong) was also arrested in cells treated with 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which also prevented demonstrable post-translational trimming of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Originally, only one α-mannosidase activity had been assigned to the ER (16Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). However, in recent years, several α-mannosidases have been identified in the ER, many of which are inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin (42Rizzolo L.J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9520-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 44Bause E. Breuer W. Schweden J. Roeser R. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 45Bonay P. Roth J. Hughes C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unlike cycloheximide treatment, in which inhibition of disposal coincided with a complete absence of the 4.5 S peak, inhibition with 1-deoxymannojirimycin did not alter the monomer population. Taken together, data from this study suggest that variant null(Hong Kong) is subjected to a quality control pathway identical to that recently proposed by Hammond and Helenius (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Their model proposes that persistent association between unfolded glycoproteins and calnexin reflects a continuous cycle of binding in which assembly of the complex is facilitated by reglucosylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by the ER resident enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (17Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Trombetta S.E Ganan S. Parodi A.J. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 48Ganan S. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3098-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Importantly, the model predicts that permanent dissociation from the binding cycle will occur when hydrolysis of mannose residues generates an oligosaccharide unable to participate as a glucose acceptor, thereby leading to disposal of the unfolded glycoprotein. Consistent with this model, inhibition of oligosaccharide trimming by 1-deoxymannojirimycin abrogated intracellular disposal of variant null(Hong Kong) without affecting the percent population of 4.5 S monomers present in the cell. This latter finding would be expected if the protein is degraded only when it can no longer participate in the cycle of binding to calnexin, which would result after extensive post-translational trimming of glycans by α-mannosidase. Further dissection of this quality control pathway will be the subject of future investigations and will enhance our current understanding of how incompletely folded human AAT variants are retained and degraded in hepatocytes. INTRODUCTIONConformational maturation of nascent polypeptides is facilitated by transient physical interaction with molecular chaperones. The general consensus is that rounds of binding prevent misfolding and subsequent entrance of partially folded intermediates into nonproductive folding pathways (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, nascent polypeptides destined to traverse compartments of the secretory pathway are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumAATα1-antitrypsinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. during biosynthesis (2Walter P.

Incompletely folded proteins often exhibit a persistent physical association with one or more molecular chaperones and are retained in the ER prior to intracellular disposal (for a review, see 3Klausner R.D.

The correctly folded variant PI M1(Val-213) is rapidly secreted from these cells, whereas null(Hong Kong) is subjected to intracellular retention and disposal (37Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S.

In this study, cosedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation analyses indicated that newly synthesized molecules sedimented at 6.8 S, which coincided with their quantitative association with the molecular chaperone calnexin. This indicates that assembly of the complex occurred cotranslationally or immediately following biosynthesis.Interaction with calnexin was prevented by inhibiting asparagine-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin or by arresting cotranslational trimming of attached glucose residues with castanospermine. This indicates that like many other glycoproteins (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 47Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), oligosaccharides may somehow function to facilitate assembly between null(Hong Kong) and calnexin. Intracellular disposal of nascent null(Hong Kong) was accelerated in cells preincubated with either tunicamycin or castanospermine, suggesting that disposal occurs in the absence of the bound molecular chaperone. This idea was consistent with appearance of the 4.5 S species at a time point that coincided with the onset of intracellular disposal. The absence of associated calnexin and sedimentation at 4.5 S suggests that this population of molecules represents the released monomer (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J.

No changes in the monomer population were observed when cell lysis was performed under less stringent conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the 4.5 S population does not merely reflect weakening of the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin interaction during retention, but represents unassociated molecules. It should be pointed out that in an earlier report (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an error in our fractionation method, overlap between the 4.5 S and 6.8 S species, and incomplete dissociation of complexes in response to incubation with EGTA led to the incorrect conclusion that an additional sedimenting species was detected under steady-state conditions. It is now apparent that the most abundant forms of null(Hong Kong) are the 4.5 S and 6.8 S species. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional, more transient species exist.Intracellular disposal of null(Hong Kong) was arrested during incubation of pulse-radiolabeled cells with cycloheximide, and this coincided with complete absence of the 4.5 S monomer population. Cycloheximide had no demonstrable effect on the intracellular stability of null(Hong Kong) in cells preincubated with either tunicamycin or castanospermine, which supported the idea that dissociation from calnexin required protein synthesis. Although our experiments have not addressed the mechanism by which dissociation was inhibited, one possibility is that a short-lived protein is required for normal disruption of the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin complex. Cycloheximide treatment had the added effect of preventing post-translational trimming of oligosaccharides attached to null(Hong Kong). At present, we do not know whether this reflects inaccessibility of glycans for trimming while null(Hong Kong) is bound to calnexin. However, previous experiments have suggested that the null(Hong Kong)-calnexin interaction is stabilized by a peptide-peptide interaction (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, incubation with several combinations of monosaccharides has failed to dissociate the complex after coprecipitation, 2R. N. Sifers, unpublished data. suggesting that the glycan moiety is not involved in stabilizing the interaction after assembly. These data are in agreement with a two-step binding model proposed by Tector and Salter (12Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in which the function of the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide is to initiate assembly of glycoproteins with calnexin. However, we cannot disregard the possibility that a lectin-like interaction does exist, but is disrupted during immunoprecipitation.Intracellular disposal of null(Hong Kong) was also arrested in cells treated with 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which also prevented demonstrable post-translational trimming of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Originally, only one α-mannosidase activity had been assigned to the ER (16Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). However, in recent years, several α-mannosidases have been identified in the ER, many of which are inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin (42Rizzolo L.J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9520-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 44Bause E. Breuer W. Schweden J.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unlike cycloheximide treatment, in which inhibition of disposal coincided with a complete absence of the 4.5 S peak, inhibition with 1-deoxymannojirimycin did not alter the monomer population. Taken together, data from this study suggest that variant null(Hong Kong) is subjected to a quality control pathway identical to that recently proposed by Hammond and Helenius (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Their model proposes that persistent association between unfolded glycoproteins and calnexin reflects a continuous cycle of binding in which assembly of the complex is facilitated by reglucosylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by the ER resident enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (17Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J.

Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3098-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Importantly, the model predicts that permanent dissociation from the binding cycle will occur when hydrolysis of mannose residues generates an oligosaccharide unable to participate as a glucose acceptor, thereby leading to disposal of the unfolded glycoprotein. Consistent with this model, inhibition of oligosaccharide trimming by 1-deoxymannojirimycin abrogated intracellular disposal of variant null(Hong Kong) without affecting the percent population of 4.5 S monomers present in the cell. This latter finding would be expected if the protein is degraded only when it can no longer participate in the cycle of binding to calnexin, which would result after extensive post-translational trimming of glycans by α-mannosidase. Further dissection of this quality control pathway will be the subject of future investigations and will enhance our current understanding of how incompletely folded human AAT variants are retained and degraded in hepatocytes. Since hepatocytes are the major site for biosynthesis and secretion of AAT (28Peters Jr., T. Glaumann H. Peters Jr., T. Redman C. Plasma Protein Secretion by the Liver. Academic Press, New York1983: 1-5Google Scholar, 46Sifers R.N. Carlson J.A. Clift S.M. DeMayo F.J. Bullock D.W. Woo S.L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1459-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), stably transfected mouse hepatoma cells were used to study conformation-based quality control of human AAT secretion. Variant null(Hong Kong) was employed for this analysis because truncation of amino acids at its carboxyl terminus prevents formation of all three large β-sheet structures common to members of the serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily (32Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 35Loebermann H. Tobuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The correctly folded variant PI M1(Val-213) is rapidly secreted from these cells, whereas null(Hong Kong) is subjected to intracellular retention and disposal (37Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, cosedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation analyses indicated that newly synthesized molecules sedimented at 6.8 S, which coincided with their quantitative association with the molecular chaperone calnexin. This indicates that assembly of the complex occurred cotranslationally or immediately following biosynthesis. Interaction with calnexin was prevented by inhibiting asparagine-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin or by arresting cotranslational trimming of attached glucose residues with castanospermine. This indicates that like many other glycoproteins (11Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 47Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), oligosaccharides may somehow function to facilitate assembly between null(Hong Kong) and calnexin. Intracellular disposal of nascent null(Hong Kong) was accelerated in cells preincubated with either tunicamycin or castanospermine, suggesting that disposal occurs in the absence of the bound molecular chaperone. This idea was consistent with appearance of the 4.5 S species at a time point that coincided with the onset of intracellular disposal. The absence of associated calnexin and sedimentation at 4.5 S suggests that this population of molecules represents the released monomer (36Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q.-Q.A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2059129888,"The effects of the components of the protein C pathway on thrombin generation were studied in a reconstituted model in which thrombin is generated by factor VIIa and relipidated tissue factor (TF) via the activation of the purified coagulation factors X, IX, VIII, V, and prothrombin. The influence of protein C and soluble thrombomodulin on thrombin generation was correlated with factor Xa generation, factor V(a) and factor VIII(a) formation/inactivation, and protein C activation. Thrombin generation initiated by low concentrations of factor VIIa·TF (1.25 pM) occurs in an explosive fashion during a propagation phase which occurs after an initiation phase of ∼1 min in which only traces of thrombin are formed. In the absence of other inhibitors, protein C (65 nM) in combination with high concentrations of soluble thrombomodulin (10 nM) resulted in a reduced rate of thrombin generation during the propagation phase without affecting the initiation phase; the activated protein C generated failed to neutralize prothrombinase activity and did not prevent prothrombin consumption. In the presence of plasma levels of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (2.5 nM recombinant TFPI), the protein C pathway reduced the rate of thrombin generation, initiated by 1.25 pM factor VIIa·TF, and completely eliminated prothrombinase activity at soluble thrombomodulin concentrations of ≥1 nM. The neutralization of prothrombinase activity coincided with cleavages at Arg-506 and subsequent cleavage at Arg-306 of the factor Va heavy chain by activated protein C. Thus, the protein C pathway combined with TFPI creates a minimal inhibitory potential required to shut down TF-initiated thrombin generation. The protein C pathway constituents did not influence factor Xa generation or factor VIIIa degradation over the interval in which prothrombinaseactivity was neutralized. Our data thus suggest that the protein C pathway regulates thrombin generation solely by the inactivation of factor Va. At low initiating factor VIIa·TF (1.25 pM) and high thrombomodulin concentrations (10 nM), the factor Va heavy chain is cleaved before significant amounts of light chain are generated. The ability of the protein C pathway to inhibit thrombin generation was greatly reduced when the reaction was initiated in the presence of factor Va, supporting the hypothesis that effective down-regulation of thrombin generation by the protein C pathway, in reactions initiated with the procofactor, occurs by prevention of the coexistence of the factor Va heavy and light chains.

The extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation initiated by tissue factor involves the activation of multiple coagulation factors leading to thrombin generation. The reaction starts with the binding of plasma factor VIIa to tissue factor (TF), 1The abbreviations used are: TFtissue factorTFPItissue factor pathway inhibitorAPCactivated protein CPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAT-IIIantithrombin-IIIFPR-ckD-phenylalanyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketoneLClight chainHCheavy chainTAPtick anticoagulant peptide. an integral membrane protein that is exposed as a result of either vessel wall injury or cytokine activation of endothelial cells and/or peripheral blood monocytes. The membrane bound factor VIIa·TF enzyme complex activates the zymogens factor X and factor IX by limited proteolysis (1Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Factor IXa combines with factor VIIIa on the membrane surface to form the intrinsic tenase that activates factor X. The factor Xa generated associates with factor Va on a membrane surface to form prothrombinase which activates prothrombin to thrombin. (For reviews on blood coagulation and membrane dependent reactions in blood coagulation see, respectively, 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W.

The thrombin initially formed accelerates further thrombin generation by feedback activation of the procofactors factor V and factor VIII. Deficiencies in factors VII, X, IX, V, VIII, or prothrombin are associated with bleeding. Thrombin stimulates platelets, which secrete their granule contents and aggregate, cleaves fibrinogen to generate the fibrin network, and activates the protransglutaminase factor XIII.

In normal hemostasis, the procoagulant system is in balance with the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic systems. The anticoagulant system consists of several stoichiometric protease inhibitors that include, at a minimum, the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), antithrombin-III (AT-III), and heparin cofactor-II, and the dynamic protein C pathway that involves thrombin, protein C, protein S, and thrombomodulin. The dynamic negative feedback mechanism provided by the protein C pathway is initiated by the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin (for a review on thrombomodulin and protein C see 4Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin changes the specificity of the enzyme, resulting in the loss of procoagulant functions and enhancement of protein C activation. The formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex accelerates the rate of protein C activation approximately 400-fold. Thrombomodulin is constitutively expressed as a transmembrane protein on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, providing an anticoagulant function at the blood/vessel wall interface (4Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and is also present on platelets (5Ogura M. Ito T. Maruyama I. Takamatsu J. Yamamoto S. Ogawa K. Nagura H. Saito H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A recent report of an individual suffering from thrombosis associated with a thrombomodulin mutation leading to a defective protein (6Öhlin A.K. Marlar R.A. Blood. 1995; 85: 330-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the embryonic lethality in mice lacking the thrombomodulin gene (7Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B. Rosenburg R.D. Weiler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) identify the significance of thrombomodulin as a natural anticoagulant. Activated protein C (APC) is thought to exert its inhibitory effect on coagulation by proteolytically inactivating the cofactors of prothrombinase and the intrinsic tenase, factor V(a) and factor VIII(a), respectively (8Suzuki K.

Protein S appears to contribute an accessory function toward the APC inactivation of factor Va and factor VIIIa (14Koedam J.A. Meijers J.C.M. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5521-5524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fulcher C.A. Gardiner J.H. Griffin J.H. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1984; 63: 486-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that protein S directly inhibits prothrombinase activity (19Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of both protein C and protein S as anticoagulants is clearly illustrated by the numerous reports of thrombotic complications in either protein C- or protein S-deficient individuals (20Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S. Kleiss A.J. Wideman C. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 21Comp P.C. Nixon R.R. Cooper M.R. Esmon C.T. J. Clin.

TFPI is a protease inhibitor that regulates coagulation by inhibition of the factor VIIa·TF complex activity in a factor Xa-dependent manner (for a review on TFPI see 22Rapaport S.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TFPI is also a reversible, active site-directed inhibitor of factor Xa. The TFPI·factor Xa complex binds to the factor VIIa·TF complex resulting in the formation of an inhibited TF·factor VIIa·TFPI·factor Xa quaternary complex (23Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Although no human deficiencies have been reported, the in vivo relevance of TFPI is supported by experiments that showed the sensitization of rabbits to TF triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation after immunodepletion of TFPI (24Sandset P.M. Warner-Cramer B.J. Rao L.V.M. Maki S.L. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the absence of coagulation inhibitors, thrombin generation in a reconstituted model (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) initiated by factor VIIa·TF is characterized by an initiation phase, in which the cofactors factor V and factor VIII are activated by traces of factor Xa and thrombin initially produced. After the initiation phase is completed thrombin generation occurs rapidly during the subsequent propagation phase, in which prothrombin is quantitatively activated. The rate of thrombin generation during the propagation phase of reactions initiated by factor VIIa·TF in a reconstituted model in the absence of inhibitors is only mildly influenced when the initiator concentration is varied (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous report we found that TFPI, at physiological concentrations, inhibits thrombin generation by inhibition of factor VIIa·TF activity and by the direct inhibition of factor Xa (26van't Veer C.

TFPI thus extends the initiation phase of thrombin generation and reduces the rate of thrombin generation during the propagation phase; however, in the presence of the components of the factor IX pathway, thrombin generation still becomes explosive after the TFPI extended lag phase (26van't Veer C.

The present study describes the effect of components of the protein C pathway, protein C and thrombomodulin on the tissue factor pathway to thrombin, and the combined actions of the protein C pathway and TFPI.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies αHFV-9, αHFV-17, and αHPC-2 were provided by Dr. William Church, Thrombosis Center Antibody CORE, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Vermont. Human coagulation factors X, IX, and prothrombin were isolated from fresh frozen plasma using the general methods of Bajaj et al. (29Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and were depleted of trace contaminants and traces of the enzyme products as described (26van't Veer C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Human protein C was purified by heparin-Sepharose and immuno-chromatography (monoclonal antibody αHPC-2 coupled to CNBr-activated CL-4B) from the protein C pool eluted in the NaCl gradient of the DEAE-Sepharose column involved in the purification of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Purified protein C was treated for 1 h at 22°C with 20 μM FPR-ck; residual FPR-ck and hydrolysis products were removed by extensive dialysis in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.4 (TBS). Aliquots of the protein solution were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Human protein S was purified from the protein S pool of the DEAE-Sepharose column using Blue-Sepharose chromatography as described by Dahlbäck (30Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The purified protein S was passed over anti-protein C and anti-factor X immunoaffinity columns which were previously equilibrated in TBS. The flow-through of the immunoaffinity columns was concentrated on a 3-ml Q-Sepharose column that was equilibrated in TBS. Protein S was eluted from the Q-Sepharose with TBS containing 1 M NaCl. Possible traces of enzyme activity in the preparation were inhibited by treatment for 1 h with 20 μM FPR-ck at 22°C. Unreacted FPR-ck and hydrolysis products were removed by extensive dialysis in TBS, and the protein S was stored frozen in aliquots at -80°C. Human factor V was isolated from freshly frozen human plasma using the method of Nesheim et al. (31Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G.

Recombinant factor VIII and recombinant tissue factor (consisting of amino acid residues 1-242 of the human sequence, lacking the cytosolic stack) were provided as gifts from Drs. Shu Len Liu and Roger Lundblad, Hyland Division, Baxter Healthcare Corp (Duarte, CA). Factor VIII was radiolabeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN (Pierce) method (32Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 60: 849-857Crossref Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) as described previously (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the use of an excess of radiolabeled factor VIII to obtain the same amount of active factor VIII in the reaction results in identical thrombin generation profiles. Thus, the inactive factor VIII does not inhibit the reaction (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

TLCK anticoagulant peptide (TAP) was provided as a gift from Dr. S. Krishnaswamy, Hematology/Oncology Division, Emory University (Atlanta, GA). Hirudin was provided as a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Thrombin generation initiated by factor VIIa·TF in a reconstituted procoagulant model using plasma protein concentrations was studied as described previously (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue factor (TF) was relipidated at 0.5 nM into 400 μM 75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine vesicles, for 30 min at 37°C in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4 (Hepes/Ca2+). The relipidated TF was incubated with factor VIIa for 20 min at 37°C to allow factor VIIa·TF complex formation. Factor V and factor VIII were added in microliter amounts of concentrated stock solutions to the equilibrated factor VIIa·TF mixture (total volume of addition not exceeding 0.25% of the final reaction volume), and immediately thereafter the reaction was started by the addition of an equal volume of a solution containing factor X, factor IX, and prothrombin, which was prepared in Hepes/Ca2+. The zymogen solution was preheated at 37°C for 3 min before addition to the factor VIIa·TF, factor V, and factor VIII mixture. When protein C, TFPI, or protein S were included, they were added to the factor X, IX, and prothrombin mixture. Thrombomodulin was added to the factor VIIa·TF mixture. The final concentrations of the proteins in the reaction, chosen to represent mean plasma values, are 160 nM factor X, 90 nM factor IX, 0.7 nM factor VIII, 20 nM factor V, and 1.4 μM prothrombin (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When added, protein C (65 nM), protein S (300 nM), and TFPI (2.5 nM) were also present at their respective plasma concentration (33Ikeda K. Stenflo J. Thromb. Res. 1985; 39: 297-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Griffin J.H. Gruber A. Fernandez J.A. Blood. 1992; 79: 3203-3211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Novotny W.F.

The factor VIIa concentrations were varied to change the concentration of the initiator complex, whereas TF was kept constant and in substantial excess at 0.25 nM. The final PCPS concentration in the reaction was 200 μM. Following initiation of the reaction, aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and quenched in either 20 mM EDTA/TBS, pH 7.4, to assay for thrombin formation or in 2% SDS, 0.062 M Tris, 10% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8, for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples quenched in SDS were heated for 5 min at 95°C and stored at -20°C, prior to SDS-PAGE analyses with intact or reduced disulfide bonds (2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 min at 95°C). Assays for thrombin activity were performed using the substrate Spectrozyme TH. Hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices Vmax spectrophotometer. Thrombin generation was calculated from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of α-thrombin. Prothrombinase concentrations were calculated from the rate of thrombin generation using a kcat of 5016 min-1 (36Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21864-21873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xa generation was measured in samples quenched in EDTA and excess hirudin using the substrate Spectrozyme Xa. Assay specificity for factor Xa was guaranteed by subtraction of the signal observed in the presence of excess TAP (2.31 μM), a specific factor Xa inhibitor. Factor Xa concentrations were calculated from a standard curve prepared by serial dilutions of purified factor Xa. Apparent dissociation constants (Kdapp) for prothrombinase were calculated using the equation for the equilibrium relation: Kd = [Vafree]·[Xafree]/[Va·Xa]. APC generation was measured using substrate S2366 in samples that were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and diluted 5-fold into excess hirudin (7 μM), TAP (2.31 μM), and 20 mM EDTA/TBS. APC generation was calculated from a standard curve prepared using serial dilutions of purified APC. Expected rates of enzyme formation were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation: V = (Vmax·[E]·[S])/([S] + KM), in which V is the velocity of product formation, Vmax the maximum product formation at saturating substrate concentrations, [E] the enzyme concentration, [S] the substrate concentration, and KM the Michaelis constant for the particular enzyme-substrate conversion. The samples quenched in SDS were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4-12% polyacrylamide gels as generally described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis using general techniques described by Towbin et al. (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation Co., Los Angeles, CA) (w/v) in TBS containing 0.05% Tween. Generation and inactivation of the factor Va heavy chain was followed by incubating the blocked membranes for 1 h with monoclonal antibody αHFV-17. This antibody recognizes an epitope on the heavy chain of factor V between residues 307 and 506 and reacts with the same fragments of the factor V heavy chain upon cleavage by APC recognized by monoclonal antibody αHFV-6, which was described previously (39Kalafatis M. Lu D. Bertina R.M. Long G.L. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 12: 2181-2187Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Generation of the factor Va light chain was followed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody αHFV-9, which recognizes an epitope on the factor Va light chain (40Kalafatis M. Haley P.E. Lu D. Bertina R.M. Long G.L. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4708-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a 1:5000 dilution, Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL) using the chemiluminescent substrate Luminol (Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent, DuPont NEN). Light emitted from the hydrolysis of the added Luminol substrate was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Films were developed in a Kodak X-Omat and scanned using a Microscan 1000 scanning densitometer (TRI, Inc). Products of radiolabeled factor VIII formed in the reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described previously (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments the membranes that were used for immunoblotting factor V products were washed with 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.7, to remove bound antibodies and probed for prothrombin products using a polyclonal burro anti-prethrombin-1 (Grettle) antibody as described (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of protein C and thrombomodulin were studied on factor VIIa·TF (1.25 pM)-initiated thrombin generation as described under “Materials and Methods.” At this concentration of initiating complex, thrombin generation occurs explosively after approximately 60 s in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1, filled circles). Neither protein C at its physiological concentration (65 nM) (Fig. 1, open squares) nor thrombomodulin (10 nM) (open triangles) influenced thrombin generation when added separately. The absence of an effect of thrombomodulin alone on thrombin generation indicates that the soluble thrombomodulin used at concentrations up to 10 nM does not interfere with the activation of factor V or factor VIII by thrombin, critical steps during the initiation phase of the reaction (25Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of thrombin generation in the presence of 65 nM protein C and varying concentrations of soluble thrombomodulin are displayed in Fig. 1. The initiation phase of the reaction does not appear to be influenced in the presence of protein C at thrombomodulin concentrations up to 10 nM (Fig. 1, inverted triangles). No effect on the rate of thrombin generation during the propagation phase is observed in the presence of protein C (65 nM) at thrombomodulin concentrations ≤1 nM (Fig. 1, filled squares). However, at 2.5 nM thrombomodulin the rate of thrombin generation is significantly decreased during the propagation phase as compared with the control (Fig. 1, stars). At 5 and 10 nM thrombomodulin (Fig. 1, diamonds and inverted triangles, respectively), the rate of thrombin generation declines after approximately 100 nM thrombin is formed, resulting in an extended period of relatively low prothrombinase activity. Subsequently, thrombin generation increases again. These delayed propagation phases, however, ultimately result in the quantitative activation of prothrombin after 20 min. The delayed increase in thrombin generation is most probably the result of the accumulation of factor Xa activated by the uninhibited factor VIIa·TF complex and the continuously generated factor IXa·factor VIIIa complex. The large amount of factor Xa that accumulates probably produces activity by prothrombinase complex formation with traces of intact or partially degraded factor Va. Thrombin is generated at a rate of 100 nM/min in the delayed propagation phase of the reaction, which, based on a kcat for prothrombinase of 5016 min-1 (36Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Hemker H.C.

THP-1 cells expressed on average about 5000 MCP-1 receptors/cell. Differentiation of the cells induced by phorbol myristate acetate resulted in a 75% reduction of receptor gene expression within 2 h. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor had only moderate effect on hCCR2 expression. However, interferon γ inhibited MCP-1 binding by 60% at 48 h. The combination of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon γ increased the inhibition to 80% at 48 h. This treatment has been shown previously to induce secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) in monocytes. Incubation of THP-1 cells with TNF-α and IL-1 induced a rapid down-regulation of hCCR2 expression and eventual loss of receptor protein. These cytokines exerted their regulatory role at the level of gene transcription. The effect of TNF-α alone persisted for 48 h, whereas the cells treated with IL-1 alone regained all of their receptor activity by 48 h.

https://openalex.org/W1998678765,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae AP-1 protein (yAP-1) is a key mediator of oxidative stress tolerance. Transcriptional activation by yAP-1 has been shown to be inducible by exposure of cells to H2O2 and diamide, among other oxidative stress eliciting compounds. Here we define the segments of the yAP-1 protein that are required to respond to this environmental challenge. Western blotting analyses indicated that levels of yAP-1 do not change during oxidative stress. Deletion mutagenesis and gene fusion experiments indicate that two different segments of yAP-1 are required for oxidative stress inducibility. These two domains function differentially depending on the type of oxidant used to generate oxidative stress. Three repeated cysteine-serine-glutamate sequences located in the carboxyl terminus are required for normal regulation of yAP-1 function during oxidative stress. Replacement of these cysteine-serine-glutamate repeats by alanine residues does not similarly affect H2O2 and diamide regulation of yAP-1 function. While yAP-1 transactivation is enhanced by exposure to either H2O2 or diamide, the protein responds to the oxidative stress produced by these compounds in nonidentical ways."

In many cell types, the cytoplasmic focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, FAK, appears to be the initial protein that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to adhesion; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating integrin-triggered FAK phosphorylation are not understood. Previous studies have shown that the integrin β1, β3, and β5 subunit cytoplasmic domains all contain sufficient information to trigger FAK phosphorylation when expressed in single-subunit chimeric receptors connected to an extracellular reporter. In the present study, β3 cytoplasmic domain deletion and substitution mutants were constructed to identify amino acids within the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain that regulate its ability to trigger FAK phosphorylation. Cells transiently expressing chimeric receptors containing these mutant cytoplasmic domains were magnetically sorted and assayed for the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Analysis of these mutants indicated that structural information in both the membrane-proximal and C-terminal segments of the β3 cytoplasmic domain is important for triggering FAK phosphorylation. In the C-terminal segment of the β3 cytoplasmic domain, the highly conserved NPXY motif was found to be required for the β3 cytoplasmic domain to trigger FAK phosphorylation. However, the putative FAK binding domain within the N-terminal segment of the β3 cytoplasmic domain was found to be neither required nor sufficient for this signaling event. We also demonstrate that the serine 752 to proline mutation, known to cause a variant of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, inhibits the ability of the β3 cytoplasmic domain to signal FAK phosphorylation, suggesting that a single mutation in the β3 cytoplasmic domain can inhibit both “inside-out” and “outside-in” integrin signaling.

Furthermore, eIF1A acted catalytically in this reaction to mediate highly efficient transfer of the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits.

Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar), the first step involves the binding of GTP and the initiator Met-tRNAf to initiation factor eIF2 to form the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex, which is then transferred to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in a reaction that is stimulated approximately 2-fold by the multi-subunit initiation factor eIF3 to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (eIF3·40 S·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). The 40 S preinitiation complex then binds to the capped 5ʹ end of mRNA in a reaction requiring eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B and begins scanning the mRNA until it selects the appropriate initiation AUG codon where the 40 S complex is positioned on the mRNA through codon-anticodon base pairing to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·mRNA·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). Initiation factor eIF5 then interacts with the 40 S initiation complex resulting in the hydrolysis of 40 S subunit-bound GTP. The hydrolysis leads to the release of the initiation factors bound to the complex and the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S complex to form the functional 80 S initiation complex (1Maitra U.

It has been reported that a 17-kDa protein, eIF1A (formerly called eIF-4C), stimulates formation of both the 40 S and 80 S initiation complexes about 2- and 3-fold, respectively (6Thomas A.

However, the function of these proteins in the initiation pathway is not clearly understood.In our laboratory, we have been studying each partial reaction of the initiation pathway separately to define the requirements of each reaction. We have previously shown (13Chaudhuri A. Stringer E.A. Valenzuela D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3988-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that when the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits and AUG at an elevated Mg2+ concentration of 5 mM (the physiological Mg2+ concentration is about 1-2 mM), the ternary complex was efficiently transferred to 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the stable 40 S initiation complex (40 S·AUG·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP) without the requirement for any additional initiation factors. This 40 S initiation complex served as an efficient substrate for the eIF5-mediated joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to form a functional 80 S initiation complex (13Chaudhuri A. Stringer E.A.

However, we have now observed that when Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits and AUG at a more physiological Mg2+ concentration of 1-2 mM, little or no transfer of Met-tRNAf to 40 S subunits occurred. During the course of purification of initiation factors from 0.5 M KCl ribosomal wash proteins from rabbit reticulocyte lysates, we observed that the addition of a protein fraction eluting from the phosphocellulose column with 1 M KCl to the 40 S initiation reaction mixture at 1 or 2 mM Mg2+ supported efficient transfer of the ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Purification and characterization of the stimulatory factor present in the 1 M phosphocellulose eluate showed that the activity responsible for this transfer is the 17-kDa-eIF1A. This result was surprising in view of the previous reports (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H.

Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that eIF1A stimulated 40 S initiation complex formation only 1.5-2-fold.In this paper, we have used homogeneous eIF1A isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysates as well as bacterially expressed recombinant eIF1A to investigate the role of this protein in the formation of 40 S and 80 S ribosomal initiation complexes. The function of this protein as a ribosomal subunit anti-association factor has also been studied. The results we have obtained demonstrate that eIF1A is essential for the transfer of Met-tRNAf (as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits prior to the binding of mRNA to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. In contrast to reports from other laboratories (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B.

Purified eIF1A stimulated the translation of globin mRNA in the reticulocyte system 3-5-fold (33Kemper W.M. Berry K.W. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

Kainuma M. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22788-22794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that the S. cerevisiae gene encoding eIF1A is essential for cell growth and viability is at variance with the weak effect eIF1A has for in vitro formation of 40 S and 80 S initiation complexes (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that in vitro, eIF1A stimulates both AUG-dependent or globin mRNA-dependent 40 S initiation complex formation about 1.5-2-fold by stabilizing the binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits which facilitates subsequent mRNA binding (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

It has also been reported that eIF1A has a pronounced effect on the eIF5-mediated joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to the 40 S initiation complex to form the 80 S initiation complex (7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factor has also been implicated in the dissociation of 80 S ribosomes to 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Goumans H. Thomas A. Verhoeven A. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 608: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, eIF1A has been designated a pleiotropic factor in the initiation pathway (4Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar).In the present work, we have used a model initiation system that directly measures the binding of Met-tRNAf (as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunit in the absence of mRNA to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. We have demonstrated that the transfer of Met-tRNAf (as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunit at physiological 1-2 mM Mg2+ requires the absolute participation of eIF1A. This effect did not require the presence of either mRNA or AUG in the reaction indicating that eIF1A is essential for the formation of 40 S preinitiation complex. In agreement with the results published from other laboratories (7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 8Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), eIF3 also stimulated the transfer of the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomes. However, the efficiency of the transfer reaction was much greater with eIF1A than with eIF3 alone (15-20-fold stimulation with eIF1A vis à vis 2-4-fold with eIF3). In the presence of eIF1A alone, the transfer of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomes was nearly quantitative. Furthermore, under our conditions of analysis, we could not detect stable binding of eIF1A to the 40 S preinitiation complex thus convincingly demonstrating that the protein is not required to stabilize the binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomes, as suggested by others (4Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar, 5Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B.

Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the absence of eIF1A in the 40 S initiation complex isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation has allowed us to use the complex as a direct substrate for the 60 S subunit joining reaction. We demonstrate that eIF5 alone was sufficient to mediate subunit joining reaction to form the 80 S initiation complex, and eIF1A had no effect on this reaction. The factor also has no demonstrable role in generating 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits from 80 S ribosomes.Our results raise substantial doubt in the current view (4Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar) that eIF1A is a pleiotropic factor in initiation of translation with only a marginal effect (1.5-2-fold) on 40 S initiation complex formation but with a somewhat greater effect on the subsequent joining reaction. The reasons for the discrepancy are not immediately apparent. The previous experiments (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 8Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that led to the current model (4Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar) of the initiation pathway measured 40 S initiation complex formation in in vitro reactions that included all known initiation factors. The function of a specific protein, e.g. eIF1A, was then determined by its omission from the complete system and measuring ribosomal initiation complex formation in its absence. An inherent problem with such experiments is that a trace contamination of the protein being analyzed in other initiation factor preparations would underestimate the requirement of this factor in initiation complex formation. This will be especially true for a low molecular weight protein like eIF1A which acts catalytically in the formation of 40 S preinitiation complex. Furthermore, the discrepancy between our finding that eIF1A does not directly affect subunit joining and those that show it does (7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be explained. Unlike our experimental approach, presented in Fig. 8, previous investigators did not utilize an isolated 40 S initiation complex, free of unreacted reaction components, as the substrate for the subunits' joining reaction. Rather, they formed the 40 S initiation complex in situ in the presence of either AUG codon (9Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or globin mRNA (7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and all the required initiation factors except eIF1A and then added eIF1A, eIF5, and 60 S subunits to these reactions and measured the formation of 80 S initiation complex. Under these conditions, the observed increase of 80 S initiation complex formation by eIF1A can be accounted for by the stimulatory effect of this factor on the 40 S initiation complex formation.Finally, it should be mentioned that although the present work demonstrates that eIF1A is essential to mediate nearly quantitative transfer of Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to free 40 S ribosomal subunits, it is likely that in vivo the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex binds, in the presence of eIF1A, to an eIF3·40 S complex rather than to free 40 S ribosomal subunits, since the majority of native 40 S subunits contains bound eIF3 (37Smith K.E. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6880-6884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Schienkuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have, however, shown that the transfer of the ternary complex to 40 S subunits is inefficient in the presence of eIF3 alone, whereas eIF1A, by itself, is both necessary and sufficient to mediate highly efficient transfer of the ternary complex. These findings lead us to speculate that the major role of eIF3 is not in the initial transfer of the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomes but rather in the subsequent binding of mRNA to the 40 S preinitiation complex. Similar conclusions regarding eIF3 were also reached by Trachsel et al. (7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONThe initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells occurs by a sequence of well defined partial reactions that require a large number of specific proteins called eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic translation initiation factorFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography.

Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 113-138Google Scholar). According to the current accepted view of initiation (4Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 31-69Google Scholar), the first step involves the binding of GTP and the initiator Met-tRNAf to initiation factor eIF2 to form the Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex, which is then transferred to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in a reaction that is stimulated approximately 2-fold by the multi-subunit initiation factor eIF3 to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (eIF3·40 S·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). The 40 S preinitiation complex then binds to the capped 5ʹ end of mRNA in a reaction requiring eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B and begins scanning the mRNA until it selects the appropriate initiation AUG codon where the 40 S complex is positioned on the mRNA through codon-anticodon base pairing to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·mRNA·eIF3·Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). Initiation factor eIF5 then interacts with the 40 S initiation complex resulting in the hydrolysis of 40 S subunit-bound GTP. The hydrolysis leads to the release of the initiation factors bound to the complex and the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S complex to form the functional 80 S initiation complex (1Maitra U.

It has been reported that a 17-kDa protein, eIF1A (formerly called eIF-4C), stimulates formation of both the 40 S and 80 S initiation complexes about 2- and 3-fold, respectively (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues of eIF1A and another low molecular weight initiation factor, eIF1, have been shown to be essential genes (10Wei C.-L. Kainuma M. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22788-22794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell.

However, the function of these proteins in the initiation pathway is not clearly understood.In our laboratory, we have been studying each partial reaction of the initiation pathway separately to define the requirements of each reaction. We have previously shown (13Chaudhuri A. Stringer E.A. Valenzuela D. Maitra U. J. Biol.

This 40 S initiation complex served as an efficient substrate for the eIF5-mediated joining of 60 S ribosomal subunits to form a functional 80 S initiation complex (13Chaudhuri A. Stringer E.A.

However, we have now observed that when Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits and AUG at a more physiological Mg2+ concentration of 1-2 mM, little or no transfer of Met-tRNAf to 40 S subunits occurred. During the course of purification of initiation factors from 0.5 M KCl ribosomal wash proteins from rabbit reticulocyte lysates, we observed that the addition of a protein fraction eluting from the phosphocellulose column with 1 M KCl to the 40 S initiation reaction mixture at 1 or 2 mM Mg2+ supported efficient transfer of the ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Purification and characterization of the stimulatory factor present in the 1 M phosphocellulose eluate showed that the activity responsible for this transfer is the 17-kDa-eIF1A. This result was surprising in view of the previous reports (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H.

The function of this protein as a ribosomal subunit anti-association factor has also been studied. The results we have obtained demonstrate that eIF1A is essential for the transfer of Met-tRNAf (as Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits prior to the binding of mRNA to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. In contrast to reports from other laboratories (6Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B.

These effectors display their action through their own nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR). PPAR and TR are ligand-dependent, DNA binding, trans-acting transcriptional factors belonging to the erbA-related nuclear receptor superfamily. The present study focused on the convergence of the effectors on the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE). Transcriptional activation induced by PPAR through a PPRE was significantly suppressed by cotransfection of TR in transient transfection assays. The inhibition, however, was not affected by adding 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Furthermore, the inhibition was not observed in cells cotransfected with retinoic acid receptor or vitamin D3 receptor. The inhibitory action by TR was lost by introducing a mutation in the DNA binding domain of TR, indicating that competition for DNA binding is involved in the molecular basis of this functional interaction. Gel shift assays revealed that TRs, expressed in insect cells, specifically bound to the 32P-labeled PPRE as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Both PPAR and TR bind to PPRE, although only PPAR mediates transcriptional activation via PPRE. TR·RXR heterodimers are potential competitors with PPAR·RXR for binding to PPREs. It is concluded that PPAR-mediated gene expression is negatively controlled by TR at the level of PPAR binding to PPRE.

Some of these compounds have been used in man as hypolipidemic agents. PPs have been shown to induce peroxisomal and microsomal enzymes involved in lipid metabolism through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (8Issemann I. Green S.

The PPAR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcriptional factors and is structurally related to the subfamily of receptors that includes the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) (10Laudet V.

PPARs regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequence elements termed PPAR response elements (PPRE). PPREs have recently been identified in the 5′-flanking sequences of peroxisome proliferator-inducible genes such as the rat acyl-CoA oxidase (aox) gene (19Osumi T. Wen J.K. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the former is the key enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation and that of latter catalyzes ω and ω-1 hydroxylation of fatty acids. PPREs are composed of two direct AGG(A/T)CA repeats separated by a single nucleotide (DR1), which is similar to previously described retinoid X response elements (22Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). These direct repeat motifs are also found in a number of other nuclear receptor response elements, e.g. the TRE, RARE, VDRE (22Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Each receptor can recognize the same half-site motif. However, they discriminate between target elements through the spacing between the half-site motifs. It is well established that heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) strongly enhances binding of the TR, RAR, and VDR to their cognate response elements (23Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 24Kliewer S.A.

Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Like other members of this subfamily, it has been demonstrated that PPAR binds to the PPRE by forming a heterodimer with RXR (27Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 28Gearing K.L. Gottlicher M. Teboul M. Widmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1440-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that PPAR may exhibit promiscuous cross-talk with other members of the nuclear receptor family (29Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11683-11686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone is another effector that influences lipid metabolism including fatty acid β-oxidation (30Heimberg M. Olubadewo J.O. Wilcox H.G. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 590-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Ichikawa K. Hashizume K. Yamada T. Hashimoto T. Endocrinol.

TRs and PPAR appear to play an important role in lipid metabolism, and their signaling pathways might be coupled. Based on the considerations described above, we focused on the convergence of TRα1 and PPARα signaling pathways on PPREs. We have examined the suppressive effects of TRα1 expression on PPARα-mediated transcriptional activation of peroxisome proliferator response genes. We demonstrated that TRα1 negatively regulates PPARα action on PPREs through competition for DNA binding, and this negative regulation occurs in a ligand (T3) -independent manner. In addition, we present evidence that PPRE (DR1) is a high affinity binding site for TRα1 but not a functional response element for TRα1. TRα1 cannot activate PPRE in the presence of T3, despite its specific and high affinity binding to the element as a heterodimer with RXR. These results imply that binding to DNA is necessary but not sufficient for T3-dependent transcriptional regulation by TR. Total RNA was extracted from rat liver using a guanidinium thiocyanate method. A cDNA pool was made by reverse transcriptase and (dT)17 primer. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique was applied to amplify the rat PPARα cDNA using reported primers as follows: 5′-ATGGTGGACACAGAGAGCCCCATCTGTCCT-3′ as sense primer and 5′-TCAGTACATGTCTCTGTAGATCTCTTGCAA-3′ as antisense primer (14Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the isolated rat PPARα cDNA was confirmed by sequencing (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the plasmid constructs used in this study. Full-length rat PPARα was inserted into the BamHI site of pCMV expression plasmid using BamHI linkers. Human TRα1 and mutant TR were also expressed under the control of the CMV promoter (pCDM) (35Miyamoto T. Suzuki S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Cell.

The TRα1 DNA binding domain mutant (DBD mutant) was made by introducing a cysteine to serine substitution at amino acid 73 using a site-directed mutagenesis system (pSELECT vector, Promega) as described previously (36Liu R.-T. Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar). RARα and VDR cDNA are kind gifts from Dr. R. M. Evans (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and Dr. B. W. O'Malley (Baylor College, TX), respectively. The coding sequences of RARα or VDR was amplified by PCR and inserted into the BamHI site of pCMV expression vector. PPRE-TK-luciferase reporter plasmid harbors three copies of PPRE from the aox promoter in front of the TK promoter (27Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The reporter employing the native promoter for aox (27Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar) is kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Evans. The DR4-TK-luciferase reporter plasmid contains one copy of the DR4-TRE sequence, 5′-GGATCCAGGTCACAGGAGGTCAGGATCC-3′. COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (36Liu R.-T. Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in 24-well plates. In general, each dish received 250 ng of reporter construct, 0.8-50 ng of expression vector, 50 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to monitor the efficiency of transfection and, if necessary, carrier DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene) to reach a total of 450 ng of DNA. Twenty hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by that containing T3 (10−7 M) or clofibric acids (10−3M), and an additional 24 h later, cells were harvested and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity (36Liu R.-T. Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar, 37Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. Opsahl A. Sakurai A. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase was measured by the method previously described (38Miyamoto T. Suzuki S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 224-231PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed using the PicaGene Luciferase Assay System (Toyo Inki, Tokyo). Cells were harvested by adding 50 μl/well Cell Culture Lysis Reagent buffer. Samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g) at 4° C for 10 min, and the supernatant was retained for assay. Luciferase assays were performed by adding 30 μl of cell extract to 100 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent. The reactions were performed at room temperature and assessed using Lumat LB9501 (Berthold Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as relative light units. Luciferase activities were corrected for the β-galactosidase activity present. Assays were conducted in triplicate, and data represent the mean ± S.E. of more than three individual experiments. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described in several reports (38Miyamoto T. Suzuki S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 224-231PubMed Google Scholar). In standard conditions, synthetic oligonucleotides representing each strand of sequences were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted, and annealed. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (>3300 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) by fill-in reactions using Klenow large fragment DNA polymerase. Labeled probes were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-25 column, which was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl. Radiolabeled probes (10 fmol, 20,000-30,000 cpm) were then incubated with binding proteins in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) buffer, 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM KCl, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. These reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 200 V at 4°C in the same buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum and autoradiographed for 6-12 h at room temperature. Complexes were quantified by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs and by liquid scintillation counting of excised gel slices. Both methods gave essentially identical results. The sequences of the probes used in this study are listed as follows: PPRE 5′-gatccTGACCTTTGTCCTg-3′ for sense strand; 5′-gatccAGGACAAAGGTCAg-3′ for antisense strand; DR4 5′-gatccAGGTCACAGGAGGTCAg-3′ for sense strand; 5′-gatccTGACCTCCTGTGACCTg-3′ for antisense strand. The source of PPRE and DR4 are from aox gene and rat malic enzyme gene, respectively. In a transient transfection system using COS1 cells, coexpression of TRα1 suppressed the PPRE-TK luciferase activity induced by PPARα in the presence of clofibric acid, whereas equivalent amounts of the empty expression vector did not inhibit PPARα-mediated transcription (Fig. 2). In the absence of PPRE, TK-luciferase reporter was not affected by cotransfection of PPARα or TRα1 in the presence of clofibric acid or T3, respectively (Fig. 2). Cotransfection of increasing amounts of TRα1 expression vector showed that the inhibitory effect of TRα1 on PPRE occurred at doses of TRα1 similar to those necessary for activation of a T3 response element (DR4-TRE) (Fig. 3), suggesting a physiological role of TRα1 in negative control of gene expression through PPRE. Then we tested the specificity of the inhibitory effect among other members of the nuclear receptor family. Expression plasmids for RARα or VDR were cotransfected with the expression vector for PPARα and PPRE-TK-luciferase reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 4, RARα or VDR did not inhibit the trans-activation of PPRE-TK-luciferase reporter by PPARα, whereas TRα1 effectively blocked the transcriptional activation of the reporter.Fig. 3Dose dependence of TR expression plasmid for PPAR inhibition and TRE activation. COS1 cells were transfected with PPRE-TK-luciferase reporter plasmid (250 ng) and 12.5 ng of pCMV-PPAR expression vector (A) or DR4-TK-luciferase reporter plasmid (250 ng) (B). Indicated amounts of pCDM-TRα1 expression plasmid were cotransfected. Cells were treated with vehicle or 10−3M clofibric acid (A) or T3 (10−3M) (B).

They showed that inhibition of this gene by TR was through titration of limiting amounts of RXR. To test this possibility, RXRa expression plasmid was cotransfected into COS1 cells in which inhibitory activity of TRα1 occurred. As shown in Fig. 4, the inhibitory effect of TRα1 is not obliterated by cotransfection of expression plasmid for RXRα, suggesting that inhibition is not due to squelching of the cofactor, RXR. This in vivo study indicates that sequestering of RXR is not responsible for the inhibitory effect of TRα1. To define the mechanism for inhibitory effect of TRα1 on PPARα action, we examined the contribution of the DNA binding domain of TRα1 to this inhibition. A mutation introduced into the P box in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the TRα1 was designed to prevent its binding to DNA (TRα1 DBD mutant) (36Liu R.-T. Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar). In transient cotransfection assay, as shown in Fig. 5, the DBD mutant did not show an inhibitory effect on PPARα, indicating that competition for DNA binding is involved. These results indicate that TRα1 regulates PPARα-mediated transcriptional activation of genes containing PPRE through competing binding to PPRE. Expression of wild type and DBD mutant proteins, as determined by Western blot, has been previously reported (36Liu R.-T. Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the wild type and mutant proteins was examined by transfection of expression plasmids into COS1 cells. T3 binding capacity of protein expressed by pCDα1 DBD mutant was, as expected, equivalent to wild type and was not influenced by cotransfection of PPAR expression vector (Table I). It is logical to consider that the lack of inhibition by the DBD mutant receptor is not due to the amounts of mutant protein present in COS1 cells in transient transfection assays.Table IProtein expression of TRa1 and its DBD mutant in COS1 cellsMinus PPARPPARPPAR + clofibric acid (+)TRα131.4 ± 4.130.0 ± 3.433.2 ± 4.8TRα1(BDB)mut32.5 ± 3.533.4 ± 4.634.2 ± 4.2 Open table in a new tab We tested whether TRα1 can inhibit PPARα activity on a native promoter as well as an heterogeneous promoter (TK promoter). We confirmed transcriptional regulation by TR of the gene containing a PPRE, using a rat acyl-CoA oxidase (aox) gene promoter. aox-luciferase reporter plasmid was activated by PPARα in the presence of clofibric acid. This activation was completely suppressed by cotransfection of TRα1 expression plasmid (Fig. 6). These results are similar to those observed when PPRE-TK luciferase was used. To test the ability of TRα1 to bind to PPRE in vitro, gel mobility shift assay was performed using TRα1 and RXRα expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The results of these experiments employing TRα1, RXRa, and 32P-labeled probes are shown in Fig. 7. TRα1 plus RXRa produced a retarded heterodimeric band with PPRE, and increasing amounts of unlabeled probe displaced the binding, as observed when a classical TRE (DR4) was utilized as a probe. To achieve high concentrations of DNA, we diluted a fixed amount of the particular radioactive probe with increasing amounts of unlabeled DNA and approximately corrected the specific activity in calculations. Bound and free complexes were quantified by a densitometric analysis. The TRα1·RXRα binding to DNA increased with increasing concentrations of DNA and approached saturation. Scatchard plots of data obtained using the PPRE and DR4 probes could be interpreted as a straight line and a single biomolecular reaction. The Ka was calculated from the slope of the Scatchard plots. The Ka values for binding of TRα1·RXRα heterodimers to PPRE and TRE (DR4) are (2.2 × 109M−1) and (2.5 × 109M−1), respectively. It is well documented that hypolipidemic drugs, such as clofibrate, induce peroxisome proliferation in rodent liver and increase the activity of enzymes involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids (1Vamecq J.

Regulation of the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism by hypolipidemic drugs and hormones is of great physiological and clinical interest. In this paper we show that TRα1 negatively regulates PPRE containing genes by competing for DNA binding with PPARα. TRα1 inhibits the binding of PPARα to aox-PPRE, resulting in the suppression of peroxisome proliferator-dependent activation by PPARα. This is a novel mechanism of actions of TR, to regulate gene expression through the DR1 motif (PPRE). To date, several enzymes, which are involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation, have been shown to be regulated by PPAR through a PPRE in the promoter region. These include the peroxisomal fatty acid acyl-CoA oxidase (9Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W.

The mechanism for negative regulation of PPARα-mediated transcription by TRα1 was clarified in this paper. In general, three different mechanisms are proposed for inhibition of transcription factors: 1) competition for binding to a response element, 2) formation of inactive heterodimers, and 3) squelching a cofactor. It has been reported that PPARα is able to modulate TRβ1 activity by forming TRβ1·PPARα heterodimers (29Bogazzi F. Hudson L.D. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol.

High cell density also induces cell cycle arrest in which the genomic DNA is unreplicated, even in the presence of a mitotic dose of growth factors; this is termed contact inhibition. Although the cell cycle of the rat fibroblast cell line, 3Y1, was arrested in quiescence by contact inhibition, the Cdk4 bound to its regulatory subunit, cyclin D1 or D3. However, these complexes were enzymatically inactive. Phosphorylation of the cyclin D1-bound Cdk4 by the Cdk-activating kinase could convert the inactive cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex into its active form in vitro, suggesting that threonine 172 of the Cdk4, of which phosphorylation is required for its activation, was in part unphosphorylated in contact-inhibited 3Y1 cells. Although MO15 was active in cell extracts prepared from the arrested 3Y1 cells, activation of bacterially produced Cdk4 in the cell extracts was inhibited. Removal of p27kip1 from the cell extracts allowed the MO15 holoenzyme to phosphorylate the Cdk4 and in turn activate it, indicating that p27kip1 plays a role in inhibiting the phosphorylation of Cdk4 by MO15 in the contact-inhibited 3Y1 cells.

Their activity is regulated through phosphorylation of tyrosine or threonine residues and by the binding of inhibitors or regulatory subunits, called cyclins. In turn, the cyclins are regulated by their expression and degradation. In mammalian cells, as quiescent cells enter the cell cycle in response to growth factor stimulation, D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) synthesized early in the G1 phase of the cell cycle form enzymatically active complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) or Cdk6 (1Matsushime H.

Deprivation of growth factor during the G1 phase results in a quiescent state or apoptosis.

Accumulation of p27kip1 is correlated with inactivation of the G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes and results in G1 arrest. In cyclic AMP-treated macrophages, an increased amount of p27kip1 prevents the activation of the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex and induces G1 arrest (33Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massagué J. Sherr C.J.

During T cell mitogenesis, antigen stimulation promotes the synthesis of cyclins and Cdks, after which interleukin-2 allows for the activation of the cyclin-Cdk complexes by decreasing the p27kip1 level.

This phenomenon, termed contact inhibition, is generally observed in normal or untransformed cells, and loss of it is one of the remarkable properties of transformed cells. In the contact-inhibited rat fibroblast cell line, 3Y1, we showed that the cyclin D-dependent kinase was inactivated and that its inactivation was in part associated with the inhibition of the access of the Cdk-activating kinase to Cdk4 by p27kip1. During resumption of the G1 phase through the release of the cells from contact inhibition, we showed that timing of the activation of the cyclin D-dependent kinase correlated well with the reduction of the p27kip1. Exponentially growing 3Y1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mML-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml kanamycin. Confluent cells (described in our experiments as arrested cells by contact inhibition) were maintained for 4 more days. Cells released from the contact inhibition by trypsinization (growing cells) were diluted 7-10-fold with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and maintained for 48 h. For analysis of the DNA content, monolayer cells were trypsinized and suspended in a 1-ml solution containing 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide and treated for 30 min at 37°C with 10 μg of RNase A. The stained cells were analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and the distribution of cells at each stage of the cycle was determined. Antisera to murine p27kip1, murine Cdk4, and human cyclin H were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p27kip1, GST-Cdk4, or GST-cyclin H fusion protein, respectively. Neither murine p21cip1/waf1/sdi1 nor murine p57kip2 transcribed/translated in vitro was immunoprecipitated by the antibody to p27kip1. Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to Cdk4 was raised to a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of murine Cdk4 by a standard procedure. Antiserum to murine MO15 was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a multiple antigenic peptide-conjugated synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the 15 amino acids at the C terminus of murine MO15.

Clarified cell lysates were precipitated for 12 h at 4°C with antiserum to cyclin H or MO15. Immunoprecipitates were brought down with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden), washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, separated on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, and detected by autoradiography. Cells were rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Tween 20 lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Sonicated extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were precipitated for 6 h at 4°C with the indicated rabbit antiserum or mAb. Immunoprecipitates were brought down with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech AB) for 45 min at 4°C, and the beads were washed with Tween 20 lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, the beads were boiled in sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with rabbit antisera (anti-p27kip1 antibody) or mAbs (anti-cyclin D1, D3, or Cdk4 antibody). Immunoblotting analyses were performed using ECL enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham International Plc, Little Chalfont, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay for pRb kinase activity was described previously (3Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in Tween 20 lysis buffer, and lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody. Recovered cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes on protein A- or protein G-Sepharose were incubated for 30 min at 30°C in 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM EGTA, 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM NaF, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with 20 μM ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham), and 0.5 μg of purified GST-pRb substrate. Reactions were stopped by boiling in sample buffer and then separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For Fig. 2d, recovered cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes on protein G-Sepharose were resuspended with kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μM ATP, incubated for 15 min at 30°C with 5 μl of insect cell lysates infected with the indicated baculoviruses for 48 h, washed three times with Tween 20 lysis buffer and once with 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), and assayed for pRb kinase activity. The immune complex CAK assay was performed as previously reported (12Matsuoka M. Kato J.-Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed by sonication in CAK buffer (80 mM sodium-β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and were clarified for 20 min in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants were incubated for 6 h at 4°C with antiserum to MO15, and protein A-Sepharose beads were added. After rocking the mixture for 30 min at 4°C, we washed the beads twice with Tween 20 lysis buffer and twice with CAK buffer. They were then resuspended in 50 μl of CAK buffer with 1 mM ATP containing bacterially produced cyclins and GST-Cdks and incubated for 1 h at 23°C. After centrifugation, cyclin-Cdk complexes in the supernatants were recovered with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech AB), washed four times with Tween 20 lysis buffer and once with HEPES (pH 8.0), and assayed for pRb kinase activity. The cells described in Fig. 3d (0.2 × 106 cells/lane) were lysed in CAK buffer, clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were mixed and incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant His-tagged cyclin D2 and GST-Cdk4 in the presence of 1 mM ATP. The cyclin D2-Cdk4 complex bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was collected by centrifugation and assayed for pRb kinase activity. The arrested cells described in Fig. 4b (0.5 × 106 cells/lane) were lysed and immunodepleted by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads precoated with saturating amounts of antiserum to p27kip1 or preimmune serum. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with both cyclin H-MO15 complexes recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads from Sf9 cells producing the cyclin H-MO15 holoenzyme and bacterially produced His-cyclin D2/GST-Cdk4 (0.6 μg each). Then the immune complex CAK assay was performed.Fig. 4Activation of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes in the contact-inhibited cell lysates by removal of p27kip1. Amounts of p27kip1 in the arrested or growing 3Y1 cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting with antiserum to p27kip1 (a). Extracts of the arrested 3Y1 cells (none) or cell extracts immunodepleted with nonimmune serum (pre-immune) or antiserum to p27kip1 (anti-KIP1) were mixed with both the immunoprecipitated cyclin H-MO15 complex and the bacterially produced cyclin D2 and Cdk4 in the presence of ATP for 1 h at 23°C and then assayed for CAK-mediated cyclin D2-Cdk4 activation (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the presence of 10% FBS, the rat fibroblast cell line, 3Y1, grows exponentially and forms a monolayer on culture plates until the cells come in contact with each other. These cells then enter the quiescent phase of the cell cycle with no replication of the genomic DNA (Fig. 1a). This phenomenon is termed contact inhibition. When these arrested cells were released from their contact inhibition by trypsinization and then dilution in 10% FBS, the cells resumed their cell cycle progression. 48 h after the release, flow cytometric measurements of their DNA contents revealed growing cells in various phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 1a). Asynchronously growing 3Y1 expressed cyclin D1 and D3, and both of the D-type cyclins formed enzymatically active complexes with Cdk4 (Fig. 1, b and c). Although cyclin D1 and D3 were expressed and bound to Cdk4 in the arrested 3Y1 cells as well as in the asynchronously growing cells, neither of the complexes was active (Fig. 1, b and c). The cyclin D-Cdk4 complex is catalytically inactive until it undergoes phosphorylation at threonine 172 in the cyclin D-bound Cdk4 (6Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar); this raises the possibility that phosphorylation of the Cdk4 could be inhibited in the arrested 3Y1 cells. Since the CAK, composed of cyclin H and MO15, is known to phosphorylate threonine 172 in the Cdk4 (12Matsuoka M. Kato J.-Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we made polyclonal antibodies to cyclin H and MO15. Antiserum to MO15 precipitated the MO15 as well as the cyclin H-MO15 complex produced in insect cells (Sf9) infected with recombinant cyclin H and MO15 baculoviruses. The antiserum to cyclin H precipitated only cyclin H (Fig. 2a). Given the failure of the cyclin H antiserum to recognize the complex, the immune complex kinase assay was performed with the antiserum to MO15. The immunoprecipitated cyclin H-MO15 complex was subjected to the kinase assay with bacterially produced Cdk2 or Cdk4, fused to GST. GST-Cdk2 was phosphorylated by the cyclin H-MO15 complex immunoprecipitated with antisera to MO15 (Fig. 2b). By contrast, GST-Cdk4 was not appreciably phosphorylated by the immunoprecipitated cyclin H-MO15 complex in both the absence and the presence of His-tagged cyclin D2 (negative data not shown). Since GST-Cdk4 could be activated by the cyclin H-MO15 complex as a pRb kinase (see below), we assumed that a major fraction of the bacterially produced GST-Cdk4 was denatured and that a minor fraction of the GST-Cdk4 was phosphorylated and activated by the cyclin H-MO15 complex. To assess the activity of the cyclin H-MO15 complex produced in Sf9 cells as CAK, we performed an immune complex CAK assay by using bacterially produced GST-cyclin A plus GST-Cdk2 or His-tagged cyclin D2 plus GST-Cdk4 for the first step substrate and histone H1 or GST-pRb for the second step substrate, respectively (12Matsuoka M. Kato J.-Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The cyclin-Cdk complex yielded a significantly higher level of histone H1 or pRb kinase activity (Fig. 2c), indicating that the cyclin H-MO15 complex reconstituted in Sf9 cells was bona fideCAK and that the antiserum to MO15 could precipitate active CAK. To examine whether the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex in the contact-inhibited cells was inactive due to the threonine unphosphorylation in cyclin D-bound Cdk4, we incubated the immunoprecipitated cyclin D-Cdk4 complex from the arrested cells with insect cell lysates producing CAK or with suitable control cell lysates in CAK kinase buffer before running the pRb kinase assay. We then incubated the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex on protein A-Sepharose beads for a short period of time at a high temperature (see “Experimental Procedures”) to reduce an effect of endogenous CAK activity in insect cells. Preincubation of the immunoprecipitated cyclin D-Cdk4 complex with the cyclin H-MO15 holoenzyme only could convert the inactive form into the active form in vitro (Fig. 2d). In agreement, [32P]orthophosphate labeling of the contact-inhibited cells showed an undetectable level of threonine phosphorylation on Cdk4 (negative data not shown). These results suggest that the Cdk4 activation was in part suppressed in the contact-inhibited cells. Since it might be possible that Cdk4-CAK is reduced or inactivated in the arrested cells, the CAK activity in contact-inhibited and growing cells was measured. When MO15 was precipitated from lysates of growing cells or from those arrested by contact inhibition, no significant differences in its Cdk2 kinase activities were detected (Fig. 3a). Moreover, immunoprecipitated MO15 from contact-inhibited cells as well as from growing cells could activate bacterially produced Cdk2 and Cdk4 (Fig. 3, b and c), indicating that CAK was active when precipitated from contact-inhibited cells, whereas when bacterially produced His-tagged cyclin D2 plus GST-Cdk4 proteins were directly added to lysates, recovered on glutathione-Sepharose, and then tested for pRb kinase activity, the CAK-mediated activation was significantly lower in the contact-inhibited cells than in the growing cells (Fig. 3d). Although the CAK activity was equally abundant in extracts of both contact-inhibited and growing cells, in the cell lysates prepared from contact-inhibited cells, the activation of bacterially produced Cdk4 was inhibited. These results suggest that MO15 could not access Cdk4 in contact-inhibited cells. The inhibitory activity of the Cdk4 activation was gradually diluted out by the addition of an increased amount of bacterially produced D-type cyclin and Cdk4. However, the inhibitory activity in the contact-inhibited cells was more than that in the growing cells (Fig. 3d). The inhibitory activity was eliminated by adding an excess amount of the bacterially produced D-type cyclin and Cdk4, indicating that the inhibitory factor, which interrupted the CAK-mediated Cdk4 activation, directly interacted with the cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. CKIs have been reported to associate with cyclin D-Cdk4 complex directly and to inhibit its kinase activity (37Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 38Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). One of the CKIs, p27kip1, has been known to increase in contact-inhibited cells (30Polyak K. Kato J.-Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massagué J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar) and to be regulated posttranscriptionally (35Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar, 39Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) or posttranslationally (35Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). In fact, the p27kip1 mRNA level did not fluctuate in either the contact-inhibited or growing 3Y1 cells (data not shown). By contrast, immunoblotting with an antibody to p27kip1 (see “Experimental Procedures” for its specificity) showed that 10-fold more p27kip1 protein was present in the contact-inhibited cells than in the growing cells (Fig. 4a). To examine whether p27kip1 was involved in the inactivation of Cdk4 in contact-inhibited cells, p27kip1-deprived or nondeprived cell lysates were subjected to inhibition of the activation of bacterially produced Cdk4. Although the cell lysates were precleared with preimmune serum-coated protein A-Sepharose beads, somehow, a slight Cdk4 activation was observed, and the p27kip1 depletion allowed for an effective activation of Cdk4 in the contact-inhibited cell lysates (Fig. 4b). These findings indicate that p27kip1 was in part involved in the regulation of Cdk4 activation in which the MO15 cannot access Cdk4 in contact-inhibited cells. When contact-inhibited 3Y1 cells were trypsinized and subsequently diluted 7-10-fold in the presence of a mitotic dose of serum (10% FBS), the cultured cells synchronously entered S phase 18-22 h later (Fig. 5c). Throughout the cell cycle, the protein levels of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and cyclin D1-bound Cdk4 did not fluctuate dramatically (Fig. 5a). As cells progressed toward the S phase, p27kip1 decreased and cyclin D-dependent kinase activity appeared. The timing of the activation of cyclin D-dependent kinase correlated well with the reduction of p27kip1, suggesting that p27kip1 also regulated cyclin D-dependent kinase activity in the cycling cells (Fig. 5, a and b). Mammalian cells can enter the cell cycle in response to growth factor-induced signals. Although macrophages transiently deprived of colony-stimulating factor 1 halt in the early G1 phase and fibroblasts transiently deprived of serum halt in quiescence, both cells reenter the cell cycle upon restimulation by growth factors. When the growth of either cell types is arrested by deprivation of the growth factor, the expression of D-type cyclins is undetectable. However, fibroblasts constitutively expressing both D-type cyclins and Cdk4 undergo growth arrest by serum starvation. In these cells, overproduced D-type cyclins and Cdk4 are detected even when the overexpessing cells are quiescent; however, the D-type cyclins and Cdk4 do not interact with each other (3Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In contact-inhibited cells, in the presence of a mitotic dose of serum, the amounts of D-type cyclins and Cdk4 were identical with those of growing cells. Moreover, D-type cyclins bound Cdk4 despite the quiescence of the cells. Together, serum stimulation induced not only synthesis of D-type cyclins but also an assembly factor for D-type cyclins and Cdk4 even when the cells were in a quiescent state, whereas complexes composed of D-type cyclins and Cdk4 were enzymatically inactive in contact-inhibited cells. We reasoned that in the contact-inhibited cells Thr-172 of the Cdk4 was unphosphorylated, because phosphorylation is necessary for Cdk4 activation mediated by CAK (6Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). CAK activity is detected in the growth factor-deprived macrophages and maintained throughout the cell cycle (12Matsuoka M. Kato J.-Y. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7265-7275Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether CAK activity was detected in the contact-inhibited cells. Although the activity was not detected in the contact-inhibited cell lysates, the immunoprecipitated CAK was active, and its kinetics measured as Cdk2 kinase activity did not show significant differences between contact-inhibited cells and growing cells. The addition of increasing amounts of bacterially produced cyclin D and Cdk4 diluted out the CAK inhibition, suggesting that an inhibitor that could associate with cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes was present. Our prediction is as follows. An inhibitor associates with cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes and prevents their kinase activity. Once the amounts of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes override an inhibitory activity, their kinase activity first makes an appearance. A candidate for an inhibitor that can block the activation of Cdk4 as well as the activity of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes is p27kip1, because p27kip1 has been known to have such dual inhibitory effects on cyclin-Cdk complexes (23Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar, 30Polyak K. Kato J.-Y. Solomon M.J.

Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In our experiments, a 10-fold greater amount of the p27kip1 protein was detected in contact-inhibited 3Y1 cells than in growing cells, whereas kip1 mRNA levels did not fluctuate. These findings suggest that the regulation of the p27kip1 accumulation was attributable to posttranscriptional control in the contact-inhibited cells. In quiescent cells, it has been reported that ubiquitin-regulated degradation (35Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar) and translational control contribute to the p27kip1 level (39Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). We examined the mechanism by which the p27kip1 accumulation is regulated in the contact-inhibited cells. The half-life of the p27kip1 was much longer in the contact-inhibited cells (>4 h) than in the growing cells (approximately 2.5 h), although [35S]methionine incorporation into p27kip1 is identical, 2A. Kato and H. Matsushime, unpublished observation.indicating that the degradation is predominantly responsible for the regulation of the p27kip1 accumulation in the contact-inhibited cells. An increased amount of p27kip1 in contact-inhibited cells blocked the access of CAK to unphosphorylated cyclin D-bound Cdk4. The same manner of p27kip1-induced Cdk4 inactivation has been also observed in cAMP treated macrophages. The macrophage cell line, Bac1.2F5, requires colony-stimulating factor 1 to proliferate and is sensitive to cAMP-induced growth arrest. Cdk4 recovered from Bac1.2F5 arrested by cAMP treatment lacks threonine phosphate (33Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massagué J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). These results suggest that inhibition of Cdk4 phosphorylation by p27kip1 may play a crucial role in maintaining cell cycle arrest. As cells were released from the contact inhibition and progressed toward the S phase, the amounts of D-type cyclins, Cdk4, and their complexes did not fluctuate dramatically. p27kip1 decreased gradually, and then cyclin D-dependent kinase activity appeared. Timing of the activation of the cyclin D-dependent kinase correlated well with the reduction of p27kip1. An increased amount of p27kip1 is expressed in various cell lines arrested in quiescence by growth factor deprivation, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 in macrophages (33Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massagué J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), interleukin-2 in T-cells (34Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Massagué J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), and serum in fibroblasts (35Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar, 36Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). As these cells are released from quiescence by growth factor stimulation and cell cycle progression is resumed, the amount of p27kip1 gradually decreases through G1 phase. This reduction of the p27kip1 level supports the view that p27kip1 also regulates the kinase activity of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes in cycling cells released from quiescence. D-type cyclins and Cdk4 are key regulators for G1 progression, and their kinase activities increase as cells approach the G1/S boundary. In our experiments, p27kip1 plays an important role in the activation of Cdk4 by CAK during contact inhibition and in the regulation of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity in the G1 phase of cycling cells released from contact inhibition. Although p27kip1 can regulate a broad range of cyclin-Cdk complexes in vitro (23Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar, 24Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar), inhibition of Cdk4 may be one of the crucial roles for p27kip1 in cell cycle control as a Cdk inhibitor in contact-inhibited cells and in released cycling cells.

These currents were assumed to be mostly due to binding and dissociation of the coupling ion near the extracellular transporter surface. Little attention was given to analogous events that may occur at the intracellular surface. To address this issue, we performed voltage clamp studies of Xenopus oocytes expressing the intestinal H+-coupled peptide cotransporter PepT1 and recorded the dependence of transient charge movements in the absence of peptide substrate on changing intra- (pHi) and extracellular pH (pHo). Rapid steps in membrane potential induced transient charge movements that showed a marked dependence on pHi and pHo. At a pHo of 7.0 and a holding potential (Vh) of −50 mV, the charge movements were mostly inwardly directed, whereas reduction of pHo to below 7.0 resulted in outwardly directed charge movements. When pHi was reduced, inwardly directed charge movements were observed. The data on the voltage dependence of the transient charge movements were fitted by the Boltzmann equation, yielding an apparent valence of 0.65 ± 0.03 (n = 7).

https://openalex.org/W2059009159,"Chemoattractants induce a variety of phagocytic functions including transendothelial migration, degranulation, and the generation of superoxide anions. We report here that the prototypic chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF) stimulates the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that is central to the regulation of proinflammatory immediate-early gene expression. In freshly prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cells, fMLF (1-100 nM) induced a κB binding activity that was receptor-dependent and involved the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins. The activation of NF-κB by fMLF appeared to be cell-specific and different from the activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Neutrophil preparations that responded to fMLF, TNFα, and lipopolysaccharides with interleukin-8 secretion did not show NF-κB activation, whereas N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-transfected HL-60 cells were responsive to TNFα but not fMLF for NF-κB activation. Differentiation of FPR-transfected HL-60 cells with dimethyl sulfoxide for 3-5 days conferred the capability of the cells to activate NF-κB in response to fMLF without a significant increase in the amount of FPR. These results identify NF-κB as a transcription factor that can be activated by the prototypic chemotactic peptide and demonstrate that this function is both highly regulated and dependent on signaling components specifically expressed during myeloid differentiation. Chemoattractants induce a variety of phagocytic functions including transendothelial migration, degranulation, and the generation of superoxide anions. We report here that the prototypic chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLF) stimulates the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor that is central to the regulation of proinflammatory immediate-early gene expression. In freshly prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cells, fMLF (1-100 nM) induced a κB binding activity that was receptor-dependent and involved the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins. The activation of NF-κB by fMLF appeared to be cell-specific and different from the activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Neutrophil preparations that responded to fMLF, TNFα, and lipopolysaccharides with interleukin-8 secretion did not show NF-κB activation, whereas N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-transfected HL-60 cells were responsive to TNFα but not fMLF for NF-κB activation. Differentiation of FPR-transfected HL-60 cells with dimethyl sulfoxide for 3-5 days conferred the capability of the cells to activate NF-κB in response to fMLF without a significant increase in the amount of FPR.

All 23 polar amino acids in the putative 7-transmembrane (TM) domains of a guinea pig PAF receptor were individually replaced with alanine. The ligand-binding properties of mutant receptors were determined after transient expression in COS-7 cells. Mutants in TM II (N58A, D63A), TM III (N100A, T101A, S104A) and TM VII (D289A) displayed higher PAF-binding affinities than seen with the wild-type receptor. In contrast, mutants in TM V (H188A), TM VI (H248A, H249A, Q252A), and TM VII (Q276A, T278A) showed lower affinities. Representative mutants were then stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells to observe PAF-induced cellular signals (arachidonate release, phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, adenylyl cyclase inhibition). An N100A mutant with the highest affinity was constitutively active and was responsive to lyso-PAF, an inactive derivative of PAF. One nanomolar PAF induced no signals in low affinity mutants, an EC50 value for the wild-type receptor. Three histidines (His-188, His-248, His-249) might form a binding pocket for the phosphate group of PAF, since zinc effectively inhibited ligand binding. Based on these results, a three-dimensional molecular model of PAF and its receptor was generated using bacteriorhodopsin as a reference protein.

https://openalex.org/W2051507092,"Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a potent cytokine produced by T cells and to a lesser extent by tumor-associated natural killer cells, basophils, and mast cells. IL-4 treatment of T cells and macrophages leads to augmentation of their cytotoxic activity. In human B cells, IL-4 is a potent stimulator of Ig class switching from IgM to IgE. The diverse biological responses induced by IL-4 are mediated through a high affinity receptor complex (IL-4R). Although a wealth of information has accumulated regarding IL-4R, the exact mechanisms of IL-4R-mediated signaling pathways in human B cells are not well defined. In an attempt to characterize the IL-4-induced signals in human B cells, we have found that IL-4 treatment induced rapid dephosphorylation of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. To identify the protein-tyrosine phosphatase involved in the IL-4-mediated dephosphorylation, we performed Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific to protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Upon IL-4 treatment, SHP-1 was specifically translocated to the cellular membrane fraction.

Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) reported that 4PS may be antigenically and functionally similar to the insulin receptor substrate-1. Additional evidence of IL-4-induced signal transduction events was demonstrated by the IL-4-induced association of the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85) with the phosphorylated form of 4PS; however, p85 itself was not phosphorylated (11Wang L.-M.

Further studies have shown that IL-4 treatment induces the association of IL-4R with the γ chain of the IL-2 receptor complex (12Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K.-I. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) that participates in IL-4-mediated signaling by γ chain-associated JAK kinases (13Yin T. Tsang M.L.-S. Yang Y.-C.

Also, Hou et al. (16Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) reported that IL-4 could activate a tyrosine-phosphorylated DNA-binding protein termed IL-4-Stat (Stat-6) that is involved in IL-4-mediated transcription. Recently, Stat-6 knockout mice have been developed, and these mice are deficient in biological responses to IL-4 treatment (17Shimoda K. Deursen J.V. Sangster M.Y. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Tripp R.A.

In this report we provide evidence for IL-4-induced protein tyrosine dephosphorylation of the 85-kDa subunit of the PI 3-kinase (p85). Also, we report the association of SHP-1, previously known as PTP-1C, with the IL-4R and PI 3-kinase (p85). It therefore appears that the IL-4-induced protein tyrosine dephosphorylation may play a role in the IL-4-induced signals, leading to diverse biological responses. The highly IL-4-sensitive subtype of the human Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line, Ramos 2G6.4C10, was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells (1 × 105-1 × 106/ml) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and gentamicin sulfate at 5 μg/ml at 37°C in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber. Recombinant human IL-4 was purchased from Sigma. For membrane preparations, cells were washed once and incubated in serum-free medium for 1.5 h before the addition of 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4. After incubation for 10 min, cells were washed twice with isotonic buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 120 mM KCl, 5 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. After washing, the cells were swollen for 5 min in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Cells were then disrupted by Dounce homogenization with 30 strokes using a tight pestle. The buffer was made isotonic with a 0.1 volume of 10 × hypertonic buffer containing 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1100 mM KCl, 35 mM magnesium acetate, and 10 mM dithiothreitol. After the nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 800 × g, the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g The pelleted membrane fractions were washed once with isotonic buffer and solubilized in 1 × SDS-sample buffer, or the aliquots were frozen at -80°C. For the kinetics of IL-4-induced dephosphorylation, Ramos cells (5 × 105/ml) were serum-starved for 1.5 h before the addition of 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4. At indicated time points, cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mM benzamidine, 100 μg/ml TPCK, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 2 mMβ-glycerol phosphate. The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Equal amounts of cell extracts, as determined by BCA protein determination assay (Pierce), were prepared by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE buffer containing 5%β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 2 min. The proteins were subjected to electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. Ramos cells at 5 × 105/ml were washed twice and lysed for 5 min in buffer containing 1% digitonin or 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mM benzamidine, 100 μg/ml TPCK, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 2 mMβ-glycerol phosphate. The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The cell extracts were precleared once with protein A-Sepharose. After the addition of appropriate antibodies, the reactions were then allowed to continue for 4 h at 4°C. To remove the antibody-antigen complexes, prewashed protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or goat anti-mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma) was added to the reaction. After incubation for 1 h, the complexes were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g and washed extensively with buffer containing 0.5% digitonin or 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and 150 mM NaCl. Samples were prepared by the addition of an equal volume of 1 × SDS-PAGE buffer containing 2.5%β-mercaptoethanol to the washed resin and boiling for 2 min before electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein from detergent extracts, as determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce), or immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked using buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, and 3% bovine serum albumin for 24 h at 4°C. Monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (4G10) (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), SHP-1, or SHP-2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were added at optimal concentrations, and the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoblotted proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and the chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection system (Amersham Corp.). Stripping of nitrocellulose membranes was performed as described by the manufacturer (Amersham). The molecular weights of proteins were determined using the Ferguson plot (18Ferguson K.A. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the protein phosphorylation was performed by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms using peak integration analysis on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. The relative change in the level of membrane-bound SHP-1 was determined by normalizing the area under the peak for SHP-1 against the peaks for SHP-1 in the cytoplasmic fractions. To determine the effects of IL-4 on the phosphorylation pattern of cellular proteins in human B cells, Ramos cells at 8 × 105/ml were serum-starved and treated with 10 ng/ml IL-4. After different times posttreatment, cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in buffer containing Nonidet P-40. Equal amounts of detergent lysates (approximately 1 × 106 cells) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mAb 4G10. The results showed a reproducible (n = 3) and significant decrease in the phosphorylation state of a major polypeptide at approximately 85 kDa (p85) after 1 min of IL-4 treatment (Fig. 1). However, the phosphorylation state of several other polypeptides did not change at this time point. Since studies by Paul and co-workers (11Wang L.-M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heidaran M.A. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4899-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85) may participate in the IL-4-induced signaling, we speculated that the IL-4-induced dephosphorylated p85 polypeptide may in fact be the 85-kDa subunit of the PI 3-kinase (p85). To determine this, we performed Western blot analysis using mAb to PI 3-kinase (p85). Ramos cells were left untreated or were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-4. After a 1-min incubation, detergent extracts were prepared, and an equal amount of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Fig. 2A, left panel). The blot was then stripped and subjected to immunodetection using anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) mAb. The results revealed that p85 migrated with identical mobility to PI 3-kinase (p85) (Fig. 2A, right panel), suggesting that the two polypeptides may be the same. Subsequently, to confirm that IL-4 treatment could induce the dephosphorylation of PI 3-kinase (p85), we performed immunoprecipitation studies. Ramos cells were left untreated or were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-4 for 1 min. After preparation of detergent extracts and immunoprecipitation using anti-PI 3-kinase (p85), the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrotransfer, the proteins were visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Fig. 2B, left and middle panels). An identical blot was also probed with mAb to PI 3-kinase (p85) (Fig. 2B, right panel). The results revealed that the PI 3-kinase (p85) was dephosphorylated upon IL-4 treatment of Ramos cells. Interestingly, an IL-4-induced dephosphorylated polypeptide at approximately 170 kDa was also coimmunoprecipitated with PI 3-kinase (p85) (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Our data showed that PI 3-kinase (p85) was rapidly dephosphorylated by IL-4 treatment; therefore, we attempted to determine the phosphatase that may be involved in this event. In concert with the signaling molecules, phosphatases are thought to play a key role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (19Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 20Brautigan D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been reported to participate in insulin receptor-mediated signaling (21Kuhné M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ugi S. Maegawa H. Olefsky J.M. Shigeta Y. Kashiwagi A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-4R shares common signal transduction molecules such as 4PS and PI 3-kinase (p85) with the insulin receptor (10Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Wang L.-M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heidaran M.A. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H.

Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). Based on the reported similarities between IL-4R and the insulin receptor, we performed Western blot experiments using monoclonal antibodies to two candidate protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2. Ramos cells were serum-starved for 1 h and treated with 5 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4 for 15 min before cell disruption and fractionation. The membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2. The results revealed that the level of SHP-1 increased in the membrane fractions prepared from IL-4-treated cells (Fig. 3, left panel). Densitometric scan of the Western blot showed that the level of SHP-1 increased approximately 9.5-fold in membranes prepared from IL-4-treated Ramos cells. In contrast, IL-4 treatment did not increase the association of SHP-2 with cellular membrane fractions in preparations (Fig. 3, right panel) (the data are representative of three different experiments). Since our data showed that upon IL-4 treatment SHP-1 was specifically translocated to the cellular membrane, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether SHP-1 could associate with the IL-4R. Ramos cells were harvested and lysed using digitonin lysis buffer. The lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of IL-4 using anti-IL-4R serum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis first using anti-SHP-1 mAb, and the immunoblotted proteins were visualized by the ECL detection method. The data revealed that SHP-1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with IL-4R (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Furthermore, the presence of IL-4 during the immunoprecipitation resulted in a significant increase in the association of SHP-1 with the IL-4R, suggesting an IL-4-induced association of SHP-1 with the IL-4R. Normal rabbit serum failed to immunoprecipitate SHP-1 (Fig. 4A, upper panel). To determine whether SHP-2 could also be coimmunoprecipitated with the IL-4R, the blot was then stripped and subjected to probing with mAb to SHP-2. The result revealed that SHP-2 was not associated with the IL-4R in Ramos cells (Fig. 4A, lower panel). It has been reported that SHP-1 and SHP-2 play a role in the insulin receptor signaling (21Kuhné M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ugi S. Maegawa H. Olefsky J.M. Shigeta Y. Kashiwagi A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since we observed the IL-4-induced PI 3-kinase (p85) dephosphorylation and SHP-1 association with the IL-4R, we tested the possibility that SHP-1 or SHP-2 may also interact with PI 3-kinase (p85) in Ramos cells. IL-4-treated Ramos cell extracts were prepared as above, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) mAb. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins was performed using, first, anti-SHP-1 (Fig. 4B, upper panel) and then, after stripping with SHP-2 (Fig. 4B, lower panel), mAb. The results revealed that SHP-1 could specifically associate with PI 3-kinase (p85) in Ramos cells. Control mAb (IgG1) failed to immunoprecipitate SHP-1 (Fig. 4B). We have used the highly IL-4-sensitive subtype (2G6.4C10) of the human Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line Ramos. These cells are IgM+ and respond to IL-4 treatment by up-regulation of CD23 (24Siegal J.P. Mostowski H.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 132: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the IL-4-induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of an 85-kDa polypeptide in Ramos cells. This polypeptide appears to be identical to the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that IL-4 treatment induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of PI 3-kinase (p85). Interestingly, an IL-4-induced tyrosine-dephosphorylated polypeptide at approximately 170 kDa was also coimmunoprecipitated with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) (Fig. 2B, middle panel). At present the identity of the 170-kDa polypeptide (p170) is unknown, but it is possible that this molecule may represent insulin receptor substrate-2. Also, IL-4 treatment of Ramos cells resulted in specific translocation of SHP-1 to a cellular membrane fraction. Zhao et al. (25Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5007-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported SHP-1 phosphorylation and translocation to the cellular membrane by phorbol ester treatment of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Furthermore, by performing immunoprecipitation studies we showed that SHP-1 could specifically associate with IL-4R as well as with PI 3-kinase (p85), suggesting a role for this phosphatase in IL-4-induced signaling pathways. The biological responses induced by IL-4 are transmitted by the high affinity IL-4R present in low abundance (102-103 copies/cell) on many hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells (26Park L.S.

Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies of cell surface radioiodinated cells showed that IL-4 treatment induces the association of IL-4R and the γ chain shared by the IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, and IL-9 receptors (12Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K.-I. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Since the IL-4R chain does not possess any protein kinase activity, IL-4-induced signals are thought to be mediated through IL-4R-associated protein kinase(s). Further evidence of IL-4-induced signal transduction was demonstrated by the observation that the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of PI 3-kinase was associated with the phosphorylated form of insulin receptor substrate-2 (4PS), suggesting that this interaction may be critical to IL-4-induced activation (11Wang L.-M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heidaran M.A. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4899-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hou et al. (16Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of an IL-4-activated transcription factor termed Stat-6. Stat-6 is phosphorylated upon IL-4 treatment, and the phosphorylated form of Stat-6 is translocated to the nucleus where it can bind and activate the transcription of IL-4-responsive genes. In contrast to the reported IL-4-induced protein phosphorylation events, in vivo phosphorylation studies by Mire-Sluis and Thorpe (7Mire-Sluis A.R. Thorpe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18113-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in human TF-1 cells showed the IL-4-induced dephosphorylation of an 80-kDa phosphotyrosine polypeptide. Pretreatment of cells with TGF-β, a known down-regulator of IL-4-induced IgE class switching (28Gauchat J.-F. Aversa G. Gascan H. de Vries J.E. Int.

Although it is not yet determined, it is possible that p80 (7Mire-Sluis A.R. Thorpe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18113-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the same polypeptide as p85, and the difference in the molecular weight is due to different electrophoresis conditions and molecular weight markers. The discrepancy in the reports of the IL-4-induced signals may represent the differences between human and mouse systems. Alternatively, these differences in the IL-4-induced signals may be due to the different cell types used in the experiments. In our experiments, we have detected rapid protein tyrosine dephosphorylation upon IL-4 treatment. At this point we do not know the exact physiologic relevance of the IL-4-induced PI 3-kinase (p85) dephosphorylation. But based on previous reports showing tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase (p85) by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and insulin (31Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11046-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Nishioka Y. Kanai F. Miyake N. Fukui Y. Shibasaki F. Takenawa T. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the IL-4-induced inhibition of leukemic and normal B cell proliferation (27Pandrau D. Saeland S. Duvert V. Manel A.-M. Zabot M.-T. Philippe N. Banchereau J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) may be due to the IL-4-induced PI 3-kinase (p85) dephosphorylation. Alternatively, based on our preliminary results showing that Na3VO4, a potent protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, could block the IL-4-induced IgE germline transcript expression, 2F. Imani, K. J. Rager, and D. G. Marsh, manuscript in preparation. it is tempting to speculate that protein tyrosine dephosphorylation may be necessary for the IL-4-induced signaling that leads to IgE class switching in human B cells. Further experiments are necessary to determine the exact role of PI 3-kinase (p85) dephosphorylation in the IL-4-induced signaling events. We gratefully acknowledge Drs. David Proud and Stephen Desiderio (The Johns Hopkins University) for helpful suggestions and critical review of this manuscript."

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments suggest that binding is independent at each binding site, with a Kd of approximately 50 nM. Remarkably, misakinolide A does not sever actin filaments like swinholide A; rather, it caps the barbed end of F-actin. When capped by misakinolide A, the elongation rate constant at the barbed end is reduced to zero; pointed end growth was affected only to the extent that the compound sequesters unpolymerized actin. Misakinolide A has essentially no effect on the off-rate of actin subunits leaving the barbed end. Energy-minimized models of misakinolide A and swinholide A are consistent with conservation of identical binding sites in both molecules, but a difference in orientation of one binding site relative to the other may explain why swinholide A has severing activity whereas misakinolide A only has capping activity.

The method was extensively validated, showing that proton efflux was sodium-dependent, inhibited by amiloride analogs, and activated by growth factors, phorbol ester, calcium ionophore, and hypertonic stress. 5-HT and the specific agonist (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide rapidly stimulated proton efflux that was blocked by a specific receptor antagonist, amiloride analogs or pertussis toxin. The activation by 5-HT depended upon extracellular sodium and could be demonstrated under conditions of imposed intracellular acid load, as well as in the presence and absence of glycolytic substrate. Acceleration of proton efflux was not inhibited by sequestration of G protein βγ-subunits, a maneuver that blocked 5-HT1A receptor activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Transfection of Gzα and pertussis toxin-resistant mutants of Goα and Giα1 did not reverse the blockade induced by pertussis toxin. In contrast, pertussis toxin-resistant mutants of Giα2 and Giα3“rescued” the ability of 5-HT to increase proton efflux after pertussis toxin treatment.

One reason for undertaking this study was to provide simpler systems for studying intramolecular electron transfer reactions. In particular, the heme-FMN version of P450BM-3 that is missing the FAD domain should prove useful in studying the FMN-to-heme electron transfer reaction. This version of P450BM-3 has been designated truncated P450BM-3 or BM3<sub>t</sub>.

While these factors appear to represent novel genes, sequence analysis of NF45 reveals homology to the prokaryotic σ-54 transcription factor. Other proteins including E1f-1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors (22Thompson C.B. Wang C.-Y. Ho I.-C. Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Miesfeldt S. Zhang L. Nabel G.J.

Genomics. 1992; 13: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have also been demonstrated to bind to the IL-2 ARRE-2 site. Winged-helix or forkhead proteins share a conserved 100-amino acid DNA binding domain and represent a family of transcription factors that participate in a number of processes that regulate cellular gene expression (25Lai E.

Constitutively expressed factors such as ILF that bind to the ARRE-2 region may help to modulate the rapidity and tissue specificity of IL-2 mRNA induction. In this study, we present evidence that ILF binds constitutively to the ARRE-2 element in the IL-2 promoter. The optimal in vitro binding site for ILF closely resembles the non-consensus AP-1 site in ARRE-2 indicating that sequences recognized by ILF and the multi-protein NFAT complex overlap. The 3′ portion of the ILF binding site comprised of purine-rich sequences is not required for NFAT binding but is important for maximal IL-2 promoter activity. These results suggest that ILF may have a positive role in regulating IL-2 gene expression, although ILF is not a component of the multi-protein NFAT complex. Thus, ILF may be important both to prevent constitutive expression from the IL-2 promoter and to maintain the IL-2 promoter in a configuration that allows NFAT and AP-1 to activate IL-2 gene expression. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 mM glutamine. T cells were activated by stimulation with 25 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 2 μM ionomycin for 30-120 min. When used, cyclosporin A was added to a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Total RNA was prepared from cells with the RNAZol reagent (Biotecx Laboratories) using the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis primed by 1 μg of random hexamer oligonucleotides (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and catalyzed by avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) in the presence of 4 mM dNTPs. The 4 μl of the cDNA synthesis reaction was used as a template in a 100-μl PCR reaction containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM dNTPs, and 50 pmol of each specific primer. Primers specific for ILF, IL-2, TATA-box binding protein (TBP), and NFATc human cDNAs contained the following sequences and nucleotide numbers. ILF sense (917-941): 5′-GGAAGCTTCAGGTGGAGACAGCCCG-3′, ILF antisense (2206-2183): 5′-GGCA-CCACAGAGTTGATATCGTT-3′, IL-2 sense (198-222): 5′-TGGAATTAATAATTACAAGATCCC-3′, IL-2 antisense (423-400): 5′-TGTTTCAGA-TCCCTTTAGTTCCAG-3′, TBP sense (220-244): 5′-TGCCAAGAAGAAAGTG-AACATCATG-3′, TBP antisense (565-541): 5′-AGGCAAGGGTACATGAGAGCCA-TTA-3′, NFATc sense (239-268): 5′-ATGCCAAGCACCAGCTTTCCA-GTCCCTT-3′, NFATc antisense (613-591): 5′-GTCTTGGGAGACACGCAGGGAGACT-3′. Predicted PCR product sizes using these primers are 240 bp (IL-2), 334 bp (TBP), and 600 bp (NFATc). ILF primers amplify PCR products of different sizes for each transcript (ILF-1, 1289 bp; ILF-2, 1711 bp; ILF-3, 411 bp). PCR reactions were generally denatured for 5 min at 95°C followed by 25-40 cycles of 55°C annealing, 72°C extension, and 95°C denaturation (1 min each step). The 20 μl of each PCR reaction was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. PCR reactions were allowed to progress for the lowest number of cycles at which ethidium bromide-stained PCR product could be visualized by UV light. ILF was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (23Li C. Lai C. Sigman D.S. Gaynor R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7739-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GST-ILF constructs contained either 148 amino acids including the ILF (amino acids 210-357) fused to GST which included the forkhead domain (amino acids 251-348) or 445 amino acids (amino acids 210-655) (23Li C. Lai C. Sigman D.S. Gaynor R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7739-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and induced by the addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5057) Google Scholar). Factor Xa (Promega) was used to cleave the GST moiety and inactivated using 1 mM Pefablock (Boehringer Mannheim). Full-length ILF and NFATc cDNAs used for CASTing experiments (32Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 33Brown L. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT T7 polymerase system (Promega). In vitro translation of CREB, Jun, or NFATc cloned into pGEM3 or −4 was also performed in a coupled transcription and translation system in either the presence or absence of [35S]methionine. The 12-amino acid influenza hemagglutinin sequences were inserted on the carboxyl terminus of ILF and Jun by PCR, and these proteins were translated in the absence of [35S]methionine. Immunoprecipitation of unlabeled Jun and ILF proteins was performed with a 1:100 dilution of 12CA5 antibody that recognizes the influenza hemagglutinin sequences. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a needle lysis method (34Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture including dithiothreitol (1 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), aprotinin (0.015 mg/ml), benzamidine (0.2 mM), antipain (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), amd chymostatin (0.1 μg/ml). Nuclear extracts from resting and activated Jurkat cells containing the same amount of soluble proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels along with ILF-1 in vitro translated using the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Proteins were transferred from the gel to Hybond C nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp.) by electroblotting for 8 h at 35 mA constant current. The filter was blocked for 1 h in 1 × TBS, 0.2% Tween (TBS-T), 5% nonfat milk. Incubation with the primary antibody was performed in TBS-T, 0.5% milk with ILF (1:2000 dilution), or c-Jun (1:500 dilution) rabbit polyclonal antisera. An anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was subsequently incubated with the blot at a 1:5000 dilution. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Corp.). Blots were generally exposed to x-ray film for 10-60 s. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the IL-2 ARRE-2 (3Fujita T. Shibuya H. Ohashi T. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1986; 46: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) were annealed and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Conditions for binding of bacterially expressed ILF to DNA were as follows: 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dG-dC), 5 μg of GST-ILF, 0.1-0.5 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotides (20,000 cpm) in a 20-μl reaction. Binding conditions and protein amounts for gel retardation with nuclear extracts were identical using 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) or 1 μg of poly(dA-dT) used instead of poly(dG-dC). Use of poly(dI-dC) proved optimal for generating NFAT binding activity, whereas the presence of poly(dA-dT) enhanced ILF binding activity. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature and were loaded and run on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels (0.5 × TBE). Antibodies used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were purified using protein A-Sepharose chromatography, with 2 ml of rabbit serum loaded on a 1-ml protein A column, washed with 20 ml of 1.5 M glycine, 3 M NaCl, pH 8.9, eluted with 0.1 M citric acid, pH 3.0, into 50 μl of 1 M Tris, pH 8.9, and dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline. Oligonucleotide sequences (sense strand)/IL-2 ARRE-2 oligonucleotides with (mutated sequences underlined) are as follows. Wild type (−286/−257), 5′-AATTGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′; 5′ purine mutant, 5′-AATTGGACCCCCCACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′; core mutant, 5′-AATTGGAGGAAAAACGGGGGCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′; 3′ purine mutant, 5′-AATTGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACTTTTTTCGT-3′; double core/3′ purine mutant, 5′-AATTGGAGGAAAAACGGGGGCATACTTTTTTCGT-3′. Gel retardation analysis using Jurkat nuclear extract was performed as described above. Reactions were scaled up 5-fold to a 100-μl size. Gels were exposed to x-ray film for 2 h and the shifted complexes subsequently purified. Gel slices containing either NFAT complex or ILF were placed in the wells of an SDS-polyacrylamide protein gel with 50 μl of 5 × protein loading dye layered on top. Gels were subject to electrophoresis and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose with immunoblotting performed as described previously. Determination of the optimal binding sites of DNA binding proteins using degenerate oligonucleotides using the so-called CASTING procedure was performed as described previously (32Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). ILF and NFATc proteins containing a hemagglutinin epitope (amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA) at their amino termini were in vitro translated using the TNT system (Promega). Proteins were allowed to bind double-stranded 75-bp fragments containing a degenerate 35-bp core for 20 min at room temperature. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads) coated with an anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody were used to isolate proteins and bound DNA fragments. PCR primers 5′-GCGTCGACAAGCTTTCTAGA-3′ (forward), 5′-CGCTCGAGGGATCCG-AATTC-3′ (reverse) flanking the degenerate core were used to amplify the selected fragments, and products were visualized on agarose gels. Aliquots of each PCR reaction were collected after 10, 14, 18, and 22 cycles. The lowest cycle number PCR aliquot that contained visible product was identified and saved, completing the first round of CASTING. Five additional rounds of CASTING were performed using this and subsequent PCR products. Products were cloned into the pCRII TA vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The IL-2 promoter from −340 to +47 was cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (2Durand D.B. Shaw J. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 3Fujita T. Shibuya H. Ohashi T. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1986; 46: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mutant IL-2 promoter plasmids were constructed using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutant IL-2 constructs extending from −286 to −257 had the following underlined alterations in the ARRE-2: wild type, 5′-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′; 5′ purine mutant, 5′-GGATTAAAAACTGTTTCATACAG-AAGGCGT-3′; AP-1/ILF mutant, 5′-GGAGGAAAAACCACTTCATACAGAAGGC-GT-3′; 3′ purine mutant, 5′-GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACTTTTTGCGT-3′. IL-2 promoter activity was assayed by transient transfection of IL-2 CAT plasmids into H9 or Jurkat T cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin with subsequent determination of CAT activity from transfected cell extracts. 107 cells were used per transfection using 200 μg of DEAE-dextran and 10-20 μg of IL-2 CAT plasmid DNA. Cells were split into two flasks 24 h after transfection with one set of cells stimulated with 25 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 2 μM ionomycin for 8 h. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline lysed by multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and used in assays of CAT activity as described previously (36Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 μg of an RSVβ-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected with the CAT reporter to standardize for transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by incubation of 10 μl of whole cell extract with 5 mM CPRG (70 mM sodium phosphate, 8 mM KCl, 0.8 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) at 37°C followed by determination of absorbance at 574 nm (37Hollon T. Yoshimura F.K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Several cDNA libraries and were screened to obtain additional ILF clones containing full-length coding sequences. 1.2 × 106 phage from a λZAP Sup T3 T cell leukemia library and 500,000 plaques from a λEXlox HeLa cDNA library (Novagen) were probed with a 32P-radiolabeled fragment spanning nucleotides 527-876 of the originally described ILF-1 and ILF-2 cDNAs. Several positive phage were isolated and sequenced, three of which contained new ILF coding sequence. The new ILF-1, ILF-2, and ILF-3 composite cDNA clones were assembled using these new sequences and compared for ILF-1, ILF-2, and ILF-3 to previously isolated cDNAs (24Li C. Lusis A.J. Sparkes R. Nirula A. Gaynor R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequences were placed into GenBank and have the accession numbers U58196, U58197, and U58198 respectively. The ARRE-2 site in the IL-2 promoter is extremely well conserved between species as depicted in Fig. 1. Comparison of the human, bovine, and murine ARRE-2 elements in the IL-2 promoter reveal three absolutely conserved regions each of which are indicated by brackets (Fig. 1). Two of these elements are remarkably purine-rich and flank a third conserved region that we designated the core element. The 5′ purine and core regions are bound in vivo by NFAT and AP-1 transcription factors, respectively, and both of these elements have been demonstrated to be essential for maximal ARRE-2 transcriptional activity (6Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 7Boise L.H. Petryniak B. Mao X. June C.H. Wang C. Lindsten T. Bravo R. Kovary K.

The functional importance of the 3′ purine element in IL-2 gene expression has not been previously determined. Gel retardation analysis was performed with an IL-2 ARRE-2 probe to characterize the binding of constitutive and inducible factors that were present in nuclear extract prepared from nonactivated and PMA and ionomycin-activated Jurkat cells. A single gel-retarded species was present in nuclear extract prepared from nonactivated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). When the IL-2 probe was incubated with extract prepared from PMA and ionomycin-treated Jurkat cells, the faster mobility gel-retarded species as well as a slower migrating inducible NFAT complex were present (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Probes containing mutations in each of the three conserved regions in the IL-2 ARRE-2 were then used to determine the binding specificity of constitutive and inducible binding activities (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-5). The inducible NFAT complex present in extracts prepared from activated Jurkat nuclear extract was markedly decreased when the 5′ purine or the core regions were mutated (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Mutation of the 3′ purine region did not prevent NFAT binding in nuclear extract prepared from activated Jurkat cells but decreased the constitutive binding activity in the nuclear extract (Fig. 2A, lane 5). These results were consistent using different preparations of Jurkat nuclear extract. Thus, a factor present in both resting and activated Jurkat nuclear extract bound to the IL-2 ARRE-2 promoter, and this binding was dependent on the core and 3′ purine sequences. Previously we have demonstrated that the transcription factor ILF when produced as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase was capable of binding to the IL-2 ARRE site (23Li C. Lai C. Sigman D.S. Gaynor R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7739-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further characterize the constitutive binding activity, nuclear extract prepared from nonactivated Jurkat cells was incubated with the radiolabeled wild-type IL-2 ARRE-2 probe (Fig. 2B). In addition to the predominant constitutive binding activity, a nonspecific faster mobility gel-retarded complex that was present in some Jurkat nuclear extract preparations was also detected (Fig. 2B). This latter complex bound to the wild-type IL-2 ARRE-2 probe in addition to mutant probes in the 5′ purine, core, or 3′ purine regions (data not shown). Incubation of Jurkat nuclear extract with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antisera to ILF resulted in a supershift of the majority of the slower mobility binding activity with no change in the amount of the nonspecific binding activity (Fig. 2B, lane 2). A similar supershifted band was not seen when preimmune antisera were incubated with the extract (Fig. 2B, lane 3) or when ILF antisera were incubated with the probe alone (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Mutations in the 5′ purine region should preclude the binding of several ARRE-2 binding proteins present in resting T cells including NFATp (9Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curan T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), in addition to the NF45 and NF90 proteins (20Corthesy B. Kao P.N. J. Biol.

ILF antisera also supershifted the majority of the slower mobility complex bound to an IL-2 ARRE-2 probe mutated in the 5′ purine region when used in gel retardation analysis with nuclear extract prepared from nonactivated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Again the ILF antibody did not alter the intensity of the nonspecific bind"

The Δ252-259 mutant has 4-fold higher affinity for glucagon than does the wild type receptor. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), inhibits binding of 125I-glucagon to the wild type receptor but not to the Δ252-259 mutant. Divalent cations such as MgCl2 and CaCl2 stimulate the binding of 125I-glucagon to the wild type receptor by increasing glucagon affinity. The rate of dissociation of 125I-glucagon is decreased 4-fold by MgCl2 and increased 6-fold by Gpp(NH)p. However, divalent cations do not affect the binding of 125I-glucagon to the Δ252-259 mutant. The rate of dissociation of 125I-glucagon from the Δ252-259 mutant protein is equivalent to the rate of dissociation from the wild type receptor in the presence of MgCl2. These data suggest that at least three conformations of the glucagon receptor can exist in the membrane based on their differing affinities for 125I-glucagon.

The apparent molecular mass of denatured isoform subunits of IA, IB, and III-PII (158, 173, and 201 kDa, respectively) bore no integer relationship to the apparent molecular mass of the native isoforms (265, 417, and 530 kDa), but the latter bore a ratio of 1.96:3.09:3.93 to the weight-average apparent molecular mass of native IA (135 kDa), suggesting that the isoforms are multimers of a 135-kDa sequence. Isoforms IA and III-PII had an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence which showed homologies to the N-terminal sequence of sialidases produced by Bacteroides fragilis SBT3182, another commensal enteric bacterium."

In cyanobacteria, cytochrome c6 and flavodoxin serve as alternate donors and acceptors under conditions of low copper and low iron. The PS I complex contains the photosynthetic pigments, the primary donor P700, and five electron transfer centers (A0, A1, FX, FA, and FB) that are bound to the PsaA, PsaB, and PsaC proteins. In cyanobacteria, the PS I complex contains at least eight other polypeptides that are ancillary to electron transfer in their function (1Chitnis P.R. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Nechushtai R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cofactors of PS I participate in electron transport across the membrane, oxidizing plastocyanin, and reducing ferredoxin according to the following sequence: plastocyanin (copper) or cytochrome c6 (heme) → P700 (Chl a dimer) → A0 (Chl a)→ A1 (phylloquinone) → FX (a [4Fe-4S] cluster) → FA or FB ([4Fe-4S] clusters) → ferredoxin ([2Fe-2S] cluster) or flavodoxin (flavin).

Previous studies showed that the introduction of aspartic acid in position 14 (C14DPsaC) and in position 51 (C51DPsaC) led to the introduction of [3Fe-4S] and mixed-ligand [4Fe-4S] clusters in the modified FB and FA sites, respectively, of Escherichia coli-expressed PsaC proteins (2Yu L. Zhao J. Lu W. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, when the mutant PsaC proteins were rebound to P700-FX cores, only mixed-ligand [4Fe-4S] clusters were found in the modified sites of the reconstituted C14DPsaC-PS I (3Yu L. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7861-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and C51DPsaC-PS I (4Yu L. Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28118-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) complexes. In both mutant PS I complexes, electrons could be transferred to the mixed-ligand iron-sulfur cluster at 15 K, and room temperature NADP+ photoreduction was supported at rates similar to the wild type. The formation of mixed-ligand [4Fe-4S] clusters with altered spectral and redox properties in vitro provided a rationale for probing the functions of FA and FB in vivo The ability to support [4Fe-4S] clusters that are able to transfer electrons at both 15 and 298 K suggests that the putative oxygen-ligated iron-sulfur clusters should be functional in living organisms. The step taken in this work is to move mutations in these ligands into a genetic system such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and to study the in vivo consequences on growth and electron transfer. Unlike other cyanobacteria, two different psaC genes have been reported in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. One (psaC1) (5Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has a deduced amino acid sequence identical to that of tobacco, while the other (psaC2) (6Steinmüller K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) has a deduced amino acid sequence similar to those reported for other cyanobacteria. The psaC1 gene is not involved in PS I, nor can it substitute for psaC2 when the latter is insertionally inactivated. The amino acid sequence of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 PsaC matched that predicted from psaC2 Insertional inactivation of psaC2 prevented the formation of PsaC, thus demonstrating that this gene encodes the PS I-bound polypeptide. Further work showed that the PsaC polypeptide is necessary for stable assembly of PsaD and PsaE into PS I complexes in vivo and that PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE are not needed for assembly of PsaA/PsaB dimer and electron transport from P700 to FX (7Yu J. Smart L.B. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this paper the term psaC refers to the gene psaC2 Site-directed mutagenesis and transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been successfully used in the study of PS I biogenesis and function (10Smart L.B Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Warren P.V. Smart L.B. McIntosh L. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, a set of strains with mutations in PsaC has been created in which a cysteine ligand to FA and/or FB is substituted by aspartate, serine, or alanine in positions 14 and/or 51. The genetic, physiological, and biochemical characterization of the PS I mutants will be presented. A companion paper (12Jung Y.-S. Vassiliev I. Yu J. McIntosh L. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8040-8049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) describes the EPR and optical kinetic properties of the mixed-ligand FA and FB clusters in site-modified PS I complexes. Experiments were performed using a glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which was acclimated for growth on solid medium in the dark. Except for tests for photoautotrophic and mixotrophic growth, cells were grown at 30°C under light-activated heterotrophic growth (LAHG) conditions, as described previously (13Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added in the following concentrations: kanamycin (Km), 5 mg/liter; gentamicin (Gm), 1 mg/liter. Transformations were performed essentially as described (15Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar), except in the case of strain ΔC-RCPT, which was carefully maintained in dim light (5 μmol m-2 s-1 during 2-h incubation) throughout the procedure, since it is light-sensitive (its mixotrophic growth with added glucose is inhibited at light intensities greater than 10 μmol m-2 s-1). Tests for photoautotrophic and mixotrophic growth were performed using solid media with or without supplemental glucose in a chamber providing continuous light. The light intensity was varied by covering plates with layers of cheese cloth and were monitored using a L1-185A photometer (LICOR, Lincoln, NE). Large cultures were grown in carboys (15 liters) under LAHG conditions and were bubbled with air. Nucleic acids were manipulated using standard methodology (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), unless otherwise stated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit as directed by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). For amplification of psaC from cyanobacterial strains, cells picked from a medium sized colony or equivalent amount of cells collected from liquid culture were washed once with water and used as template. Amplification products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Procedure for preparation of cyanobacterial DNA was adapted from 17Ohad N. Hirschberg J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 273-282PubMed Google Scholar, with two “loopfuls” of cells scraped from plates or cells from 10 ml of liquid culture being used to extract DNA. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that had been maintained under LAHG conditions for at least two subcultures (cells were subcultured once a week) was transformed with plasmids containing resistance genes to kanamycin or gentamicin. Selection for antibiotic-resistant colonies was performed under LAHG conditions. Resistant colonies were re-streaked to single colonies with at least five serial transfers to obtain full segregation of the mutation, as verified by restriction enzyme analysis of PCR products, direct sequencing of PCR products, Southern hybridizations, and growth tests. Thylakoid membranes were isolated and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described (18Smart L. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To resolve the PsaA/PsaB proteins, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were used; 17% gels were used to resolve PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, and PsaF. D2 protein in Photosystem II (PS II) was resolved with a 17% gel to serve as a control. Protein assays were performed using the method of (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of chlorophyll (4 μg for PS I complexes) were loaded in each lane. Equal amounts of protein (150 μg) was loaded in each lane for thylakoids preparations. Rabbit antiserum to PsaC or PsaD were raised using protein purified from strains of E. coli expressing, respectively, the psaC gene from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 or the psaD gene from Nostoc sp. PCC 8009 (20Li N. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. Frank G. Zuber H. Bryant D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibodies against PsaA/B proteins from Synechococcus were raised in rabbits as described previously (21Henry R. Takemoto L. Murphy J. Gallegos G. Guikema J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. (Paris). 1992; 30: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against PsaE and PsaF (gifts from Dr. Parag Chitnis, Kansas State University) were raised in rabbits immunized with PsaE and PsaF purified from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Rabbit antibodies to the D2 polypeptide from spinach (gifts from Dr. Wim Vermaas, Arizona State University) were raised as described (22Vermaas W.F.J. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 17: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll was extracted with methanol and quantified using published extinction coefficients (23Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9133) Google Scholar). LAHG-grown cells were washed once in 40 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.0 and cells containing 10 μg Chl were resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer and illuminated by saturating light at 25°C. Rates of oxygen evolution were determined with a Rank-type oxygen electrode unit. Whole-chain electron transport was measured in the presence of 10 mM NaHCO3. PS II electron transport was measured in the presence of 1 mM 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone. Thylakoid membranes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were isolated using a modification of the procedure described in 7Yu J. Smart L.B. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. The cells were suspended in 0.8 M sucrose, 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were washed twice and suspended in the same buffer containing 0.8 M sucrose and protease inhibitors. The cells were broken in 10 cycles of a prechilled bead-beater (Biospec Products, Bartelsville, OK); one cycle consisted of a 45-s “on phase” and a 10-min “off phase.” The cell solution was removed from the beads by vacuum suction and centrifuged at rav of 5,000 × g to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was pelleted by high speed ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g with repetitive washing. The thylakoid membranes were suspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -95°C. n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside-PS I (DM-PS I) complexes were isolated using the protocol described in 24Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 336: 330-334Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar with minor modifications. The membranes were solubilized in 1% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DM, Calbiochem) at 4°C for 1 h at the Chl concentration of 0.5 mg ml-1. DM-PS I complexes were isolated from the lower green zone of PS I trimers which appeared after centrifugation of the solubilized membrane suspension loaded in a sucrose density gradient (0.1-1.0 M sucrose) for 24 h at 4°C. In the alanine and double aspartate mutants, a mixture of PS I monomers and trimers was used, because it was difficult to completely separate the lower and the upper bands. The problem is that PsaL is easily lost in the presence of 1% DM at 0.4 mg Chl/ml due to the absence of PsaD (9Mannan R.M. Pakrasi H.B. Sonoike K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Even though the lower part of the broad band containing mostly PS I trimers was used (containing <10% of the total Chl), there was nonetheless some contamination by PS I monomers. Isolated PS I complexes were dialyzed in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, resuspended with the same buffer containing 15% glycerol and 0.03% DM, frozen as small aliquots in the liquid nitrogen, and stored at -95°C. The steady state reductase activities of PS I complexes were measured according to 25Jung Y.-S. Yu L. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. The absorbance kinetics were measured using a Cary 219 spectrophotometer with the photomultiplier shielded by appropriate narrow band and interference filters. The sample was illuminated from both sides using two banks of high intensity, LEDs emitting at ∼660 nm (LS1, Hansatech Ltd.). The light intensity was saturating at the chlorophyll concentration used. Rates of flavodoxin photoreduction were measured in a 1.3-ml volume using 15 μM flavodoxin and DM-PS I at 5 μg ml-1 of Chl in 50 mM Tricine, pH 8.0, 50 mM MgCl2, 15 μM cytochrome c6 from Spirulina maxima, 6 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.05% DM. The measurement was made by monitoring the rate of change in the absorption of flavodoxin at 467 nm. Rates of flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction were measured in a 1.3-ml volume using 15 μM flavodoxin and 0.8 μM spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (Sigma), and DM-PS I at 5 μg ml-1 of chlorophyll in 50 mM Tricine, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 15 μM cytochrome c6 from S. maxima, 6 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.05% DM, 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol. Rates of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction were measured in a 1.3-ml volume using 5 μM spinach ferredoxin and 0.8 μM spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (Sigma), and DM-PS I at 5 μg ml-1 of chlorophyll in 50 mM Tricine, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 15 μM cytochrome c6 from S. maxima, 6 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.05% DM, 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol. The flavodoxin was purified from the a strain of E. coli containing the gene by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-75 (both from Sigma) (26Mühlenhoff U. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NADP+ reduction were measured by monitoring the rate of change in the absorption of NADPH at 340 nm. Transient absorbance changes of P700 at 820 nm (ΔA820) were measured from the microseconds to tens-of-seconds time domain with a laboratory-built double-beam spectrometer as described in 28Vassiliev I.

J. 1995; 69: 1544-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar upon excitation with a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser with a flash energy of 250 mJ. The decay transients were fitted to “sum of several exponentials with base line” using the Marquardt algorithm in Igor Pro. The user-defined fit function enabled a fit up to 7 exponentials with all amplitudes and rate constants set free during the fit. In most cases the fit comprised a base-line component accounting for long term phases and/or possible drift of signal zero during long time scale acquisition. The quality of the fit was estimated using standard techniques, including analyses of the residuals plots and comparison of the X2 values and standard errors of the fit parameters between different fits. To allow rapid segregation of mutations in the psaC gene, a recipient strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was engineered with the psaC coding region deleted and replaced by a kanamycin-resistant (KmR) cassette (Fig. 1A). PCR-amplified psaC upstream (454 bp) and downstream (208 bp) flanking regions, with linker sequences for BamHI and EcoRI at either end, were cloned into pUC118 (29Vierra J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3781) Google Scholar). A KmR cassette excised from pUC4K (30Taylor L.A. Rose R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 358Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using EcoRI was inserted into the EcoRI site that separated the upstream and downstream flanking regions to form the plasmid pUC118-ΔC. Glucose-tolerant but otherwise wild type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was transformed with pUC118-ΔC, and KmR colonies were selected under LAHG conditions and were genetically verified by Southern hybridization using a 1.5-kb EcoRI-NcoI fragment containing psaC as probe and by PCR. Complete segregation of the deletion mutation was confirmed (data not shown). Plasmids for site-directed mutagenesis were constructed in vitro and manipulated in E. coli A 1.5-kb EcoRI-NcoI fragment containing psaC was cut out of the plasmid p6.1S3.5I (6Steinmüller K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and cloned into pUC119 (29Vierra J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3781) Google Scholar) at the SmaI site to create plasmid pC. A 2.0-kb gentamicin resistance (GmR) cassette, cut with BamHI from pUC119-gen (31Smart L.B. Bowlby N.R. Anderson S.L. Sithole I. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), was inserted at BbsI site downstream of psaC gene on pC to create plasmid pCG. Single-stranded DNA of pC was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides were designed to effect the desired changes in the coding sequence, while also destroying an endonuclease restriction site (RsaI for the Cys-14 site and BbvI for the Cys-51 site). The resulting change in digestion pattern serves as an effective and simple means of screening for the desired mutation. After verification of the mutations on pC using restriction mapping and DNA sequencing, a 953-bp BglII-PstI fragment containing the psaC mutation was cut out of pC and ligated with a 5.7-kb partial digestion product from pCG devoid of the corresponding fragment to form pCG with mutated psaC gene. The mutated pCG plasmids were checked by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the proper sequences. Taking advantage of a XbaI site in between Cys-14 site and Cys-51 site, pCG with a double mutation C14D/C51DPsaC was created by ligating a 758-bp XbaI-XbaI fragment from pCG with a single mutation C14DPsaC and a 5.9-kb XbaI-XbaI fragment from pCG with a single mutation C51DPsaC. Plasmid pCG with wild type psaC and its mutated variants (shown with asterisk on psaC) were then used to transform the strain ΔC-RCPT (Fig. 1B). GmR colonies were selected under LAHG conditions and were genetically verified by three different methods: (i) Southern hybridization of genomic DNA using a 1.5-kb EcoRI-NcoI fragment containing psaC as probe; (ii) restriction mapping and direct DNA sequencing of PCR product amplified from single colonies; and (iii) growth in the presence of kanamycin. Gene replacement by double crossover and complete segregation of all the mutations was confirmed (data not shown). As shown in Table I, all of the PsaC mutants were unable to grow autotrophically under light intensities ranging from 2.2 to 22 μmol m-2 s-1. They were able to grow mixotrophically under 2.2 μmol m-2 s-1 but not under 22 μmol m-2 s-1. In addition, C51D and C14S were not able to grow photoautotrophically or mixotrophically under 60 μmol m-2 s-1. All PsaC mutants showed similar growth rates to wild type when growing under LAHG or mixotrophically under 2.2 μmol m-2 s-1. These results show that the mutants are deficient in photosynthesis, that they are light-sensitive, and that their mixotrophic growth is inhibited by moderate light intensity of 22 μmol m-2 s-1. The likely source of light inhibition is the overreduction of the quinone pool by PSII activity. This interpretation arises from results (data now shown) where C51DPsaC was found to grow mixotrophically under 22 μmol m-2 s-1 light in the presence of 5 mM DCMU, a PS II inhibitor. Transformation of C14SPsaC and C51DPsaC with wild type psaC DNA restored photoautotrophic growth and relieved light inhibition under mixotrophic conditions, demonstrating that the only lesion in these mutants is on psaC (data not shown).Table IPhysiological characterization of PsaC mutantsWild type GmRΔC-RCPTC51DC51SC51AC14DC14SC14AC14D C51DPhotoautotrophic growth (2.2-22 μmol m-2 s-1)+--------Mixotrophic growth (2.2 μmol m-2 s-1)+++++++++Mixotrophic growth (22 μmol m-2 s-1)+--------Whole-chain O2 evolution430 ± 1652.58 ± 18.0341 ± 126101 ± 56.539.0 ± 27.4118 ± 62.4141 ± 61.332.9 ± 15.129.5 ± 18.1H2O → CO2; μmol O2 mg Chl-1 h-1PS II O2 evolution292 ± 75.3312 ± 62.6553 ± 253326 ± 38.5484 ± 124368 ± 79.5455 ± 43.7409 ± 117370 ± 68.3H2O → DCBQ; μmol O2 mg Chl-1 h-1PS I electron transport90040460480605104804060Cytochrome c6→ flavodoxin; μmol flavodoxin mg Chl-1 h-1PS I electron transport93070700670170700730200170Cytochrome c6→ flavodoxin → NADP+; μmol NADP+ mg Chl-1 h-1PS I electron transport82040540430504803805070Cytochrome c6→ ferredoxin → NADP+; μmol NADP+ mg Chl-1 h-1Single turnover efficiency (%)86028210413200ΔA820, P700+ [FA/FB]- Open table in a new tab Whole-chain electron transport (H2O → CO2) and PS II electron transport (H2O → 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone) were measured using LAHG-grown cells. As shown in Table I, there was essentially no O2 evolution in ΔC-RCPT, indicating that PsaC is required for whole-chain photosynthetic electron transport. This is consistent with previous observations (7Yu J. Smart L.B. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type control, all the PsaC mutants had lowered whole-chain O2 evolution rates to varying degrees, with Asp and Ser mutants showing the highest rates, and Ala mutants and the double Asp mutant showing the lowest rates. However, all the mutants, including ΔC-RCPT, showed near-wild type levels of PS II O2 evolution rates, indicating electron transport in PS II was not affected in the short term in the mutants. Variation of these rates most probably represents physiological variations of the whole cells of several independent cultures of each mutant tested over a period of several months. Table I shows rates of flavodoxin reduction and ferredoxin- and flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction for DM-PS I complexes isolated from the wild type and mutant strains. The wild type PS I complex supports high rates of reductase activity in the range of 800-900 μmol/mg of Chl/h. The ΔC-RCPT mutant (which lacks PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE) shows the rate of flavodoxin photoreduction of 40 μmol/mg of Chl/h and the rates of flavodoxin and ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction of 70 and 40 μmol/mg Chl/h. The C14DPsaC-PS I and C51DPsaC-PS I complexes show similar levels of reductase activity, but at a reduced level compared with the wild type PS I complex: 460-510 μmol/mg of Chl/h for flavodoxin reduction, 700 μmol/mg of Chl/h for flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction, and 480-540 μmol/mg of Chl/h for ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction. Both the C14SPsaC-PS I and C51SPsaC-PS I complexes show nearly the same level of reductase activity as the aspartate mutants. However, the C14APsaC-PS I, C51APsaC-PS I, and C14D/C51DPsaC-PS I complexes supported minimal rates of PS I reductase activities similar to those for the ΔC-RCPT complex. Immunoblotting of thylakoid membrane proteins was performed on an equal protein basis, and PS I complexes on an equal chlorophyll basis, using antibodies against the proteins PsaA/B, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, and PsaF. Compared with wild type thylakoid membranes, the levels of PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE were lower to varying degrees in all mutants (Fig. 2). The Asp and Ser mutants demonstrated moderately low levels of these proteins, while Ala mutants and the double Asp mutant did not contain detectable amounts of these three subunits. All mutants contained near-wild type levels of PsaF and PsaA/PsaB in all samples (Fig. 2). It is difficult to quantitate PsaA/PsaB with immunoblots (10Smart L.B Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L.

PCC 6803 was utilized to incorporate site-specific amino acid substitutions in the cysteine residues that ligate the FA and FB iron-sulfur clusters in Photosystem I (PS I). Cysteines 14 and 51 of PsaC were changed to aspartic acid (C14DPsaC, C51DPsaC, C14D/C51DPsaC), serine (C14SPsaC, C51SPsaC), and alanine (C14APsaC, C51APsaC), and the properties of FA and FB were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The C14DPsaC-PS I and C14SPsaC-PS I complexes showed high levels of photoreduction of FA with g values of 2.045, 1.944, and 1.852 after illumination at 15 K, but there was no evidence of reduced FB in the g = 2 region.

One instance of a functional [4Fe-4S] cluster derived from an aspartate-for-cysteine change is the modified PsaC subunit of PS I. In a previous study, E. coli expressed mutant PsaC proteins were reconstituted onto P700-FX cores, and the assignment of the ligands for the two terminal electron acceptors was determined by EPR spectroscopy (10Zhao J. Li N. Warren P. Golbeck J. Bryant D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The substitution of aspartate for cysteine in position 14 of PsaC led to the retention of a S = 1/2, [4Fe-4S] cluster at the unmodified site with g values characteristic of FA. Similarly, the substitution of aspartate for cysteine in position 51 of PsaC led to the retention of a S = 1/2, [4Fe-4S] cluster at the unmodified site with g values characteristic of FB. Since the pattern of cysteine ligation in PsaC is expected to be identical to that of ferredoxins with two [4Fe-4S] clusters whose structures have been determined, it follows that FB is ligated by cysteines 11, 14, 17, and 58 and FA is ligated by cysteines 21, 48, 51, and 54 (10Zhao J. Li N. Warren P. Golbeck J. Bryant D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstitution experiments led to several hypotheses regarding alternative ligands to iron-sulfur clusters: 1) unbound PsaC refolds only in the presence of one [3Fe-4S] and one [4Fe-4S] or two [4Fe-4S] clusters when cysteine is replaced in positions 14 and 51 by aspartate, serine, and alanine (11Yu L.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28108-28117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). According to these results, a stable three-dimensional structure requires the presence of two iron-sulfur clusters, one of which must be a cubane. 2) The failure to observe a [3Fe-4S] cluster in the in vitro reconstituted C14XPsaC-PS I or C51XPsaC-PS I complexes (where X = D, A, or S) indicates that the binding of PsaC onto P700-FX cores requires the presence of two [4Fe-4S] clusters. If rigorously true, it may be difficult to introduce a [3Fe-4S] cluster motif into PsaC in vivo 3) An oxygen ligand to the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the mutant site of the C14DPsaC-PS I and the C51DPasC-PS I complexes leads to a high-spin state (likely S = 3/2). In this paper, these hypotheses were tested through the generation of a series of in vivo mutations in FA and FB. The choices to replace cysteine residues with aspartic acid, serine, and alanine were made because aspartate is known to support [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters in naturally occurring ferredoxins (13Armstrong F.A.

Sayavedrasoto L.A. Arp D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3960-3964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and alanine, with the absence of a suitable ligand, should support only [3Fe-4S] clusters. This paper summarizes the EPR spectral characteristics and electron transfer properties of aspartate (C14DPsaC, C51DPsaC, C14D/C51DPsaC), alanine (C14APsaC, C51APsaC), and serine (C14SPasC, C51SPsaC) mutations in PsaC in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The premise tested is that [4Fe-4S] clusters will only be assembled in those mutants where oxygen ligands are available from the side chains of the replacement amino acids.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies were performed using a Bruker ECS-106 X-band spectrometer equipped with either a standard resonator (ER4102 ST) or a dual-mode resonator (DM/4116). Samples contained either 0.5 mg ml-1 (wild type) or 1 mg ml-1 (mutants) chlorophyll, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, 30 μM DCPIP in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. For chemical reduction of the FA and FB clusters, samples were suspended at a chlorophyll concentration of either 0.5 mg ml-1 (wild type) or 1 mg ml-1 (mutants) in 250 mM glycine, pH 10, with 50 mM sodium dithionite. For analysis of the P700+ cation, samples were suspended at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.47 mg ml-1 in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 30 μM DCPIP, and 200 μM sodium ascorbate. The spectra were taken at 77 K and at microwave power levels that were in the square-law region and well below saturation. The charge separation between P700 and FA/FB is irreversible at this temperature during the time scale of the measurement (17Chamorovsky S.K. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 679: 146-155Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All data manipulations and graphics were performed using IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Simulations of the S = 1/2 EPR spectra were performed using the “EPRSim” XOP for IGOR Pro 3.0 (recompiled by John Boswell, Oregon Graduate Institute), an adaptation of the FORTRAN program “QPOW” (18Belford R.L. Nilges M.J. EPR Symposium, 21st Rocky Mountain Conference. Denver, CO1979Google Scholar). The number of electron acceptors functioning after A1 was determined at room temperature using a train of appropriately spaced sequential single turnover flashes similar to that described in (19Bottin H. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 91-98Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this protocol, reduction of P700+ by reduced phenazine methosulfate (PMS) overrides the faster reaction(s) involving FX- and/or A1- on the first and second flashes, when the electrons are consequently stabilized on both FA and FB. On the third and fourth flashes, the faster back reactions from FX- and A1- with lifetimes shorter than 1 ms become dominant. Hence, when two acceptors function after FX, the kinetics for the second flash is similar to that for the first, and the kinetics for a fourth flash is similar to that for the third. In practice, the kinetics on the second flash may contain some contribution from FX- due to double hits on the 10-μs duration xenon flash.

The output power was 25 mW, and due to a higher stability of the output, the reference channel was not used. Repetitive flashes at 15-ms intervals were provided by a model 6100E-72 xenon flash lamp (Photochemical Research Associates, London, Ontario, Canada) at full-width half-maximum of 10 μs and flash energy of ∼5 mJ. A fiber optic light guide was used to direct the actinic beam to the cuvette in direction prependicular to that of the measuring beam. The saturating intensity of the flash was confirmed by using the neutral density filters and by monitoring the ΔA832 signal. The samples were suspended in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 6.3, at a chlorophyll concentration of 25 μg ml-1 with 0.05%β-DM, and PMS and sodium dithionite from freshly prepared solutions were added to concentrations of 10 μM and 2 mM, respectively. The concentration of PMS was chosen to assure re-reduction of P700+ prior to recombination with FA- and/or FB-. Sodium dithionite was used to completely reduce the PMS to prevent the oxidized form from functioning as an electron acceptor. The optical path length for the measuring light was 1 cm. The samples were preincubated in the dark in the spectrometer for 4 min prior to flash excitation. For numeric analysis of the data we have made a simultaneous global fit of all four kinetics to the sum of two exponentials with common lifetimes and common initial amplitude (assuming that the amount of P700+ formed on each flash should be the same upon almost complete relaxation of the absorbance change produced by the preceding flash). For each set of four kinetics we have derived the initial amplitude of the absorbance change, the lifetime of the slow component accounting for P700+ reduction by reduced PMS, the lifetime of the fast component accounting for P700+ reduction by FX- and A1-, and a set of four amplitudes of the slow component. In general, this model gave a high quality fit in the millisecond time domain (where the kinetics is mostly governed by the slower PMS component), but in some cases the deviations in the sub-millisecond time domain could be higher due to the presence of two exponentially decaying components in this time domain. When PS I complexes from a mutant expressing C14DPsaC were frozen in darkness and illuminated at 15 K, the EPR spectrum showed a S = 1/2 ground state iron-sulfur cluster with g values of 2.047, 1.945, and 1.851 (Fig. 1, left column). The resonances, which are diagnostic of FA, do not diminish in intensity in a subsequent period of darkness. The temperature dependence of the resonances at 18 K (not shown), 15 K (Fig. 1A), 12 K (Fig. 1B), 9 K (Fig. 1C) to 6 K (Fig. 1D) indicates a maximum signal intensity at 15 K, similar to the wild type, although the resonances are present over a much broader and lower range of temperatures. (The trough between 365 and 370 mT may represent the midfield resonance of FX; the low-field trough around 390 mT is barely visible). There is no indication of a S = 1/2 ground state iron-sulfur cluster characteristic of reduced FB in the g = 2 spectral region. Resonances characteristic of FA were also present in the g = 2 spectral region when PS I complexes from the a mutant expressing C14DPsaC were frozen during illumination (Fig. 1, right column). Under these conditions, more than one electron is promoted to the acceptor system. The intensity of the FA resonances increase from 15 K (Fig. 1E), to 12 K (Fig. 1F), to 9 K (Fig. 1G), and become maximum at <6 K (Fig. 1H). This is a temperature behavior different from conditions where only one electron is promoted (compare Fig. 1, B and D with F and H), indicating that the FA cluster is relieved of power saturation, most likely by the presence of a nearby spin system. One candidate is reduced FX, which is observed at temperatures <9 K (see Fig. 1, G and H) as a broad, rhombic spectrum with midfield and high-field resonances at g = 1.852 and 1.755 (the low-field peak is obscured by the g = 2.044 resonance of FA). However, it has been shown in a PS I complex which lacks FB that reduced FX does not influence the microwave power or temperature dependence of FA (27Jung Y.-S. Yu L. Golbeck J.H. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assuming that no changes are introduced other than creating an empty site in FB, these data indicate that FX does not influence the spin relaxation properties of FA. The implication is that the enhanced relaxation rate of FA is due to the presence of reduced FB, which we propose is present as a high-spin (likely S = 3/2) [4Fe-4S] cluster in the mutant site. At this time, it is only possible to infer the presence of FB, since we have not located a low-field resonance around g = 5.5 which could be attributed to a highly rhombic S = 3/2 spin system. High-spin iron-sulfur clusters are difficult to observe when the g anisotropy is distributed over a large spectral range. Note also that there is also an apparent broadening of the g = 1.852 resonance at 6 K (Fig. 1H), but this is probably due to overlap from the midfield resonance of FX. The PS I complexes from the C14SPsaC mutant have EPR spectral properties that are similar, although not identical, to those for the C14DPsaC-PS I complex. When the PS I complexes from a mutant expressing the C14SPsaC mutant were frozen in darkness and illuminated at 15 K, the EPR spectrum was characteristic of the FA cluster with g values of 2.045, 1.944, and 1.854 (Fig. 2, left column). There is no indication of reduced FB in the g = 2 spectral region. The FA resonances are present over a narrower range of temperatures than in C14DPsaC-PS I, increasing in intensity from 15 K (Fig. 2A), becoming maximum at 12 K (Fig. 2B) and decreasing from 9 K (Fig. 2C) through 6 K (Fig. 2D). This temperature behavior is similar than that of FA in the wild type cyanobacterial PS I complex, indicative of an enhanced spin relaxation mechanism at this site. Resonances characteristic of FA are found with the same temperature behavior when PS I complexes from the mutant C14SPsaC are frozen during illumination (Fig. 2, right column). The FX cluster is visible in the 9 K (Fig. 2G) and 6 K spectra (Fig. 2H), with a high-field resonance at g = 1.761 and a midfield feature around 365 mT. The latter is likely to be responsible for some, but not all, of the features around 360 mT in the 6 K spectrum. There is evidence at 12 K (Fig. 2F, arrows) and 9 K (Fig. 2G, arrows) for additional resonances at g = 2.102 and 1.883, and for a broader line width of the high-field resonance at g = 1.846. Except for the temperature dependence, these resonances are strikingly similar to those observed in the PS I complexes containing C51SPsaC (see below). When PS I complexes from a mutant expressing C51DPsaC were frozen in darkness and illuminated at 15 K, the EPR spectrum showed a set of resonances characteristic of FB, with g values of 2.067, 1.931, and 1.880 (Fig. 3, left column). The intensity of the resonances are weak, but are formed irreversibly. The maximum signal intensity occurs at 15 K (Fig. 3A), with lower intensities being observed at 12 K (Fig. 3B), 9 K (Fig. 3C), and 6 K (Fig. 3D). This temperature optimum is similar to that of FB in the wild type complex. However, a large amount of irreversible P700+ is generated; this rules out charge separation with FX or A1 (discussed below). The spectrum is considerably more complex when the C51DPsaC-PS I complex is frozen during illumination (Fig. 3, right column). As the temperature is lowered from 15 K (Fig. 3E) to 12 K (Fig. 3F), the FB resonances remain dominant with a temperature optimum identical to that of a sample illuminated at 15 K. At temperatures of 9 K (Fig. 3G) and 6 K (Fig. 3H), FB diminishes due to microwave power saturation, but at 6 K a broad peak at g = 2.096, a change in the slope of the midfield feature at g = 1.925, and a high-field trough at g = 1.843 become visible (Fig. 3H, arrows). These features are assumed to be derived from a mixed-ligand cluster, termed FAʹ, in the modified site. The maximum signal intensity of the modified FAʹ cluster occurs at temperatures between 4.2 and 6 K, a value which is lower than the 15 K optimum of FA in a wild type complex. The FX cluster is also seen at 6 K, with its high-field trough at g = 1.76 and a midfield resonance between 350 and 360 mT, which is obscured by the presence of resonances from FA and/or FB. When PS I complexes from a mutant expressing C51SPsaC were frozen in darkness and illuminated at 15 K, the EPR spectrum was characteristic of FB, with g values of 2.067, 1.930, and 1.879 (Fig. 4, left column). There is no indication of reduced FA in the S = 1/2 spectral region. The intensity of the FB resonances are also weak, but again, are formed irreversibly. The maximum signal intensity occurs at 15 K (Fig. 4A), becoming progressively weaker at 12 K (Fig. 4B), 9 K (Fig. 4C), and 6 K (Fig. 4D). The maximum at 15 K is similar to that of FB in the wild type complex. Because of the large amount of P700+ radical generated, we again surmise that the FA cluster is present and functional, but that it is not visible in the g = 2 region when FB is oxidized in the same reaction center. In terms of g values, temperature dependence and spectral lineshape, the FB cluster in the C51SPsaC-PS I mutant is identical to that in the C51DPsaC-PS I mutant. A stronger set of resonances characteristic FB are found when the C51SPsaC-PS I complex is frozen during illumination (Fig. 4, right column). The signal attains maximum intensity at 15 K (Fig. 4E) and decreases at 12 K (Fig. 4F) due to the onset of microwave power saturation; below 9 K (Fig. 4, G and H), the resonances are within the noise. At 9 K (Fig. 4G) and 6 K (Fig. 4H) high-field resonance of the FX cluster can be observed at g = 1.756, but the low-field and mid-field resonances are obscured by other peaks. At temperatures of 6 K and lower (Fig. 4H), a new set of features at g = 2.117, 1.916, and 1.837 become visible, these are attributed to a mixed-ligand FAʹ cluster in the modified site. Their maximum signal intensity occurs at ≤4.2 K, a temperature lower than that of FA in the wild type PS I complex. The spectral g values and lineshapes are similar to those the in vivo C51DPsaC-PS I complex; a set of common features includes the temperature dependence of the FB resonances, the appearance of new resonances at very low temperatures, and the apparent lack of magnetic interaction between the FB cluster observed at 15 K and the new spin system(s) observed at lower temperatures. If FB in the C14DPsaC-PS I and C14SPsaC-PS I complexes and if FA in the C51DPsaC-PS I and C51SPsaC-PS I complexes are present as a high spin iron-sulfur clusters, then the relative spin concentrations of FA and FB in the non-mutant sites should be equivalent to that in the wild type. One obvious consequence is that the digital summation of the C14XPsaC-PS I spectrum and the C51XPsaC-PS I spectrum (where X = D or S) should yield a wild type spectrum. This is shown in Fig. 5A for C14DPsaC-PS I (data from Fig. 1A) and C51DPsaC-PS I (data from Fig. 3A), where, under conditions where there is no magnetic interaction between FA and FB, the resulting admixture of FA and FB is identical to a wild type PS I complex (Fig. 5B). The relative spin concentrations of FA and FB in the C14DPsaC-PS I and C51DPsaC-PS I complexes were determined by double integration of the simulated spectra. As shown in Fig. 5C, FA (dotted line) can be accurately simulated assuming g values of 2.047, 1.945, and 1.851 and line widths of 33, 21, and 17 MHz and FB (dashed line) can be simulated assuming g values of 2.067, 1.931, and 1.880 and line widths of 50, 32, and 33 MHz. Using these parameters, the composite spectrum of FA/FB in the wild type and in the digitally summed mutant spectra can be reproduced assuming a 3.17 ratio of FA to FB (solid line). A second consequence is that the P700+ cation radical should also be equivalent in spin concentration in the wild type, C14XPsaC-PS I, and C51XPsaC-PS I complexes (where X = D or S), regardless of the spin concentration of FA or FB seen in the g = 2 region. Fig. 6 shows the P700+ radical in a sample after freezing in darkness and illumination at 77 K (dotted line) and in a subsequent period of darkness (solid line). The former corresponds to the charge separated state of P700+ (FB-/FA- plus FX-), and the latter represents the permanent charge separated state of P700+ (FB-/FA-). In wild type PS I complexes, charge separation is not quantitative, but is progressively induced in a series of laser flashes up to a maximum of two-thirds of the reaction centers (28Sétif P. Mathis P. Vänngaard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 404-414Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hence, the amount of irreversibly formed P700+ radical paired with FA and FB in the wild type PS I complex is less than the amount seen on continuous illumination. As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of irreversible P700+ generated in the C14XPsaC-PS I and C51XPsaC-PS I complexes is roughly equivalent, yet the spin concentration of FB is only 24% that of FA (Fig. 5C). This strongly implies that the majority of irreversible P700+ is paired with a missing spin system in the C51DPsaC-PS I complex, presumably the high-spin FA cluster. Similarly, there is a smaller amount of irreversible P700+ paired with a missing spin system in the C14DPsaC-PS I complex, presumably the high-spin FB cluster. One final detail is that there is a greater amount of irreversible P700+ formed in the C14SPsaC-PS I and C51SPsaC-PS I complexes than in the wild type and aspartate mutants, but this could be due to a greater efficiency of forward electron transfer from FX to FA/FB at cryogenic temperatures in the serine mutants. Western blots showed the absence of PsaC (as well as PsaD and PsaE) on the C14APsaC-PS I and C51APsaC-PS I complexes (16Yu J. Vassiliev I. Jung Y.-S. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. J. Biol.

In the present study, the extent of involvement of protein kinase C in the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact retinas was assessed using a specific activator (phorbol ester) and specific inhibitor (calphostin C) of protein kinase C. Kinetic analysis of rhodopsin phosphorylation following different illumination conditions revealed that hyperactivation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester resulted in a relative increase in rhodopsin phosphorylation that peaked 10-15 min after the onset of illumination. Following this period, the rate of rhodopsin dephosphorylation was increased in the phorbol ester-treated retinas, so that by about 30 min the amount of phosphorylation was similar to that in control retinas. Treatment of retinas with calphostin C, a potent regulatory domain-directed inhibitor of protein kinase C, resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin. This inhibitor had no effect on the activity of rhodopsin kinase in vitro Last, we show that frog rhodopsin is phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C from frog rod outer segments, indicating that this kinase could directly modulate rhodopsin in vivo In conclusion, the present results reveal that the kinetics of rhodopsin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation differ markedly, depending on whether protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase activity dominates, and that, under the conditions studied, protein kinase C contributes to approximately half of the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact frog retinas.

The involvement of multiple kinases in the regulation of specific signaling pathways is a common cellular theme. For G protein-coupled pathways, two classes of kinases phosphorylate receptors: substrate-regulated G protein-coupled receptor kinases and second messenger-regulated kinases such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the examples studied to date, phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases is typically involved in homologous desensitization (the phosphorylation follows direct stimulation of the receptor), and phosphorylation by second messenger-regulated kinases is involved in heterologous desensitization (the phosphorylation is independent of the liganded state of the receptor and may be initiated by activation of the kinase by a separate receptor) (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Phototransduction serves as the archetypal transduction pathway, and extensive studies with photoreceptor proteins have provided invaluable insight into the regulation of not only this pathway but numerous other G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways as well (3Hargrave P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 575-581Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 4Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the heptahelical receptor, rhodopsin, by a photon of light results in activation of the G protein transducin, which in turns activates a cGMP phosphodiesterase. The ensuing drop in cGMP levels in photoreceptor outer segments causes hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane by closing cGMP-gated channels, thus converting a biochemical signal into an electrophysiological response (6Lagnado L. Baylor D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 995-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the light-activated receptor by rhodopsin kinase, followed by binding of arrestin, effectively quenches the signal. Ca2+ levels, which are lowered when the cGMP-gated channels close, regulate deactivation and recovery stages of phototransduction. Two targets of Ca2+ have been identified in photoreceptors: guanylate cyclases, which are responsible for restoring cGMP levels, are activated at low Ca2+ concentrations by calmodulin-like proteins (7Duda T.R.G. Surgucheva I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Gorczyca W.A. Palczewski K. Sitaramaya A. Baehr W. Sharma R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8478-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the activity of rhodopsin kinase is inhibited by another Ca2+-binding protein, recoverin, at high concentrations of Ca2+ (8Kawamura S.

Several reports over the past decade have implicated a role for protein kinase C in photoreceptor function; its presence in rod outer segments (10Kapoor C.L. Chader G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1990; 193: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have been described. Protein kinase C is activated by the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol through binding of this ligand to a membrane-targeting domain (C1) that also binds phorbol esters (18Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). Some isozymes of protein kinase C are sensitive to Ca2+, which binds to a separate membrane-targeting domain (C2) and thus also increases the enzyme's affinity for membranes (18Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Generation of diacylglycerol, the key activator of protein kinase C, has been reported to be stimulated by light in photoreceptors (20Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Ghalayini A. Anderson R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Samuelson D. Cohen R.J. Shichi H. Cell Struct. Funct. 1987; 12: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), consistent with a potential role for this kinase in phototransduction. Evidence that the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C is physiologically relevant comes from the finding that hyperactivation of protein kinase C in intact retinas, by treatment with phorbol esters, alters the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin (24Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies reveal remarkable similarities between the enzymology of phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C and the phosphorylation of other G protein-coupled receptors by second messenger kinases (26Newton A.C. Williams D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 275-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most notably, phosphorylation is independent of the activation state of the receptor (13Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4749-4757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and results in decreased coupling of the receptor to G protein (13Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4749-4757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the in situ and in vitro data are consistent with direct modulation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C. Nonetheless, the extent of involvement of protein kinase C in rhodopsin phosphorylation in vivo remains to be established. In the present study, specific inhibition of protein kinase C by calphostin C was used to determine the contribution of protein kinase C in the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact frog retinas. We found that this kinase contributes to approximately 50% of the phosphorylation of rhodopsin. Furthermore, using phorbol esters to hyperactivate the kinase, we show that the kinetics of rhodopsin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation differ markedly, depending on whether protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase activities dominate.

Freshly dissected retinas from dark-adapted (12-14 h) frogs were incubated individually in 1 ml of amphibian culture medium (ACM; 65 mM NaCl, 35 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 μg·ml-1 phenol red, 1 mg·ml-1 casamino acids, 10 mMβ-D-glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 20-100 μCi·ml-1 carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate and gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at room temperature (21-23°C). After 30-120 min, 100 μl of ACM containing an 11-fold concentrate of PMA or calphostin C was added to gently agitated tubes to yield final concentrations of 1-1000 nM PMA and 1 μM calphostin C. An appropriate concentration (0.1%) of Me2SO (solvent for PMA and calphostin C) was added to control tubes. One retina from each frog served as the experimental and the other as the control. After a 15-120-min incubation with Me2SO or pharmacophore, retinas were exposed to one of three light regimes by flash or continuous illumination. A Vivitar flash unit (model 285) was used to provide a single flash of one of two intensities. For the lower intensity, the flash unit was set at 1/16 maximal intensity and filtered by 20 layers of lens tissue, which act as a neutral density filter, with measured attenuation of 1.2 log units. The higher intensity was effected by an unfiltered flash from the unit at 1/2 maximal intensity. For a third condition of light exposure, retinas were illuminated by 500-lux cool fluorescent lighting for 1-30 min. Some samples were not exposed to light. After the flashes, retinas were incubated under dim red light for 1-60 min. Retinas were gently agitated (approximately 40 rpm) during incubations. All procedures were carried out under dim red light (15-W bulb, No. 1A Safelight Filter, Eastman Kodak Co.) unless otherwise stated. Rhodopsin phosphorylation from retinas was analyzed by one of two methods. In one, 300 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 80 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 20 mM EDTA, 20 mM EGTA was added to each sample, retinas were vortexed for 10 s to break off rod outer segments, and tubes were placed on ice for 2 min to allow retinas to settle. Aliquots (1 ml) of the rod outer segment-enriched supernatant were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 s. The sedimented rod outer segments were quickly resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 110 mM NaCl, 5 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and centrifuged again, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 1% SDS. To reduce viscosity, samples were frozen at -80°C, thawed, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots of the supernatant (10-20 μl) were mixed with a 5-fold concentrate of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250; protein in each lane was quantified by densitometric analysis on a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer, and 32P incorporation into rhodopsin was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) or scintillation counting of excised rhodopsin bands. This method yielded good quality rod outer segments with clean separation of rhodopsin from other proteins, but there was concern that phosphorylation reactions were not quenched instantly. In the other method, 100% trichloroacetic acid (125 μl) was added to retinas in ACM. The tubes were vortexed for 3 s and then placed on ice for 5 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 × g The retinal pellets were resuspended by sonication (for 10 s with a Branson Probe Sonifer-250, power setting on 2) in 500 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, and 20 mM sodium phosphate and then centrifuged again for 20 min at 23,000 × g, 2°C. Pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS (200 μl) and sonicated again, and after a second centrifugation (20 min, 23,000 × g, 22°C), two aliquots (40 μl) of the supernatant were mixed with 10 μl of a 5-fold concentrate of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. One sample was kept at room temperature while the other was heated for 15 min at 100°C to oligomerize rhodopsin molecules (this treatment resulted in quantitative disappearance of monomeric rhodopsin on SDS-PAGE and served as the background for calculation of 32P incorporation into rhodopsin). Both methods yielded qualitatively similar results. Frog retinas in ACM (without [32P]orthophosphate) were subjected to various flash intensities or continuous light under the same conditions used in the in situ experiments above. After illumination, rod outer segment-enriched supernatants were prepared as in the first method above, except that 20 mM hydroxylamine was included in the vortexing mixture. Rod outer segments were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (29Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and washed twice by centrifugation at 300,000 × g, 10 min, 2°C, in buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 110 mM NaCl. Final pellets were solubilized in 80 μl of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% octylglucoside and incubated for 15 min on ice, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 min, 2°C. The A278/A498 absorbance ratios of supernatants were measured before and after complete bleaching (5,000 lux, 2 min) of rhodopsin in the presence of 20 mM hydroxylamine. Fig. 1 shows the amount of bleached rhodopsin in intact frog retinas calculated by this method as a function of flash intensity. Arrows indicate the two intensities used in the in situ phosphorylation experiments; setting the flash at 1/16 maximal power and using a 1.2-log unit neutral density filter bleached 6 ± 3% of the rhodopsin (arrow a), and an unfiltered flash set at 1/2 maximal intensity bleached 80 ± 6% of the rhodopsin (arrow b). Ten minutes of 500-lux continuous illumination bleached 97 ± 1% of the rhodopsin (not shown). Octylglucoside-solubilized rhodopsin from purified dark-adapted frog rod outer segments was illuminated under the same light regimes as intact retinas, and the amount of bleaching, as a function of light intensity, was determined as described above. Similar levels of bleaching resulted from illumination of intact retinas or solubilized rhodopsin from purified rod outer segments. Activity of protein kinase C (0.6-3 nM) was measured in the presence of histone IIIS (200 μg·ml-1) or protein kinase C-selective peptide (Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2, 50 μg·ml-1) in 20 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5 at 30°C) containing 50-200 μM [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 Ci·mmol-1), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg·ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 1 mM DTT, lipid/detergent mixed micelles with 0.1% Triton X-100, 12.5 mol % phosphatidylserine (180 μM), 1.6 mol % diacylglycerol (24 μM), and either 100 μM CaCl2 or 1 mM EGTA for 5-8 min at 30°C. Reactions were quenched and analyzed as described (28Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes were prepared from 30 frog retinas, as described (30Yamanaka G. Eckstein F. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and stored in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4°C, 120 mM NaCl, 30 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol at -20°C. The concentration of rhodopsin was 30-50 μM as assessed by its absorbance at 498 nm in 1% octylglucoside using an extinction coefficient of 40,600 M-1·cm-1 (31Wald G. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C was determined as described above except that substrate was replaced with 0.5 μM rhodopsin in urea-stripped membranes and Triton X-100/lipid mixed micelles were omitted. In some experiments, 20-100 nM PMA was present. For calphostin inhibition studies, 0-1 μM of this inhibitor was included in phosphorylation mixtures that also contained 20 nM PMA to ensure full activation of protein kinase C. Phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase was performed under similar conditions, except that protein kinase C was replaced with rhodopsin kinase and assays did not include PMA (PMA does not affect rhodopsin phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase in vitro (14Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Reactions were quenched by the addition of 5 μl of a 5-fold concentrate of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). 32P incorporation into rhodopsin was assessed as described above for in situ experiments. Protein kinase C from rod outer segments was isolated following the procedure of Udovichenko et al. (32Udovichenko I.P. Cunnick J. Gonzalez K. Yakhnin A. Takemoto D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, rod outer segments from 20 frogs were collected under dim red light, purified by two sequential sucrose gradients (29Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and lysed in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, at 4°C, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 μg·ml-1 leupeptin, 1 μg·ml-1 aprotinin, 1 μg·ml-1 pepstatin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg·ml-1 sodium L-ascorbate. Membranes were washed three times by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 10 min in this buffer. Membranes were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4°C, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 μg·ml-1 leupeptin, 1 μg·ml-1 aprotinin, 1 μg·ml-1 pepstatin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) to extract protein kinase C, and sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant, containing protein kinase C, was applied to a 50-μl DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with buffer A, and the column was washed with 2 ml of buffer A. Protein kinase C was eluted with a step gradient (50-μl steps in a 1-ml total volume) of 0-500 mM NaCl in buffer A, in 25 mM NaCl increments. Fractions (50 μl) were collected and assayed for protein kinase C activity. Concentrations of free Ca2+ were calculated using a computer program kindly provided by Dr. Claude Klee that takes into account pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, EGTA, EDTA, and ATP concentrations (33Jean T. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16414-16420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we showed that PMA alters the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact rat retinas (24Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the effect of protein kinase C activation on rhodopsin phosphorylation, we undertook a systematic study of the time-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin after different illumination conditions. For these studies, we chose frog retinas because they have been well characterized in short term culture. They are more stable in culture medium than mammalian retinas, so that they are more suited to the present experiments, which require longer incubation periods than those of our previous studies (24Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step, we characterized the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin initiated by three light treatments (Fig. 1): exposure to a filtered flash of light resulting in photoexcitation of approximately 6% of rhodopsin, exposure to a flash of light resulting in photoexcitation of approximately 80% of rhodopsin, and exposure to continuous room lighting (approximately 500 lux) resulting in photoexcitation of approximately 97% of rhodopsin. Fig. 2 shows the time-dependent increase in rhodopsin phosphorylation after treatment of intact frog retinas with these light regimes; these data are compiled from 35 separate experiments. All lighting conditions resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of rhodopsin, with a half-time of approximately 2 min. Relative to the phosphorylation resulting from photoexcitation of 97% of the rhodopsin, approximately 12 and 50% of the rhodopsin was phosphorylated following the two different flash intensities, which photoexcited 6 and 80% of the rhodopsin, respectively. Thus, conditions were established where the kinetics and extent of phosphorylation of control retinas, in the absence of any stimulation other than light, were characterized. We next studied how hyperactivation of protein kinase C, resulting from PMA treatment of retinas, altered the kinetics of rhodopsin phosphorylation. The data in Fig. 3 show the effect of PMA treatment on rhodopsin phosphorylation relative to that of untreated retinas (for these experiments, one retina from each frog was treated with PMA and the other with Me2SO, the solvent for PMA). For all illumination conditions, the effects of phorbol esters were biphasic. In general, PMA first caused an increase in rhodopsin phosphorylation relative to controls; this increase was greatest at about 10-15 min after the onset of illumination. After this time, the relative difference in rhodopsin phosphorylation level between PMA-treated retinas and control retinas decreased, so that by approximately 30 min after the onset of illumination there was little difference. What was unique to each illumination condition was the magnitude of the phorbol ester effect. In response to the flash photoexciting 6% of the rhodopsin, PMA caused an approximately 20% increase in rhodopsin phosphorylation that was sustained for 20 min (Fig. 3, B and E). This increase was followed by a marked decrease in the relative level of rhodopsin phosphorylation in PMA-treated retinas, such that by 60 min, it was 50% less relative to controls. In retinas exposed to the flash of light resulting in 80% photoexcitation of rhodopsin, PMA treatment resulted in 80% greater rhodopsin phosphorylation by 15 min, although the initial phosphorylation level in PMA-treated retinas was actually less (Fig. 3, C and F). As with the lower flash intensity, rhodopsin phosphorylation in PMA-treated retinas became progressively less relative to control with incubation times exceeding 15 min, except that at the higher flash intensity, the amount of phosphorylated rhodopsin in PMA-treated retinas did not drop below that in control retinas. In retinas exposed to continuous illumination, the same biphasic trend was evident, with the greatest increase in rhodopsin phosphorylation due to PMA occurring after 15 min (Fig. 3, D and G). No effect of PMA was detected in the absence of illumination (Fig. 3A). To test whether the PMA-induced effect resulted from direct stimulation of protein kinase C, we determined the effect of the biologically inactive enantiomer 4-α-PMA on rhodopsin phosphorylation in situ Although 4-α-PMA caused a slight increase in rhodopsin phosphorylation, PMA caused at least a 2-fold increase above this level, with a half-maximal effect at 2 nM (data not shown). Thus, the major effect of PMA is stereospecific and does not arise from perturbation of rod outer segment membranes or nonspecific interactions with rod outer segment components. As an alternative approach to studying the effect of protein kinase C on rhodopsin phosphorylation, we investigated the effect of a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, on rhodopsin phosphorylation. Calphostin C binds the phorbol ester-binding (C1) domain of protein kinase C (34Rotenberg S.A. Huang M.H. Zhu J. Su L. Riedel H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 12: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and at concentrations up to 1 μM has no significant effect on other kinases (35Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that calphostin C specifically inhibits the protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of rhodopsin in vitro (filled circles), with no detectable inhibition of the rhodopsin kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of rhodopsin (open circles). Protein kinase C was half-maximally inhibited by 400 nM calphostin C, with 1 μM causing approximately 70% inhibition. Note that this inhibition occurred in the presence of 20 nM PM"

Replacement of Asp-128 by Ala, Asn, and Ser resulted in a small decrease in Vmax and a significant increase in Km values for both substrates. These mutants exhibited similar pH activity profiles as that of the wild type enzyme.

A fluorescent analog of ATP, 2ʹ(3ʹ)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ATP (mant-ATP) served as a substrate with Km = 0.64 μM, and Vmax = 25 milliunits/mg and was a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. When mant-ATP bound to the enzyme, fluorescence intensity at 440 nm increased. mant-ATP binding of the wild type and the mutant enzymes were compared using the fluorometric method. The Kd values of the T52A and D128N enzymes were infinitely high and could not be measured, while those of the other mutant enzymes increased slightly. These results provide evidence that those amino acids are involved in substrate binding, and they are consistent with the crystallographic data. The results also suggest that Asp-128 does not serve as a nucleophile in catalysis, and since there are no other potential nucleophiles in the active site, we hypothesize that the Fru 6-P,2-kinase reaction is mediated via a transition state stabilization mechanism.

The probe predominately labeled Glu-355, a highly conserved residue among hexosaminidases. To determine if Glu-355 has a role in catalysis, β-subunit mutants were prepared with the Glu-355 codon altered to either Ala, Gln, Asp, or Trp. After expression of mutant proteins using recombinant baculovirus, the enzyme activity associated with the β-subunits was found to be reduced to background levels. Although catalytic activity was lost, the mutations did not otherwise affect the folding or assembly of the subunits. The mutant β-subunits could be isolated using substrate affinity chromatography, indicating they contained intact substrate binding sites. As shown by cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate, the mutant β-subunits were properly assembled. They could also participate in the formation of functional β-hexosaminidase A activity as indicated by activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degradation activity produced by co-expression of the mutant β-subunits with the α-subunit.

The human lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52) are composed of two structurally related subunits, α and β (for reviews see 1Sandhoff K. Conzelmann E. Neufeld E.F. Kaback M.M. Suzuki K.

After synthesis, the precursor subunits dimerize and form three isozymes: β-hexosaminidase A (αβ), β-hexosaminidase B (ββ), and β-hexosaminidase S (αα). Proper folding and assembly of the subunits is required for expression of catalytic activity and for transport of the enzymes out of the endoplasmic reticulum (3Proia R.L. Neufeld E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6360-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Proia R.L. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3350-3354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After reaching their final destination within lysosomes, the precursor polypeptides undergo proteolytic processing to a mature lysosomal form. The β-hexosaminidases degrade glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans through the release of terminal β-glycosidically linked N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. Each subunit possesses an active site within the context of the dimeric structure of the holoenzyme. The α and β active sites, although functionally very similar, exhibit differences in their ability to hydrolyze sulfated substrates (5Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Significant substrate specificity differences also exist between the isozymes.

The GM2 activator protein functions through binding the ganglioside substrate and interacting with β-hexosaminidase A. The release of the terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue from the ganglioside is accomplished via the α-chain active site (5Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Mutations in the HEXA (α-subunit) and HEXB (β-subunit) genes cause Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, respectively. Defects in the GM2A gene result in GM2 activator deficiency. In each of these genetic disorders there is a massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and related glycolipids in neuronal lysosomes, leading to severe neurodegeneration. In addition to GM2 ganglioside and related glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans are also critical substrates as demonstrated by the severe mucopolysaccharidoses phenotype exhibited in mice lacking both subunits of hexosaminidase (10Sango K.

Although much progress has been made in understanding the genetics and biochemistry of the hexosaminidases, details concerning the structures of the active sites and mechanisms of catalysis have only recently emerged. The first biochemical evidence localizing an active site was presented in a study by Liessem et al. (11Liessem B. Glombitza G.J. Knoll F. Lehmann J. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

This probe was shown to label Glu-355 of the human β-subunit, implicating this amino acid in the architecture of the active site. To determine if Glu-355 has a role in β-hexosaminidase B-mediated catalysis, we altered this residue by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant β-subunits lost catalytic activity but retained their ability to bind a substrate analogue, form homo- and heterodimers, function in the context of β-hexosaminidase A in activator-dependent GM2 degradation, and undergo intracellular transport to lysosomes. These results, together with affinity labeling of Glu-355 and the recently described structure of an evolutionarily related chitobiase (12Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), provide compelling evidence that Glu-355 has an essential role in the catalytic mechanism of human β-hexosaminidase B. The mutations were made with the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system from Amersham Corp. (RPN 1526) using the human β-subunit cDNA that had been cloned into M13mp18 (13Sonderfeld-Fresko S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant oligonucleotides (antisense) were as follows: E355A, CCCAACATTTAAATTCCACTGCATCTCCTCCCAAATG; E355Q, CCCAACATTTAAATTCCACTTGATCTCCTCCCAAATG; E355D, CCCAACATTTAAATTCCACATCATCTCCTCCCAAATG; E355W, CCCAACATTTAAATTCCACTGCATCTCCTCCCAAATG. The resultant mutant cDNAs were cloned into the XbaI and SacI sites of the pSVL vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for expression in COS-1 cells. For the production of baculovirus, the mutant cDNAs were excised from the pSVL vector and subcloned into the XbaI/SmaI sites of the baculovirus shuttle vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen). All mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Clonal recombinant baculovirus containing each of the mutant cDNAs was produced as described except that the virus producing the mutant cDNAs was identified by production of immunoreactive β-subunits rather than by enzymatic activity (9Pennybacker M. Liessem B. Moczall H. Tifft C.J. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17377-17382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus containing wild-type β-subunit was described previously (14Boose J.A. Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Myerowitz R. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Production of expression media by infection of insect cells (High Five and SF21) and co-expression of the mutant β-subunit cDNAs with the α-subunit was accomplished as described by Pennybacker et al. (9Pennybacker M. Liessem B. Moczall H. Tifft C.J. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17377-17382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with mutant cDNAs in the pSVL vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [35S]Methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation have been described (13Sonderfeld-Fresko S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined with MU-GlcNAc and MU-GlcNAc-6-SO4 as described previously (9Pennybacker M. Liessem B. Moczall H. Tifft C.J. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17377-17382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured according to the method of Bradford (15Bradford H.F. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215535) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. [3H]GM2 ganglioside, labeled in the GalNAc moiety, was used to determine GM2 degrading activity in the presence of recombinant GM2 activator protein (9Pennybacker M. Liessem B. Moczall H. Tifft C.J. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17377-17382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The affinity gel was prepared as described by Izumi and Suzuki (16Izumi T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6991-6999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 2-acetamido-N-(ϵ-aminocaproyl)-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopranosylamine as an affinity ligand. Small columns were prepared with a 1-ml bed volume and were equilibrated in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 200 mM NaCl. Samples (0.5 ml) of dialyzed and concentrated expression medium were loaded on the affinity columns. Nonspecifically bound protein was removed with 2.5 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 mM NaCl. Specifically bound proteins were eluted with 2 ml of 150 μMδ-lactone in equilibration buffer. Proteins were analyzed by 10% Tricine polyacrylamide gels as described by Schägger and von Jagow (17Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar). In the case of E355D, wash-through and eluate were concentrated approximately 5-fold before electrophoresis. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining as described by Blum et al. (18Blum H. Beur H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 6: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3738) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, equal volumes of eluate were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C and then incubated with goat anti-hexosaminidase B for 1.5 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with Tris buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 340 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.4). After 1 h of incubation with rabbit anti-goat IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase followed by washing in Tris buffer, the membrane was developed using 0.7 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.2 mM nitro blue tetrazolium in carbonate buffer (100 mM carbonate, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% NaN3, pH 9.8). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, 10 mM) was freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. β-Subunit preparations (30 ng in 75 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) were incubated in the presence of 0.78 mM DSS at 37°C for 30 min. Control samples contained an equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide without the cross-linker. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to 27 mM. The samples were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After probing the membrane with anti-hexosaminidase B, detection was accomplished with the Vistra ECF Western blotting kit (Amersham). Probed membranes were scanned with the Storm 860 Fluorimager from Molecular Dynamics. The codon specifying Glu-355 in the β-hexosaminidase β-subunit cDNA was altered to produce cDNAs with the following changes: E355A, E355W, E355Q, and E355D. The cDNAs were recombined into baculovirus for expression in insect cells. We previously showed that precursor enzyme can be recovered from the expression medium for analysis in a number of biochemical assays (9Pennybacker M. Liessem B. Moczall H. Tifft C.J. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17377-17382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression medium from cells infected with each recombinant virus was assayed for enzymatic activity with the synthetic substrate, MU-GlcNAc, and for β-subunit protein by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Abundant β-hexosaminidase activity was detected in medium from insect cells infected with virus expressing the unaltered β-subunit (Glu-355). In contrast, expression media containing the Glu-355 mutant β-subunits resulting from infection with baculovirus carrying any of the mutant cDNAs (E355A, E355Q, E355W, E355D) displayed very low levels of activity (≤3%) relative to wild-type β-hexosaminidase B after normalization to the amount of β-subunit protein present. The expression media were passed through miniaffinity columns containing the ligand, 2-acetamido-N-(ϵ-aminocaproyl)-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopranosylamine (Fig. 2). This is the classical affinity ligand used for purification of β-hexosaminidase via its substrate binding site (16Izumi T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6991-6999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Geiger B. Arnon R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the columns, elution was carried out with the high affinity competitive inhibitor, δ-lactone, a transition state analogue with a submicromolar Ki. If the mutant subunits retained their substrate binding sites, they should bind to the columns and then be eluted specifically with δ-lactone. The wash-through fraction obtained from each expression medium showed a complex mixture of protein species after electrophoresis on SDS-gels and visualization by silver staining. As expected, a Mr 63,000 polypeptide, the precursor size of the β-subunit (20Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was specifically eluted from the affinity column that had been loaded with expression medium containing β-hexosaminidase B (Glu-355 (E355), Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with the expression media obtained by infection with virus carrying the mutant β-subunit cDNAs even though only minimal enzyme activity had been found. In each case the Mr 63,000 polypeptide was proven to be the hexosaminidase β-subunit by virtue of its reactivity with antiserum prepared against β-hexosaminidase B (Fig. 2B). No comparable peptide was found in the medium from cells infected with wild-type virus (control). The affinity-purified preparations were used for determination of kinetic parameters with the synthetic substrate, MU-GlcNAc (Table I). The recombinant hexosaminidase B displayed a Vmax and Km similar to the purified placental enzymes. A low level of activity was detected in the preparation derived from the wild-type virus infection (control). This background activity likely represents a previously described insect cell activity released during viral infection (21Licari P.J. Jarvis D.L. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Prog. 1993; 9: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that apparently binds to the affinity column. The Vmax values of each of the affinity-purified mutant preparations were reduced to near the background level of the control virus preparation. The Km values were also close to that of the background insect cell enzyme and may be the result of interference by this endogenous activity.Table I.Km and Vmax values of recombinant β-hexosaminidase β-subunit preparations purified by substrate affinity chromatographyEnzymeKmaDeterminations were carried out in duplicate; deviation did not exceed 5%.

Open table in a new tab The mutant subunits were tested to ensure their structural and functional integrity in light of their catalytic deficiency. First, mutant β-subunit preparations were cross-linked with DSS to determine if they had assembled, a state required for enzymatic activity to be expressed (4Proia R.L. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3350-3354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, the catalytically impaired mutant proteins were indistinguishable from catalytically active β-hexosaminidase B (Glu-355) in their capacity to be cross-linked by DSS. Next, we tested whether the catalytically deficient mutant β-subunits could function in the context of the heterodimer β-hexosaminidase A in activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degradation. The α-subunit was co-expressed with each β-subunit to produce heterodimers. The resulting expression media were assayed for the capacity to hydrolyze labeled GM2 ganglioside in the presence of activator protein. All mutant β-chains, in concert with the α-subunit, were competent in their capacity to degrade the ganglioside (Fig. 4). The GM2 ganglioside-degrading activities of the expression media containing the mutant heterodimers ranged from 77 to 120% of the activity of co-expressed wild-type α- and β-subunits (Fig. 4). Finally, the mutant subunits were expressed in COS-1 cells to determine their intracellular fate (Fig. 5). After transfection, the mutant constructs did not produce enzyme activity above background levels (not shown). However, the mutant constructs did direct the production of Mr 63,000 β-subunit precursors (Fig. 5, Pulse) that were converted to the mature, lysosomal forms (βa-chain, Mr 29,000 and βb-chains, Mr 24,000) upon chase in a manner indistinguishable from the unaltered β-subunit (Glu-355) (Fig. 5, Chase) (13Sonderfeld-Fresko S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using [3H]ATB-GalNAc as a photoaffinity label for the substrate binding site of β-hexosaminidase B, Liessem et al. (11Liessem B. Glombitza G.J. Knoll F. Lehmann J. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23693-23699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed a specific incorporation into Glu-355 of the β-subunit. This result, the strongest biochemical evidence to date in the identification of an active site, focused our attention on this evolutionarily conserved amino acid. We have now extended these studies by analyzing mutant β-subunits with Glu-355 converted into four other amino acids, Ala, Asp, Trp, and Gln. Each of the mutant proteins showed an abrogation of enzymatic activity to near background levels. Despite the catalytic deficit, other functions and properties associated with the β-subunit were normal, indicating that the mutations did not adversely affect the folding and quaternary structure of the protein. The mutant β-chains underwent normal proteolytic maturation in COS-1 cells indicative of lysosomal delivery. The capacity to pass through the endoplasmic reticulum “quality control” system is evidence for the correct folding and assembly of subunits (22Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Mutations in hexosaminidase subunits impairing their folding and assembly leads to premature degradation before lysosome delivery (2Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). We also directly demonstrated that the subunits were in an assembled state. The mutant β-subunits were indistinguishable from wild-type β-subunits in their capacity to be chemically cross-linked. Activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degradation, a functional assay for heterodimer formation with the α-subunit, was also found to be unimpaired. Since ganglioside degradation is mediated through the α-subunit active site, it would be expected that a defective β active site should not affect hydrolysis. However, the presence of the β-subunit is essential for ganglioside hydrolysis, perhaps by contributing to the interaction with the activator-ganglioside complex. It is clear that the presence of the Glu-355 mutations did not impair these essential functions. We found that the mutant proteins could be isolated using a substrate affinity column. This result indicates that the substrate binding site on the mutant proteins is sufficiently intact for interaction with the low affinity ligand, 2-acetamido-N-(ϵ-aminocaproyl)-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopranosylamine (Ki∼0.5 mM). Mutant proteins that were affinity-isolated through their substrate binding site were catalytically impaired. The presence of substrate binding in association with a large decrease in enzymatic activity is, in itself, strong evidence for the involvement of Glu-355 in the catalytic mechanism of β-hexosaminidase B. Due to the high degree of sequence similarity between the α- and β-subunits and the functional similarities of their active sites, it is expected that α-subunit Glu-323, the counterpart of β-subunit Glu-355, would also be involved in catalysis mediated by the α-subunit. Mutagenesis of α-subunit Glu-323 also impairs catalytic activity (not shown). Recently, the crystal structure of Serratia marcescens chitobiase, a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family that also includes the human β-hexosaminidases, was determined (12Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Based on the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex, an acid-base substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism was proposed in which Glu-540 of the chitobiase functions as the catalytic acid while the polar acetamido group of the sugar substrate serves as a nucleophile in the reaction. Homology modeling of the catalytic domains of the human enzymes suggests that they adhere to the same catalytic mechanism as proposed for chitobiase (12Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Significantly, sequence alignments show that Glu-540, the proposed proton donor in chitobiase, coincides with Glu-323 of human α-subunit, the equivalent of Glu-355 in the human β-subunit. Our results, in combination with the structure of the related chitobiase, would indicate that Glu-355 serves as the proton donor during the catalytic action of β-hexosaminidase B. Previously, two other amino acids, Arg-211 and Asp-196, were suggested to be involved in the β-hexosaminidase B catalytic mechanism (23Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Tse R. Vavougios G. Hou Y. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7599-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, current evidence does not support a direct role for either of these amino acids in this process. The structure of chitobiase indicates that the counterpart of Arg-211 is involved in substrate binding and not in the catalytic mechanism (12Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Asp-196 was suggested to serve as the acid catalyst in β-hexosaminidase B (24Tse R. Vavougios G. Hou Y. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7599-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This seems very unlikely given the very strong evidence summarized here supporting Glu-355 for this role and because all proton donors in glycosidases analyzed thus far have been found to be glutamic acid (25Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.-P. Davis G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In conclusion, three independent lines of evidence provide compelling support for the involvement of Glu-355 in the catalytic mechanism mediated by β-hexosaminidase B. First, Glu-355 was uniquely labeled by an active-site affinity probe. Second, the structure of an evolutionarily related enzyme suggests that the counterpart of Glu-355 functions as the catalytic acid in an acid-base enzyme mechanism. Third, the data presented in this report show that mutant β-subunits with Glu-355 altered to any of four other amino acids display minimal β-hexosaminidase B activity even though other properties of the β-subunit, including formation of the substrate binding site, subunit assembly, activator-dependent GM2 degradation by β-hexosaminidase A, and intracellular transport, remain intact. After this manuscript was accepted for publication, Fernandes et al (26Fernandes M.J.G. Yew S. Leclerc D. Henrissat B. Vorgias C.E. Gravel R.A. Hechtman P. Kaplan F. J. Biol.

In previous studies, we solubilized this preparation with a detergent and mapped the relative positions of several transmembrane helices of the subunits by chemical cross-linking. To determine if these detected helix-helix proximities were representative of those existing in the bilayer prior to solubilization, we have now done similar studies on the membrane-bound preparation of the same digested enzyme.

One was a dimer of a 11-kDa α-fragment containing the H1-H2 helices and a 22-kDa α-fragment containing the H7-H10 helices. This dimer seemed to be the same as that obtained in the solubilized preparation. The other product was a trimer of the above two α-fragments and that fraction of β whose extracellular domain was cleaved at Arg142-Gly143.

INTRODUCTIONThe coupled active transport of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane of most eucaryotic cells is carried out by Na+/K+-ATPase. The enzyme consists of two subunits, α and β, both of which are essential to normal function (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). That some transmembrane domains of the subunits must be involved in cation transport is self-evident, and specific roles of several such domains of the α-subunit in ion binding and transport have been explored (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Moorman J. Stein W.D. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is one transmembrane domain in the β-subunit, and the 10-span model of α is favored by most evidence (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar).To define the roles of the intramembrane domains in ion binding and transport, it is clearly necessary to go beyond two-dimensional schemes of folding and obtain information about the three-dimensional packing of the transmembrane domains of Na+/K+-ATPase. There is a paucity of such information, however, because it has been difficult to apply high resolution structural methods to hydrophobic helix-bundle proteins such as Na+/K+-ATPase. Molecular modeling studies have been helpful (7Efremov R.G. Gulyaev D.I. Modyanov N.N. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Modyanov N. Lutsenko S.

Limited experimental data on the helix packing of Na+/K+-ATPase have resulted from our recent chemical cross-linking studies on enzyme preparations that were subjected to controlled proteolysis and solubilized in a detergent (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings suggested contact between the intramembrane H1,H2 helix pair and H8-H10 intramembrane helices of α, and between these N-terminal and C-terminal helices of α and the single intramembrane helix of β (10Sarvazyan N.A.

The use of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins in chemical cross-linking studies is both necessary and problematic. On the one hand, solubilized preparations must be used to rule out the possibility of cross-linking due to random collisions of proteins and peptides that are highly concentrated within the membrane phase (11Peters K. Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 12Askari A. J. Bioenerg.

On the other hand, once the existence of a stable noncovalent complex is established by the formation of a cross-linked product in a solubilized preparation, it is necessary to ensure that the detected protein-protein interaction is not entirely an artifact of solubilization (11Peters K. Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present experiments was to determine if the helix-helix proximities that we had detected in solubilized preparations (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol.

Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was exposed to trypsin (Sigma, Type III-S, bovine pancreas) in the presence of Rb+ and EDTA at pH 8.5 (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol.

This preparation is often called the “19-kDa membranes” because its cation occlusion capacity was originally thought to be due to a C-terminal fragment of α with the apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa (15Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is now evident, however, that several, if not all, peptides of this preparation are involved in its functions (5Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The capacity of this digested preparation to occlude Rb+ was verified before use by previously described procedures (15Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For cross-linking, the digested enzyme was suspended (2 mg/ml) in a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 mM CuSO4, and 1.25 mM o-phenanthroline, and incubated at 24°C for 15 min. These conditions were chosen after preliminary experiments using the approach described previously (13Periyasamy S.M. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 30 mM, followed by SDS to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on Tricine 1The abbreviation used is: TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine./SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, sulfhydryl reagents were omitted from the buffers used for electrophoresis to preserve the cross-linked products. The stained peptide bands were quantified by a scanning densitometer (Bio-Rad). N-terminal analyses of the peptide bands were done as described previously (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).RESULTSOur previous conclusions regarding the intramembrane helix-helix interactions of Na+/K+-ATPase were based on the identification of cross-linked products obtained from enzyme preparations that were cleaved proteolytically, solubilized in digitonin, and oxidized in the presence of Cu2+ (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The present experiments were initiated with the specific aims of determining (a) if the same or similar cross-linked products could be obtained in membrane-bound preparations that were not detergent-solubilized prior to cross-linking, and (b) if the functional specificities of the protein-protein interactions could be established by the sensitivities of the cross-linking reactions to ligands specific to Na+/K+-ATPase. Based on promising results of preliminary experiments, we focused attention on the cross-linking reactions of the membrane moiety of the trypsin-digested enzyme in the presence of Cu2+-phenanthroline complex.The trypsin-digested preparation used here consists of four well characterized fragments of the α-subunit (10Sarvazyan N.A.

The most prominent, and the most consistently observed, cross-linked products were the two designated as bands a and b in Fig. 2. These bands were excised from gels such as those of lane 2 of Fig. 2, electroeluted, and subjected to N-terminal analysis. Also analyzed as controls were the materials eluted from the positions corresponding to those of bands a and b from the gels on which the uncross-linked samples were resolved (Fig. 2, lane 1). These analyses (Table I), in conjunction with the apparent molecular mass of band a, showed that band a was the cross-linked dimer of the 22-kDa C-terminal fragment of α containing the H7-H10 transmembrane helices (Fig. 1), and the 11-kDa N-terminal fragment of α containing the H1,H2 helix pair (Fig. 1).Table IN-terminal sequences of isolated cross-linked productsCross-linked productSequencePolypeptide chain regionYieldpmol11,2268Asp-Gly-Pro-Asn-Ala-Leu-Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro-Thr-α-Subunit, H1-H219.8831Asn-Pro-Lys-Thr-Asp-Lys-Leu-Val-Asn-Glu-Arg-α-Subunit, H7-H1018.911,22,β68Asp-Gly-Pro-Asn-Ala-Leu-Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro-Thr-α-Subunit, H1-H26.0831Asn-Pro-Lys-Thr-Asp-Lys-Leu-Val-Asn-Glu-Arg-α-Subunit, H7-H106.55Ala-Lys-Glu-Glu-Gly-Ser-Xaa-Lys-Lys-Phe-Ile-β-Subunit, N-terminal half6.2143Gly-Glu-Arg-Lys-Val-Xaa-Arg-Phe-Lys-Leu-Glu-β-Subunit, C-terminal half5.6 Open table in a new tab Four sequences shown in Table I were identified upon N-terminal sequencing of band b, indicating that this cross-linked product contains the following four peptides in equimolar stoichiometry: the 11-kDa N-terminal fragment of α, the 22-kDa C-terminal fragment of α, a fragment of β beginning at Ala5, and a fragment of β beginning at Gly143. That the trypsin-digested enzyme contains β beginning at Ala5, and that a fraction of this truncated β is also cleaved at Arg142-Gly143 has been demonstrated (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Capasso J.M. Hoving S.D. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish J.D. J. Biol.

Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4555-4564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the latter cleavage site (Fig. 1) is between Cys125 and Cys148, which are connected by a disulfide bridge (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and since the bridge is expected to remain intact under oxidative cross-linking reaction conditions, we conclude that band b is the cross-linked trimer of 11-kDa and 22-kDa fragments of α-subunit and a β-subunit that begins at Ala5, is cleaved at Arg142-Gly143, but is otherwise intact. Because we have not been able to detect β that is cross-linked either with the 11-kDa fragment alone or with the 22-kDa fragment alone, we suspect that formation of a disulfide bond between the two α-fragments stabilizes a conformation of the α-subunit helix-bundle, which is the mandatory first step to the subsequent direct contact of the Cys44 of β with an intramembrane cysteine of the two α-fragments.The above identifications of 11-kDa and 22-kDa fragments of α in the two most prominent cross-linked products are consistent with the reduced intensities of 11-kDa and 22-kDa bands after exposure to Cu2+-phenanthroline (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Closer examination of these gels shows, however, that other peptides also may have participated in cross-linking reactions. To date, we have been unable to characterize other discrete cross-linked products.The specificities of the cross-linking reactions were tested in experiments, a representative of which are shown in Fig. 2. Formations of the cross-linked products, and the disappearances of 11-kDa and 22-kDa α fragments were prevented by Na+ and K+ (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), but not by the same concentrations of choline and N-methylglucamine (data not shown). Incubation in the presence of ouabain and Mg2+ also prevented cross-linking (Fig. 1, lane 5), but Mg2+ alone was not effective (data not shown). When the protective effects of different concentrations of Na+ and K+ were quantitated, K0.5 values were in the range of 10-20 mM for Na+ and less than 0.5 mM for K+ (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The relative values of these constants are in general agreement with the relative K0.5 values for occlusions of Na+ and Rb+ by this digested preparation (15Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and clearly indicate the specificities of the cation effects on the cross-linking reactions. The concentration of ouabain for half-maximal protection of cross-linking was reduced when Mg2+ was present (Fig. 5), indicating that the well established interactive effects of ouabain and Mg2+ on the native enzyme (14Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) continue to exist within the peptide fragments of the digested enzyme.Fig. 3Protective effects of varying Na+ concentrations on the cross-linking reactions of the 22-kDa α-fragment of Na+/K+-ATPase.

Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or in the presence of Cu2+-phenanthroline as in experiments of Fig. 2, no Na+, K+, or ouabain effects on the cross-linking reactions of the solubilized preparation were noted (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe trypsin-digested preparation of the membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase used here (Fig. 1) has no ATPase activity, but retains the capacity to occlude Na+ and Rb+ and to carry out a slow Rb+/Rb+ exchange after reconstitution (15Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When this preparation is solubilized in digitonin and oxidatively cross-linked, a major product is a dimer of the 11-kDa N-terminal fragment of α and the 22-kDa C-terminal fragment of α (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We now show (Fig. 2 and Table I) that such a dimer is also a major cross-linked product of the membrane-bound version of this preparation. It has long been recognized that the demonstration of similar cross-linked complexes of proteins in native membranes and in solubilized preparations of the membranes is a good indication of the existence of specific protein associations within the native membranes (11Peters K. Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 13Periyasamy S.M. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present findings and our previous data (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), therefore, establish the proximities of the N-terminal and C-terminal helices of α in the functional membrane. Although the details of the contact domains remain to be mapped, as discussed previously (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the estimated locations of the sulfhydryl groups of these helices (Fig. 1) suggest that the most likely interacting helices are the H1,H10 pair and the H2,H8 pair.The other prominent cross-linked product of the membrane preparation identified here is a trimer of an essentially intact β and the above two fragments of α (Fig. 2 and Table I). This is also similar to such a trimer that we obtained previously from the detergent-solubilized preparation (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The two trimers, however, differ significantly in respect to the nature of β that participates in cross-linking. In the solubilized preparation the predominant reactant is the β that begins at Ala5, but is otherwise intact (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), while the predominant reactant in the membrane preparation is the same N-terminally truncated β that is also cleaved at Arg142-Gly143 between two half-cystines (Table I). Since under the conditions we have used to prepare the digested enzyme (i.e. at pH 8.5, the Arg142-Gly143 cleavage occurs in a small fraction of total β content (16Capasso J.M. Hoving S.D. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), we conclude that without this cleavage β does not cross-link with the α-fragments in the membrane-bound preparation. Evidently, some spatial flexibility of the β-subunit chain, induced either by cleavage between the half-cystine residues or by detergent solubilization, is required for close juxtaposition of the single transmembrane cysteine of β with one of the nearby transmembrane cysteines of α to allow the zero-length cross-linking of the two sulfhydryl groups. The five intramembrane sulfhydryl groups available for the formation of the two disulfides of the cross-linked trimer are Cys44 of β and cysteines 104, 138, 930, and 983 of α (Fig. 1).That the area of contact between the transmembrane helix of β and one or more transmembrane helices of α is altered significantly by a cleavage in the extracellular domain of β is pertinent to a number of studies that have provided considerable information on the effects of various structural modifications of the extracellular domains and the transmembrane domain of β on the assembly of the α,β-complex (20Fambrough D.M.

We suggest that, in the interpretation of these findings, the often neglected possibility should be considered that a structural change of an extramembrane domain of β may be transmitted to its transmembrane helix, and then to the interacting helices of α.A large number of studies on ligand-induced conformational transitions of Na+/K+-ATPase in relation to its function have been conducted over the years (25Robinson J.D. Pratap P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Few of these, however, have addressed such structural transitions of the transmembrane domains of the enzyme. Experiments on hydrophobic labeling, followed by proteolysis, have suggested the existence of different Na+- and K+-dependent conformations of the transmembrane domains (8Modyanov N. Lutsenko S. Chertova E. Efremov R. Gulyaev D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 26Farley R.A. Goldman D.W. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 860-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); a fluorescent label attached to a specific transmembrane domain of the α-subunit of the intact enzyme has been shown to respond differently to various ligand-induced states (27Taniguchi K. Mårdh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15588-15594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and structural changes of some transmembrane helices, either by chemical modification or by site-directed mutagenesis, have been shown to alter specific ligand interactions with the enzyme (2Goldshleger R.

To our knowledge, these and related previous studies, however, have not provided experimental evidence for ligand-induced interactions among the intramembrane domains. The sensitivities of the cross-linking reactions to Na+, K+, and ouabain demonstrated in the present studies (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) clearly indicate that the highly specific interactions of these ligands with the extensively digested enzyme regulate the three-dimensional packing of the transmembrane helices. Specifically, our data show that the conformational states induced by the indicated ligands affect the alignments of the residues of H1,H2 helix pair relative to those of the H8-H10 helices, and the proximities of these helices with the residues of one transmembrane helix of β. This does not exclude the involvement of other transmembrane domains in ligand-induced conformational changes of the helix-bundle. The use of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, other cross-linking reagents, and other functionally competent fragments of the enzyme may reveal additional ligand-sensitive transmembrane helix-helix interactions. Such studies are in progress. INTRODUCTIONThe coupled active transport of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane of most eucaryotic cells is carried out by Na+/K+-ATPase. The enzyme consists of two subunits, α and β, both of which are essential to normal function (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). That some transmembrane domains of the subunits must be involved in cation transport is self-evident, and specific roles of several such domains of the α-subunit in ion binding and transport have been explored (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Moorman J. Stein W.D. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There is one transmembrane domain in the β-subunit, and the 10-span model of α is favored by most evidence (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar).To define the roles of the intramembrane domains in ion binding and transport, it is clearly necessary to go beyond two-dimensional schemes of folding and obtain information about the three-dimensional packing of the transmembrane domains of Na+/K+-ATPase. There is a paucity of such information, however, because it has been difficult to apply high resolution structural methods to hydrophobic helix-bundle proteins such as Na+/K+-ATPase. Molecular modeling studies have been helpful (7Efremov R.G. Gulyaev D.I. Modyanov N.N. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Modyanov N. Lutsenko S.

Limited experimental data on the helix packing of Na+/K+-ATPase have resulted from our recent chemical cross-linking studies on enzyme preparations that were subjected to controlled proteolysis and solubilized in a detergent (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings suggested contact between the intramembrane H1,H2 helix pair and H8-H10 intramembrane helices of α, and between these N-terminal and C-terminal helices of α and the single intramembrane helix of β (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The use of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins in chemical cross-linking studies is both necessary and problematic. On the one hand, solubilized preparations must be used to rule out the possibility of cross-linking due to random collisions of proteins and peptides that are highly concentrated within the membrane phase (11Peters K. Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 12Askari A. J. Bioenerg.

On the other hand, once the existence of a stable noncovalent complex is established by the formation of a cross-linked product in a solubilized preparation, it is necessary to ensure that the detected protein-protein interaction is not entirely an artifact of solubilization (11Peters K. Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present experiments was to determine if the helix-helix proximities that we had detected in solubilized preparations (10Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONMany plant lectins, including concanavalin A (ConA) 1The abbreviations used are: ConAconcanavalin APHAphytohemagglutininWGAwheat germ agglutininT3triiodothyroninePTHparathyroid hormonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMeManmethylmannosideTGF-β1transforming growth factor β-1IGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor IALPasealkaline phosphatase. and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), with various sugar-binding properties induce blastoid transformation of lymphocytes and have been extensively applied in studies of proliferation and differentiation (1Lis H. Sharon N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 35-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which plant lectins activate lymphocytes is unknown because of the lack of lectin specificity. ConA and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) also have insulin-like activity in adipocytes (2Cuatrecasas P. Tell G.P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 3Czech M.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Lynn W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7499-7505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Katzen H.M. Vicario P.P. Mumford R.A. Green B.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5800-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our group has shown that in chondrocyte cultures, ConA, but not other lectins, stimulates the synthesis of cartilage-matrix proteoglycan (aggrecan) by chondrocytes, and that this effect is greater than that of growth factors and hormones (5Yan W. Nakashima K. Iwamoto M. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10125-10131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ConA induces cartilage in amphibian early gastrula ectoderm (6Makhailov A.T. Gorgolyuk N.A. Cell Diff. 1988; 22: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cell-surface glycoproteins with N-linked sugar chains specific for ConA play crucial roles in chondrocyte differentiation.In growth plates and bone fracture callus, chondrocytes undergo a sequence of cell changes including proliferation, cessation of cell division, matrix synthesis, maturation (hypertrophy), and calcification. The hypertrophic chondrocytes produce alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) (7Robison R. Biochem. J. 1923; 17: 286-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), type X collagen (8Schmid T.M. Conrad H.E. J. Biol.

Neither of these chondrocyte subtypes usually undergoes endochondral ossification. Cells from the resting zone undergo hypertrophy at slower rates than growth-plate chondrocytes when maintained at high density in the presence of 10% serum (9Iwamoto M. Sato K. Nakashima K. Shimazu A. Kato Y. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, articular chondrocytes rarely undergo hypertrophy even at high density in the presence of 10% serum (14Iwamoto M. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 461-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although they become hypertrophic in arthritic joints (15von der Mark K. Kirsch T. Medici A. Kumiss A. Weseloh G. Gluckert K. Stoss H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which hypertrophy is suppressed in permanent cartilages is not known. However, lectins may alter the differentiation program in permanent chondrocytes by cross-linking cell-surface glycoproteins, because some surface glycoproteins serve as growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix receptors, and modulators of signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of 11 lectins with different sugar-binding properties on the expression of maturation-related phenotypes by resting and articular chondrocytes. The results showed that among the tested lectins, ConA alone induces ALPase activity, type X collagen synthesis, vitamin D receptor synthesis, and matrix calcification in resting, but not in articular chondrocyte cultures.DISCUSSIONExposure to ConA markedly increased ALPase activity and the size of resting chondrocytes. ALPase synthesis was stimulated more by ConA than by hormones and growth factors that supposedly enhance ALPase synthesis by chondrocytes. The specificity of the ConA action on ALPase was indicated by the following observations. (i) ConA did not stimulate ALPase synthesis and hypertrophy in articular chondrocyte cultures. The marginal effect of ConA on ALPase activity in growth-plate chondrocyte cultures could have been due to contamination of the growth-plate cell population by resting chondrocytes. (ii) Lentil and garden pea lectins had little effect on ALPase activity, although their monosaccharide-binding properties (mannose/glucose) are similar to those of ConA. The crystal structure of pea lectin is also similar to that of ConA (34Einspahr H. Parks E.H. Suguna K. Subramanian E. Suddath F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16518-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the oligosaccharide-binding properties of lentil and garden pea lectins differ from those of ConA (1Lis H. Sharon N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 35-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). (iii) Of the lectins examined, only ConA stimulated chondrocyte hypertrophy and calcification. This is important, because many lectins with different sugar-binding properties activate lymphocytes. (iv) ALPase induction by ConA was suppressed by methylmannoside.Our findings indicated that ConA does not randomly activate gene expression by chondrocytes, but that it initiates the maturation program in resting chondrocytes. Exposing resting chondrocytes to ConA for 6-24 h suppressed cell division, then increased the proteoglycan content, the cell size, ALPase activity, the vitamin D receptor level, the incorporation of 45Ca into insoluble material, and the calcium content. These cell-matrix changes proceeded in the same order as that seen in growth plates and bone fracture callus in vivo The cell size as well as the ALPase and the vitamin D receptor levels in the ConA-exposed chondrocyte cultures were comparable to those in the growth plate in vivo (14Iwamoto M. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 461-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Chondrocytes in rib resting cartilage start to mature only near the growth plate in vivo, although cells far from the growth plate can also become hypertrophic when cultured at high density in the absence of a tissue culture surface (9Iwamoto M. Sato K. Nakashima K. Shimazu A. Kato Y. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Changes in cell-matrix interactions and/or growth factor levels may stimulate the maturation of resting chondrocytes in vivo We postulated that specific lectins induce the maturation of “permanent chondrocytes” in vitro by cross-linking or activating growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix receptors, and/or modulators of signal transduction, because some of the cell-surface proteins are uniquely glycosylated. The finding that ConA, but not other lectins, induces maturation of resting chondrocytes suggests that ConA-binding surface glycoprotein(s) plays a crucial role in switching from the immature, to the mature stage.Why only resting, but not articular, chondrocytes respond to ConA is unknown. Resting cartilage provides the reserved chondrocyte pool for the growth plate while remaining flexible, whereas articular cartilage supports high compressive loads in the body while remaining flexible. A fraction of resting chondrocytes may undergo hypertrophy even in normal cartilage, whereas articular chondrocytes do not undergo hypertrophy unless they become arthritic. The functional differences between these cartilages suggest that the factors regulating maturation in resting and articular cartilage should differ. In fact, PTH-related protein is involved in inhibiting hypertrophy in resting, but not articular cartilage in vivo (32Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewocz V. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), although BMP-2 and thyroid hormone induce hypertrophy in both resting and articular chondrocyte cultures.Although ConA and WGA activate insulin receptors in adipocytes (2Cuatrecasas P. Tell G.P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 3Czech M.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Lynn W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7499-7505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Katzen H.M. Vicario P.P. Mumford R.A. Green B.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5800-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), insulin induced only a very low level of ALPase activity in chondrocytes.2 Thus, the stimulation of ALPase is not mediated by the binding of ConA to insulin receptors. In addition, ConA did not down-regulate PTH, TGF-β1, and fibroblast growth factor receptors in chondrocytes.ConA enhanced the synthesis of 15-kDa cystatin-like protein by resting chondrocytes. Since ConA also enhanced this synthesis by articular chondrocytes,3 the cystatin-like protease inhibitor is unlikely to mediate the action of ConA on chondrocyte hypertrophy. Previous studies have shown that ConA stimulates and inhibits the synthesis of matrix-metalloproteinases and TIMP inhibitor, respectively, by fibroblasts (35Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that some ConA-binding surface glycoproteins are involved in the control of matrix breakdown in connective tissues.Interactions of chondrocytes with artificial substrate impair their phenotypic expression. Thus ConA may enhance proteoglycan and ALPase synthesis via inhibition of their spreading on tissue culture surface. We tested this notion by comparing the action of ConA with that of succinyl ConA. Tetravalent ConA induced extensive cross-linking of membrane glycoproteins, whereas the divalent ConA derivative did not. This accounted for the differences between the actions of ConA and succinyl ConA on lymphocytes (36Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunnungham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In this study, ConA, but not succinyl ConA, inhibited the spreading of chondrocytes, although these lectins exerted the same effects on ALPase activity, proteoglycan synthesis, and total protein synthesis. Thus, extensive cross-linking of cell-surface glycoproteins is required for the rapid cell-shape change, but not for chondrocyte differentiation.The tertiary structures of ConA and the ConA-sugar complex, as well as its sugar-binding site, have been characterized (37Derewenda Z. Carib J. Helliwell J.R. Halo (Gibbon) A.J. Godson E.J. Rapid M.Z. Wan T. Campbell J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, the oligosaccharide structure required for ConA binding has been determined (38Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a family of peptides that mimic the binding of MeMan to ConA have been identified from screening a hexapeptide epitope library (39Scott J.K. Loganathan D. Bailey R.B. Gong X. Goldstein I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This information will be useful for future studies on the action of ConA on animal cells.In conclusion, the present study showed that ConA selectively acts on resting chondrocytes to initiate the maturation program, and that the ConA stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation is not directly linked with lectin-induced changes in the cytoskeleton. Resting chondrocytes exposed to ConA may be useful as a novel model for studies on endochondral bone formation.

Shimazu A. Kato Y. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, articular chondrocytes rarely undergo hypertrophy even at high density in the presence of 10% serum (14Iwamoto M. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 461-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although they become hypertrophic in arthritic joints (15von der Mark K. Kirsch T. Medici A. Kumiss A. Weseloh G. Gluckert K. Stoss H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which hypertrophy is suppressed in permanent cartilages is not known. However, lectins may alter the differentiation program in permanent chondrocytes by cross-linking cell-surface glycoproteins, because some surface glycoproteins serve as growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix receptors, and modulators of signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of 11 lectins with different sugar-binding properties on the expression of maturation-related phenotypes by resting and articular chondrocytes. The results showed that among the tested lectins, ConA alone induces ALPase activity, type X collagen synthesis, vitamin D receptor synthesis, and matrix calcification in resting, but not in articular chondrocyte cultures. DISCUSSIONExposure to ConA markedly increased ALPase activity and the size of resting chondrocytes. ALPase synthesis was stimulated more by ConA than by hormones and growth factors that supposedly enhance ALPase synthesis by chondrocytes. The specificity of the ConA action on ALPase was indicated by the following observations. (i) ConA did not stimulate ALPase synthesis and hypertrophy in articular chondrocyte cultures. The marginal effect of ConA on ALPase activity in growth-plate chondrocyte cultures could have been due to contamination of the growth-plate cell population by resting chondrocytes. (ii) Lentil and garden pea lectins had little effect on ALPase activity, although their monosaccharide-binding properties (mannose/glucose) are similar to those of ConA. The crystal structure of pea lectin is also similar to that of ConA (34Einspahr H. Parks E.H. Suguna K. Subramanian E. Suddath F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16518-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the oligosaccharide-binding properties of lentil and garden pea lectins differ from those of ConA (1Lis H. Sharon N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 35-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). (iii) Of the lectins examined, only ConA stimulated chondrocyte hypertrophy and calcification. This is important, because many lectins with different sugar-binding properties activate lymphocytes. (iv) ALPase induction by ConA was suppressed by methylmannoside.Our findings indicated that ConA does not randomly activate gene expression by chondrocytes, but that it initiates the maturation program in resting chondrocytes. Exposing resting chondrocytes to ConA for 6-24 h suppressed cell division, then increased the proteoglycan content, the cell size, ALPase activity, the vitamin D receptor level, the incorporation of 45Ca into insoluble material, and the calcium content. These cell-matrix changes proceeded in the same order as that seen in growth plates and bone fracture callus in vivo The cell size as well as the ALPase and the vitamin D receptor levels in the ConA-exposed chondrocyte cultures were comparable to those in the growth plate in vivo (14Iwamoto M. Shimazu A. Nakashima K. Suzuki F. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 461-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Chondrocytes in rib resting cartilage start to mature only near the growth plate in vivo, although cells far from the growth plate can also become hypertrophic when cultured at high density in the absence of a tissue culture surface (9Iwamoto M. Sato K. Nakashima K. Shimazu A. Kato Y. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Changes in cell-matrix interactions and/or growth factor levels may stimulate the maturation of resting chondrocytes in vivo We postulated that specific lectins induce the maturation of “permanent chondrocytes” in vitro by cross-linking or activating growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix receptors, and/or modulators of signal transduction, because some of the cell-surface proteins are uniquely glycosylated. The finding that ConA, but not other lectins, induces maturation of resting chondrocytes suggests that ConA-binding surface glycoprotein(s) plays a crucial role in switching from the immature, to the mature stage.Why only resting, but not articular, chondrocytes respond to ConA is unknown. Resting cartilage provides the reserved chondrocyte pool for the growth plate while remaining flexible, whereas articular cartilage supports high compressive loads in the body while remaining flexible. A fraction of resting chondrocytes may undergo hypertrophy even in normal cartilage, whereas articular chondrocytes do not undergo hypertrophy unless they become arthritic. The functional differences between these cartilages suggest that the factors regulating maturation in resting and articular cartilage should differ. In fact, PTH-related protein is involved in inhibiting hypertrophy in resting, but not articular cartilage in vivo (32Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewocz V. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), although BMP-2 and thyroid hormone induce hypertrophy in both resting and articular chondrocyte cultures.Although ConA and WGA activate insulin receptors in adipocytes (2Cuatrecasas P. Tell G.P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 3Czech M.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Lynn W.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5800-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), insulin induced only a very low level of ALPase activity in chondrocytes.2 Thus, the stimulation of ALPase is not mediated by the binding of ConA to insulin receptors. In addition, ConA did not down-regulate PTH, TGF-β1, and fibroblast growth factor receptors in chondrocytes.ConA enhanced the synthesis of 15-kDa cystatin-like protein by resting chondrocytes. Since ConA also enhanced this synthesis by articular chondrocytes,3 the cystatin-like protease inhibitor is unlikely to mediate the action of ConA on chondrocyte hypertrophy. Previous studies have shown that ConA stimulates and inhibits the synthesis of matrix-metalloproteinases and TIMP inhibitor, respectively, by fibroblasts (35Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that some ConA-binding surface glycoproteins are involved in the control of matrix breakdown in connective tissues.Interactions of chondrocytes with artificial substrate impair their phenotypic expression. Thus ConA may enhance proteoglycan and ALPase synthesis via inhibition of their spreading on tissue culture surface. We tested this notion by comparing the action of ConA with that of succinyl ConA. Tetravalent ConA induced extensive cross-linking of membrane glycoproteins, whereas the divalent ConA derivative did not. This accounted for the differences between the actions of ConA and succinyl ConA on lymphocytes (36Gunther G.R. Wang J.L. Yahara I. Cunnungham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In this study, ConA, but not succinyl ConA, inhibited the spreading of chondrocytes, although these lectins exerted the same effects on ALPase activity, proteoglycan synthesis, and total protein synthesis. Thus, extensive cross-linking of cell-surface glycoproteins is required for the rapid cell-shape change, but not for chondrocyte differentiation.The tertiary structures of ConA and the ConA-sugar complex, as well as its sugar-binding site, have been characterized (37Derewenda Z.

In addition, the oligosaccharide structure required for ConA binding has been determined (38Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a family of peptides that mimic the binding of MeMan to ConA have been identified from screening a hexapeptide epitope library (39Scott J.K. Loganathan D. Bailey R.B. Gong X. Goldstein I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This information will be useful for future studies on the action of ConA on animal cells.In conclusion, the present study showed that ConA selectively acts on resting chondrocytes to initiate the maturation program, and that the ConA stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation is not directly linked with lectin-induced changes in the cytoskeleton. Resting chondrocytes exposed to ConA may be useful as a novel model for studies on endochondral bone formation.

https://openalex.org/W1978397203,"We used complexes of avidin and biotinylated precursors to generate translocation intermediates that occupy functional transport sites and thereby block the transport of other precursor proteins into pea chloroplasts. Cysteine residues of purified precursor to the small subunit of rubisco (prSS) were modified with the biotinylation reagent biotin-1-biotinamido-4-[-4ʹ-(maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-carboxamido]butane. Chemically biotinylated prSS was readily imported into chloroplasts. The addition of avidin, however, resulted in the formation of an avidin-biotinylated precursor complex that could not be imported into chloroplasts even when precursors had already engaged the transport apparatus before avidin was added. On fractionation, the avidin-biotinylated precursor complex associated with envelope membranes. Titration of transport sites with avidin-biotinylated precursor complexes revealed that saturation was reached at 2,000 molecules/chloroplast. Even with less than saturating levels of complexes, a sufficient number of translocation sites could be occupied with avidin-precursor complexes so that the import rate of freshly added radiolabeled prSS was reduced by 35%. From these observations we conclude that the trapped intermediates were blocking functional translocation sites. These biotinylated translocation intermediates should be useful in future efforts to purify and characterize the chloroplastic protein import machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2133275947,"To assess the functional roles of helix 13 and of the conserved and variable residues in the C-terminal region (residues 378-397) of the tryptophan synthase β subunit, we have constructed four C-terminal truncations and 12 point mutations. The effects of these mutations on kinetic and spectroscopic properties and thermal stability are reported here. The mutant β subunits all form stable α2β2 complexes that have been purified to homogeneity. The mutant α2β2 complexes are divided into two classes on the basis of activity in the reaction of L-serine with indole to form tryptophan. Class I enzymes, which have mutations at Arg-379 or Asp-381 or truncations (384-397 or 385-397), exhibit significant activity (1-38% of wild type). Class II enzymes, which have mutations at Lys-382 or Asp-383 or truncations (382-397 or 383-397), exhibit very low activity (<1% of wild type). Although Class II enzymes have drastically reduced activity in the reaction of L-serine with indole and an altered distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates in the reaction of L-serine with β-mercaptoethanol, they retain activity in the reaction of β-chloro-L-alanine with indole. Correlation of the results with the three-dimensional structure of the α2β2 complex suggests that Lys-382 and Asp-383 serve important roles in a proposed “open” to “closed” conformational change that occurs in the reactions of L-serine. Because mutant β subunits having C-terminal truncations (383-397 or 384-397) undergo much more rapid thermal inactivation at 60°C than the wild type β subunit, the C-terminal helix 13 stabilizes the β subunit.
