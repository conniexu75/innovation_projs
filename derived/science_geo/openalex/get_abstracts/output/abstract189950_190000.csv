https://openalex.org/W2039953952,"Diazonium reagents functionalize single-walled carbon nanotubes suspended in aqueous solution with high selectivity and enable manipulation according to electronic structure. For example, metallic species are shown to react to the near exclusion of semiconducting nanotubes under controlled conditions. Selectivity is dictated by the availability of electrons near the Fermi level to stabilize a charge-transfer transition state preceding bond formation. The chemistry can be reversed by using a thermal treatment that restores the pristine electronic structure of the nanotube."
https://openalex.org/W2086265207,"Stem cell self-renewal can be specified by local signals from the surrounding microenvironment, or niche. However, the relation between the niche and the mechanisms that ensure the correct balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we show that dividing Drosophila male germline stem cells use intracellular mechanisms involving centrosome function and cortically localized Adenomatous Polyposis Coli tumor suppressor protein to orient mitotic spindles perpendicular to the niche, ensuring a reliably asymmetric outcome in which one daughter cell remains in the niche and self-renews stem cell identity, whereas the other, displaced away, initiates differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2003001669,"Phototropins are light-activated kinases important for plant responses to blue light. Light initiates signaling in these proteins by generating a covalent protein-flavin mononucleotide (FMN) adduct within sensory Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains. We characterized the light-dependent changes of a phototropin PAS domain by solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and found that an alpha helix located outside the canonical domain plays a key role in this activation process. Although this helix associates with the PAS core in the dark, photoinduced changes in the domain structure disrupt this interaction. We propose that this mechanism couples light-dependent bond formation to kinase activation and identifies a signaling pathway conserved among PAS domains."
https://openalex.org/W2017671227,"The formation of an atherosclerotic lesion is mediated by lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells), which also establish chronic inflammation associated with lesion progression. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma promotes lipid uptake and efflux in these atherogenic cells. In contrast, we found that the closely related receptor PPARdelta controls the inflammatory status of the macrophage. Deletion of PPARdelta from foam cells increased the availability of inflammatory suppressors, which in turn reduced atherosclerotic lesion area by more than 50%. We propose an unconventional ligand-dependent transcriptional pathway in which PPARdelta controls an inflammatory switch through its association and disassociation with transcriptional repressors. PPARdelta and its ligands may thus serve as therapeutic targets to attenuate inflammation and slow the progression of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2171281863,"We examined the encoding and decoding of odor identity and intensity by neurons in the antennal lobe and the mushroom body, first and second relays, respectively, of the locust olfactory system. Increased odor concentration led to changes in the firing patterns of individual antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs), similar to those caused by changes in odor identity, thus potentially confounding representations for identity and concentration. However, when these time-varying responses were examined across many PNs, concentration-specific patterns clustered by identity, resolving the apparent confound. This is because PN ensemble representations changed relatively continuously over a range of concentrations of each odorant. The PNs' targets in the mushroom body—Kenyon cells (KCs)—had sparse identity-specific responses with diverse degrees of concentration invariance. The tuning of KCs to identity and concentration and the patterning of their responses are consistent with piecewise decoding of their PN inputs over oscillation-cycle length epochs."
https://openalex.org/W2077293902,"RNA interference (RNAi) spreads systemically in plants and nematodes to silence gene expression distant from the site of initiation. We previously identified a gene, sid-1 , essential for systemic but not cell-autonomous RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans . Here, we demonstrate that SID-1 is a multispan transmembrane protein that sensitizes Drosophila cells to soaking RNAi with a potency that is dependent on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) length. Further analyses revealed that SID-1 enables passive cellular uptake of dsRNA. These data indicate that systemic RNAi in C. elegans involves SID-1–mediated intercellular transport of dsRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2002145259,"Highly extensible Escherichia coli DNA molecules in planar extensional flow were visualized in dilute solution by fluorescence microscopy. For a narrow range of flow strengths, the molecules were found in either a coiled or highly extended conformation, depending on the deformation history of the polymer. This conformation hysteresis persists for many polymer relaxation times and is due to conformation-dependent hydrodynamic forces. Polymer conformational free-energy landscapes were calculated from computer simulations and show two free-energy minima for flow strengths near the coil-stretch transition. Hysteresis cycles may directly influence bulk-solution stresses and the development of stress-strain relations for dilute polymer flows."
https://openalex.org/W2143333433,"Cells in macaque ventral premotor cortex (area F5c) respond to observation or production of specific hand-object interactions. Studies in humans associate the left inferior frontal gyrus, including putative F5 homolog pars opercularis, with observing hand actions. Are these responses related to the realized goal of a prehensile action or to the observation of dynamic hand movements? Rapid, event-related fMRI was used to address this question. Subjects watched static pictures of the same objects being grasped or touched while performing a 1-back orienting task. In all 17 subjects, bilateral inferior frontal cortex was differentially activated in response to realized goals of observed prehensile actions. Bilaterally, precentral gyrus was most frequently activated (82%) followed by pars triangularis (73%) and pars opercularis (65%)."
https://openalex.org/W2087902062,"L-type (CaV1.2) and P/Q-type (CaV2.1) calcium channels possess lobe-specific CaM regulation, where Ca2+ binding to one or the other lobe of CaM triggers regulation, even with inverted polarity of modulation between channels. Other major members of the CaV1-2 channel family, R-type (CaV2.3) and N-type (CaV2.2), have appeared to lack such CaM regulation. We report here that R- and N-type channels undergo Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation, which is mediated by the CaM N-terminal lobe and present only with mild Ca2+ buffering (0.5 mM EGTA) characteristic of many neurons. These features, together with the CaM regulatory profiles of L- and P/Q-type channels, are consistent with a simplifying principle for CaM signal detection in CaV1-2 channels-independent of channel context, the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM appear invariably specialized for decoding local versus global Ca2+ activity, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1985475442,"During spliceosome activation, a large structural rearrangement occurs that involves the release of two small nuclear RNAs, U1 and U4, and the addition of a protein complex associated with Prp19p. We show here that the Prp19p-associated complex is required for stable association of U5 and U6 with the spliceosome after U4 is dissociated. Ultraviolet crosslinking analysis revealed the existence of two modes of base pairing between U6 and the 5' splice site, as well as a switch of such base pairing from one to the other that required the Prp19p-associated complex during spliceosome activation. Moreover, a Prp19p-dependent structural change in U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles was detected that involves destabilization of Sm-like (Lsm) proteins to bring about interactions between the Lsm binding site of U6 and the intron sequence near the 5' splice site, indicating dynamic association of Lsm with U6 and a direct role of Lsm proteins in activation of the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W1986143056,The pseudo–one-dimensional (psuedo-1D) conjugated electronic structure of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) allows them to exhibit semiconducting and metallic properties and to exhibit ballistic transport (1). We show that their unique electronic structure also offers the opportunity for new horizons in chemistry by exploring the response of the Fermi level (EF) electronic structure of the metallic SWNTs to carbon-carbon bond formation at the nanotube surface.
https://openalex.org/W2116582052,"Propagation in higher animals requires the efficient and accurate display of innate mating behaviors. In Drosophila melanogaster, male courtship consists of a stereotypic sequence of behaviors involving multiple sensory modalities, such as vision, audition, and chemosensation. For example, taste bristles located in the male forelegs and the labial palps are thought to recognize nonvolatile pheromones secreted by the female. Here, we report the identification of the putative pheromone receptor GR68a, which is expressed in chemosensory neurons of about 20 male-specific gustatory bristles in the forelegs. Gr68a expression is dependent on the sex determination gene doublesex, which controls many aspects of sexual differentiation and is necessary for normal courtship behavior. Tetanus toxin-mediated inactivation of Gr68a-expressing neurons or transgene-mediated RNA interference of Gr68a RNA leads to a significant reduction in male courtship performance, suggesting that GR68a protein is an essential component of pheromone-driven courtship behavior in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1971857408,"Cooling of blood platelets clusters the von Willebrand factor receptor complex. Macrophage alphaMbeta2 integrins bind to the GPIbalpha subunit of the clustered complex, resulting in rapid clearance of transfused, cooled platelets. This precludes refrigeration of platelets for transfusion, but the current practice of room temperature storage has major drawbacks. We document that alphaMbeta2 is a lectin that recognizes exposed beta-N-acetylglucosamine residues of N-linked glycans on GPIbalpha. Enzymatic galactosylation of chilled platelets blocks alphaMbeta2 recognition, prolonging the circulation of functional cooled platelets. Platelet-associated galactosyltransferase produces efficient galactosylation when uridine diphosphate-galactose is added, affording a potentially simple method for storing platelets in the cold."

https://openalex.org/W2064157840,"While electrophysiological recordings from visually identified cell bodies or dendrites are routinely performed in cell culture and acute brain slice preparations, targeted recordings from the mammalian nervous system are currently not possible in vivo. The “blind” approach that is used instead is somewhat random and largely limited to common neuronal cell types. This approach prohibits recordings from, for example, molecularly defined and/or disrupted populations of neurons. Here we describe a method, which we call TPTP (two-photon targeted patching), that uses two-photon imaging to guide in vivo whole-cell recordings to individual, genetically labeled cortical neurons. We apply this technique to obtain recordings from genetically manipulated, parvalbumin-EGFP-positive interneurons in the somatosensory cortex. We find that both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity patterns involve the synchronized discharge of electrically coupled interneurons. TPTP applied in vivo will therefore provide new insights into the molecular control of neuronal function at the systems level."
https://openalex.org/W2121882364,"The 5' untranslated region of the proto-oncogene c-myc contains an internal ribosome entry segment and c-Myc translation can be initiated by cap-independent as well as cap-dependent mechanisms. In contrast to the process of cap-dependent initiation, the trans-acting factor requirements for cellular internal ribosome entry are poorly understood. Here, we show that members of the poly (rC) binding protein family, poly (rC) binding protein 1 (PCBP1), poly (rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and hnRNPK were able to activate the IRES in vitro up to threefold when added in combination with upstream of N-ras and unr-interacting protein. The interactions of PCBP1, PCBP2 and hnRNPK with c-myc-IRES-RNA were shown to be specific by ultraviolet crosslinking analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, while immunoprecipitation of the three proteins using specific antibodies followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that they were able to bind c-myc mRNA. c-myc-IRES-mediated translation from the reporter vector was stimulated by cotransfection of plasmids encoding PCBP1, PCBP2 and hnRNPK. Interestingly, the mutated version of the c-myc IRES that is prevalent in patients with multiple myeloma bound hnRNPK more efficiently in vitro and was stimulated by hnRNPK to a greater extent in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2078197727,"Spin-polarized gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates were confined by a combination of gravitational and magnetic forces. The partially condensed atomic vapors were adiabatically decompressed by weakening the gravito-magnetic trap to a mean frequency of 1hertz, then evaporatively reduced in size to 2500 atoms. This lowered the peak condensate density to 5 x 10(10) atoms per cubic centimeter and cooled the entire cloud in all three dimensions to a kinetic temperature of 450 +/- 80 picokelvin. Such spin-polarized, dilute, and ultracold gases are important for spectroscopy, metrology, and atom optics."
https://openalex.org/W2091791375,"We have analyzed the global tropospheric temperature for 1978 to 2002 with the use of passive microwave sounding data from the NOAA series of polar orbiters and the Earth Observing System Aqua satellite. To accurately retrieve the climatic trend, we combined the satellite data with an analytic model of temperature that contains three different time scales: a linear trend and functions that define the seasonal and diurnal cycles. Our analysis shows a trend of +0.22 degrees to 0.26 degrees C per 10 years, consistent with the global warming trend derived from surface meteorological stations."
https://openalex.org/W2151797745,"Leprosy presents as a clinical and immunological spectrum of disease. With the use of gene expression profiling, we observed that a distinction in gene expression correlates with and accurately classifies the clinical form of the disease. Genes belonging to the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LIR) family were significantly up-regulated in lesions of lepromatous patients suffering from the disseminated form of the infection. In functional studies, LIR-7 suppressed innate host defense mechanisms by shifting monocyte production from interleukin-12 toward interleukin-10 and by blocking antimicrobial activity triggered by Toll-like receptors. Gene expression profiles may be useful in defining clinical forms of disease and providing insights into the regulation of immune responses to pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2043706518,Presynaptic GABAA receptors modulate synaptic transmission in several areas of the CNS but are not known to have this action in the cerebral cortex. We report that GABAA receptor activation reduces hippocampal mossy fibers excitability but has the opposite effect when intracellular Cl- is experimentally elevated. Synaptically released GABA mimics the effect of exogenous agonists. GABAA receptors modulating axonal excitability are tonically active in the absence of evoked GABA release or exogenous agonist application. Presynaptic action potential-dependent Ca2+ transients in individual mossy fiber varicosities exhibit a biphasic dependence on membrane potential and are altered by GABAA receptors. Antibodies against the alpha2 subunit of GABAA receptors stain mossy fibers. Axonal GABAA receptors thus play a potentially important role in tonic and activity-dependent heterosynaptic modulation of information flow to the hippocampus.
https://openalex.org/W2069403245,"Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism is a movement disorder associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. The loss of functional parkin caused by parkin gene mutations is the most common single cause of juvenile parkinsonism. Parkin has been shown to aid in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stressors presumably due to ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin that targets proteins for proteasomal degradation. However, studies on parkin have been impeded because of limited reagents specific for this protein. Here we report the generation and characterization of a panel of parkin-specific monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical analyses indicate that parkin is present only in the high salt-extractable fraction of mouse brain, whereas it is present in both the high salt-extractable and RIPA-resistant, SDS-extractable fraction in young human brain. Parkin is present at decreased levels in the high salt-extractable fraction and at increased levels in the SDS-extractable fraction from aged human brain. This shift in the extractability of parkin upon aging is seen in humans but not in mice, demonstrating species-specific differences in the biochemical characteristics of murine versus human parkin. Finally, by using these highly specific anti-parkin monoclonal antibodies, it was not possible to detect parkin in α-synuclein-containing lesions in α-synucleinopathies, thereby challenging prior inferences about the role of parkin in movement disorders other than autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism.

A major locus for this disease was mapped to chromosome 6q, and the gene was subsequently identified and termed parkin (1Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4166) Google Scholar). Human parkin is a 465-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 52 kDa that contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, a linker region, and a C-terminal TRIAD domain consisting of two RING fingers on either side of an in-between RING (IBR) finger region (2van der Reijden B.A. Erpelinck-Verschueren C.A. Lowenberg B. Jansen J.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletions and insertions of one or more exons resulting in premature translation termination are some of the most common mutations in parkin, but numerous missense point mutations in parkin have also been shown to be causal of AR-JP (3West A. Periquet M. Lincoln S. Lucking C.B. Nicholl D. Bonifati V. Rawal N. Gasser T. Lohmann E. Deleuze J.F. Maraganore D. Levey A. Wood N. Durr A. Hardy J. Brice A. Farrer M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 114: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Since the identification of parkin, many studies focused on elucidating the function of this protein, and it has been shown it can function as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase and that its overexpression in vivo enhances the ubiquitinylation of synphilin-1, Pael-R, and CDCRel-1. Immunoprecipitated parkin has been reported to catalyze the ubiquination of these substrates in vitro as well as O-glycosylated α-synuclein p22 and cyclin E (4Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T.

A panel of antiparkin monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognize different domains of parkin was produced, and their specificity in murine and human brain was demonstrated. Detailed analyses of the biochemical properties of parkin in mouse and human brain tissue by using serial fractionation with buffers of increasing protein extraction strength showed unusual properties of parkin in the human brain. Finally, by using these highly specific parkin mAbs in conjunction with biochemical and immunostaining methods, we were unable to detect parkin in α-synuclein containing lesions in patients with α-synucleinopathies thereby calling into question prior studies about the role of parkin in movement disorders other than AR-JP. The full-length human parkin cDNA was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pFASTBAC-HTb and expressed in Sf9 cells (Invitrogen). The resulting His6-tagged parkin protein was purified on a column packed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Invitrogen). In brief, Sf9/parkin cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated in equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer followed by 2 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 m KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol) and then 2 column volumes of equilibration buffer. His6-parkin was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m KCl, 100 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol (see Fig. 1A). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies CS2132 and AB5112 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA), respectively. Murine anti-human parkin mAbs were generated by immunization of mice with recombinant human parkin as described (30Giasson B.I. Jakes R. Goedert M. Duda J.E. Leight S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Fusion was conducted by using spleen lymphocytes from immunized Balb/c mice and SP2 cells to produce hybridomas. Resulting hybridoma supernatants were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using plates coated with parkin. The epitopes of the anti-parkin mAbs were mapped by Western blotting using proteins expressed by Gene-Porter 2 (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA)-mediated transfection of QBI293 cells with pcDNA3.1-myc/His (Invitrogen) harboring subcloned domains of parkin. To generate these constructs, PCR fragments spanning the coding region for each domain (ubiquitin-like domain, 1–77; linker region, 78–220; first RING finger, 221–305; IBR region, 306–398; second RING finger, 399–465) were digested and ligated into the host vector. The predicted sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Antibodies were isotyped by antigen-captured ELISA by using goat anti-mouse antibodies to each immunoglobulin subtype (Sigma). Proteins were resolved on 10 and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for parkin and α-synuclein, respectively, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (29Forman M.S.

Immuno-positive protein bands were detected with Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Wild type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO cells stably expressing human parkin (CHO-PAR4) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. HeLa, Neuro-2A, and HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (Cellgro by Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown to ∼80% confluency, lysed in 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Parkin-null mice were generated by genomic deletion of exon 2 of parkin, removing most of the coding region for the ubiquitin-like domain. 2F. A. Perez and R. D. Palmiter, manuscript in preparation. The parkin-null mice were maintained on a C57Bl6/J × Sv129S hybrid background. Young wild type and parkin null mice used in these studies were 4–12 weeks old, and aged wild type mice were >22 months old. Whole mouse brains were dissected for biochemical fractionation studies. The brain tissue samples from human subjects that were used for biochemical analyses are summarized in Table I. Two extraction methods (I and II) were used for these tissues as summarized below.Table ISummary of subjects used in this study Young (Y) and aged (A) cases are described according to their pathologically confirmed diagnoses, age at death (Age), sex and post-mortem interval (PMI).

Supernatants from the initial fractionation were saved as the HS fraction, and the pellets were washed and re-extracted sequentially with buffers of increasing protein extraction strengths. For each buffer, two cycles of extraction and washes were conducted using 2 ml/g of HS + 1% Triton X-100 (HST) followed by 2 ml/g of RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Supernatants were saved as the HST and RIPA fractions, respectively. Floatation and removal of contaminating myelin using HS + 20% sucrose was performed prior to the RIPA extraction. A final extraction using 2 ml/g of 2% SDS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, was conducted on the pellet and sedimented at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C. The supernatant was saved as the SDS fraction. Method II—Brain tissues from patients with α-synucleinopathies and control patients were homogenized in 10 ml/g low salt (LS) buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) and sedimented at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were saved as the LS fraction, and pellets were washed by re-extraction in LS buffer. Resulting pellets were subjected to two sequential extractions in 10 ml/g Triton X (TX) buffer (LS + 1% Triton X-100 + 0.5 m NaCl) and sedimented at 180,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants from the first of these extractions were saved as the TX fraction. Pellets were then homogenized in 10 ml/g Sarkosyl buffer (LS + 1% N-lauroylsarcosine + 0.5 m NaCl) and incubated at 22 °C on a shaker for 1 h prior to sedimentation at 180,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C. Supernatants were saved as the Sarkosyl extraction buffer fraction. Remaining pellets were extracted in 2.5 ml/g SDS buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6) prior to centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C. Supernatants were saved as the SDS fraction. All extraction buffers contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mm PMSF). For experiments using quantitative amounts of protein, total protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose) was added to samples of HS, HST, RIPA, LS, TX, and Sarkosyl extraction buffer fractions; sample buffer without SDS was added to the SDS samples. All samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C prior to SDS-PAGE. PRK8-coupled dextran beads were generated using the Carbo-Link column kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were extracted from human frontal cortex tissue by two extractions with HST, and myelin was floated and removed as described above. The resulting pellet was homogenized in 8 m urea in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with protease inhibitors. Following sedimentation at 125,000 × g, the supernatant was diluted to 2 m urea and incubated by gentle rocking with PRK8-coupled beads for 4 h. The incubation and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with 2 m urea, 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and bound parkin was then eluted with Pierce ImmunoElution Buffer by gentle rocking for 1 h. SDS sample buffer was added to an aliquot of the eluant. Samples were not boiled to limit carbamoylation of protein in the presence of urea. The harvesting, fixation, and further processing of the tissue specimens used in this study were conducted as described previously (24Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Gur T.L. Montine T.J. Robertson D.

In order to try to stain α-synuclein pathological inclusions in human diseased cases with parkin antibodies, a variety of fixation and retrieval methods were applied. These include the following: 1) formalin- or ethanol-fixed, paraffin-infiltrated tissue followed by antigen retrieval with urea, microwave irradiation, or formic acid; 2) formalin- or ethanol-fixed floating sections; 3) frozen sections post-fixed with ethanol or formalin; and 4) fresh frozen un-fixed sections.

For tissue culture experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips, transfected as described above, and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by the permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Alexa Fluor 488-(green) and Alexa Fluor 594 (red)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used to detect immunostaining, and slides were coverslipped with Vectashield 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). CHO cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the plasmid parkin/pcDNA 3.1 expressing full-length un-tagged parkin using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells stably transfected with parkin/pcDNA 3.1 were selected and maintained with 200 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Following harvesting with trypsin, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol, 150 mm NaCl, compacted into a pellet by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, and paraffin-embedded. Following sectioning, immunocytochemistry or immunofluorescence staining was performed as described above. To produce antibodies specific to parkin, a battery of murine mAbs was raised against recombinant human parkin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We identified 60 hybridomas with strong immunoreactivity for the recombinant protein by ELISA. To confirm the specificity of these parkin mAbs, we conducted Western blot analyses using brain extracts from wild type and parkin-null mice as well as extracts from the human brain. Surprisingly, out of our panel of 60 mAbs, only four anti-parkin antibodies (PRK8, PRK28, PRK106, and PRK109) were able to detect protein bands with apparent molecular masses corresponding to that of parkin while at the same time showing no cross-reactivity with proteins in extracts from parkin null mice (Fig. 1 and Table II).

https://openalex.org/W2116376337,"Learning systems must be able to store memories reliably, yet be able to modify them when new learning is required. At the mechanistic level, new learning may either reverse the cellular events mediating the storage of old memories or mask the old memories with additional cellular changes that preserve the old cellular events in a latent form. Behavioral evidence about whether reversal or masking occurs in a particular circuit can constrain the cellular mechanisms used to store memories. Here we examine these constraints for a simple cerebellum-dependent learning task, motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Learning can change the amplitude of the VOR in two opposite directions. Contrary to previous models about memory encoding by the cerebellum, our results indicate that these behavioral changes are implemented by different plasticity mechanisms, which reverse each other with unequal efficacy."

https://openalex.org/W2171804890,"A pattern of light striking the retina of an alert observer is normally readily perceived. While a handful of conditions exist in which even salient visual stimuli can be rendered invisible, the mechanisms underlying such suppression remain poorly understood. Here, we describe experiments using a novel stimulation sequence that gives rise to the sudden and reliable subjective disappearance of a wide range of visual patterns. We found that a parafoveal target immediately vanished from perception following the abrupt onset of a surrounding texture. The probability of disappearance was influenced by the ocular configuration of the target and surround, as well as their spatial separation. In addition, suppression was critically dependent upon several hundred milliseconds of stimulus-specific adaptation. These findings demonstrate that the all-or-none disappearance of a salient visual target, which is reminiscent of a high-level selection process, is inextricably linked to topographic stimulus representations, presumably in the early visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2058367692,"Prostatic glandular epithelial cells express protein kinase Cɛ (PKCɛ), an oncoprotein that coordinately disrupts the reactivation of the tumor suppressor Rb, derepressess transcriptional elongation of the c-myc oncogene, and propagates survival signals in LNCaP cells. Since the activation of such a program may contribute to the progression of human prostate cancer, a proteomic analysis was performed to gain a more global perspective on the signaling network that PKCɛ might be capable of engaging in prostate cancer cells. Using CWR22 xenografts, we identified at least 18 different structural, signaling, and stress-related proteins that associated with PKCɛ, including an interaction with the proapoptotic protein Bax that was novel to recurrent CWR22 tumors. An investigation into the biological significance of the PKCɛ association with Bax provided the first evidence of an inverse relationship between endogenous levels of PKCɛ and susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to the apoptotic effects of phorbol esters. Western blot and antisense experiments demonstrated that CWR-R1 cells expressed moderate levels of PKCɛ and relied on this protein to survive in the presence of phorbol esters, while the apoptosis normally induced by phorbol esters in PKCɛ-deficient LNCaP cells was dependent on the presence of Bax. Forced expression of PKCɛ in LNCaP cells was sufficient to confer a significant resistance to phorbol esters and this resistance was associated with an inhibition of phorbol ester-induced Bax conformational rearrangements that are important for Bax oligomerization, mitochondrial integration, and cytochrome c release. Considered in their entirety, our data suggest that an association of PKCɛ with Bax may neutralize apoptotic signals propagated through a mitochondrial death-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2062960630,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a major health issue. Whereas localized disease can be cured surgically, there is no effective therapy for metastatic disease. The development of an effective therapy will require an understanding of the pathways that are important in RCC carcinogenesis and progression. Using genomic profiling of patient-matched tissue, we have identified aberrations in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathway in RCC. We observed loss of type III TGFbeta receptor (TBR3) expression in all RCC samples. This suggests that TBR3 loss is an early event in RCC carcinogenesis and plays a sentinel role in the acquisition of a tumorigenic phenotype. We also observed subsequent loss of type II TGFbeta receptor (TBR2) expression in metastatic RCCs. We propose that loss of TBR3 is necessary for RCC carcinogenesis, and that loss of TBR2 leads to acquisition of a metastatic phenotype. To this end, we have identified a human renal cell carcinoma line (UMRC6) that is representative of localized, nonmetastatic RCC, reflecting a loss of TBR3, but not TBR2 expression. Another cell line, UMRC3, is highly metastatic, having lost TBR3 and TBR2 expression. We demonstrate functional loss of TGFbeta responsiveness in these cell lines as observed through phenotypic and transcriptional responsiveness to exogenous TGFbeta. Restoring TBR2 and TBR3 expression in UMRC3 cells attenuates cell proliferation, completely restores TGFbeta-mediated transcriptional responses, and completely blocks anchorage independent-growth: while restoration of TBR2 partially restores TGFbeta-mediated signaling. Based on these data, we propose that dysregulation in TGFbeta signaling, through stepwise loss in receptor expression, plays a prominent role in RCC carcinogenesis and progression. In addition, these studies unequivocably demonstrate a link between loss of TBR3 and a human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2008890538,"The redox potentials of the two electron transfer (ET) active quinones in the central part of photosystem I (PSI) were determined by evaluating the electrostatic energies from the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on the crystal structure. The calculated redox potentials are -531 mV for A1A and -686 mV for A1B. From these results we conclude the following. (i) Both branches are active with a much faster ET in the B-branch than in the A-branch. (ii) The measured lifetime of 200-290 ns of reduced quinones agrees with the estimate for the A-branch and corroborates with an uphill ET from this quinone to the iron-sulfur cluster as observed in recent kinetic measurements. (iii) The electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic data refer to the A-branch quinone where the corresponding ET is uphill in energy. The negative redox potential of A1 in PSI is primarily because of the influence from the negatively charged FX, in contrast to the positive shift on the quinone redox potential in bacterial reaction center and PSII that is attributed to the positively charged non-heme iron atom. The conserved residue Asp-B575 changes its protonation state after quinone reduction. The difference of 155 mV in the quinone redox potentials of the two branches were attributed to the conformation of the backbone with a large contribution from Ser-A692 and Ser-B672 and to the side chain of Asp-B575, whose protonation state couples differently with the formation of the quinone radicals.

PSI consists of 12 polypeptide chains. The central part of PSI is composed of the homologue chains PsaA and PsaB, followed by chain PsaC. The former two host as redox-active cofactors a dimer of chlorophylls (chlorophyll a Chl) (P700), two accessory Chls (A-1), two more distant Chls (A0), two phylloquinones (phyllo-Q; A1), and one iron-sulfur cluster (FX), whereas PsaC contains two iron-sulfur clusters (FA and FB) (Fig. 1). Similar to the bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers (bRC) these cofactors are arranged in two branches (A and B) related by C2 symmetry with an axis going through the P700 dimer and FX, the iron-sulfur cluster closest to P700. Both branches start with the dimer P700 and end in the iron-sulfur cluster FX, which they have in common. These cofactors are bridged by the four Chls A-1A, A-1B, A0A, A0B, two for each branch, and the two quinones A1A and A1B. Despite the apparent C2 symmetry, the electron transfer (ET) in bRC occurs predominantly in the A-branch. A likewise asymmetric behavior was observed in PSI. For instance, EPR studies resulted in reduced A1 localized in the A-branch only (2Bittl R. Zech S.G. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Lubitz W.

This view is also supported by point mutagenesis studies replacing the tryptophans Trp-A697 and Trp-B677 in the vicinity of each of the quinones (see Fig. 2) by His, Leu, and Phe residues. These two tryptophan residues in the A- and B-branch were shown to be related to the slow and the fast phase of the ET process from A1 to FX, respectively (7Guergova-Kuras M. Boudreaux B. Joliot A.

Therefore, the idea that in PSI both branches are active ET pathways has been put forward, contrary to the conservative idea of a single ET active branch as found in bRC.Fig. 2Quinone binding site in PSI from S. elongatus. Trp-A697 and Trp-B677 are in a π-stacking conformation with the ring part of the quinones A1A and A1B, respectively. Oxygen and sulfur atoms are displayed in dark gray. The indole ring of the tryptophans with the carbon atom connecting to the backbone is depicted as a stick model. Backbone atoms are shown only for the serines B672 and A692 with enlarged spheres for the carbonyl groups. The oxygen atom of the crystal water W-37 is shown as a large dark sphere.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) photosystem I photosystem II chlorophyll a bacterial reaction center dimethylformamide electron nuclear double resonance electron paramagnetic resonance electron spin echo modulation electron transfer monogalactosyl-diglyceride linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation phosphatidylglycerol phylloquinone ubiquinone Monte Carlo. Knowing the redox potentials of the cofactors in the two branches provides a thermodynamic basis to understand these ET processes in more detail. Therefore, it would be quite helpful to measure directly the redox potentials of those cofactors individually in each ET active branch and to evaluate the corresponding free energy differences between the electron donor and acceptor groups. However, the complexity of the PSI membrane protein complex, the large number of possible variably charged groups (redox-active and titratable), and the unknown interactions among them make it difficult to attribute experimentally measured signals uniquely to a specific redoxactive cofactor. Another problem is that the redox potentials of cofactors in PSI can often not be controlled directly by the solvent redox potential. This is particular the case for Chl and phyllo-Q. For the accessory Chls (A-1), located between P700 and the A0, it is even not clear whether they serve as electron acceptor or donor in the ET chain or whether they are involved directly in the charge separation process. In this report, we show that by computing the redox properties for the phyllo-Q (A1) participating in the ET pathways of PSI, we can clearly distinguish between the cofactors in the A- and B-branches. Our computed redox potential of A1A is higher than that of A1B and assumes a significantly more positive value than the value of about -800 mV estimated from experimental data more than 10 years ago (11Sétif, P., and Brettel, K. (1990) in Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Photosynthesis, Stockholm, Sweden, August 6-11, 1989 (Baltscheffsky, M., ed) Vol. 2, pp. 539-546, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). This may be very important to finally solve the riddle whether one or both branches of redox-active cofactors are ET active and helps to interpret diverging conclusions that are based on data obtained with different experimental methods. EPR studies (2Bittl R. Zech S.G. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12001-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B.L.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) support two active branches. Our calculated redox potentials are capable of explaining both the kinetic and the EPR studies and thus resolving the apparent conflict between these different experimental data. We try to identify the factors that shift the quinone redox potentials in PSI. Recently, it was suggested that the charge state of the iron complexes is responsible for the difference in the quinone redox potentials between bRC, PSII, and PSI (12Brettel K. Leibl W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Comparing details of those factors in the structurally known proteins PSI and bRC and recognizing their differences may provide clues to understand why in PSI the quinone redox potentials are dramatically more negative than in bRC and PSII. Coordinates—For our computations, we used the crystal structures of the trimeric PSI from S. elongatus at a resolution of 2.5 Å (Protein Data Bank code 1JB0) (1Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar) in the revised version, where the coordinates for the P700A Chl were corrected. 2N. Krauss, personal communications. The calcium ion, which is at a distance of more than 35 Å from the closest quinone and more than 20 Å from the porphyrin ring system of the closest Chl, was deleted as were the three negatively charged phosphatidylglycerols (PG) and one neutral monogalactosyl-diglyceride (GG) that are present in the crystal structure. However, to study the influence of these four lipids on the values of the quinone redox potentials we also performed computations where the PSI structure included them. Furthermore, we neglected in our computations the subunit PsaK, because it is very distant from the central part of the reaction center, and coordinates are available for backbone atoms only. Because there are no hydrogen atoms in the crystal structures, they were generated, and their positions were energetically optimized with CHARMM (13Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). During this procedure the positions of all non-hydrogen atoms were fixed, all titratable groups were kept in their standard protonation state (i.e. the acidic groups ionized and the basic groups protonated), and the Chls of the P700 dimer, of A-1, and A0, as well as the quinones, were kept in the oxidized neutral charge state. There is no explicit experimental information available on the position of the hydrogen atoms of water molecules found in the crystal structures. Generating these coordinates by modeling depends critically on the protonation pattern of titratable residues in the neighborhood, and often more than one conformation is possible. To avoid this uncertainty in previous treatments, we normally did not consider crystal waters explicitly. In the absence of water, their influence was considered implicitly by the high dielectric constant used for the resulting cavities. There are a number of studies to evaluate electrostatic energies in protein-water systems based on the solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) equation, which considered the influence of explicit water molecules, which generally yielded no improvement (14Gibas C.J.

In the present application we deviated slightly from this general procedure and considered also the action of crystal water and in particular of one specific water (W-37) in PSI. This water molecule forms a hydrogen bond with one of the acidic oxygens of Asp-B575 that was found to change its protonation state coupled with the redox states of the quinones as discussed later. If not stated otherwise, the presented results refer to computations that include this crystal water. Atomic Partial Charges—Atomic partial charges of the amino acids were adopted from the all-atom CHARMM22 (22MacKerell A.D.J. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D.D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher W.E. III Roux B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J. C. Stote R.

However, instead of attaching an explicit hydrogen atom on one of the oxygens of the protonated carboxyl group of glutamate or aspartate, the charges of these two oxygens were both increased symmetrically by +0.5 unit charges to account implicitly for the presence of the proton. A similar procedure was used for the basic groups of arginines and lysines, where instead of removing a proton explicitly in the deprotonated state the charges of all protons at the corresponding basic group were diminished symmetrically by a total unit charge. For cofactors and residues whose protonation states are not considered in the CHARMM22 parameter set, we used appropriate charges that were computed before (23Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Bophys. J. 1998; 1998: 626-637Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because phyllo-Q has the same aromatic ring structure as menaquinone except for the non-polar phytol chain, the charges computed for the latter were used (23Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Bophys. J. 1998; 1998: 626-637Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the iron-sulfur clusters, we used the atomic charges (electrostatic potential charges) of the model system [Fe4S4(SCH3)4] given in Ref. 24Mouesca J. Chen J.L. Noodleeman L. Bashford D. Case D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11898-11914Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar. We considered FX, FA, and FB in the oxidized charge state [Fe4S4(SCH3)4]2-, whereas in the reduced state the iron-sulfur cluster corresponds to the charge state [Fe4S4(SCH3)4]3- (25Vassiliev I.R.

A detailed discussion for the redox states of the iron-sulfur clusters can be found in Ref. 25Vassiliev I.R. Antonkine M.L. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. The atomic charges of the two different lipids PG and GG and of the Chl molecules (the latter in both redox states) (see Supplemental Material) were determined from the electronic wave functions obtained in Hartree-Fock approximation with 6-31G* basis set by fitting the resulting electrostatic potential in the neighborhood of these molecules by the restrained electrostatic potential model (28Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5782) Google Scholar). The charges for the β-carotene molecules and the phytol chain of the Chls and quinones were assigned in agreement with CHARMM22 parameters with a standard charge of +0.09 for non-polar hydrogen atoms and vanishing total charge for each CHn group (22MacKerell A.D.J.

In the computation of the PSI charge pattern with an oxidized P700+ the positive unit charge was located on the B-branch Chl monomer (P700B) of the P700 dimer only. This model is in agreement with ENDOR and ESEEM studies from which a largely asymmetric spin density distribution was deduced (30Davis I.H. Heathcote P. MacLachlan D.J. Evance M.C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 183-189Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Rigby S.E.J. Nugent J.H.A. O'Malley P.J.

Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 13215-13223Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) it was found that the spin density distribution is completely localized on P700B. Measurements on P700 where the axial ligands of both Chl monomers in the P700 dimer were mutated from histidine to Gln or Ser for P700A and to Gln, Gly, Asn, or Cys for P700B demonstrated that the replacement of the axial ligand on the B-branch had a much stronger impact on the redox potential and the spin density distribution of P700 (36Krabben L. Schlodder E. Jordan R. Carbonera D. Giacometti G. Lee H. Webber A.N. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13012-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recent molecular orbital calculations of P700 corroborated the results for the spin density localization on P700B (37Webber A.N. Lubitz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the redox potentials of the quinone cofactors were calculated with a positively charged Chl monomer P700B whereas the other Chls were kept in the neutral charge state. Computation of Protonation Pattern—The computation of the energetics of the protonation pattern is based on the electrostatic continuum model by solving the LPB equation with the program MEAD from Bashford and Karplus (38Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The ensemble of protonation patterns was sampled by a Monte Carlo (MC) method where we used our own program Karlsberg (39Rabenstein B. Karlsberg Online Manual. 1999; http://agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de/karlsberg/Google Scholar). The detailed procedure that we used is described in Refs. 18Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 19Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10487-10496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. The dielectric constant was set to ϵP = 4 inside the protein and ϵW = 80 for water. Discussions about the appropriate choice of the dielectric constant can be found in Refs. 23Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Eur. Bophys. J. 1998; 1998: 626-637Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 40Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 41Warshel A. Russel S.T. Q. Rev.

All computations were performed at 300 K with pH 7.0 and an ionic strength of 100 mm. The LPB equation was solved using a three-step grid-focusing procedure with a starting grid resolution of 2.5 Å, an intermediate grid resolution of 1.0 Å, and a final grid resolution of 0.3 Å. The MC sampling yields the probabilities [Aox] and [Ared] of the states of the redox-active group A. With these probabilities, the redox potentials can be calculated from the Nernst equation, shown below in Equation 1, where F is the Faraday constant, E is the solution redox potential, and E° is the standard redox potential of the redox-active group A.E=E∘+RTFln[Aox][Ared](Eq. 1) To minimize the statistical error in evaluating the redox potential from the Nernst equation (Equation 1) we applied a bias redox potential to the redox-active group A such that we obtained an equal amount of both redox states ([Aox] = [Ared]). The resulting bias potential is just the calculated value of the redox midpoint potential of that group. Error Estimate—The error in the computed redox potentials has statistical, numerical, and systematic contributions. The standard deviation in the protonation probability of a single titratable group estimated from the MC sampling procedure accounting for correlation between subsequent MC steps as described in Ref. 44Beroza P. Fredkin D.R. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5804-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar was much smaller than 0.01 protons. The sum of the standard deviations of protonation probabilities from all titratable groups was for each redox state of the cofactors that we considered about 0.02 protons similarly as in former applications (18Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Rabenstein B. Knapp E.W. Wheeler R.A. Bioenergetics. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C., in press2003Google Scholar). The error in the electrostatic energy values resulting from a grid resolution of 0.3 Å that we used was estimated to be considerably smaller than 10 meV (45Rabenstein B. Knapp E.W. Wheeler R.A. Bioenergetics. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C., in press2003Google Scholar). The resulting estimate of the combined numerical and statistical error of about 10 mV for the absolute values of the computed redox potentials is in the same range as typical uncertainties in experimental values for conventional molecular systems if measured under favorable conditions. But, this may not be fulfilled in the present case where redox-active cofactors are deeply buried in a large membrane-bound protein complex and require redox mediators to change their redox states. The computational method also involves systematic errors, which are generally difficult to estimate and which can have a major influence on the final value of the computed cofactor redox potential. These errors can be because of uncertainties in atomic partial charges, the value of the dielectric constant used inside the protein and the atomic coordinates. Regarding the coordinates there are a number of error sources. In the present application we used a single coordinate set taken from the crystal structure. A statistical average of different conformations would be more appropriate, but a suitable ensemble of conformations is not readily available. Conformations of crystal waters are generally uncertain with regard to hydrogen atom positions and are likely to involve a number of energetically equivalent conformations. Therefore, they were removed in our past treatments. The distance dependence of electrostatic interactions is also for inhomogeneous dielectrics roughly proportional to the inverse of the distance between charges, which is a rather mild distance dependence. Therefore, the influence from different conformations is generally not so critical. But, this may no longer be the case in the presence of variably charged groups (titratable or redox-active) that are close to the considered redox-active group and are about to change their charge state. Under these circumstances, subtle changes in conformation may lead to shifts in the charge state of that group, which in turn changes the electrostatic interactions with the considered redox-active group and shifts its potential. In these cases shifts of the redox potential by 100 mV or more can be observed. Nevertheless, we demonstrated in many different applications where experimental redox potentials are known that our computational procedure is reliable and yielded redox potential values that often agree with experimental results within 20 mV (17Popovic D.M. Zaric S.D. Rabenstein B. Knapp E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6040-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Rabenstein B. Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.W.

For convenience, the computed redox potentials are given with a 1-mV accuracy, although this does not suggest that the last digit is significant. Computation of Redox Potentials of the Cofactors—To obtain the in situ absolute values of the redox potentials of the cofactors, we need a reference model system of the cofactor (preferentially in solution) where the experimental value of the redox potential is known. By calculating the electrostatic energy difference of the two redox states of the considered cofactor in the reference model system and in the protein environment we obtain the shift in the redox potential between the two systems. This shift is added to the experimental value of the redox potential in the reference model system to yield the absolute value of the redox potential in the protein environment. As reference model system for phyllo-Q in PSI we considered the same quinone for the redox states (0/-1) solvated in dimethylformamide (DMF) where the measured redox potential is -463 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode. The latter value was obtained by converting the corresponding value measured versus standard calomel electrode (46Prince R.C. Dutton P.L. Bruce J.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 273-276Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Note that the computational conversion of this redox potential value from DMF to water as solvent yields -453 mV, if we account for the dielectric constant of ϵDMF = 37 for DMF and ϵW = 80 for water. Henceforth, we will provide values of redox potentials relative to normal hydrogen electrode, if not stated otherwise. The reliability for a"

However, the mechanism whereby hTERT expression is activated remains unresolved. Specifically, recent data challenging the role of Myc/Max in E-box-dependent activation of hTERT expression suggests that other E-box-binding proteins regulate hTERT transcription. Indeed, we now demonstrate that two such proteins, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) 1 and 2, readily associate with two E-boxes in the hTERT promoter in vitro and in vivo primarily as heterodimers, whereas Myc/Max does not. The avid binding of USF1/2 heterodimers to these E-boxes occurs in both hTERT-positive and -negative cells. In contrast, USF1/2 activates the hTERT promoter exclusively in hTERT-positive cells in a manner that is enhanced by the coactivator p300 and attenuated upon inhibiting p38-MAP kinase, a known modulator of USF activity. Collectively, our data indicate that USF binding to the hTERT promoter may be transcriptionally neutral, or even repressive, in nonimmortalized hTERT-negative somatic cells, but stimulatory in hTERT-positive cells where USF1/2 contributes to the acquisition and maintenance of immortality."

To explore the possibility that the genetic alterations of CASPASE-7 might be involved in the development of human cancers, we analysed the entire coding region and all splice sites of human CASPASE-7 gene for the detection of somatic mutations in a series of human solid cancers, including carcinomas from stomach, colon, head/neck, esophagus, urinary bladder and lung. Overall, we detected CASPASE-7 mutations in two of 98 colon carcinomas (2.0%), one of 50 esophageal carcinomas (2.0%) and one of 33 head/neck carcinomas (3.0%). We expressed the tumor-derived caspase-7 mutants in 293 T cells and found that the apoptosis was reduced compared to the wild-type caspase-7. This is the first report on the CASPASE-7 gene mutations in human malignancies, and our data suggest that the inactivating mutations of the CASPASE-7 gene might lead to the loss of its apoptotic function and contribute to the pathogenesis of some human solid cancers."

The groove is lined with amino acids that have been implicated in mediating the interaction with hyaluronan, including two tyrosine residues that appear to form essential intermolecular hydrogen bonds and two basic residues capable of supporting ionic interactions. This is the first structure of a non-enzymic hyaladherin in its active state, and identifies a ligand-induced conformational change that is likely to be conserved across the Link module superfamily. NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with defined oligosaccharides have allowed us to infer the minimum length of hyaluronan that can be accommodated within the binding site and its polarity in the groove; these data have been used to generate a model of the complex formed between the Link module and a hyaluronan octasaccharide.

NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with defined oligosaccharides have allowed us to infer the minimum length of hyaluronan that can be accommodated within the binding site and its polarity in the groove; these data have been used to generate a model of the complex formed between the Link module and a hyaluronan octasaccharide.

Alterations in the metabolism and localization of this molecule underlie the progression of many diseases, for instance arthritis, pulmonary/vascular disorders, and cancer (5.Siegelman M.H.

These diverse biological activities may seem surprising for a linear polymer composed entirely of a repeating disaccharide (i.e. -glucuronic acid-β-1,3-N-acetylglucosamine-β-1,4-; up to 107 Da) that, unlike other glycosaminoglycans, is neither attached to a core protein nor sulfated. This functional complexity is thought to arise from the interaction of HA with a large number of specific HA-binding proteins (7.Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which can form structurally diverse complexes (see Ref. 8.Day A.J. Sheehan J.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The majority of these “hyaladherins” belong to a superfamily of proteins that share a common ∼100 amino acid domain, termed a Link module, that mediates the interaction with HA.Previously we have determined the solution structure of the Link module from human TSG-6 (the protein product of the tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (9.Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)), thereby defining the consensus fold for this superfamily (10.Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In TSG-6, a 35-kDa secreted protein composed mainly of contiguous Link and CUB modules, the Link module is sufficient to mediate a high affinity interaction with HA (10.Kohda D. Morton C.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The HA receptor CD44, which has an important role in mediating lymphocyte migration, however, requires N- and C-terminal extensions to its Link module for correct folding and functional activity of its type B interaction domain. Most other members of the superfamily, such as link proteins and chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans (critical for extracellular matrix organization; see Ref. 12.Spicer A.P. Joo A. Bowling Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21083-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), have larger HA-binding domains containing two tandem Link modules (7.Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J.

Day A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), e.g. in the joint tissues of arthritis patients (14.Wisniewski H.G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L.

These studies suggest that TSG-6 is an endogenous component of a negative feedback loop capable of down-regulating the inflammatory response (13.Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TSG-6 is also expressed in inflammation-like processes such as ovulation (20.Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J.

Thermodynamic studies of the interaction between Link_TSG6 and defined oligomers of HA by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicated that an octasaccharide (HA8) was close to the minimum length that bound optimally to the protein (11.Kahmann J.D. O'Brien R. Werner J.M. Heinegård D. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy on Link_TSG6, in the absence and presence of HA8 (11.Kahmann J.D. O'Brien R. Werner J.M. Heinegård D. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis (22.Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been used to identify the position of the HA-binding site. However, to date it has only been possible to map these data on the structure of the free Link module (10.Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), which does not provide a clear picture of how HA is recognized by the protein.Here we have determined the structure of the TSG-6 Link module in its HA8-bound conformation. This has revealed a well defined HA-binding groove containing all the amino acids implicated previously in binding. Comparison with a de novo calculated structure of the free protein demonstrates that a small but significant ligand-induced conformational change occurs on interaction with HA, switching the Link module from a closed to an open state. The minimum length of HA that can be accommodated within the binding site and its polarity in the groove have been identified. These structural studies provide valuable new insights into the function of TSG-6 and the Link module superfamily in general.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—Unlabeled and uniformly 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled Link_TSG6 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (see Ref. 11.Kahmann J.D. O'Brien R. Werner J.M. Heinegård D. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HA oligosaccharides of defined length (including HA5 and HA7 which have GlcUA at either end) were purified from high molecular weight HA (unlabeled or 15N-enriched) following digestion with testicular hyaluronidase as before (23.Mahoney D.J. Aplin R.T. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Uniformly labeled 15N-HA polysaccharide was produced by fermentation (3 days at 30 °C) of E. coli K5 transfected with recombinant HA synthase from Pasteurella multocida (24.DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in M9 minimal media with 15NH4Cl (>99 atom %; Spectra Stable Isotopes) as the nitrogen source. The polymer in the media was purified by cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation, DNase/RNase treatment, chloroform extraction, and reverse phase extraction as described previously (25.DeAngelis P.L. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Mao W.J. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NMR samples were prepared from lyophilized material reconstituted in 10% (v/v) D2O, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 (or 99.98 atom % D2O) and adjusted to pH 6.0; oligosaccharides or protein were added, as required, to a 1:1 stoichiometry (unless stated otherwise).NMR Data Collection—All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on spectrometers operating at 500, 600, or 750 MHz. Assignment used the spectra recorded previously (1H,15N-HSQC, HCCH-TOCSY, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and CBCA(CO)NH; see Ref. 11.Kahmann J.D. O'Brien R. Werner J.M. Heinegård D. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) supplemented with HNCO, C(CO)NH, HC(CO)NH and 26 and 13 ms constant time 1H,13CHSQC spectra of the aromatic region, acquired on the same samples (i.e. 2.8 mm13C,15N-Link_TSG6, 2 mm13C,15N-Link_TSG6/HA8). Two-dimensional 1H,1H-TOCSY spectra were recorded on 1 mm samples in D2O at 750 MHz (mixing time of 46 ms). The nitrogen carrier frequency was routinely set to 119.0 ppm.NOESY data sets were recorded on samples of free and HA8-bound Link_TSG6. 1H,15N-NOESY-HSQC (600 MHz; with an NOE mixing time of 60 ms) and 1H,15N-HSQC-NOESY-HSQC (750 MHz; 70 ms mixing time) spectra were acquired on samples of 2 mm15N-Link_TSG6 (with and without HA8). 1H,13C-NOESY-HSQC data sets were recorded at 600 MHz on the 13C,15N-labeled samples described above, and 1H,1HNOESY spectra were collected at 750 MHz on the 15N-labeled samples (2 mm in water or 1 mm in D2O) with mixing times of 80 ms. The observation of amide exchange was performed at 500 MHz on 0.4 mm15N-Link_TSG6 samples (±HA8; buffered with 2 mm MES, pH 6.75) with 1H,15N-HSQC experiments recorded at 105-min intervals after the addition of D2O to the lyophilized material.1H,15N-HSQC spectra were recorded (500 MHz) on 15N-Link_TSG6 in the absence and presence of equimolar concentrations of HA oligosaccharides (HA6,HA7,HA8, and HA10 at1mm;HA4 and HA5 at 0.4 mm because of limiting amounts of sugar). A data set with HA4 at a 10:1 ratio was recorded, and a comparison of the chemical shift perturbations from four resonances in fast exchange at the 1:1 and 10:1 ratios was used to estimate the Kb; the majority of resonances are in slow exchange in the Link_TSG6-HA4 complex, whereas all resonances are in slow exchange with the longer oligomers. This estimate is based on the assumption that in the latter case (10:1 ratio) all the protein was in the complexed state and that only one HA4 can bind per Link_TSG6. 1H,15N-HSQC experiments with 15N-labeled oligomers (15N-HA6 0.6 mm, 15N-HA8 0.3 mm) were performed (with 15N offset at 122.5 ppm) in the absence and presence of unlabeled protein (1:1 stoichiometry).Data Processing and Structure Calculations—Data were processed using FELIX 2.3 (Biosym Inc.) and referenced and analyzed with XEasy as described previously (11.Kahmann J.D. O'Brien R. Werner J.M. Heinegård D. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). NOE intensities for each data set were calibrated using interproton distances in regions of secondary structure and converted into three distance restraint categories with limits of 2.7, 3.5, and 5.0 Å. These restraints, with 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shift values, were used in the program CNS version 0.9 in the ab initio-simulated annealing protocol described previously (26.Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); H-bonds were included as two restraints toward the end of the structure calculations. A total of 250 structures was calculated for both the free and HA8-bound Link_TSG6 by using identical protocols, and in each case the 30 with the lowest energy were refined using an additional cycle of simulated annealing, followed by extensive restrained energy minimization. The resulting 20 lowest energy structures were deposited at the Protein Data Bank with accession codes of 1o7b and 1o7c for free and HA8-bound Link_TSG6, respectively. Figures were prepared using MOLMOL, POV-Ray, and RASMOL.Model Building—Molecular modeling calculations were performed using CHARMm version 28b2 (27.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13840) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the lowest energy protein structure (in its HA8-bound conformation) were fixed throughout the docking simulation; Arg81 was replaced by an Ala residue because its side chain was not particularly well defined in the family and may have caused steric interference with ligand insertion. An HA8 molecule was built into the binding groove based on the inferred polarity and register (see below). Energy minimization of the HA8 molecule was performed on the basis of van der Waals contacts and internal energies calculated from the force field to obtain the final model. The glycosidic bond angles for the 8-mer were close to those predicted for free HA (28.Almond A. Brass A. Sheehan J.K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 5634-5640Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The interactions between Link_TSG6 and HA oligomers of different lengths were investigated on a Microcal VP-ITC instrument at 25 °C in 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, as described previously (19.Getting S.J. Mahoney D.J. Cao T. Rugg M.S. Fries E. Milner C.M. Perretti M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 51068-51076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22.Mahoney D.J.

Oligosaccharide solutions (ranging from 180 to 870 μm, determined on the basis of the accurately determined protein concentration and known stoichiometry as described previously (11.Kahmann J.D. O'Brien R. Werner J.M. Heinegård D. Ladbury J.E. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) were added in 5-μl injections (28 in total) to protein (ranging from 10.0 to 58.6 μm). Data were fitted to a one-site model by nonlinear least squares regression with the Origin software package, after subtracting the heats resulting from the addition of oligosaccharide into buffer alone. Affinities for the interaction with HA6 and HA8 were determined by averaging results from 5 or 10 experiments, respectively, whereas all other sugars were analyzed at least twice.RESULTSResonance Assignments and Structure Determination—Assignments were determined for nearly all 1H, 15N, and 13C nuclei in both free and HA8-bound Link_TSG6 (1H, 98.8 and 100%; 15N, 98.2 and 100%; 13C (backbone/aliphatic), 98.4 and 100%; 13C (aromatic), 79.7 and 79.7%, respectively, excluding the fast exchanging nuclei). Slowly exchanging hydroxyl protons were identified on Tyr12, Tyr78, and Tyr91 in the complex and on Thr32 in both free and bound structures. Two sets of signals were found for residues 61–63 (which may arise from cis-trans-isomerization of Pro60 or Pro64) and 95–98 (C-terminal tail) in both free and bound protein. These minor conformations (which correspond to less than ∼25% of the total populations) were not included in the structure calculations.Solution structures of Link_TSG6 in both its free and HA8-bound states were generated completely independently using NOE restraints, 13Cα/13Cβ chemical shifts, and H-bonds identified on the basis of hydrogen exchange data (Fig. 1 and Table I). As can be seen from Fig. 2 (and Table I) the lowest energy structure families are well defined, with backbone r.m.s.d. values over amino acids 2–94 (i.e. excluding N- and C-terminal “tails”) of 0.49 and 0.53 Å for free and HA8-bound protein, respectively.Table IExperimental restraints and structural statistics for families of 20 structuresFreeComplexedTotal no. restraints NOEsIntraresidual {[i — j] < 1}467506Sequential {[i — j] = 1}354391Short range {1 < [i — j] ≤ 4}175195Long range {[i — j] > 4}328353Total13241445 H-bonds3234 Cα chemical shifts (of 96)9596 Cβ chemical shifts (of 84)8283R.m.s. deviations from experimental dataaNone of the 20 free or 20 HA8-bound structures showed distance restraint violations of >0.3 Å and no distance restraint was consistently violated by >0.1 Å All NOE restraints0.014 ± 0.001 Å0.013 ± 0.001 Å Intraresidual {[i — j] < 1}0.016 ± 0.004 Å0.015 ± 0.002 Å Sequential {[i — j] = 1}0.014 ± 0.002 Å0.014 ± 0.002 Å Short range {1 < [i — j] ≤ 4}0.012 ± 0.001 Å0.012 ± 0.002 Å Long range {[i — j] > 4}0.011 ± 0.002 Å0.011 ± 0.002 Å H-bonds0.009 ± 0.003 Å0.008 ± 0.001 ÅR.m.s.d. ideal covalent geometry Bonds0.0013 ± 0.0001 Å0.0013 ± 0.0001 Å Angles0.264 ± 0.006 Å0.273 ± 0.005 ÅRamachandran analysisbProlines, glycines, and terminal residues are excluded Residues in favored regions62.2%65.3% Residues in additional allowed regions34.6%32.2% Residues in generously allowed regions3.2%2.3% Residues in disallowed regions0%0.2%Co-ordinate precisioncCo-ordinate r.m.s.d. were calculated following best fit superposition over the defined atoms All atoms1.22 ± 0.15 Å1.21 ± 0.15 Å All heavy atoms0.98 ± 0.15 Å0.98 ± 0.18 Å Heavy atoms, residues 2-940.93 ± 0.16 Å0.92 ± 0.12 Å Heavy atoms, 2° structuredResidues of the two β-sheets (SI and SII) and two α-helices, as defined in text0.59 ± 0.09 Å0.63 ± 0.09 Å Entire backbone (N, Cα, C)0.53 ± 0.12 Å0.60 ± 0.21 Å Backbone, residues 2-940.49 ± 0.12 Å0.53 ± 0.16 Å Backbone, 2° structuredResidues of the two β-sheets (SI and SII) and two α-helices, as defined in text0.25 ± 0.06 Å0.31 ± 0.04 Åa None of the 20 free or 20 HA8-bound structures showed distance restraint violations of >0.3 Å and no distance restraint was consistently violated by >0.1 Åb Prolines, glycines, and terminal residues are excludedc Co-ordinate r.m.s.d. were calculated following best fit superposition over the defined atomsd Residues of the two β-sheets (SI and SII) and two α-helices, as defined in text Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Solution structures of the TSG-6 Link module in its free (A and B) and HA8-bound states (C and D).A and C, stereoviews of backbone traces for the family of 20 structures superimposed on the backbone heavy atoms in the secondary structure elements.

Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This, in conjunction with the additional 13C chemical shift assignments and hydrogen-exchange data, has enabled the determination of a much more accurate structure for free Link_TSG6. It should be noted that whereas the newly determined structure has a very similar fold to that described in Ref. 10.Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, there is considerably improved reliability in the definition of secondary structure elements (predicted previously on the basis of NOE connectivities alone), loop geometry, and side chain orientations.The Link module fold, which is identical in both free and HA8-bound forms of Link_TSG6 determined here (see Fig. 2, B and D), is composed of two triple-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets (SI (β1, β2, and β6) and SII (β3, β4, and β5)) and two α-helices (α1 and α2); disulfide bridges connect α1to β6 (Cys23–Cys92) and the irregular loop following α2 to the long loop between β4 and β5 (Cys47–Cys68). As can be seen from Fig. 3 the SI β-sheet and α1-helix are identical to those described before (10.Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J.

There are, however, subtle differences in the definition of the SII sheet (i.e. β3, β4, and β5 correspond to residues 49–52, 56–61, and 74–77, respectively, rather than 49–51, 56–60, and 75–81 (with a bulge at 77–79) reported previously (10.Kohda D.

In addition, the α2-helix was incorrectly orientated in our original structure and corresponds to residues 33–42 (instead of 36–41); slowly exchanging amides support the presence of caps at both N (Thr32–Gln35) and C termini (Schellman motif (29.Aurora R. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Science. 1994; 264: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), Gly43). The proposed N-cap on α1 (Thr15–Glu18 (10.Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H.

Consistent with this, these three cap motifs are highly conserved across the Link module superfamily, whereas an α1 Schellman motif is not (see Fig. 3). Slowly exchanging amide protons were also observed for Trp88 and Leu14, which H-bond to each other in an antiparallel arrangement. Leu14 packs behind β1 and against the side of the α2-helix; a large hydrophobic residue is conserved at this position across the Link module superfamily (Fig. 3). These interactions orientate the β1/α1 loop (which contains the HA-binding residues Lys11 and Tyr12 (22.Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. J. Biol.

Enediynes are among the most potent naturally occurring antibiotics, yet the mechanism of resistance to these toxins has remained a mystery. We characterize an enediyne self-resistance protein that reveals a self-sacrificing paradigm for resistance to highly reactive antibiotics, and thus another opportunity for nonpathogenic or pathogenic bacteria to evade extremely potent small molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2025534438,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in diverse processes such as inflammation, carcinogenesis and apoptosis. As COX-2 inhibitors interfere with these processes, inhibition of COX-2 has been suggested as a promising anticancer treatment. However, the role of COX-2 in modulation of apoptosis as well as the death pathways affected by COX-2 inhibitors are poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that the selective COX-2 inhibitors NS-398 and nimesulide increased TNF sensitivity of TNF-resistant HeLa H21 and TNF-sensitive HeLa D98 cells, although this cytokine induced significant COX-2 activity, as judged by prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production, only in H21 cells. TNF did also not induce PGE(2) production in MCF-7/casp-3 cells stably expressing COX-2; however, nimesulide strongly enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, COX-2 activity in HeLa H21 cells could be inhibited by NS-398 concentrations that were 10 000-fold lower compared to those required for the induction of cell death. Most intriguingly, sensibilization to apoptosis was specifically observed in response to activation of death receptors. Not only TNF-induced cell death but also apoptosis triggered by the CD95 and TRAIL receptors was enhanced by nimesulide. In contrast, apoptosis induced by the anticancer drugs doxorubicine and etoposide that target the mitochondrial death pathway remained unaffected. Together, our data suggest that COX-2 inhibitors overcome apoptosis resistance and selectively sensitize tumor cells to the extrinsic death receptor-induced apoptotic pathway independently of COX-2."
https://openalex.org/W2079373259,"Simple metapopulation models with random disturbances are used in species conservation or management, relying on the condition for persistence that the per-patch colonization rate be greater than the per-patch extinction rate. For a general model incorporating the role of succession or patch age–dependent extinction, I show that persistence requires the per-patch colonization rate to be greater than the inverse of mean patch age, where age is the time since the patch became available for colonization. Because mean patch age can be arbitrarily large relative to the extinction rate, currently persisting metapopulations may be persisting despite small colonization rates, and management approaches that do not consider the role of mean patch age may unnecessarily doom populations to extinction."

The cell adhesion molecules caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin play a crucial role in the generation of functional septate-like junctions at paranodes. We have previously demonstrated that association with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked F3/contactin is required for the recruitment of caspr/paranodin into the lipid rafts and its targeting to the cell surface. When transfected alone in neuroblastoma N2a cells, caspr/paranodin is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using chimerical constructs, we show that the cytoplasmic region does not contain any ER retention signal, whereas the ectodomain plays a crucial role in caspr/paranodin trafficking. A series of truncations encompassing the extracellular region of caspr/paranodin was unable to abolish ER retention. We show that N-glycosylation and quality control by the lectin-chaperone calnexin are required for the cell surface delivery of caspr/paranodin. Cell surface transport of F3/contactin and caspr/paranodin is insensitive to brefeldin A and the two glycoproteins are endoglycosidase H-sensitive when associated in complex, recruited into the lipid rafts, and expressed on the cell surface.

Myelination is of key importance in vertebrates, ensuring rapid saltatory conduction of nerve impulses. The nodes of Ranvier that contain high density of voltage-gated sodium channels are flanked by the paranodes where the terminal loops of myelinating glial cells are sealed to the axonal membrane through septate-like junctions. The juxta-paranodal regions highly enriched in potassium channels are bordering the paranodes. Contacts with myelinating glial cells generate specialized axonal domains in the region of the nodes of Ranvier, with highly specific composition in ion channels, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), 1The abbreviations used are: CAMcell adhesion moleculecasprcontactin-associated proteinEGFepidermal growth factorERendoplasmic reticulumEndo Hendoglycosidase HGFPgreen fluorescent proteinaaamino acid(s)CHOChinese hamster ovaryDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyPNGase FN-glycosidase F. and cytoskeletal linker protein (1Arroyo E.J.

Caspr/paranodin is a transmembrane molecule of the neurexin superfamily with an ectodomain bearing a N-terminal discoidin domain, several laminin-G and EGF-like regions, and a fibrinogen central domain (12Menegoz M.

The intracellular region of caspr/paranodin contains a juxtamembrane region for the binding of FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) molecules, including 4.1B and schwannomin (14Gollan L.

A recent study shows that the extracellular region of caspr/paranodin is sufficient to direct it to paranodes in transgenic mice (14Gollan L. Sabanay H. Poliak S. Berglund S.R. Ranscht B. Peles E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the cytoplasmic domain is required for the stabilization of caspr/paranodin at the paranodal membrane most likely through the linkage with the cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1B. Deficiency in either caspr/paranodin or F3/contactin in the respective knockout mice results in the aberrant organization of the paranodal region, disruption of septate junctions, and reduction of nerve conduction velocity (17Bhat M.A. Rios J.C. Lu Y. Garcia-Fresco G.P. Ching W. Martin M.S. Li J. Einheber S. Chesler M. Rosenbluth J. Salzer J.L. Bellen H.J.

The fence function of septate junctions has been well evidenced from the mutant phenotype, because their disruption results in the lateral shift of the potassium channels that are mislocalized at paranodes instead of juxtaparanodes. In addition, mutant analyses show that caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin are interdependent for their paranodal distribution. Interestingly, two distinct forms of F3/contactin are expressed at the nodes and paranodes, respectively, which differ in their N-glycan content (4Rios J.C. Melendez-Vasquez C.V. Einheber S. Lustig M. Grumet M. Hemperly J. Peles E. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8354-8364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In caspr/paranodin-deficient mice, F3/contactin is not found at paranodes, but is enriched in the nodal region (17Bhat M.A. Rios J.C. Lu Y. Garcia-Fresco G.P. Ching W. Martin M.S. Li J. Einheber S.

Caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin assemble early during biosynthesis in the ER and this association is required for an efficient targeting of caspr/paranodin to the surface of transfected cells (19Faivre-Sarrailh C. Gauthier F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Le Bivic A. Rougon G. Girault J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In agreement with the in vitro analysis, caspr/paranodin expression is restricted to the neuronal cell bodies and not addressed to the axolemma in F3/contactin-deficient mice (18Boyle M.E. Berglund E.O. Murai K.K. Weber L. Peles E. Ranscht B. Neuron. 2001; 30: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms involved in caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin trafficking to the cell surface. The intracellular transport of glycoproteins from the ER to the cell surface is a tightly controlled process that allows quality control, regulation of subunit assembly, and sorting of proteins to specific destinations. Different mechanisms such as masking and unmasking of retention signal, association with ER chaperones, or thiol-mediated retention have been described (20Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Google Scholar). In addition, it is now well known that N-linked glycans play a pivotal role in protein folding, quality control, sorting, and transport of glycoproteins (21Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 22Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 23Roth J. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 285-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Here we show that caspr/paranodin cell surface targeting depends on N-glycosylation and on quality control by the lectin-chaperone calnexin. In addition, we present evidence that the complex of caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin reaches the plasma membrane with high-mannose type N-glycans, via an unconventional pathway insensitive to brefeldin A, as recently described for CD45 (24Baldwin T.A. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50333-50340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or for the flottilin-1/reggie-2 raft component (25Morrow I.C. Rea S. Martin S.

Our data indicate that F3/contactin traffics to the cell surface via two distinct routes, one involving the Golgi complex, resulting in endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-resistant carbohydrate processing, and the other independent of the Golgi, resulting in the maintenance of Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate when associated with caspr/paranodin on the cell surface. Antibodies—We used a rabbit antiserum prepared against the F3/contactin Ig-like domains and designated 24 for immunofluorescence staining (26Gennarini G. Durbec P. Boned A. Rougon G. Goridis C. Neuron. 1991; 6: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and a rabbit antiserum directed against amino acids (aa) 37–50 of F3/contactin for immunoblotting (27Rigato F. Garwood J. Calco V. Heck N. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Faissner A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6596-6609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum SL51, which was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing residues 1303–1380 of caspr/paranodin, reacted with epitopes in its intracellular region (12Menegoz M.

The anti-caspr2 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the intracellular region (residues 1284–1331) fused to glutathione S-transferase. Human CD4 cDNA and mouse anti-CD4 mAb were donated by J. Mérot (Centre d'Etude Atomique, Saclay, France), mouse anti-GFP mAb was purchased from Roche Diagnostics, rabbit anti-calnexin antiserum was from StressGen Biotechnologies. Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Peroxidase- and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cloning Strategies—The DNA construct pRc-CMV/F3 encoding the full-length sequence of F3/contactin was previously described (28Durbec P. Gennarini G. Buttiglione M. Gomez S. Rougon G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The full-length sequence of caspr/paranodin subcloned into the pBK-CMV2 expression vector (pBK-CMV2-pnd) was described in Menegoz et al. (12Menegoz M. Gaspar P. Le Bert M. Galvez T. Burgaya F. Palfrey C. Ezan P. Arnos F. Girault J.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 319-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The human caspr2 cDNA was introduced into the KpnI/NotI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The caspr/paranodin-GFP (pnd-GFP) chimera was generated by PCR amplification with the High Fidelity polymerase (Roche) of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of caspr/paranodin (aa 1–1297) using the forward primer, TAAGAATTCATGATGAGTCTCCGGCTTTTC, and reverse primer, TTAGAATTCGCAGATAGAAGAGCACCAGCAT, and insertion into the EcoRI cloning site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The CD4-caspr/paranodin (CD4-pnd) chimera was generated by PCR amplification of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD4 (forward primer: ATCTGAGATATGATTTCTGTGGGCTCAGGTCC and reverse primer: GGTGTGATAGGAGCCCTTGTATCGATGATTCCTGACACAGAAGAAGATGC) and by PCR amplification of the complete cytoplasmic region of caspr/paranodin using forward primer, AATCATCGATACAAGGGCTCC, and reverse primer, CACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTA, and insertion at NdeI-XbaI into pBK-CMV2-pnd. Constructs with truncation in the extracellular region were generated by PCR amplification and NdeI-BstEII insertion (for pnd-Δ1, pnd-Δ2, and pnd-Δ3) or BstEII-XbaI insertion (for pnd-Δ4 and pnd-Δ5) in pBK-CMV2-pnd. Pnd-Δ1 was truncated in the N-terminal region from the discoidin to the fibrinogen domain (aa 28–781), pnd-Δ2 was deleted from the first laminin-G to the fibrinogen domain (aa 186–781), pnd-Δ3 from the first EGF-like to the fibrinogen domain (aa 532–781), pnd-Δ4 from the third laminin-G domain to the juxtamembrane region (aa 781–1277), and pnd-Δ5 from the third laminin-G to the PGY domain (aa 781–1097). The PCR amplified products were verified by sequencing (Genome express). Cell Culture—CHO, COS-7, and neuroblastoma N2a cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS. CHO cell lines stably transfected with caspr/paranodin or with F3/contactin, or coexpressing caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin were previously described (19Faivre-Sarrailh C. Gauthier F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Le Bivic A. Rougon G. Girault J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). COS-7 and N2a cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Single or double transfected N2a cells were cultured for 18 h in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) before treatment with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma), or 1 mm castanospermine (Sigma) during an additional period of 24 h. Immunoprecipitation, Endoglycosidase Treatments, and Cell Surface Biotinylation—Transfected COS-7, N2a, and CHO cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2 and protease inhibitors, centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. After preclearing for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose, supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose coated with SL51 antibody (3 μl), anti-GFP antibody (3 μl), or anti-caspr2 antibody (3 μl). The beads were washed twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, twice in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl and twice in 50 mm Tris. Immune precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspr/paranodin, anti-F3/contactin, anti-GFP, anti-caspr2, or anti-calnexin. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Roche). Low density Triton X-100-insoluble lipid rafts were isolated as previously described from double transfected CHO cells (19Faivre-Sarrailh C. Gauthier F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Le Bivic A. Rougon G. Girault J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CHO or N2a cell lysates and lipid raft fractions were adjusted to 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% SDS, incubated with 3 milliunits of Endo H (Roche) or 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Roche) for 3 h at 37 °C, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspr/paranodin or anti-F3/contactin. Double transfected CHO cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS at 4 °C and then biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 9, 140 mm NaCl for 20 min at 4 °C. After two washes in PBS at 4 °C, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and proteases inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation of caspr/paranodin was carried out as described above, and elution was performed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and proteases inhibitors. The immune precipitates were treated with 3 milliunits of Endo H for 3 h at 37 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspr/paranodin antibody or peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Metabolic Labeling—Double transfected CHO cells were treated with 5 mm sodium butyrate during 18 h, incubated in Opti-MEM with or without 2 μg/ml tunicamycin for 2 h and then pulsed with 10 μCi/ml [35S]Met + Cys (Expre35S35S-label, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h in DMEM without cysteine and methionine, supplemented with 10% FCS. After washing twice with PBS, cells were chased in DMEM, 10% FCS, for 2, 6, and 16 h. Immunoprecipitation with anti-paranodin antibody and SDS-PAGE analysis were performed as described above. The radioactivity was digitalized and quantified using a Molecular Imager GS363 (Bio-Rad). Brain Extracts—Rat brain was homogenized in a buffer (6 ml/g) containing 50 mm Tris, 3 mm MgCl2, 320 mm sucrose, and proteases inhibitors, using a Heidolph homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The pellet was extracted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and proteases inhibitors. Samples were then treated with 3 milliunits of Endo H for 3 h at 37 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-paranodin and anti-F3/contactin antibodies. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—N2a cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with different constructs. For visualization of CD4-pnd, N2a-transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with methanol for 10 min at -20 °C, rehydrated in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with anti-CD4 mAb and SL51 antibody diluted 1:750 and 1:3000, respectively, in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The cells were rinsed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. After washing in PBS, cells were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) and viewed on a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. Expression of caspr2-, caspr/paranodin-, and caspr/paranodin-deleted constructs were visualized on N2a-transfected cells after fixation with methanol for 10 min at -20 °C, and immunofluorescence staining with SL51 or anti-caspr2 (1:2000) antibody. Pnd-GFP was detected by immunofluorescence staining with anti-GFP (1:250) in cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. In clustering experiments, live N2a cells were first incubated with anti-F3/contactin 24 antibody diluted 1:50 in DMEM, 10% FCS for 1 h at 4 °C, washed in DMEM, 10% FCS, incubated with secondary antibody in DMEM, 10% FCS for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in DMEM, 10% FCS. Cells were fixed with 5% acetic acid in 95% ethanol for 1 min at -20 °C and processed for anti-GFP immunostaining. The Cytoplasmic Region of Caspr/Paranodin Does Not Confer ER Retention—Caspr/paranodin is blocked in the ER when transfected alone in neuroblastoma N2a cells, whereas it is efficiently targeted to the cell surface when co-transfected with F3/contactin (19Faivre-Sarrailh C. Gauthier F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Le Bivic A. Rougon G. Girault J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the cytoplasmic region of caspr/paranodin does not appear to contain any consensus sequence for ER retention, such as the dibasic motifs operating in ER resident molecules (29Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We tested whether the cytoplasmic region of caspr/paranodin is able to confer ER retention to the transmembrane reporter CD4, a T-cell surface protein. A CD4-pnd chimera was engineered by fusing the cytoplasmic region of caspr/paranodin to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD4 (Fig. 1). The CD4-pnd chimera was transfected in N2a cells. Double immunostaining with anti-CD4 mAb and an antiserum directed against the intracellular region of caspr/paranodin (SL51) shows that CD4-pnd is highly expressed at the cell surface and not detected in intracellular compartments (Fig. 2). This result indicates that the intracellular region of caspr/paranodin does not confer ER retention.Fig. 2The cytoplasmic region of caspr/paranodin does not induce ER retention. N2a cells were transiently transfected with truncated CD4 (A) or with CD4-pnd (B–D). A shows immunofluorescence staining of truncated CD4 with anti-CD4 mAb. B–D shows the double immunofluorescence staining of the CD4-pnd chimera with anti-CD4 mAb (B) and a rabbit anti-paranodin antiserum directed against the intracytoplasmic domain (C) and overlay (D). Truncated CD4 is expressed at the cell surface (A). Double immunofluorescence staining for CD4-pnd shows that the chimera is strongly expressed at the cell surface with no ER retention (B–D).

Bar, 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Ectodomain Plays a Crucial Role in Caspr/Paranodin Trafficking to the Cell Surface—The role of the extracellular region of caspr/paranodin was then evaluated. We first generated a pnd-GFP chimera by fusing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of caspr/paranodin with GFP as a cytoplasmic tail, using the pEGFP-N1 vector (Fig. 1). Caspr/paranodin and pnd-GFP were both retained in the ER when transfected alone in N2a cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, both proteins were strongly expressed on the cell surface when co-transfected with F3/contactin (Fig. 3, C and D). F3/contactin is expressed as a doublet of 142 and 135 kDa in transfected N2a cells. Using immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP mAb and immunoblot for F3/contactin, we further demonstrated that pnd-GFP, like native caspr/paranodin, interacted with the 135-kDa form of F3/contactin (Fig. 3E). These data show that the extracellular region is necessary and sufficient for ER retention of caspr/paranodin and for the F3/contactin-mediated export to the cell surface. As a second step, we generated constructs with large deletions all along the ectodomain of caspr/paranodin to map the domains implicated in ER retention and/or in F3/contactin binding (Fig. 1). To minimize conformational alterations, the different constructs were designed with deletion sites at the border between structural modules. The deleted constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 extracts with an anti-paranodin antibody directed against the cytoplasmic region. All the constructs were detected on immunoblots at the expected molecular weight (Fig. 4A). The immune precipitates from double transfected cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-F3/contactin antibody. F3/contactin was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with caspr/paranodin in control experiments, whereas it was not precipitated with any of the deleted constructs (Fig. 4B). Then, we investigated the consequence of the various truncations on caspr/paranodin trafficking in transfected N2a cells. Confocal analysis indicates that all the deleted constructs are distributed in the ER, without any cell surface expression (Fig. 4, D–H). N2a cells were co-transfected with F3/contactin and each of the deleted constructs. All types of deletion abolished the interaction with F3/contactin, and as a consequence, prevented F3/contactin-mediated cell surface targeting of the different constructs (not shown). The pnd-Δ1 and pnd-Δ4 constructs comprised deletions of the N- or C-terminal half of the ectodomain, respectively. These two constructs were retained in the ER indicating that caspr/paranodin does not contain an ER retention motif corresponding to a single sequence of amino acids, and may contain several motifs of retention. Alternatively, a conformational control of ER export may be mediated by the binding of F3/contactin onto the ectodomain of caspr/paranodin. Half-life and Cell Surface Delivery of Caspr/Paranodin Depend on N-Glycosylations—N-Linked oligosaccharides play a significant role in trafficking, folding, and sorting of membrane proteins (20Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Google Scholar). For example, N-linked glycosylation increases the stability and cell surface expression of the Shaker potassium channel in mammalians cells (30Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the slowed surface delivery of unglycosylated mutant Shaker is at least partially because of slowed export from the ER (31de Souza N.F. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11351-11361Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible role of N-glycans in caspr/paranodin transport to the cell surface. N2a cells were transiently transfected with pnd-GFP alone or in association with F3/contactin. 18 h after transfection, cells were treated during 24 h with tunicamycin, an antibiotic that specifically prevents the early step of N-glycosylations (21Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin treatment prevented the cell surface expression of pnd-GFP when co-transfected with F3/contactin in N2a cells (Fig. 5C). In double transfected N2a cells, co-clustering experiments were realized using anti-F3/contactin antibody-mediated cross-linking. In the absence of tunicamycin, pnd-GFP and F3/contactin were colocalized in clusters on the cell surface of the N2a cells (Fig. 5, D–F). In contrast, in the presence of tunicamycin, F3/contactin clusters were observed on the cell surface, whereas pnd-GFP was retained in the ER compartment (Fig. 5, G–I). It must be noted that the internal pool of F3/contactin cannot be visualized with antibody 24, which only recognizes F3/contactin by immunofluorescence on live cells. Next, we analyzed the tunicamycin effect on the N-glycan content of caspr/paranodin and F3/contactin in transfected N2a cell extracts using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5J (lanes 5 and 6), tunicamycin treatment prevented N-glycosylation of F3/contactin. In the absence of tunicamycin, a doublet of 135–142-kDa glycosylated F3/contactin was detected, whereas a single band of 130 kDa corresponding to the protein core was present after tunicamycin treatment. Unexpectedly, caspr/paranodin detected after tunicamycin treatment was still highly glycosylated (Fig. 5J, lanes 2 and 4). The deglycosylated protein core of F3/contactin expressed after tunicamycin treatment interacted with caspr/paranodin as demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5J, lane 7). Because we did not detect any deglycosylated form of caspr/paranodin at steady"

RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers of old and metal-poor populations. We measured the kinematics of 43 RR Lyrae stars in the inner regions of the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy. The velocity dispersion equals 53 ± 10 kilometers per second, which indicates that a kinematically hot metal-poor old halo also exists in the LMC. This result suggests that our galaxy and smaller late-type galaxies such as the LMC have similar early formation histories."
https://openalex.org/W1987046160,"The Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY) genes are essential for development of the mammalian gonads and mutations in these genes are associated with gonadal dysgenesis in humans. The SRY gene encodes a transcription factor with one high-mobility group (HMG) box as a DNA-binding domain. WT1 encodes a transcription factor that contains four contiguous C2H2-type zinc-finger motifs as a DNA/RNA binding or protein–protein interaction domain. Here we report that WT1 binds to and acts synergistically with SRY to activate transcription from a promoter containing SRY-binding sites. This interaction is mediated by the WT1 zinc-finger domain and the SRY HMG box. WT1 mutants associated with Denys–Drash syndrome (DDS), which is characterized by Wilms’ tumor, pseudohermaphroditism, and nephropathy, fail to interact with SRY. Wildtype WT1 is recruited to SRY-binding sites in an SRY-dependent manner, whereas DDS mutants are not recruited as efficiently. These results suggest that WT1 forms a complex with SRY to regulate transcription and that this WT1-SRY interaction is important in testis development."

PLB is a small protein inhibitor of SERCA2a that reduces enzyme affinity for Ca2+ and thereby regulates cardiac contractility. We found that the PLB monomer with Asn27 or Asn30 changed to Cys (N27C-PLB or N30C-PLB) cross-linked to lysine of SERCA2a within seconds with ≥80% efficiency. Optimal cross-linking occurred at spacer chain lengths of 10 and 15 Å for N27C and N30C, respectively. The rapid time course of cross-linking indicated that neither dissociation of PLB pentamers nor binding of PLB monomers to SERCA2a was rate-limiting. Cross-linking occurred only to the E2 (Ca2+-free) conformation of SERCA2a, was strongly favored by nucleotide binding to this state, and was completely inhibited by thapsigargin. Protein sequencing in combination with mutagenesis identified of Lys328 of SERCA2a as the target of cross-linking. A three-dimensional map of interacting residues indicated that the cross-linking distances were entirely compatible with the 10-Å distance recently determined between N30C of PLB and Cys318 of SERCA2a. In contrast, Lys3 of PLB did not cross-link to any Lys (or Cys) of SERCA2a, suggesting that previous three-dimensional models that constrain Lys3 near residues 397–400 of thapsigargin-inhibited SERCA2a should be viewed with caution. Furthermore, although earlier models of PLB·SERCA2a are based on thapsigargin-bound SERCA, our results suggest that the nucleotide-bound, E2 conformation is substantially different and represents the key conformational state for interacting with PLB.

The alternative conformation induced by Ca2+, E1, does not appear to be capable of binding PLB (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol.

Zhang Z. Lewis D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By stabilizing SERCA2a in the E2 conformation, PLB slows the transition from E2 to E1 during the catalytic cycle (3Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus impeding overall Ca2+ transport (Fig. 1). Thus, the apparent reduction of Ca2+ affinity is a kinetic effect of PLB on conformational changes, not necessarily a direct effect on Ca2+ binding sites (3Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of SERCA1a, the skeletal muscle isoform of the Ca2+ pump, was determined, both in the E1 state with bound Ca2+ (14Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), and in the E2 state, bound with the irreversible inhibitor thapsigargin (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). These structures reveal a relatively complex molecule composed of ∼1000 amino acids, ten transmembrane helices, and three distinct cytoplasmic domains (16MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

Although no crystal structure of PLB has yet been reported, numerous biophysical methods have been used to study its structure (17Slovic A.M. Summa C.M. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of technical limitations of the various techniques, no consensus has yet been reached for the complete structure of PLB within biological membranes or, more particularly, in association with SERCA2a (1Simmerman H.K.B.

Biochemical work has demonstrated that the PLB pentamer is stabilized by a network of interdigitating Leu/Ile residues along one face of the transmembrane helix between residues 37 and 51 of each monomer (17Slovic A.M.

Point mutations along the opposite face of the transmembrane helix attenuated SERCA2a inhibition, and residues here were proposed to constitute an interaction site between the two molecules (9Kimura Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), although certain residues in the zipper domain now also appear to interact directly with SERCA2a (24Cornea R.L.

Amino acid substitutions within the cytoplasmic region of PLB (residues 1–31) also affected SERCA2a activity (23Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

In particular, replacement of Asn27 or Asn30 of PLB with Ala had no major effect on the equilibrium between PLB pentamers and monomers, but significantly enhanced inhibition of SERCA2a, suggesting that these two PLB residues are directly involved in the interaction with SERCA2a (18Young H.S.

Biophys. 1999; 372: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Finally, an interaction between the extreme N terminus of PLB and an exposed loop in the nucleotide domain of SERCA2a was suggested by chimeric constructs (27Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by early cross-linking studies (11James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To characterize further the interactions between the PLB monomer and SERCA2a at the molecular level, we initiated a series of studies using cross-linking agents as molecular rulers to measure distances between key amino acid residues of PLB and SERCA2a (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using the homobifunctional, thiol cross-linking agent BMH, we demonstrated a highly specific cross-link between Asn30 of PLB changed to cysteine (N30C-PLB) and Cys318 of SERCA2a at the cytoplasmic boundary of M4. The length of the cross-linking spacer chain suggested that these two residues are 10 Å apart. Cross-linking of PLB to SERCA2a occurred only in the absence of Ca2+ and was strikingly potentiated by ATP or ADP, providing strong physical evidence that monomeric PLB binds preferentially to the nucleotide-stabilized, E2 conformation of SERCA2a (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Significantly, the irreversible SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin completely prevented cross-linking of PLB to SERCA2a (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), supporting previous evidence that the E2-like conformation stabilized by thapsigargin is conformationally distinct from the native E2 conformation (28DeJesus F. Girardet J.L. Dupont Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Inesi G. Sagara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Here we report on the use of second generation cross-linking agents, which are heterobifunctional and provide additional constraints on the interaction and dynamics between PLB and SERCA2a. The new cross-linking agents contain a maleimide group at one end for coupling to Asn27 or Asn30 of PLB replaced with cysteine, and an NHS-ester group at the other end, for coupling to nearby lysine residues of WT-SERCA2a (30Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). We show that these heterobifunctional cross-linking agents work faster and even more efficiently than the homobifunctional agent, BMH, reported on previously (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nearly quantitative coupling between PLB and SERCA2a is achieved with heterobifunctional cross-linking agents. At the same time, the heterobifunctional cross-linkers remain highly specific, and react only with Lys328 of SERCA2a when attached to residues 27 and 30 of PLB, with optimal linker lengths of 10 and 15 Å, respectively. Materials—All of the cross-linking agents used were obtained from Pierce. The heterobifunctional cross-linkers were: N-(α-maleimidoacetoxy)succinimide ester (cross-linking distance 4.4 Å), N-(β-maleimidopropyloxy)succinimide ester (6.9 Å), N-(ϵ-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (EMCS; 9.4 Å), m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (9.9 Å), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (11.6 Å), succinimidyl-6-(β-maleimidopropionamido)hexanoate (14.3 Å), and N-(κ-maleimidoundecanoyloxy)sulfosuccinimide ester (KMUS; 15.7 Å). The homobifunctional cross-linking agent was 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH; 10.2 Å) (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin was purchased from Sigma. Iodogen was from Pierce. Endo-Asp-N and endo-Lys-C were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mutagenesis and Baculovirus Production—Point mutations in the cDNA encoding canine PLB were made as previously described (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB were expressed on Cys-less PLB background, which is canine PLB with Cys residues 36, 41, and 46 replaced by Ala (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Wild-type canine SERCA2a cDNA was mutated directly in the transfection vector pVL1393 using the QuikChange™ XL-Gold system (Stratagene) (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All cDNA mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Baculoviruses encoding mutated proteins were generated by co-transfecting into Sf21 insect cells mutated cDNAs in pVL1393 with BaculoGold™ (Pharmingen) linearized baculovirus DNA (7Jones L.R.

Protein Co-expression in Insect Cells and Isolation of Microsomes—Canine SERCA2a and N27C-PLB or N30C-PLB were co-expressed in Sf21 insect cells as described (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol.

Microsomes were harvested 60 h after initiating baculovirus infections and stored frozen in small aliquots at -40 °C at a protein concentration of 6–10 mg/ml. Protein assay and Ca2+-ATPase activities of microsomes were determined as previously described (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cross-linking—Cross-linking between single Cys residues of N27C-PLB or N30C-PLB and endogenous Lys residue(s) of WT-SERCA2a was conducted using the heterobifunctional cross-linking agents of increasing lengths listed under “Materials.” All heterobifunctional agents tested contained a maleimide group at one end for coupling to Cys residues and an NHS-ester group at the other end for coupling to Lys residues (30Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Cross-linking between PLB and SERCA2a was conducted essentially as recently described (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted with 11 μg of microsomal protein in 12 μl of buffer A, which contained 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA. Reactions were started by adding 0.75 μl of cross-linking agent from a 1.6 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 mm final cross-linker concentration) and stopped by adding 7.5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer containing 15% SDS plus 100 mm dithiothreitol. Heterobifunctional cross-linking was conducted for 10 min at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Homobifunctional cross-linking between Cys residues with 0.1 mm BMH was conducted for 1 h at room temperature (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After terminating the reactions, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To assess Ca2+ effects on cross-linking, ionized Ca2+ was varied by adding CaCl2 to buffer A (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In some experiments, ATP in buffer A was omitted or was replaced by other nucleotides, as indicated. To determine antibody effects on cross-linking, affinity-purified anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, or anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody, 2A7-A1, dialyzed in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7) and 150 mm NaCl, were used (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 5.5 μg of antibody were included with 11 μg of microsomal protein in buffer A. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed in 8% polyacrylamide, and immunoblots were probed with anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, to detect free and cross-linked forms of PLB (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 9, the immunoblot was also probed with anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody, 2A7-A1, to detect Ca2+ pumps not cross-linked to PLB (8Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Antibody-binding protein bands were visualized with 125I-protein A, except for the experiment depicted in Fig. 7, in which 125I-2D12 was used directly for PLB visualization (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), to avoid interference from antibodies carried over from the cross-linking reactions. Antibody-binding bands were quantified with a Bio-Rad Personal Fx phosphorimager.Fig. 7Monoclonal antibody effects on N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB cross-linking to WT-SERCA2a. 11 μg of microsomes co-expressing WT-SERCA2a and N27C-PLB or N30C-PLB were cross-linked in the absence (CON) or presence of 5.5 μg of anti-PLB monoclonal antibody (2D12) or anti-SERCA monoclonal antibody (2A7-A1) (top) as described in Fig. 5 legend. The immunoblot was probed with 125I-2D12. Only PLB/SERCA2a cross-linked bands are shown on the autoradiograph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of Cross-linked Lys Residue of SERCA2a—SERCA2a cross-linked to N27C-PLB with EMCS, or to N30C-PLB with KMUS, was purified to homogeneity from insect cell microsomes in separate runs by sequential anti-SERCA2a (2A7-A1) and anti-PLB (2D12) monoclonal affinity chromatographies, as recently described in detail (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each type of purified, cross-linked Ca2+ pump was then digested with endo-Asp-N and endo-Lys-C, and the limit SERCA2a fragment cross-linked to PLB was isolated by a second round of 2D12 chromatography and sequenced, as described (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By this analysis, the cross-linked amino acid of SERCA2a was restricted to just three potential Lys residues (see Fig. 8). Replacement-mutagenesis of Lys with Ala was then used to determine which of these three Lys residues was the one cross-linked to N27C-PLB and to N30C-PLB. Modeling—Coordinates for PLB residues 19–52 (42Lamberth S. Schmid H. Muenchback M. Vorherr T. Krebs E. Carafoli E. Griesinger C. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2000; 83: 2141-2152Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession code 1FJK) were manually docked to E2 coordinates of SERCA1a (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession code 1IWO) using cross-linking constraints as a guide. The model was then subjected to a round of energy minimization in XPLOR, with 1IWO held rigid, to eliminate any steric clashes. Phospholamban residues 27 and 30 were mutated to Cys using the DeepView Swiss-PdbViewer program. A search for optimal rotomers for PLB residues, Cys27 and Cys30, and SERCA residue, Lys328, was then performed using this program. The model was rendered using Pymol (W. L. DeLano, www.pymol.org). Specific Cross-linking of N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB to SERCA2a—We recently showed that N30C-PLB cross-links to Cys318 of native SERCA2a near M4 using the homobifunctional thiol cross-linking agent BMH (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we tested for cross-linking N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB to Lys residues of native SERCA2a using a series of heterobifunctional thiol to amine cross-linking agents of different lengths, spanning distances from 4 to 16 Å. N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB were expressed on the Cys-less PLB background, and were fully functional in their abilities to inhibit SERCA2a by lowering Ca2+ affinity (7Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB cross-linked strongly to wild-type SERCA2a in insect cell microsomes with use of heterobifunctional cross-linking agents. When immunoblots were probed with the anti-PLB antibody, 2D12, intense cross-linking signals were obtained at molecular masses of just over 100 kDa (PLB/SER), corresponding to heterodimers formed between PLB and SERCA2a. Some weaker homodimerization of PLB monomers was also detected (PLB2). 2We should point out that Cys-less PLB is predominately a pentamer in insect cell microsomal membranes, even though it mi"

https://openalex.org/W2090403252,"Mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) are characterized by their aggressive behavior and poor response to chemotherapy regimens. We report here evidence of increased in vitro radiation sensitivity in two cell lines that we have generated from two MCL patients (UPN1 and UPN2). However, despite their increased radiation sensitivity, UPN2 cells were totally resistant to apoptotic cell death, whereas UPN1 cells underwent massive apoptosis 6 h after irradiation. The frequency of induced chromosomal abnormalities was higher in UPN1 as compared to UPN2. Distinct mechanisms have been found to contribute to this phenotype: a major telomere shortening (UPN1 and UPN2), deletion of one ATM allele and a point mutation in the remaining allele in UPN2, mutation of p53 gene (UPN1 and UPN2) with absence of functional p53 as revealed by functional yeast assays. After irradiation, Ku70 levels in UPN1 increased and decreased in UPN2, whereas in the same conditions, DNA-PKcs protein levels decreased in UPN1 and remained unchanged in UPN2. Thus, irradiation-induced apoptotic cell death can occur despite the nonfunctional status of p53 (UPN1), suggesting activation of a unique pathway in MCL cells for the induction of this event. Overall, our study demonstrates that MCL cells show increased radiation sensitivity, which can be the result of distinct molecular events. These findings could clinically be exploited to increase the dismal response rates of MCL patients to the current chemotherapy regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2064510947,"The parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria tropica, the most prevailing parasitic disease worldwide, with 300-500 million infections and 1.5-2.7 million deaths/year. The emergence of strains resistant to drugs used for prophylaxis and treatment and no vaccine available makes the structural analysis of potential drug targets essential. For that reason, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure of the glutathione S-transferase from P. falciparum (Pf-GST1) in the apoform and in complex with its inhibitor S-hexyl-glutathione. The structures have been analyzed to 2.6 and 2.2 Å, respectively. Pf-GST1 shares several structural features with the Mu-type GSTs and is therefore closely related to this class, even though alignments with its members display low sequence identities in the range of 20-33%. Upon S-hexyl-glutathione binding, the overall structure and the glutathione-binding site (G-site) remain almost unchanged with the exception of the flexible C terminus. The detailed comparison of the parasitic enzyme with the human host Mu-class enzyme reveals that, although the overall structure is homologue, the shape of the hydrophobic binding pocket (H-site) differs substantially. In the human enzyme, it is shielded from one side by the large Mu-loop, whereas in Pf-GST1 the Mu-loop is truncated and the space to recognize and bind voluminous substrates is extended.

This structural feature can be exploited to support the design of specific and parasite-selective inhibitors. Sophisticated defense strategies have evolved in organisms that enable them to deal with a broad range of foreign and endogenously derived toxic compounds. These structurally diverse usually highly non-polar molecules are by definition not required for normal metabolic functions, and enzyme systems that catalyze the rapid conversion of these compounds have been developed. However, instead of converting these compounds to useful metabolites as described for a vast array of highly specific enzymes among a large number of bacteria, higher life forms have opted for elimination of toxic compounds rather than their utilization (1.Jakoby W.B. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20715-20718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, the pathways of detoxification can be divided into three phases. Phase I reactions consist of the so-called “functionalization” reactions, where a reactive group is demasked or introduced into the molecule. These reactive groups then can be conjugated with natural constituents of the organism (phase II) prior to excretion (phase III) (2.Vore M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 422-423PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione transferase; Pf, P. falciparum; r.m.s., root mean square; G-site, glutathione-binding site; H-site, hydrophobic binding pocket. EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of phase II detoxification enzymes found in most organisms. Eucaryotes usually contain multiple GSTs with different catalytic activities to accommodate a wide range of functions within the cells. Cytosolic GSTs of mammals are divided into seven classes named Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, Zeta, Sigma, and Omega on the basis of different amino sequences and substrate specificities. Additionally, the Kappa GST is a soluble mitochondrial enzyme. Studies of GSTs from non-mammalian species have revealed the existence of several new classes such as the Beta-class found in bacteria, the Phi- and Tau-classes of plants, and the Delta-class described in insects (3.Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of several members of the different GST classes were determined by x-ray crystallography and have provided insights into their unique catalytic mechanism that are not designed to accommodate any particular substrate, exhibiting a broad specificity toward substrates and non-substrate ligands (4.Listowski I. Tavolini N.N. Berk P.D. Hepatic Transport and Bile Section. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1-20Google Scholar). The primary function of the GSTs lies in the protection of cellular macromolecules by catalyzing the nucleophilic addition of the thiol of reduced glutathione (GSH) to electrophilic centers of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and pharmacologically active compounds. Furthermore, they are also involved in metabolic pathways not associated with detoxification. Other functions include selenium-independent reduction of hydroperoxides and isomerization of specific metabolites (e.g. prostaglandin H, 13-cis-retinoic acid). A recently discovered GST class also possesses dehydroascorbate reductase and thioltransferase activities (5.Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Besides their enzymatic functions, GSTs can also modulate activities of some key signaling proteins and transcription factors by direct interaction with the proteins, thereby preventing stress response pathways (6.Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 2003; 3: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). They are involved in the sequestering and with varying affinities in the transport of exogenous compounds such as pesticides, herbicides, anthelmintics, antibiotics, and endogenous metabolites as steroids and porphyrin metabolites. GSTs were identified as “ligandins” while searching for auxin- or cytokinin-binding proteins in plants, pointing to their role as binding and transport proteins for plant hormones (3.Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 7.Neuefeind T. Reinemer P. Bieseler B. Biol.

The participation of GSTs in regulatory pathways of stress response, in the neutralization of lipid peroxidation products, in the sequestration of potentially toxic compounds, and also in drug resistance (9.Hemingway J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) is especially important within a parasitic context. The disease malaria caused by the intracellular parasite P. falciparum remains a major and growing threat to countries in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world with 300-500 million cases and >1 million deaths each year. The emergence of strains resistant to drugs used for prophylaxis and treatment and presently no vaccine available makes it essential to identify novel targets and lead compounds active against them (10.Breman J.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 11.Greenwood B. Mutabingwa T. Nature. 2002; 415: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). GST activity has been detected in simian (Plasmodium knowlesi), rodent (Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium berghei), and human (P. falciparum) malarial parasites, and the initial conjugation of GSH to antimalarial drugs has been described previously (12.Platel D.F.

For the investigations we describe here, the GST of P. falciparum (Pf-GST1) has been recombinantly expressed and a substrate- as well as inhibitor-profiling was carried out(15.Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S.

Interestingly, it was also shown that Pf-GST1 interacts with ferriprotoporphyrin IX, the major toxic degradation product released during the digestion of hemoglobin. Therefore, it was postulated that, in addition to detoxification, Pf-GST1 is involved in the sequestration of non-polymerized heme in the cytosol. The relative high concentration of Pf-GST1 in the parasite makes it plausible that the protein serves as an in vivo buffer for the parasitotoxic ferriprotoporphyrin IX in the cytosol (17.Muller S. Liebau E. Walter R.D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 320-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and that an inhibition of the ligandin would effectively kill the parasite. Interfering with heme detoxification and hemozoin formation is also the mode of action of the known antimalarial drug chloroquine. Therefore, potential Pf-GST1 inhibitors would have a synergistic effect by preventing parasite resistance against chloroquine (15.Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although the utility of this enzyme as a drug target against P. falciparum is yet to be established, the critical role played by Pf-GST1 in detoxification makes it a viable drug target against malaria. The data reported here form the basis of structure-based design of selective inhibitors, which may serve as antimalarial drug leads. Construction of the expression vector, expression, purification, and crystallization of Pf-GST1 were carried out as described previously (16.Liebau E. Bergmann B. Campbell A.M. Teesdale-Spittle P.

Open table in a new tab Native and heavy atom derivative data were collected at room temperature on a MARresearch 300-mm image plate detector using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Data of the GST·S-hexyl-GSH complex were collected with synchrotron radiation at the consortium beamline X13 (HASYLAB, DESY). The programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (20.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar) were applied for data analysis and reduction. Further calculations were performed with the CCP4 program suite (21.CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). Statistics for all of the datasets are provided in Table I. The phase problem was successfully solved by multiple isomorphic replacement methods using mercury (ethyl mercury phosphate) and platinum (potassium tetracyanoplatinate) as heavy atoms. The heavy atom positions, occupancies, B-factors, and initial phases were calculated using the program SOLVE (22.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) including the anomalous signals of both derivatives. Further refinement of heavy atom parameters and phases was performed with MLPHERE (21.CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar) and resulted in an overall figure of merit of 0.6. The initial electron density was calculated at 3.1 Å and improved by solvent flattening applying the program DM (21.CCP4.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar), allowing the identification of most sections of the structure and secondary structure elements. The following model building was carried out with TURBO-FRODO (23.Roussell A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory, Silicon Graphics. Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). The first model was constructed as polyalanine. The information from this model was used to combine phases and to calculate an electron density, which allowed the identification of amino acid site chains according to the known sequence. Both molecules in the asymmetric unit were built simultaneously. A successive cyclic procedure of manual model building and phase combining of multiple isomorphic replacement and model phases combined with phase expansion to 2.6 Å led to the first model of ∼80% completeness. After the initial model building, cyclic steps of refinement using the program Refmac5 (24.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) and model building were performed applying all of the data up to 2.6 Å. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied during the complete process of refinement. During this process, missing residues and 47 water molecules were added. The R-factor converged for the apoenzyme at 20.5% (Rfree = 25.3%). The monomers in the asymmetric unit show a r.m.s. deviation of 0.5 Å for all of the Cα-atoms. For the GST·S-hexyl-GSH complex, the refined apoenzyme was used as starting model. For the refinement, all of the data up to a 2.2-Å resolution were used. The inhibitor S-hexyl-glutathione was identified by difference Fourier techniques in both glutathione-binding sites (G-sites) of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Subsequently, 138 water molecules were introduced and the R-factor converged at 21.0% (Rfree 25.7%). A summary of the refinement statistics is shown in Table II. The structural quality of the models was verified using PROCHECK (25.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornten J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab We have analyzed the native and inhibited crystal structure of the glutathione S-transferase Pf-GST1 from P. falciparum at 2.6 and 2.2 Å, respectively. Knowing the three-dimensional structure of the native enzyme is essential for understanding of structure/function relationships. The molecular mass of the monomeric protein is 23.5 kDa, and the monomer consists of two distinct domains. The Overall Structure of Pf-GST1—The regions of secondary structural elements are given in Fig. 1. The first domain (domain 1, residues 1-80) consists of four β-sheets with three flanking α-helices. Furthermore, domain 1 consists of distinct N-terminal and C-terminal motifs, which have a βαβ and ββα arrangement, respectively, and which are linked by an α-helix (α-2). This fold is similar to that of thioredoxin and T4 glutaredoxin, small proteins that are involved in a variety of redox reactions in cells (26.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannerwik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 27.Soderberg B.O.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The first domain (Fig. 2a) begins with an N-terminal β-strand (β-1) followed by a short 310-helix at the top of an α-helix (α-1) and then a second β-strand (β-2), which is parallel to β-1. A loop region leads to a second α-helix (α-2), which connects to the C-terminal tail. This motif consists of two sequential β-strands (β-3 and β-4), which are antiparallel and are followed by a third α-helix (α-3) at the C terminus of the fold. The four β-sheets are essentially in the same plane with two helices (α-1 and α-3) below this plane and the α-2 helix above it facing the solvent. The loop that connects α-2 to β-3 features a characteristic proline residue, which is the in less favored cis-conformation found to be highly conserved in all of the GSTs. The entire domain 1 is highly conserved and provides most of the glutathione-binding site (G-site). It is connected to the second domain (domain 2) by a linker sequence.Fig. 2Ribbon diagram of Pf-GST1. a, the Pf-GST1 monomer emphasizing the secondary structure elements. Helices are colored light blue, β-strands are colored green, and the 310-helix at the top of helix α-1 are colored dark blue. The S-hexyl-GSH molecule bound to the G-site is shown in ball and stick representation. B, the biological dimer is shown along the 2-fold axis. The 2-fold axis is perpendicular to the plane, and helices α-3 and α-4 are arranged around the 2-fold axis. The figure was produced using the program RIBBONS (40.Carson M. J. Mol. Graphics. 1987; 5: 103-106Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Domain 2 (approximately residues 87-211) is build up entirely from five (α-4 to α-8) α-helical segments connected by a variety of loops (Fig. 2a). The first two helices are relatively long and have a similar conformation to the typical Alpha-class of enzymes (26.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannerwik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). As described for Alpha-class enzymes, helix α-4 (residues 90-114) is smoothly distorted into a banana shape, whereas α-5 (residues 119-142) is distorted by a proline residue (Pro-129). Helices α-5 and α-6 are connected by an extended flexible loop. The biological significance of this loop is not clear. Helix α-6 (residues 159-175) is shorter than α-4 and α-5, forming a three-helix bundle and the core of the domain. The loop connecting helices α-6 and α-7 (residues 183-197) is much larger than described for the Alpha-class enzymes; however, α-7 is also almost right-angled to α-6. Pro-197 terminates α-7, and helix α-8 starts with another sharp changing of direction to domain 1. The typical Alpha-class extra helix α-9 is not found in this structure, which strongly supports the Pi- or Mu-class nature of this enzyme. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of S-hexyl-GSH complex with that of ligand-free enzyme revealed no significant changes. The G-site seems to be relatively rigid, and the overall structure is not appreciably affected by inhibitor binding (r.m.s. deviation of 0.4 Å for all of the Cα-atoms of the superimposed structures) with the exception of the rather flexible C-terminal tail and the loop connecting the helices α-4 and α-5. The result of the superposition is in good agreement with the structural analysis of the human GST M2-2 (29.McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 30.Patskovsky Y.V. Patskovska L.N. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3296-3304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Biological Dimer—Glutathione S-transferases are functional dimers. The dimers are stable, and the molecular interactions at the subunit interface is class-specific. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are slightly different (r.m.s. deviation of 0.5 Å), and they are not forming the functional biological homodimer. The biological homodimer (Fig. 2b) is formed by the crystallographic 2-fold axis by two identical molecules and has a central typical V-shaped crevice of ∼40-Å long also found in other GSTs (26.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannerwik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol.

The intermolecular interactions at the subunit interface of the dimer are summarized in Table III. There are several characteristic hydrophilic interactions close to the 2-fold axis. Particularly, the side chain of residue Arg-77 (helix α-3) serves as a hydrophilic anchor and forms two hydrogen bridges to the side chain of residue Asp-97 (helix α-4) from the other subunit of the homodimer. This arginine-mediated intersubunit contact is very specific for Mu-class enzymes, whereas Arg-68 mediates this special contact in the Alpha- and the Pi-class (32.Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although the arginines are not conserved in the Alpha- and Pi-classes on one hand and Mu-class on the other, they obviously occupy similar spatial positions.Table IIIThe intersubunit interactions of the biological homodimerResidue subunit 1Residue subunit 2DistanceÅHydrogen bondsTyr-78 OHAsp-90 OE12.9Lys-82 NZAsp-90 OE23.1Lys-81 NZAsp-93 OE23.1Asp-87 OD2Arg-77 NH22.7Asp-87 OD1Arg-77 NE2.7Asp-90 OE1Tyr-78 OH2.9Asp-90 OE2Lys-82 NZ3.1Asp-93 OE2Lys-81 NZ3.1Arg-77 NH2Asp-87 OD22.7Arg-77 NEAsp-87 OD12.7Hydrophic InteractionsPhe-56Trp-131∼4.5Phe-56Tyr-134∼4.5Phe-56Phe-135∼4.5Trp-131Phe-56∼4.5Tyr-134Phe-56∼4.5Phe-135Phe-56∼4.5 Open table in a new tab One of the most striking similarities found in the Alpha-, Mu-, and Pi-classes is the type of interaction occurring at the intersubunit interface of the homodimers. These are dominated by hydrophobic interactions between residues from domain 1 of one subunit and domain 2 of the other. This “lock and key” motif is common for the Alpha-, Mu-, and Pi-classes (26.Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannerwik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, a detailed comparison of these structural similarities offers a good possibility to distinguish among the three classes (3.Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). For Pf-GST1, Phe-56 acts as the “key” extending from the loop preceding β-3, which fits into the hydrophobic “lock” provided by residues Trp-131, Phe-135, and Tyr-134 of the other subunit. This lock is located between helices α-4 and α-5. This structural feature is also unique for Mu-class GSTs, because in Alpha- and Pi-class GSTs, residue Phe-52 or Tyr-49 acts as the key residue, respectively. The G-site—All of the GSTs are highly specific toward the natural substrate GSH. The G-site for binding of the tripeptide GSH appears as a pronounced cleft along the domain interface of domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 2a) and is located in equivalent positions in the structures of Alpha-, Mu-, and Pi-class enzymes. The molecular recognition of GSH or the specific inhibitor S-hexyl-GSH, respectively, is facilitated by a specific network of polar interactions between protein residues and the tripeptide shown in Fig. 3. Residues contributing to and involved in binding GSH are conserved within a gene class. These residues are typical for Mu-class GSTs. The three invariant G-site ligands, Tyr-9, Gln-71, and Asp-105 (from domain 2 of the adjacent subunit of the dimer), prove the Mu-class character of Pf-GST1. The catalytic tyrosine is located at the end of the C terminus of strand β-1 and is followed by a conserved loop connecting β-1 and α-1. Moreover, the four conservatively replaced G-site residues within the Mu-class Ser-72, Val-59, Lys-15, and Glu-58 are involved in GSH binding. Lys-15 is in close proximity to the S-hexyl-GSH sulfur and would therefore attribute to the further stabilization of GSH or the electrophilic co-substrate. In other Mu-class enzymes, Lys-15 is replaced by Leu, which is a remarkable difference (32.Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2069634494,"In follicular lymphomas with the t(14;18) translocation, there is increased expression of the bcl-2 gene, which is dependent upon regulatory elements within the bcl-2 5' flanking region and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancers. We found that t(14;18) lymphomas expressed C/EBPalpha, which is not normally expressed in B lymphocytes. Expression of C/EBPalpha increased bcl-2 expression, and two regions of the bcl-2 P2 promoter that mediated this effect were identified. C/EBPbeta was also able to increase bcl-2 promoter activity through these sites. The 5' site was GC-rich and did not contain a C/EBP consensus sequence; however, C/EBP was observed to interact with this site both in vitro by EMSA and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The 3' region contained the Cdx site, which mediates the effect of A-Myb on the bcl-2 promoter. In vivo binding studies revealed that C/EBP interacted with this region of the bcl-2 promoter as well. Decreased expression of C/EBP factors due to targeting of their transcripts by siRNA molecules resulted in downregulation of Bcl-2 protein. We conclude that C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta contribute to the deregulated expression of Bcl-2 in t(14;18) lymphoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030155767,"The Cdx1 homeobox gene encodes an intestine-specific transcription factor with a pro-oncogenic function in vitro. Here we have analysed the pattern of Cdx1 in human colon cancer progression. Cdx1 expression remains at a high level in the majority of the polyps and it is even overexpressed in more than one-third of the specimens, consistent with the fact that the gene is an intestine-specific target of oncogenic pathways. However, Cdx1 decreases in one-fifth of the polyps, which is reminiscent of the loss of expression previously reported in the majority of carcinomas. Allelic imbalance analysis demonstrates that the Cdx1 locus located on chromosome 5q is a major site of genomic rearrangement in colorectal cancers, and that the frequency of the rearrangements increases during polyps to carcinoma progression. Allelic imbalance at the Cdx1 locus occurs in relation to, although not invariably in association with, the rearrangements at the APC locus on the same chromosomal arm. Xenografts of primary human colon carcinomas indicate that the level of Cdx1 mRNA correlates with the intensity of allelic imbalance. Together, these data show that Cdx1 exhibits a complex pattern during colorectal cancer progression. Given that Cdx1 has a pro-oncogenic function in vitro, the maintenance of a high level of expression in polyps, and even its overexpression in one-third of the specimens, suggest that this homeobox gene may be an important factor in the process toward malignant transformation during the first steps of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2103516293,"We have found that a malignant mesothelioma cell line, NCI-H28, had a chromosome 3p21.3 homozygous deletion containing the β-catenin gene (CTNNB1), which suggested that the deletion of β-catenin might have a growth advantage in the development of this tumor. To determine whether β-catenin has a growth-inhibitory activity, we transfected wild-type β-catenin, Ser37Cys mutant β-catenin as an activated type, and C-terminus deletion mutant β-catenin that lacks the transcription activity, into the NCI-H28 cells. A non-small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H1299, which expressed endogenous β-catenin, was also studied. We tested the localization of exogenous β-catenin in the NCI-H28 cells with immunofluorescence, and found that the wild-type β-catenin and the C-terminus deletion mutant were more strongly expressed in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm than in the nucleus, while the Ser37Cys mutant was more in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. By using luciferase-reporter assay, the β-catenin/T-cell factor 4-mediated transactivity of the Ser37Cys mutant was shown to be higher than that of the wild-type β-catenin in both cell lines. However, the transactivity of the C-terminus deletion mutant was strongly reduced in both. Colony formation of the NCI-H28 cells was reduced by 50% after transfection with the wild-type β-catenin, and 60% with the Ser37Cys mutant, but only 20% with the C-terminus deletion mutant compared to the vector control. Inhibition of colony formation in NCI-H28 cells was because of apoptosis, manifested by positive staining of Annexin V and TUNEL assays in transfected cells. In contrast, when transfected with the wild-type β-catenin, no significant reduction in colony formation was seen in β-catenin wild-type NCI-H1299 cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that inactivation of β-catenin by a 3p21.3 homozygous deletion might be a crucial event in the development of the mesothelioma NCI-H28 cells. Thus, while β-catenin is well known to be a positive growth-stimulating factor for many human cancers, it can also act as a potential growth suppressor in some types of human cancer cells."
