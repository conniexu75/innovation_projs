https://openalex.org/W2053330373,"Production of hydrogen and organic compounds by an electrosynthetic microbiome using electrodes and carbon dioxide as sole electron donor and carbon source, respectively, was examined after exposure to acidic pH (∼ 5). Hydrogen production by biocathodes poised at -600 mV vs. SHE increased >100-fold and acetate production ceased at acidic pH, but ∼ 5-15 mM (catholyte volume)/day acetate and >1,000 mM/day hydrogen were attained at pH ∼ 6.5 following repeated exposure to acidic pH. Cyclic voltammetry revealed a 250 mV decrease in hydrogen overpotential and a maximum current density of 12.2 mA/cm2 at -765 mV (0.065 mA/cm2 sterile control at -800 mV) by the Acetobacterium-dominated community. Supplying -800 mV to the microbiome after repeated exposure to acidic pH resulted in up to 2.6 kg/m3/day hydrogen (≈ 2.6 gallons gasoline equivalent), 0.7 kg/m3/day formate, and 3.1 kg/m3/day acetate ( = 4.7 kg CO2 captured)."
https://openalex.org/W2081070723,"Light limitation caused by dense vegetation is one of the greatest threats to plant survival in natural environments. Plants detect such neighboring vegetation as a reduction in the red to far-red ratio (R:FR) of the incoming light. The low R:FR signal, perceived by phytochromes, initiates a set of responses collectively known as the shade avoidance syndrome, intended to reduce the degree of current or future shade from neighbors by overtopping such competitors or inducing flowering to ensure seed production. At the seedling stage these responses include increased hypocotyl elongation. We have systematically analyzed the Arabidopsis seedling response and the contribution of phyA and phyB to perception of decreased R:FR, at three different levels of photosynthetically active radiation. Our results show that the shade avoidance syndrome, induced by phyB deactivation, is gradually antagonized by phyA, operating through the so-called FR-High Irradiance Response, in response to high FR levels in a range that simulates plant canopy shade. The data indicate that the R:FR signal distinguishes between the presence of proximal, but non-shading, neighbors and direct foliar shade, via a intrafamily photosensory attenuation mechanism that acts to suppress excessive reversion toward skotomorphogenic development under prolonged direct vegetation shade."
https://openalex.org/W2030509106,"Streams are potential receiving compartments for engineered nanoparticles (NP). In streams, NP may remain dispersed or settle to the benthic compartment. Both dispersed and settling NP can accumulate in benthic biofilms called periphyton that are essential to stream ecosystems. Periphytic organisms excrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that interact with any material reaching the biofilms. To understand the interaction of NP with periphyton it is therefore crucial to study the interaction of NP with EPS. We investigated the influence of EPS on the physicochemical properties of selected NP (CeO2, Ag) under controlled conditions at pH 6, 7.6, 8.6 and light or dark exposure. We extracted EPS from five different periphyton communities, characterized the extracts, and exposed CeO2 and carbonate-stabilized Ag NP (0.5 and 5 mg/L, both 25 nm primary particle size) and AgNO3 to EPS (10 mg/L) over two weeks. We measured NP size distribution, shape, primary particle size, surface plasmon resonance, and dissolution. All EPS extracts were composed of biopolymers, building blocks of humic substances, low molecular weight (Mr) acids, and small amphiphilic or neutral compounds in varying concentrations. CeO2 NP were stabilized by EPS independent of pH and light/dark while dissolution increased over time in the dark at pH 6. EPS induced a size increase in Ag NP in the light with decreasing pH and the formation of metallic Ag NP from AgNO3 at the same conditions via EPS-enhanced photoreduction. NP transformation and formation were slower in the extract with the lowest biopolymer and low Mr acid concentrations. Periphytic EPS in combination with naturally varying pH and light/dark conditions influence the properties of the Ag and CeO2 NP tested and thus the exposure conditions within biofilms. Our results indicate that periphytic organisms may be exposed to a constantly changing mixture of engineered and naturally formed Ag NP and Ag+."
https://openalex.org/W1971398866,"We have previously shown that the L-type calcium channel (LCC) antagonist nilvadipine reduces brain amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation by affecting both Aβ production and Aβ clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nilvadipine consists of a mixture of two enantiomers, (+)-nilvadipine and (−)-nilvadipine, in equal proportion. (+)-Nilvadipine is the active enantiomer responsible for the inhibition of LCC, whereas (−)-nilvadipine is considered inactive. Both nilvadipine enantiomers inhibit Aβ production and improve the clearance of Aβ across the BBB showing that these effects are not related to LCC inhibition. In addition, treatment of P301S mutant human Tau transgenic mice (transgenic Tau P301S) with (−)-nilvadipine reduces Tau hyperphosphorylation at several Alzheimer disease (AD) pertinent epitopes. A search for the mechanism of action of (−)-nilvadipine revealed that this compound inhibits the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). We further validated Syk as a target-regulating Aβ by showing that pharmacological inhibition of Syk or down-regulation of Syk expression reduces Aβ production and increases the clearance of Aβ across the BBB mimicking (−)-nilvadipine effects. Moreover, treatment of transgenic mice overexpressing Aβ and transgenic Tau P301S mice with a selective Syk inhibitor respectively decreased brain Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD relevant epitopes. We show that Syk inhibition induces an increased phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser-9 residue of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, a primary Tau kinase involved in Tau phosphorylation, by activating protein kinase A, providing a mechanism explaining the reduction of Tau phosphorylation at GSK3β-dependent epitopes following Syk inhibition. Altogether our data highlight Syk as a promising target for preventing both Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.

https://openalex.org/W2050303562,"Boosting NAD+ biosynthesis with NAD+ intermediates has been proposed as a strategy for preventing and treating age-associated diseases, including cancer. However, concerns in this area were raised by observations that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a key enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, is frequently up-regulated in human malignancies, including breast cancer, suggesting possible protumorigenic effects for this protein. We addressed this issue by studying NAMPT expression and function in human breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. Our data indicate that high NAMPT levels are associated with aggressive pathological and molecular features, such as estrogen receptor negativity as well as HER2-enriched and basal-like PAM50 phenotypes. Consistent with these findings, we found that NAMPT overexpression in mammary epithelial cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a morphological and functional switch that confers cancer cells an increased metastatic potential. However, importantly, NAMPT-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was found to be independent of NAMPT enzymatic activity and of the NAMPT product nicotinamide mononucleotide. Instead, it was mediated by secreted NAMPT through its ability to activate the TGFβ signaling pathway via increased TGFβ1 production. These findings have implications for the design of therapeutic strategies exploiting NAD+ biosynthesis via NAMPT in aging and cancer and also suggest the potential of anticancer agents designed to specifically neutralize extracellular NAMPT. Notably, because high levels of circulating NAMPT are found in obese and diabetic patients, our data could also explain the increased predisposition to cancer of these subjects.

Notably, because high levels of circulating NAMPT are found in obese and diabetic patients, our data could also explain the increased predisposition to cancer of these subjects. The aging process is accompanied by a decline in systemic NAD+ levels, possibly as a result of defective NAD+ biosynthesis and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-mediated NAD+ depletion (1Imai S. Guarente L. NAD and sirtuins in aging and disease.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 464-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Regardless of the underlying mechanism, declining NAD+ levels seem to facilitate the occurrence of several age-related diseases, including cancer, because they negatively affect the activity of sirtuins, NAD+-dependent enzymes with pleiotropic antiaging and tumor-suppressive effects (2Guarente L. Franklin H. Epstein lecture: sirtuins, aging, and medicine.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar).

In this context, it is of interest that both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide showed remarkable anticancer and antimetastatic effects in breast cancer (BC) models (3Santidrian A.F. Matsuno-Yagi A.

However, controversy has arisen over the exploitation of NAD+ biosynthesis in cancer because NAMPT, which is one of the key enzymes for NAD+ production in mammalian cells, has been found to be frequently up-regulated in malignant cells, suggesting that it may exert protumorigenic effects (4Shackelford R.E. Mayhall K. Maxwell N.M. Kandil E. Coppola D. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in malignancy: a review.Genes Cancer. 2013; 4: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Specifically, strong NAMPT expression was reported in breast, colorectal, brain, stomach, thyroid, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancer as well as in multiple myeloma, melanoma, and astrocytomas (4Shackelford R.E. Mayhall K. Maxwell N.M. Kandil E. Coppola D. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in malignancy: a review.Genes Cancer. 2013; 4: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The possibility that NAMPT could be subjected to regulation by oncogenes has also been proposed recently on the basis of the observation that v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) promotes NAMPT up-regulation in different cell types (5Menssen A. Hydbring P. Kapelle K. Vervoorts J. Diebold J. Lüscher B. Larsson L.G. Hermeking H. The c-MYC oncoprotein, the NAMPT enzyme, the SIRT1-inhibitor DBC1, and the SIRT1 deacetylase form a positive feedback loop.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E187-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Among the mechanisms that have been suggested to explain the role of NAMPT in cancer are the increased metabolic demands of cancer versus healthy cells, the ability to stimulate the antiapoptotic effects of SIRT1 (i.e. p53 deacetylation), and its propensity to trigger calcium signaling and cell motility (4Shackelford R.E. Mayhall K. Maxwell N.M. Kandil E. Coppola D. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in malignancy: a review.Genes Cancer. 2013; 4: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). BC is a highly heterogeneous type of cancer that shares many features with other common cancers, including mutations, amplifications, or deletions in key oncogenes and tumor suppressors (i.e. HER2, MYC, TP53, CDKN2A, and PTEN), an important role of the tumor microenvironment, and the tendency to metastasize through a process named epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (6Leary R.J.

In addition, similar to other types of cancer, BC is strongly related to age (9Biganzoli L. Wildiers H. Oakman C. Marotti L. Loibl S. Kunkler I. Reed M. Ciatto S. Voogd A.C. Brain E. Cutuli B.

Importantly, although the last two decades have witnessed a remarkable improvement in the prognosis of patients with BC, the death toll of this disease remains high, with 40,000 deaths per year in the United States and over 100,000 deaths in Europe (12DeSantis C.

Therefore, further efforts to optimize BC prevention and treatment are required. Here we addressed the issue of the role of NAMPT in BC by studying its expression in a large data set of primary BC (the METABRIC set) (14Curtis C. Shah S.P. Chin S.F. Turashvili G. Rueda O.M.

A new mechanism is described by which, in mammary epithelial cells, NAMPT promotes EMT independent of its enzymatic activity and of its product nicotinamide mononucleotide but, rather, through its function as a cytokine secreted into the extracellular environment. MCF10A, MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, BT549, MDA-MB-468, and Phoenix cells were purchased from the ATCC. HMLE cells were a gift from Dr. Robert A. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA). MCF10A and HMLE cells were cultured in MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum, antibiotics, insulin (0.01 mg/ml), hydrocortisone (500 ng/ml), EGF (20 ng/ml), and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml) (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy)). Phoenix, MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, BT549, and MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. Puromycin, nicotinamide, and protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. FK866 was provided by the National Institute of Mental Health Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program, and CHS 828 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. AZD5363 and GDC-0068 were from Selleck Chemicals, and LY294002 and SB431542 were from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human NAMPT (produced in HEK 293 cells) was from Adipogen (San Diego, CA). For cell doubling time estimation, 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. At 0, 12, 36, and 48 h, cells were fixed with 3% TCA for 1 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, plates were air-dried, stained for 1 h with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (SRB) in 1% glacial acetic acid, rinsed three times with 1% glacial acetic acid, and air-dried again. SRB was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, and optical density was measured at 515 nm on a Tecan Infinte F200 Pro plate reader. Doubling time was finally calculated from the signal corresponding to the different time points. For cell growth assays, 1–5 × 103 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Thereafter, cells were either fixed with 3% TCA or stimulated with or without FK866 (10, 100, and 1000 nm). 72 h later, cells were fixed with 3% TCA and stained with SRB, and cell growth was calculated as detailed in Ref. 15Vichai V.

For retroviral transductions, 106 Phoenix cells were plated in 4 ml medium in 6-cm dishes and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using TransIT-293 (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Viral supernatants were harvested after 36, 48, 60, and 72 h and used to infect MCF-10A cells (3 × 105) in 10-cm dishes in the presence of 5 μg/ml protamine sulfate. Successfully infected cells were selected using 1.3 μg/ml puromycin. NAMPT silencing in MDA-MB-231 was performed using pLKO.1 plasmids as described previously (17Cea M. Cagnetta A. Fulciniti M.

The sequences of the NAMPT silencing sequences were as follows: shRNA#1, 5′-GTAACTTAGATGGTCTGGAAT-3′; shRNA#2, 5′-GAAGCCAAAGATGTCTACAAA-3′. As a control, a pLKO.1 plasmid encoding for a scrambled shRNA was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, plasmid no. 1864). In brief, pLKO.1 plasmids were cotransfected with the packaging plasmids pVSV-G and δ8.9 into 293T cells with Transit293 (Mirus Bio). 48 and 72 h after transfection, the supernatants were harvested, filtered, and used to infect MDA-MB-231 (which had been plated the day before in 6-cm dishes at 3 × 105 cells/dish) in the presence of 5 μg/ml protamine sulfate. Successfully infected cells were subsequently selected with 1.2 μg/ml puromycin. Unless otherwise specified, 3 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture), and protein concentration was determined according to a standard Bradford assay. Proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Vimodrone, Italy), and detected with the following antibodies: anti-NAMPT (anti-PBEF, catalog no.

Band intensities were quantified with the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). 3 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were detached, washed, and stained for 30 min at 4 °C with a CD24-PerCP-Cy5.5 antibody (catalog no. 561647) and a FITC-anti-CD44 antibody (catalog no. 555478), both from BD Biosciences. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur by acquiring 10,000 events. For intracellular NAD+ quantification, 105 cells/well were incubated in 6-well plates for 48 h in the presence or absence of FK866 (300 nm).

Supernatants were collected 48 h later and used for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc-6-PD) activity assays. In brief, media were centrifuged to remove intact cells. 50 μl of supernatant from each cell type was added to 950 μl of the assay mixture (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, and 0.6 mm glucose-6-P), and absorbance at 340 nm was spectrophotometrically detected for 5 min to determine Glc-6-PD activity. Intracellular Glc-6-PD activity was measured on cell lysates (40 μg of proteins was added to the assay mixture). Cellular supernatants were assayed for eNAMPT and TGFβ1 concentration using commercially available NAMPT and TGFβ1 ELISA kits (Adipogen SA and R&D Systems, respectively). In the case of supernatants generated from cell lines with different proliferation rates, to allow comparisons, ELISA results were normalized to cell densities at the time of supernatant harvest as detected by SRB staining (see above). 106 cells were plated in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks. Supernatants were harvested when cells reached 70–80% confluence, spun at 1200 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove intact cells and stored at 4 °C until subsequent use. 500 μl of Dynabeads protein G for immunoprecipitation (Invitrogen) was washed twice with PBS-Tween (Tween 0.02%) with the aid of a magnetic 15-ml tube holder (M-Medical). Subsequently, the beads were resuspended in 250 μl of PBS and incubated on a tube rotator for 30 min at room temperature after the addition of 80 μl of anti-NAMPT antibody (anti-PBEF, catalog no. A300-372A, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.). Thereafter, the beads were washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight with 10 ml of cell supernatants on a tube rotator at 4 °C. Finally, the beads were removed from the supernatants using a magnetic tube holder. Supernatants were sterile-filtered and stored at 4 °C until subsequent use. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 50 μl using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). 5 μl of the resulting cDNA was used for QPCR with a 7900 HT fast real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems by Invitrogen).

Gene expression was normalized to housekeeping gene expression (β-actin). Comparisons in gene expression were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method. Cells were imaged at room temperature using the ×10 magnification of a Zeiss AXIOVERT200 microscope and an Olympus C-4040ZOOM camera. The image files were acquired with Olympus CAMEDIA Master 2.5 software and subsequently processed using Microsoft Photo Editor. 3 × 104 MCF10A vector or NAMPT cells were plated on glass coverslips (Thermo Scientific Nunc Lab-Tek II chamber slide system) and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, saturated, and incubated with anti E-cadherin or anti-vimentin primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Specific staining was visualized with a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and nuclei were counterstained with QnuclearTM deep red stain (Invitrogen). Then glass coverslip were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). The images were collected using a three-channel TCS SP2 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software version 5 (GraphPad Software) using one-way analysis of variance for multiple group comparisons or unpaired Student's t test for two-group comparisons. p values below 0.05 were considered significant.

Given the high variability of NAMPT expression in BC, we searched for biological and clinical features that would account for such an observation. We observed that ER status, histological grading, and the PAM intrinsic phenotype classification were associated with different NAMPT levels at univariate analysis (Fig. 1, A–C) whereas stage, primary tumor size, age, menopausal status, and HER2 amplification status as determined by array-CGH were not.

https://openalex.org/W2002539692,"Borrelia miyamotoi is a newly described emerging pathogen transmitted to people by Ixodes species ticks and found in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. There is limited understanding of large scale entomological risk patterns of B. miyamotoi and of Borreila burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss), the agent of Lyme disease, in western North America. In this study, B. miyamotoi, a relapsing fever spirochete, was detected in adult (n=70) and nymphal (n=36) Ixodes pacificus ticks collected from 24 of 48 California counties that were surveyed over a 13 year period. Statewide prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), which includes B. burgdorferi ss, and B. miyamotoi were similar in adult I. pacificus (0.6% and 0.8%, respectively). In contrast, the prevalence of B. burgdorferi sl was almost 2.5 times higher than B. miyamotoi in nymphal I. pacificus (3.2% versus 1.4%). These results suggest similar risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi sl and B. miyamotoi from adult I. pacificus tick bites in California, but a higher risk of contracting B. burgdorferi sl than B. miyamotoi from nymphal tick bites. While regional risk of exposure to these two spirochetes varies, the highest risk for both species is found in north and central coastal California and the Sierra Nevada foothill region, and the lowest risk is in southern California; nevertheless, tick-bite avoidance measures should be implemented in all regions of California. This is the first study to comprehensively evaluate entomologic risk for B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi for both adult and nymphal I. pacificus, an important human biting tick in western North America."
https://openalex.org/W2001307141,"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and other members of Saccharum spp. are attractive biofuel feedstocks. One of the two World Collections of Sugarcane and Related Grasses (WCSRG) is in Miami, FL. This WCSRG has 1002 accessions, presumably with valuable alleles for biomass, other important agronomic traits, and stress resistance. However, the WCSRG has not been fully exploited by breeders due to its lack of characterization and unmanageable population. In order to optimize the use of this genetic resource, we aim to 1) genotypically evaluate all the 1002 accessions to understand its genetic diversity and population structure and 2) form a core collection, which captures most of the genetic diversity in the WCSRG. We screened 36 microsatellite markers on 1002 genotypes and recorded 209 alleles. Genetic diversity of the WCSRG ranged from 0 to 0.5 with an average of 0.304. The population structure analysis and principal coordinate analysis revealed three clusters with all S. spontaneum in one cluster, S. officinarum and S. hybrids in the second cluster and mostly non-Saccharum spp. in the third cluster. A core collection of 300 accessions was identified which captured the maximum genetic diversity of the entire WCSRG which can be further exploited for sugarcane and energy cane breeding. Sugarcane and energy cane breeders can effectively utilize this core collection for cultivar improvement. Further, the core collection can provide resources for forming an association panel to evaluate the traits of agronomic and commercial importance."
https://openalex.org/W2130635767,"Increased chondrocyte hypertrophy is often associated with cartilage joint degeneration in human osteoarthritis patients. Matrilin-3 knock-out (Matn3 KO) mice exhibit these features. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, we sought a molecular explanation for increased chondrocyte hypertrophy in the mice prone to cartilage degeneration. We analyzed the effects of Matn3 on chondrocyte hypertrophy and bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling by quantifying the hypertrophic marker collagen type X (Col X) gene expression and Smad1 activity in Matn3 KO mice in vivo and in Matn3-overexpressing chondrocytes in vitro. The effect of Matn3 and its specific domains on BMP activity were quantified by Col X promoter activity containing the Bmp-responsive element. Binding of MATN3 with BMP-2 was determined by immunoprecipitation, solid phase binding, and surface plasmon resonance assays. In Matn3 KO mice, Smad1 activity was increased more in growth plate chondrocytes than in wild-type mice. Conversely, Matn3 overexpression in hypertrophic chondrocytes led to inhibition of Bmp-2-stimulated, BMP-responsive element-dependent Col X expression and Smad1 activity. MATN3 bound BMP-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains clustered together by the coiled coil of Matn3 is required for Smad1 inhibition. Hence, as a novel BMP-2-binding protein and antagonist in the cartilage extracellular matrix, MATN3 may have the inherent ability to inhibit premature chondrocyte hypertrophy by suppressing BMP-2/Smad1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2063580702,"Saccharomonospora viridis is a thermophilic actinomycete that may have biotechnological applications because of its dye decolorizing activity, though the enzymatic oxidative system responsible for this activity remains elusive. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a DyP-type peroxidase gene in the genome of S. viridis DSM 43017 with sequence similarity to peroxidase from dye-decolorizing microbes. This gene, svidyp, consists of 1,215 bp encoding a polypeptide of 404 amino acids. The gene encoding SviDyP was cloned, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and then purified. The recombinant protein could efficiently decolorize several triarylmethane dyes, anthraquinonic and azo dyes under neutral to alkaline conditions. The optimum pH and temperature for SviDyP was pH 7.0 and 70°C, respectively. Compared with other DyP-type peroxidases, SviDyP was more active at high temperatures, retaining>63% of its maximum activity at 50-80°C. It also showed broad pH adaptability (>35% activity at pH 4.0-9.0) and alkali-tolerance (>80% activity after incubation at pH 5-10 for 1 h at 37°C), and was highly thermostable (>60% activity after incubation at 70°C for 2 h at pH 7.0). SviDyP had an accelerated action during the biobleaching of eucalyptus kraft pulp, resulting in a 21.8% reduction in kappa number and an increase of 2.98% (ISO) in brightness. These favorable properties make SviDyP peroxidase a promising enzyme for use in the pulp and paper industries."
https://openalex.org/W2046971314,"Mucosal biopsies from inflamed colon of inflammatory bowel disease patients exhibit elevated epithelial apoptosis compared with those from healthy individuals, disrupting mucosal homeostasis and perpetuating disease. Therapies that decrease intestinal epithelial apoptosis may, therefore, ameliorate inflammatory bowel disease, but treatments that specifically target apoptotic pathways are lacking. Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), a G protein-coupled receptor activated by trypsin-like serine proteinases, is expressed on intestinal epithelial cells and stimulates mitogenic pathways upon activation. We sought to determine whether PAR2 activation and signaling could rescue colonic epithelial (HT-29) cells from apoptosis induced by proapoptotic cytokines that are increased during inflammatory bowel disease. The PAR2 agonists 2-furoyl-LIGRLO (2f-LI), SLIGKV and trypsin all significantly reduced cleavage of caspase-3, -8, and -9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and the externalization of phosphatidylserine after treatment of cells with IFN-γ and TNF-α. Knockdown of PAR2 with siRNA eliminated the anti-apoptotic effect of 2f-LI and increased the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to cytokine-induced apoptosis. Concurrent inhibition of both MEK1/2 and PI3K was necessary to inhibit PAR2-induced survival. 2f-LI was found to increase phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic BAD at Ser(112) and Ser(136) by MEK1/2 and PI3K-dependent signaling, respectively. PAR2 activation also increased the expression of anti-apoptotic MCL-1. Simultaneous knockdown of both BAD and MCL-1 had minimal effects on PAR2-induced survival, whereas single knockdown had no effect. We conclude that PAR2 activation reduces cytokine-induced epithelial apoptosis via concurrent stimulation of MEK1/2 and PI3K but little involvement of MCL-1 and BAD. Our findings represent a novel mechanism whereby serine proteinases facilitate epithelial cell survival and may be important in the context of colonic healing."
https://openalex.org/W2023134406,"The gladiator cemetery discovered in Ephesus (Turkey) in 1993 dates to the 2nd and 3rd century AD. The aim of this study is to reconstruct diverse diet, social stratification, and migration of the inhabitants of Roman Ephesus and the distinct group of gladiators. Stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur isotope analysis were applied, and inorganic bone elements (strontium, calcium) were determined. In total, 53 individuals, including 22 gladiators, were analysed. All individuals consumed C3 plants like wheat and barley as staple food. A few individuals show indication of consumption of C4 plants. The δ13C values of one female from the gladiator cemetery and one gladiator differ from all other individuals. Their δ34S values indicate that they probably migrated from another geographical region or consumed different foods. The δ15N values are relatively low in comparison to other sites from Roman times. A probable cause for the depletion of 15N in Ephesus could be the frequent consumption of legumes. The Sr/Ca-ratios of the gladiators were significantly higher than the values of the contemporary Roman inhabitants. Since the Sr/Ca-ratio reflects the main Ca-supplier in the diet, the elevated values of the gladiators might suggest a frequent use of a plant ash beverage, as mentioned in ancient texts."
https://openalex.org/W1973813289,"Selenium (Se) has been becoming an emerging pollutant causing severe phytotoxicity, which the biochemical mechanism is rarely known. Although hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been suggested as an important exogenous regulator modulating plant physiological adaptions in response to heavy metal stress, whether and how the endogenous H2S regulates Se-induce phytotoxicity remains unclear. In this work, a self-developed specific fluorescent probe (WSP-1) was applied to track endogenous H2S in situ in the roots of Brassica rapa under Se(IV) stress. Se(IV)-induced root growth stunt was closely correlated with the inhibition of endogenous H2S generation in root tips. Se(IV) stress dampened the expression of most LCD and DCD homologues in the roots of B. rapa. By using various specific fluorescent probes for bio-imaging root tips in situ, we found that the increase in endogenous H2S by the application of H2S donor NaHS could significantly alleviate Se(IV)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-accumulation, oxidative impairment, and cell death in root tips, which further resulted in the recovery of root growth under Se(IV) stress. However, dampening the endogenous H2S could block the alleviated effect of NaHS on Se(IV)-induced phytotoxicity. Finally, the increase in endogenous H2S resulted in the enhancement of glutathione (GSH) in Se(IV)-treated roots, which may share the similar molecular mechanism for the dominant role of H2S in removing ROS by activating GSH biosynthesis in mammals. Altogether, these data provide the first direct evidences confirming the pivotal role of endogenous H2S in modulating Se(IV)-induced phytotoxicity in roots."
https://openalex.org/W2052368810,"The pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (denoted Bd), causes large-scale epizootics in naïve amphibian populations. Intervention strategies to rapidly respond to Bd incursions require sensitive and accurate diagnostic methods. Chytridiomycosis usually is assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) amplification of amphibian skin swabs. Results based on this method, however, sometimes yield inconsistent results on infection status and inaccurate scores of infection intensity. In Asia and other regions where amphibians typically bear low Bd loads, swab results are least reliable. We developed a Bd-sampling method that collects zoospores released by infected subjects into an aquatic medium. Bd DNA is extracted by filters and amplified by nested PCR. Using laboratory colonies and field populations of Bombina orientalis, we compare results with those obtained on the same subjects by qPCR of DNA extracted from swabs. Many subjects, despite being diagnosed as Bd-negative by conventional methods, released Bd zoospores into collection containers and thus must be considered infected. Infection loads determined from filtered water were at least 1000 times higher than those estimated from swabs. Subjects significantly varied in infection load, as they intermittently released zoospores, over a 5-day period. Thus, the method might be used to compare the infectivity of individuals and study the periodicity of zoospore release. Sampling methods based on water filtration can dramatically increase the capacity to accurately diagnose chytridiomycosis and contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between Bd and its hosts."

The strength of association between severe LUTS and socio-demographic, lifestyle and health-related factors was estimated, using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios, adjusted for a range of confounding factors.Overall, 18.3% reported moderate, and 3.6% severe, LUTS. Severe LUTS were more common among men reporting previous prostate cancer (7.6%), total prostatectomy (4.9%) or having part of the prostate removed (8.2%). After excluding men with prostate cancer or prostate surgery, the prevalence of moderate-severe LUTS in the cohort (n = 95,089) ranged from 10.6% to 35.4% for ages 45-49 to ≥ 80; the age-related increase was steeper for storage than voiding symptoms. The adjusted odds of severe LUTS decreased with increasing education (tertiary qualification versus no school certificate, odds ratio (OR = 0.78 (0.68-0.89))) and increasing physical activity (high versus low, OR = 0.83 (0.76-0.91)). Odds were elevated among current smokers versus never-smokers (OR = 1.64 (1.43-1.88)), obese versus healthy-weight men (OR = 1.27 (1.14-1.41)) and for comorbid conditions (e.g., heart disease versus no heart disease, OR = 1.36 (1.24-1.49)), and particularly for severe versus no physical functional limitation (OR = 5.17 (4.51-5.93)).LUTS was associated with a number of factors, including modifiable risk factors, suggesting potential targets for prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2079264427,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential process for embryogenesis. It also plays a critical role in the initiation of tumor metastasis. Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) is a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase and is mutated in many tumors. However, its functional role in tumor metastasis remains largely unknown. We found that TGFβ1-induced EMT in lung epithelial A549 cells was partially blocked when SHP2 was decreased by transfected siRNA. The constitutively active form (E76V) promoted EMT while the phosphatase-dead mutation (C459S) and the SHP2 inhibitor PHPS1 blocked EMT, which further demonstrated that the phosphatase activity of SHP2 was required for promoting TGFβ1-induced EMT. Using the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain of SHP2 as bait, we identified a novel SHP2-interacting protein Hook1. Hook1 was down-regulated during EMT in A549 cells. Overexpression of Hook1 inhibited EMT while knockdown of Hook1 promoted EMT. Moreover, both the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain and N-terminal SH2 domain of SHP2 directly interacted with Hook1. Down-regulation of Hook1 increased SHP2 activity. These results suggested that Hook1 was an endogenous negative regulator of SHP2 phosphatase activity. Our data showed that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 was involved in the process of EMT and Hook1 repressed EMT by regulating the activation of SHP2. SHP2-Hook1 complex may play important roles in tumor metastases by regulating EMT in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979842843,"Homocysteinylation of lysine residues by homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), a reactive homocysteine metabolite, results in protein aggregation and malfunction, and is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurological diseases. Human plasma paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and bleomycin hydrolase (Blmh) have been reported as the physiological HCTL detoxifying enzymes. However, the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by Blmh is low and not saturated at 20 mM HCTL. The catalytic efficiency of PON1 for HCTL hydrolysis is 100-fold lower than that of Blmh. A homocysteine thiolactonase (HCTLase) was purified from human liver and identified by mass spectrometry (MS) as the previously described human biphenyl hydrolase-like protein (BPHL). To further characterize this newly described HCTLase activity, BPHL was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The sequence of the recombinant BPHL (rBPHL) and hydrolytic products of the substrates HCTL and valacyclovir were verified by MS. We found that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of rBPHL for HCTL hydrolysis was 7.7 × 104 M−1s−1, orders of magnitude higher than that of PON1 or Blmh, indicating a more significant physiological role for BPHL in detoxifying HCTL."
https://openalex.org/W2021180956,"Camouflage is found in a wide range of species living in numerous habitat types, offering protection from visually guided predators. This includes many species from the intertidal zone, which must cope with background types diverse in appearance and with multiple predator groups foraging at high and low tide. Many animals are capable of either relatively slow (hours, days, weeks) or rapid (seconds and minutes) colour change in order to better resemble the background against which they are found, but most work has been restricted to a few species or taxa. It is often suggested that many small intertidal fish are capable of colour change for camouflage, yet little experimental work has addressed this. Here, we test rock gobies (Gobius paganellus) for colour change abilities, and whether they can tune their appearance to match the background. In two experiments, we place gobies on backgrounds of different brightness (black or white), and of different colours (red and blue) and use digital image analysis and modelling of predator (avian) vision to quantify colour and luminance (perceived lightness) changes and camouflage. We find that gobies are capable of rapid colour change (occurring within one minute), and that they can change their luminance on lighter or darker backgrounds. When presented on backgrounds of different colours, gobies also change their colour (hue and saturation) while keeping luminance the same. These changes lead to predicted improvements in camouflage match to the background. Our study shows that small rockpool fish are capable of rapid visual change for concealment, and that this may be an important mechanism in many species to avoid predation, especially in complex heterogeneous environments."
https://openalex.org/W2042410565,"Epithelial ion transport is mainly under the control of intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+) signaling. Although the molecular mechanisms of cAMP-induced epithelial ion secretion are well defined, those induced by Ca(2+) signaling remain poorly understood. Because calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation results in an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]cyt) but a decrease in cAMP levels, it is a suitable receptor for elucidating the mechanisms of [Ca(2+)]cyt-mediated epithelial ion transport and duodenal bicarbonate secretion (DBS). CaSR proteins have been detected in mouse duodenal mucosae and human intestinal epithelial cells. Spermine and Gd(3+), two CaSR activators, markedly stimulated DBS without altering duodenal short circuit currents in wild-type mice but did not affect DBS and duodenal short circuit currents in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) knockout mice. Clotrimazole, a selective blocker of intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels but not chromanol 293B, a selective blocker of cAMP-activated K(+) channels (KCNQ1), significantly inhibited CaSR activator-induced DBS, which was similar in wild-type and KCNQ1 knockout mice. HCO3 (-) fluxes across epithelial cells were activated by a CFTR activator, but blocked by a CFTR inhibitor. CaSR activators induced HCO3 (-) fluxes, which were inhibited by a receptor-operated channel (ROC) blocker. Moreover, CaSR activators dose-dependently raised cellular [Ca(2+)]cyt, which was abolished in Ca(2+)-free solutions and inhibited markedly by selective CaSR antagonist calhex 231, and ROC blocker in both animal and human intestinal epithelial cells. Taken together, CaSR activation triggers Ca(2+)-dependent DBS, likely through the ROC, intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels, and CFTR channels. This study not only reveals that [Ca(2+)]cyt signaling is critical to modulate DBS but also provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of CaSR-mediated Ca(2+)-induced DBS."
https://openalex.org/W1980458029,"The uptake of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDL) is mediated by LDL receptor (LDLR) through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. At the early stage of this process, adaptor proteins ARH and Dab2 specifically bind the endocytic signal motif in LDLR and recruit clathrin/AP2 to initiate internalization. On the other hand, intestinal cholesterol is absorbed by Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Another adaptor protein, Numb recognizes the endocytic motif in NPC1L1 C terminus and couples NPC1L1 to endocytic machinery. The ARH, Dab2, and Numb proteins contain a homogeneous phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that directly binds endocytic motifs. Because ARH, Dab2, and Numb are all PTB domain family members, the emerging mystery is whether these adaptors act complementally in LDLR and NPC1L1 endocytosis. Here, we found that ARH and Dab2 did not bind NPC1L1 and were not required for NPC1L1 internalization. Similarly, Numb lacked the ability to interact with the LDLR C terminus and was dispensable for LDL uptake. Only the Numb isoforms with shorter PTB domain could facilitate NPC1L1 endocytosis. Besides the reported function in intestinal cholesterol absorption, Numb also mediated cholesterol reabsorption from bile in liver. We further identified a Numb variant with G595D substitution in humans of low blood LDL-cholesterol. The G595D substitution impaired NPC1L1 internalization and cholesterol reabsorption, due to attenuating affinity of Numb to clathrin/AP2. These results demonstrate that Numb specifically regulates NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption both in human intestine and liver, distinct from ARH and Dab2, which selectively participate in LDLR-mediated LDL uptake. The uptake of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDL) is mediated by LDL receptor (LDLR) through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. At the early stage of this process, adaptor proteins ARH and Dab2 specifically bind the endocytic signal motif in LDLR and recruit clathrin/AP2 to initiate internalization. On the other hand, intestinal cholesterol is absorbed by Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Another adaptor protein, Numb recognizes the endocytic motif in NPC1L1 C terminus and couples NPC1L1 to endocytic machinery. The ARH, Dab2, and Numb proteins contain a homogeneous phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that directly binds endocytic motifs. Because ARH, Dab2, and Numb are all PTB domain family members, the emerging mystery is whether these adaptors act complementally in LDLR and NPC1L1 endocytosis. Here, we found that ARH and Dab2 did not bind NPC1L1 and were not required for NPC1L1 internalization. Similarly, Numb lacked the ability to interact with the LDLR C terminus and was dispensable for LDL uptake. Only the Numb isoforms with shorter PTB domain could facilitate NPC1L1 endocytosis. Besides the reported function in intestinal cholesterol absorption, Numb also mediated cholesterol reabsorption from bile in liver. We further identified a Numb variant with G595D substitution in humans of low blood LDL-cholesterol. The G595D substitution impaired NPC1L1 internalization and cholesterol reabsorption, due to attenuating affinity of Numb to clathrin/AP2. These results demonstrate that Numb specifically regulates NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption both in human intestine and liver, distinct from ARH and Dab2, which selectively participate in LDLR-mediated LDL uptake."

Consequently, there has been an increase in the number of resistant strains to one or many antivirals in recent years. Here we compared the antiviral effects of lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents (LAAs) and calcium modulators (CMs), which interfere with crucial events in the influenza virus replication cycle, against avian, swine, and human viruses of different subtypes in MDCK cells. We observed that treatment with LAAs, CMs, or a combination of both, significantly inhibited viral replication. Moreover, the drugs were effective even when they were administered 8 h after infection. Finally, analysis of the expression of viral acidic polymerase (PA) revealed that both drugs classes interfered with early events in the viral replication cycle. This study demonstrates that targeting broad host cellular pathways can be an efficient strategy to inhibit influenza replication. Furthermore, it provides an interesting avenue for drug development where resistance by the virus might be reduced since the virus is not targeted directly."
https://openalex.org/W2031644195,"The molecular mechanism of p16-mediated senescence in cisplatin-treated cancer cells is not fully understood. Here we show that cisplatin treatment of head and neck cancer cells results in nuclear transport of p16 leading to a molecular modification of NFκB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that this modification is associated with the inhibition of NFκB interacting with its DNA binding sequences, leading to decreased expression of NFκB-transcribed proteins. LCMS proteomic analysis of LAP-TAP-purified proteins from HeLa cells containing a tetracycline-inducible GFP-S peptide-NFκB expression system identified gigaxonin, an ubiquitin E3 ligase adaptor, as an NFκB-interacting protein. Immunoblotting and siRNA studies confirmed the NFκB-gigaxonin interaction and the dependence of this binding on p16-NFκB binding. Using gel shift assays, we have confirmed p16-NFκB and gigaxonin-NFκB interactions. Furthermore, we have observed increased NFκB ubiquitination with cisplatin treatment that is abolished in the absence of p16 and gigaxonin expression. Analysis of 103 primary tumors has shown that increased nuclear p16 expression correlates with enhanced survival of head and neck cancer patients (p < 0.0000542), indicating the importance of nuclear p16 expression in prognosis. Finally, p16 expression is associated with reduced cytokine expression and the presence of human papilloma virus in chemoradiation-sensitive basaloid tumors. However, the absence of p16 expression is associated with enhanced cytokine expression and the absence of human papilloma virus in aggressive tumors. These results clearly demonstrate that nuclear p16 and gigaxonin play an important role in chemosensitivity of head and neck cancers through ubiquitination of NFκB."
https://openalex.org/W2047582838,"Subject motion has long since been known to be a major confound in functional MRI studies of the human brain. For resting-state functional MRI in particular, data corruption due to motion artefacts has been shown to be most relevant. However, despite 6 parameters (3 for translations and 3 for rotations) being required to fully describe the head's motion trajectory between timepoints, not all are routinely used to assess subject motion. Using structural (n = 964) as well as functional MRI (n = 200) data from public repositories, a series of experiments was performed to assess the impact of using a reduced parameter set (translationonly and rotationonly) versus using the complete parameter set. It could be shown that the usage of 65 mm as an indicator of the average cortical distance is a valid approximation in adults, although care must be taken when comparing children and adults using the same measure. The effect of using slightly smaller or larger values is minimal. Further, both translationonly and rotationonly severely underestimate the full extent of subject motion; consequently, both translationonly and rotationonly discard substantially fewer datapoints when used for quality control purposes (“motion scrubbing”). Finally, both translationonly and rotationonly severely underperform in predicting the full extent of the signal changes and the overall variance explained by motion in functional MRI data. These results suggest that a comprehensive measure, taking into account all available parameters, should be used to characterize subject motion in fMRI."

Here we assess previous methods for the design of reserves for climate change and present a new approach to prioritize areas for conservation that leverages the most desirable properties of previous approaches. The new method moves the science of reserve design for climate change a step forwards by: (1) recognizing the role of seasonal acclimation in increasing the limits of environmental tolerance of corals and ameliorating the bleaching response; (2) using the best proxy for acclimatization currently available; (3) including information from several bleaching events, which frequency is likely to increase in the future; (4) assessing relevant variability at country scales, where most management plans are carried out.

https://openalex.org/W2089547175,"Heparin allosterically activates antithrombin as an inhibitor of factors Xa and IXa by enhancing the initial Michaelis complex interaction of inhibitor with protease through exosites. Here, we investigate the mechanism of this enhancement by analyzing the effects of alanine mutations of six putative antithrombin exosite residues and three complementary protease exosite residues on antithrombin reactivity with these proteases in unactivated and heparin-activated states. Mutations of antithrombin Tyr253 and His319 exosite residues produced massive 10–200-fold losses in reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in both unactivated and heparin-activated states, indicating that these residues made critical attractive interactions with protease independent of heparin activation. By contrast, mutations of Asn233, Arg235, Glu237, and Glu255 exosite residues showed that these residues made both repulsive and attractive interactions with protease that depended on the activation state and whether the critical Tyr253/His319 residues were mutated. Mutation of factor Xa Arg143, Lys148, and Arg150 residues that interact with the exosite in the x-ray structure of the Michaelis complex confirmed the importance of all residues for heparin-activated antithrombin reactivity and Arg150 for native serpin reactivity. These results demonstrate that the exosite is a key determinant of antithrombin reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in the native as well as the heparin-activated state and support a new model of allosteric activation we recently proposed in which a balance between attractive and repulsive exosite interactions in the native state is shifted to favor the attractive interactions in the activated state through core conformational changes induced by heparin binding.

Antithrombin, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, acts as a critical anticoagulant regulator of hemostasis through its ability to rapidly inhibit the blood coagulation proteases, thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa (1Olson S.T.

The physiologic importance of this anticoagulant protein is indicated from the increased risk of thrombotic diseases associated with acquired or inherited deficiencies of the protein in humans (2van Boven H.H.

Heparin activation of antithrombin involves both an allosteric component wherein a specific pentasaccharide sequence in heparin induces activating conformational changes in the serpin that promotes its interaction with protease and a bridging component in which the extended heparin chain in the antithrombin-heparin complex provides a site for the protease to bind next to the serpin to promote the serpin-protease interaction (7Petitou M.

The allosteric mechanism activates antithrombin reactivity with the target proteases, factors Xa and IXa, but only minimally with thrombin, whereas the bridging mechanism activates antithrombin reactivity with all three proteases (10Bedsted T.

The mechanism of allosteric activation of antithrombin has been the subject of numerous studies. Early models based on x-ray structures of native and heparin-activated antithrombin suggested the importance of releasing the reactive center protease binding loop (RCL) 2The abbreviation used is: RCLreactive center protease binding loop. from a constrained interaction with sheet A in the native state, first as a means of making the critical P1 Arg recognition determinant accessible to target proteases (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. The anticoagulant activation of antithrombin by heparin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and later as a means to gain access to exosites outside the RCL to augment the protease interaction (12Izaguirre G. Olson S.T.

Although a critical role for exosites in augmenting the antithrombin RCL interaction with factors Xa/IXa in the allosterically activated state is now well established, a role for RCL expulsion from sheet A in making the exosites available for interaction with protease is not supported by much available data. reactive center protease binding loop. In particular, the observation that mutations of a critical Tyr253 exosite residue cause large losses in antithrombin reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in both unactivated and heparin-activated states (12Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. Residues Tyr-253 and Glu-255 in strand 3 of β-sheet C of antithrombin are key determinants of an exosite made accessible by heparin activation to promote rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) has suggested that the exosite contributes to antithrombin reactivity in both native and activated states and therefore that release of the RCL from its interaction with sheet A is not required to engage the exosite. This and other data suggested an alternative model in which the antithrombin exosite is available to interact with RCL-bound proteases in the native RCL-constrained state, but the interaction is less favorable due to repulsive interactions counteracting the attractive interactions (16Gettins P.G. Olson S.T. Activation of antithrombin as a factor IXa and Xa inhibitor involves mitigation of repression rather than positive enhancement.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Allosteric activation in this model enhances antithrombin reactivity by mitigating the repulsive interactions and augmenting the attractive interactions with protease. More recently, it was found that an antithrombin variant with mutations designed to promote the allosteric-activating changes in the heparin binding site was fully activated as an inhibitor of factors Xa and IXa without the need for heparin (17Dementiev A. Swanson R. Roth R. Isetti G. Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.

Chem. 2013; 288: 33611-33619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Significantly, this activation was not accompanied by the signature tryptophan fluorescence changes that report RCL expulsion from sheet A, although such changes could be induced by heparin, consistent with the idea that RCL expulsion is not required for allosteric activation. To provide a more rigorous test of the new model of allosteric activation and in particular to provide evidence for the proposed different modes of exosite interaction in native and allosterically activated states, we chose to mutate six antithrombin residues that comprise the critical exosite in x-ray structures of heparin-antithrombin-protease Michaelis complexes (13Johnson D.J.

Complementary mutations of three active-site loop residues in factor Xa that interact with the antithrombin exosite in the Michaelis complex structures (18Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R.

Our results demonstrate the importance of antithrombin and protease exosite residues for reactivity in both native and heparin-activated states of the serpin and thus show that RCL expulsion is not required to engage the exosite. Significantly, they support a new model of allosteric activation in which a balance between attractive and repulsive exosite interactions in the native state designed to repress reactivity at an otherwise attractive P1 Arg residue is shifted to favor the attractive interactions in the activated state through core conformational changes induced by heparin binding.

Protein concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 37,700 m−1 cm−1 (22Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. The size and shape of human and bovine antithrombin III.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Coagulation factors IXa and Xa from human plasma were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, and human plasma thrombin was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Recombinant Gla-domainless wild-type and mutant human factor Xas were expressed in mammalian cells and activated and purified as described (18Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Role of basic residues of the autolysis loop in the catalytic function of factor Xa.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Active protease concentrations were determined from standard substrate assays previously calibrated with active site-titrated enzyme. A synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin was provided by Sanofi-Aventis (Toulouse, France). A full-length heparin (50-mer) containing the pentasaccharide binding sequence was prepared by size and affinity fractionation of commercial heparin as described (23Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Kinetic characterization of heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed inhibition of blood coagulation proteinases by antithrombin.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The purity of recombinant antithrombins as well as plasma and recombinant proteases and their ability to form antithrombin-protease covalent complexes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (24Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Antithrombin-protease reaction stoichiometries and kinetics were analyzed in ionic strength (I) 0.15, pH 7.4, buffers at 25 °C. Reactions with plasma factor Xa and factor IXa were done in 100 mm Hepes, 93.5 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% PEG 8000, whereas reactions with plasma thrombin and recombinant factor Xa were conducted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000 because the latter were not affected by calcium. The stoichiometries of antithrombin inhibition of proteases were determined in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins by end point assays essentially as described in past studies (12Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. Residues Tyr-253 and Glu-255 in strand 3 of β-sheet C of antithrombin are key determinants of an exosite made accessible by heparin activation to promote rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fixed concentrations of protease and heparin (∼100 nm) were incubated with increasing molar ratios of antithrombin to protease (up to 2:1) for a time sufficient to complete the reaction based on measured rate constants. Residual protease activity was then assayed by dilution of an aliquot into 100 μm chromogenic or 50 μm fluorogenic substrate solution and the initial linear absorbance (405 nm) or fluorescence (λex 380 nm, λem 440 nm) increase was measured for several minutes. Plots of residual protease activity as a function of the molar ratio of antithrombin to protease were linear and yielded the stoichiometry of inhibition from the abscissa intercept. The substrates used were S2238 for thrombin (Chromogenix), Spectrozyme FXa for factor Xa (American Diagnostica), and Pefachrome or Pefafluor for factor IXa (Centerchem). Substrates were made up in buffers consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, for S2238, 100 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, for Spectrozyme FXa, and 100 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 33% ethylene glycol, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 8, for Pefachrome and Pefafluor. 50 μg/ml of Polybrene was included in all substrates to neutralize heparin when present. The kinetics of antithrombin inhibition of proteases was studied under pseudo first-order conditions with antithrombin concentrations at least 10-fold higher than that of the protease as in previous studies (12Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. Residues Tyr-253 and Glu-255 in strand 3 of β-sheet C of antithrombin are key determinants of an exosite made accessible by heparin activation to promote rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For reactions without heparin or in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide concentrations sufficient to saturate antithrombin (20–100% molar excess) and with measured rate constants up to 105 m−1 s−1, full reaction time courses of the loss of protease activity were measured by assaying residual protease activity in aliquots of reaction mixtures as a function of time as described in measurements of reaction stoichiometries. Progress curves were fit by a single exponential decay function with zero end point for thrombin and factor Xa reactions and nonzero end point for factor IXa reactions to account for low levels of degraded protease less susceptible to inhibition (<10%) to obtain the observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs). Apparent second-order association rate constants were calculated by dividing kobs by the concentration of antithrombin. For reactions in the presence of pentasaccharide or full-length heparin that were faster than 105 m−1 s−1, reactions were conducted for a fixed time in the presence of increasing concentrations of heparin at catalytic levels and residual protease activity was then assayed. The loss in protease activity was in this case fit by an exponential function with the heparin concentration instead of time as the independent variable (10Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Heparin and calcium ions dramatically enhance antithrombin reactivity with factor IXa by generating new interaction exosites.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The apparent second-order rate constant was obtained by dividing the exponential rate constant by the fixed reaction time. Because antithrombin concentrations greatly exceeded dissociation constants for antithrombin-heparin interactions at I 0.15 for wild-type and variant antithrombins (>20-fold), no corrections for unbound heparin were required. Corrected second-order association rate constants reflecting reaction along the inhibitory pathway (ka) were obtained by multiplying apparent second-order rate constants by inhibition reaction stoichiometries. Equilibrium dissociation constants for antithrombin-heparin interactions were measured by titrations of wild-type and mutant antithrombins (100 nm) with the heparin pentasaccharide monitored from the ∼40% enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence that accompanies heparin binding as in previous studies (9Olson S.T.

Titrations were performed in I 0.35 buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, to weaken heparin affinity and allow accurate measurements of KD.

Antithrombin variants with alanine mutations of Asn233, Arg235, Glu237, Tyr253, Glu255, and His319 residues of strands 2, 3, and 4 of sheet C were made alone and in combination. Although His319 was previously not implicated as part of the exosite, intramolecular interactions of this residue with Glu237 and Tyr253 exosite residues suggested a potential role in exosite function. The variant antithrombins were evaluated for their effects on antithrombin reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in the absence and presence of specific pentasaccharide and full-length ∼50-saccharide heparins containing the pentasaccharide sequence. The heparin pentasaccharide is sufficient to allosterically activate the inhibitor, whereas the full-length heparin augments the allosteric activating effect by providing an additional bridging interaction site for the protease in the ternary Michaelis complex (9Olson S.T.

Because thrombin does not engage the exosite and its reactivity with antithrombin is solely enhanced by bridging heparin activation (25Li W. Johnson D.J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A.

All antithrombin mutants were expressed and purified similar to wild-type and yielded amounts of protein comparable with wild-type. All mutants bound the heparin pentasaccharide with binding stoichiometries close to 1:1 and inhibited thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa in the absence and presence of heparin with stoichiometries of 1–2 mol of inhibitor/mol of protease that were comparable with wild-type values. The effect of the mutations on antithrombin reactivity with the three proteases was assessed by measuring the apparent second-order rate constants for the reactions under pseudo first-order conditions as in past studies (12Izaguirre G. Olson S.T.

These were corrected for the fraction of inhibitor reacting through a competing substrate pathway by multiplying by the inhibition stoichiometries to yield the second-order association rate constant (ka) for reaction along the inhibitory pathway. Mutations of Tyr253 and His319 had profound effects on antithrombin reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in native as well as heparin-activated states (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Y253A antithrombin inhibited factor Xa with a 7-fold lower ka than wild-type in the absence of heparin and more substantial 40- and 10-fold lower ka in the presence of pentasaccharide and bridging heparins, respectively. The mutant antithrombin inhibited factor IXa with an even greater 69-fold reduction in ka from wild-type in the unactivated state but lesser 32- and 14-fold reductions in ka in pentasaccharide and bridging heparin-activated states, although the latter reductions were comparable with those observed in corresponding reactions with factor Xa. Similarly, H319A antithrombin inhibited factor Xa with a 9-fold lower ka than wild-type in the absence of heparin and greater 67- and 27-fold reduced values in the presence of pentasaccharide and bridging heparins. As observed with the Y253A mutant, H319A antithrombin inhibited factor IXa with the most dramatic 230-fold reduction in ka"

Methods Based on a prospective observational cohort design, 1254 inpatients (mean age ± standard deviation, 84.9±5.9 years; 59.3% female) recruited upon their admission to ED and discharged in acute care medical units of Angers University Hospital, France, were selected in this study. At baseline assessment, a BGA was performed and included the following 6 items: age ≥85years, male gender, polypharmacy (i.e., ≥5 drugs per day), use of home-help services, history of falls in previous 6 months and temporal disorientation (i.e., inability to give the month and/or year). The LHS in acute care medical units was prospectively calculated in number of days using the hospital registry. Results Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of prolonged LHS of different combinations of BGA items ranged from 0.50 to 0.57. Cox regression models revealed that combinations defining a high risk of prolonged LHS, identified from ROC curves, were significant risk factors for prolonged LHS (hazard ratio >1.16 with P>0.010). Kaplan-Meier distributions of discharge showed that inpatients classified in high-risk group of prolonged LHS were discharged later than those in low-risk group (P<0.003). Prognostic value for prolonged LHS of all combinations was poor with sensitivity under 77%, a high variation of specificity (from 26.6 to 97.4) and a low likelihood ratio of positive test under 5.6. Conclusion Combinations of 6-item BGA tool were significant risk factors for prolonged LHS but their prognostic value was poor in the studied sample of older inpatients."

https://openalex.org/W2040165740,"Objective There is limited epidemiological data on the seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in subtropical climates, such as in Taiwan. This study aimed to assess RSV seasonality among children ≤24 months of age in Taiwan. We also assessed factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with RSV-associated hospitalization in preterm infants to confirm the appropriateness of the novel Taiwanese RSV prophylactic policy. Study Design From January 2000 to August 2010, 3572 children aged ≤24-months were admitted to Taipei Mackay Memorial Hospital due to RSV infection. The monthly RSV-associated hospitalization rate among children aged ≤24 months was retrospectively reviewed. Among these children, 378 were born preterm. The associations between GA, CA, and BPD and the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization in the preterm infants were assessed. Results In children aged ≤24 months, the monthly distribution of RSV-associated hospitalization rates revealed a prolonged RSV season with a duration of 10 months. Infants with GAs ≤32 weeks and those who had BPD had the highest rates of RSV hospitalization (P<0.001). Preterm infants were most vulnerable to RSV infection within CA 9 months. Conclusions Given that Taiwan has a prolonged (10-month) RSV season, the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations for RSV prophylaxis are not directly applicable. The current Taiwanese guidelines for RSV prophylaxis, which specify palivizumab injection (a total six doses until CA 8–9 months) for preterm infants (those born before 286/7 weeks GA or before 356/7 weeks GA with BPD), are appropriate. This prophylaxis strategy may be applicable to other countries/regions with subtropical climates."
https://openalex.org/W2076477508,"Asymmetric disposition of Fab arms in the structures solved for the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (nmAb) IgG1 b12 raised the question of whether the unusual shape observed for b12 is common for all IgG1 mAbs or if there is a difference in the overall shape of nmAbs versus non-nmAbs. We compared small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data-based models and limited proteolysis profiles of some IgG1 mAbs known to be having and lacking HIV-1 neutralizing potency. In non-nmAbs, the Fab arms were found to be symmetrically disposed in space relative to central Fc, but in most nmAbs, the Fab arms were asymmetrically disposed, as seen for IgG1 b12. The only exceptions were 2G12 and 4E10, where both Fab arms were closed above Fc, suggesting some Fab-Fc and/or Fab-Fab interaction in the nmAbs that constrained extension of the Fab-Fc linker. Interestingly, these observations were correlated with differential proteolysis profiles of the mAbs by papain. Under conditions when papain could cut both Fab arms of non-nmAbs, only one Fab arm could be removed from neutralizing ones (except for 2G12 and 4E10). Chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering results of papain-digested products revealed that 1) the Fab-Fc or Fab-Fab interactions in unliganded mAbs are retained in digested products, and 2) whereas anti-gp120 non-nmAbs could bind two gp120 molecules, nmAbs could bind only one gp120. Additional experiments showed that except for 2G12 and 4E10, unopen shapes of nmAbs remain uninfluenced by ionic strength but can be reversibly opened by low pH of buffer accompanied by loss of ligand binding ability."
https://openalex.org/W2056630890,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health concern worldwide, and is associated with marked increase of bone fragility. Previous studies assessing the effect of CKD on bone quality were based on biopsies from human patients or on laboratory animal models. Such studies provide information of limited relevance due to the small size of the samples (biopsies) or the non-physiologic CKD syndrome studied (rodent models with artificially induced CKD). Furthermore, the type, architecture, structure and biology of the bone of rodents are remarkably different from human bones; therefore similar clinicopathologic circumstances may affect their bones differently. We describe the effects of naturally occurring CKD with features resembling human CKD on the skeleton of cats, whose bone biology, structure and composition are remarkably similar to those of humans. We show that CKD causes significant increase of resorption cavity density compared with healthy controls, as well as significantly lower cortical mineral density, cortical cross-sectional area and cortical cross-sectional thickness. Young's modulus, yield stress, and ultimate stress of the cortical bone material were all significantly decreased in the skeleton of CKD cats. Cancellous bone was also affected, having significantly lower trabecular thickness and bone volume over total volume in CKD cats compared with controls. This study shows that naturally occurring CKD has deleterious effects on bone quality and strength. Since many similarities exist between human and feline CKD patients, including the clinicopathologic features of the syndrome and bone microarchitecture and biology, these results contribute to better understanding of bone abnormalities associated with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2077263322,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5-1.8% in most populations. Around 30-50% of CU patients have an autoimmune etiology, with autoantibodies (autoAbs) against IgE, FcεRIα, and FcεRII/CD23. Although the in vivo autologous serum skin test (ASST) and in vitro histamine release/activation assay are the most frequently used screening methods, these two have many limitations and do not directly measure susceptible autoAbs. This study aimed to establish an in vitro rapid screening test using recombinant autoantigen FcεRIα(rFcεRIα) to improve the diagnosis of autoimmune urticaria.Forty patients with CU and 20 healthy individuals were enrolled. After PCR-based cloning and the production of extracellular fragments of the FcεRIα protein using the E. coli expression system, serum autoAb to rFcεRIα was evaluated using in-house ELISA and rapid immunodot test.In ELISA-based detection, 14 out of 20 CU-ASST(+) patients exhibited anti- FcεRIα responses, whereas five of the 20 CU-ASST(-) and two of the 20 non-CU patients showed autoantibody background in the assay. For the immunodot test, 55% (11/20) of the CU-ASST(+) sera exhibited anti-FcεRIα reactivity. There was no false positive among the CU-ASST(-) and non-CU groups. Using clinical urticaria plus ASST(+) as the gold standard, in-house ELISA had 70% sensitivity, 82.5% specificity, and positive likelihood ratio of 4, while immunodot had 55% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and positive likelihood ratio >55.This study has developed a rapid immunodot method with high specificity for detecting autoAb to FcεRIαin patients with CU. Preliminary data indicates that this immunodot technique has the potential to be a routine diagnostic assay for autoimmune CU."

Intracellular MMP2 expression and activity were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and zymography, respectively. MMP2 expression and activity were manipulated by over-expression with recombinant MMP2 plasmids or knockdown with either MMP2 specific siRNA or inhibitors, and effects on apoptosis and insulin-secretion were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA.AGE treatment induced intracellular oxidative stress in INS-1 cells, as indicated by elevated ROS levels, apoptotic cell death, and suppressed insulin secretion. This was accompanied by increased MMP2 expression and activity. However, Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment inhibited MMP2 expression and activity, and partially reversed cell apoptosis and insulin secretion dysfunction induced by AGE. Forced expression of MMP2 mimicked the effects of AGE treatment while inhibition of MMP2 either by a specific MMP2 inhibitor or MMP2 siRNA protected oxidative stress induced by AGE.MMP2 expression and intracellular activity are increased by oxidative stress, contributing to cellular dysfunction and apoptosis in INS-1 cells after AGE challenge."

https://openalex.org/W2321492301,"SH2D5 is a mammalian-specific, uncharacterized adaptor-like protein that contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. We show that SH2D5 is highly enriched in adult mouse brain, particularly in Purkinjie cells in the cerebellum and the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus. Despite harboring two potential phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) recognition domains, SH2D5 binds minimally to Tyr(P) ligands, consistent with the absence of a conserved Tyr(P)-binding arginine residue in the SH2 domain. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry (IP-MS) from cultured cells revealed a prominent association of SH2D5 with breakpoint cluster region protein, a RacGAP that is also highly expressed in brain. This interaction occurred between the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of SH2D5 and an NxxF motif located within the N-terminal region of the breakpoint cluster region. siRNA-mediated depletion of SH2D5 in a neuroblastoma cell line, B35, induced a cell rounding phenotype correlated with low levels of activated Rac1-GTP, suggesting that SH2D5 affects Rac1-GTP levels. Taken together, our data provide the first characterization of the SH2D5 signaling protein."
https://openalex.org/W2040629819,"Previously, we have identified Caprin-2 as a new regulator in canonical Wnt signaling through a mechanism of facilitating LRP5/6 phosphorylation; moreover, we found that its C-terminal C1q-related domain (Cap2_CRD) is required for this process. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Cap2_CRD from human and zebrafish, which both associate as a homotrimer with calcium located at the symmetric center. Surprisingly, the calcium binding-deficient mutant exists as a more stable trimer than its wild-type counterpart. Further studies showed that this Caprin-2 mutant disabled in binding calcium maintains the activity of promoting LRP5/6 phosphorylation, whereas the mutations disrupting Cap2_CRD homotrimer did impair such activity. Together, our findings suggested that the C-terminal CRD domain of Caprin-2 forms a flexible homotrimer mediated by calcium and that such trimeric assembly is required for Caprin-2 to regulate canonical Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2085459927,"SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, protects neurons in various models of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously described that neuroprotection by SIRT1 is independent of its catalytic activity. To elucidate how SIRT1 protects neurons, we performed a mass spectrometric screen to find SIRT1-interacting proteins. One of the proteins identified was JAZ (Znf346), a member of a new class of Cys-2-His-2 zinc finger proteins. To investigate the significance of JAZ in the regulation of neuronal survival, we overexpressed it in neurons. We found that JAZ protects cerebellar granule neurons against potassium deprivation-induced death and cortical neurons from death resulting from oxidative stress. JAZ also protects neurons against toxicity induced by mutant huntingtin and mutant ataxin-1 expression. Although expression of endogenous JAZ does not change in neurons primed to die, knockdown of its expression promotes death of otherwise healthy neurons. In contrast to its protective effect in neurons, overexpression of JAZ in different cell lines promotes death. We find that JAZ suppresses cell cycle progression, thereby explaining its contrasting effect in postmitotic neurons versus proliferating cell lines. Although not affecting the expression of several cyclins, overexpression of JAZ stimulates expression of p21 (WAF1/CIP1), a cell cycle inhibitor known to have neuroprotective effects. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional assays indicate that the stimulatory effect of JAZ on p21 expression is mediated at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, knockdown of p21 expression inhibits the neuroprotective effect of JAZ. Together, our results suggest that JAZ protects neurons by inhibiting cell cycle re-entry through the transcriptional stimulation of p21 expression."

IRF8 was shown to exert its influences on the germinal center (GC) reaction, class switch recombination, and plasma cell development through partnering with PU.1 and IRF4 to promote the activation of Aicda and Bcl6, genes central to the maintenance of the B cell program, while repressing genes such as Prdm1 that promote terminal differentiation (15Lee C.H.

Previous studies demonstrated that IRF8 is involved in the regulation of Bcl6 expression in GC B cells (15Lee C.H. Melchers M. Wang H. Torrey T.A. Slota R. Qi C.F. Kim J.Y. Lugar P. Kong H.J.

BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor with critical roles in several immunological processes including B and T cell functions, especially GC development and generation. BCL6 is highly expressed in B cells undergoing affinity maturation in GC, and its expression is down-regulated upon selection for apoptosis or differentiation (17Cattoretti G. Shaknovich R. Smith P.M. Jäck H.M. Murty V.V. Alobeid B. Stages of germinal center transit are defined by B cell transcription factor coexpression and relative abundance.J.

The critical function of BCL6 in GC biology is associated with the BCL6 BTB/POZ domain physically interacting with the corepressor proteins BCOR (19Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J.

To determine whether there are other partners for IRF8 that might contribute to this complex and late developmental transcriptional program of B cells, we adopted the technique of enhanced retroviral mutagen protein complementation assay (22Ding Z. Liang J. Lu Y. Yu Q. Songyang Z. Lin S.Y. Mills G.B. A retrovirus-based protein complementation assay screen reveals functional AKT1-binding partners.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15014-15019Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We identified 32 potential interaction partners that included BCOR, a transcriptional corepressor that specifically inhibits gene expression when recruited to promoter regions by BCL6 (19Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. BCoR, a novel corepressor involved in BCL-6 repression.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from the established importance of BCOR as a BCL6-interacting corepressor, there have been few studies about the role of BCOR in GC B cell development and function. Here we show that BCOR interacts directly with IRF8 and that the BCOR-IRF8 complex enhances transcriptional repression by BCL6. HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Quality Biological Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. NFS202, 18-81, 18-81 Tet-On, WEHI231, and MPC11 cells (all from our laboratory) and OCI-Ly1 (originally provided by Dr. Riccardo Dalla-Favera, Columbia University) were cultured with RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and HEPES. Plasmids for the retrovirus-based protein complementation assay (RePCA) screen were from Odyssey Thera, Inc. (San Ramon, CA). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged full-length and truncated forms (1–390, 356, Del-N, and Del-C) of Irf8 plasmid were described previously and were kindly provided by Dr. Keiko Ozato (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health). The full-length ORFs of Bcor (GenBankTM accession number NM_029510.3) and ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain- or BCL6 binding domain (BBD)-deleted forms of Bcor were cloned in pcDNA4-myc and pTOPO-V5-His (Invitrogen) vectors, respectively. For Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) cotransfection, 5 × 105 HEK293 cells were plated into a 60-mm dish with 2 ml of medium. Each 1.5 μg of DNA was mixed with 2.5 μl of Plus reagent in 500 μl of serum-free medium for 5 min. Then 7.5 μl of Lipofectamine LTX was added, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and loaded onto the cells. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The RePCA screens were performed as described previously (22Ding Z. Liang J. Lu Y. Yu Q. Songyang Z. Lin S.Y. Mills G.B. A retrovirus-based protein complementation assay screen reveals functional AKT1-binding partners.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15014-15019Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the mouse Irf8 gene was cloned by RT-PCR and stably transfected to 18-81 Tet-on cells. Retrovirus-infected cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. After induction of GFP by doxycycline, fluorescent cells were sorted by flow cytometry using an Aria-Green sorter (BD Biosciences). To identify target genes, cDNA was synthesized from expanded clones, and PCR-amplified with a specific intensely fluorescent protein (IFP) C-terminal portion primer and T7 primer, and PCR products were sequenced. Cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and rinsed three times in PBT (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). Samples were incubated with antibody specific for BCOR (Abcam) at 37 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature (1:500). For confocal microscopic analyses, fixed and stained cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective at ambient temperature and processed using ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using an RNeasy Miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized with the Superscript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction volume, one-tenth of which was used as a template for qRT-PCR in the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each PCR procedure included a non-template negative control reaction. The Hprt level was used as the internal control, and ΔC(t) values were calculated according to the 2−ΔΔC(t) method (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(−ΔΔCT) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123070) Google Scholar). -Fold change was determined by normalizing the ΔC(t) values for each gene. Each sample subjected to qRT-PCR was analyzed in triplicate. For promoter repression assays, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 0.25 μg of either pGL3-containing 5× BCL6 or a control promoter reporter construct, 0.1 μg of human Bcor (pcDNA4-Bcor-Myc) or pcDNA4-Irf8, and 0.05 μg of Bcl6 expression plasmid made up to a total 0.35 μg using empty vector. After 30 h, cells were extracted in 110 μl of passive lysis buffer and analyzed in a MicroBeta Luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). All firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the expressed Renilla luciferase activity transfected with pAc-LacZ vector (50 ng). Student's t test was performed to evaluate statistical significance. Cells were lysed in IP Lysis Buffer (Pierce) with protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were precleared with Dynabeads protein G (Cell Signaling Technology) for 0.5 h at room temperature and then incubated with 2.5 μg of antibody of interest-conjugated Dynabeads protein G for 16 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated, washed, and eluted in Laemmli sample buffer with reducing reagent. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer with reducing reagent and separated through 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen). Following transfer, the membrane was incubated with various antibodies as described; anti-IRF8, -BCOR, -BCL6, -MYC, -V5, and -FLAG antibodies were used at a 1:1000–2000 dilution. Goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Pierce; 1:5000) were subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were visualized using the SuperSignal® West Dura Substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated BCOR protein and IRF8 proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TnT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized protein efficiency was checked with SDS-PAGE, and mixtures of both proteins were incubated on ice for 1 h. Dynabeads streptavidin (Invitrogen) was used for precipitation. Precipitated proteins were subjected to 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) followed by immunoblotting. For ChIP assays, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min, quenched by adding 0.125 m glycine, and washed twice with PBS. Fixed samples were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in swelling buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the pellet was suspended in sonication buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture). Sonication efficiency was checked on 2% agarose gels to obtain 100–400 bp of sheared chromatin. Anti-rabbit BCOR antibody (Abcam)-conjugated protein A-agarose was used for precipitation with sheared chromatin. The immune complexes were washed with LiCl buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholic acid) and then eluted by elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Eluted proteins were diluted and subjected to the ReChIP procedure with anti-goat IRF8 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A goat/rabbit serum was used as a control. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and DNA diluted 1:10 was used for PCR. To identify potential partner proteins that influence the biological function of IRF8 in B lineage cells, we screened proteins interacting directly with IRF8 using a retrovirus-based protein complementation assay (22Ding Z. Liang J. Lu Y. Yu Q. Songyang Z. Lin S.Y. Mills G.B. A retrovirus-based protein complementation assay screen reveals functional AKT1-binding partners.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15014-15019Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As bait, we used intensely fluorescent protein N-terminal portion-conjugated full-length mouse IRF8. The bait vector was co-transfected with an IFP C-terminal portion-conjugated cDNA library target vector into the 18-81 mouse pre-B cell line, and cotransfected cells were incubated for 24–48 h. GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1) were purified by FACS to develop sequence information on targets. From sequencing analyses of interacting target clones, a series of potential interaction partners of mIRF8 was identified (Table 1). Importantly, SFPI1 (PU.1) was identified as a binding partner of IRF8 by RePCA, providing a proof of principle because both PU.1 and IRF8 are well known heterodimeric transcription factors sharing IRF binding motifs on target DNA (9Brass A.L. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C.F. Storb U. Singh H. Pip, a lymphoid-restricted IRF, contains a regulatory domain that is important for autoinhibition and ternary complex formation with the Ets factor PU.1.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In particular, the identified potential binding partners, SFPI1, TAF8, GFI1B, NRID2, POLK (DNA polymerase κ), THRB (thyroid hormone receptor β), and BCOR, generally bind to promoter or enhancer DNA sequences to regulate transcriptional activity. Among the binding partners, BCOR was hit three times, implying that BCOR was highly disposed to physically bind or interact with IRF8.TABLE 1Interaction partners of IRF8 identified in RePCA screenGene symbolTimes identifiedSfpi11Sh3bgrl24Csf11Thrb>1Polk1Fbxl18>1Mef2d1Gfi1b1Nr1d2>1Bcor3Blnk1Ccnd1Sost>1Taf81Prtn31 Open table in a new tab To confirm the physical interactions between IRF8 and BCOR, we performed a pulldown study using Myc-tagged mouse BCOR (mBCOR) or human BCOR protein. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a full-length mouse IRF8 expression vector and a Myc-tagged mBCOR construct. mBCOR was pulled down by anti-Myc antibody 48 h after transfection. BCOR was not detected in IRF8 singly transfected control pulldown products, but IRF8 was clearly detected by pulling down Myc-tagged mBCOR/BCOR (Fig. 2A). To determine whether IRF8 and BCOR can interact directly in the absence of other proteins, we translated biotin-BCOR and IRF8 in vitro. Biotin-BCOR alone or mixed with IRF8 was pulled down with streptavidin-coated beads. The results (Fig. 2C) showed that IRF8 forms a complex with BCOR directly in vitro. We also tested for IRF8-BCOR interactions by immunostaining for endogenous BCOR in HEK293 cells transiently expressing GFP-IRF8. Transfected GFP-IRF8 overlapped completely with DAPI-stained nuclei, indicating a dominant location for IRF8 in the nucleus. The pattern for BCOR staining also overlapped with that of GFP-IRF8 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that interactions between BCOR and IRF8 are likely to occur mainly in the nucleus. IRF8 comprises two major functional domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding region and a C-terminal IRF association domain involved in protein-to-protein interactions with other IRF family members as well as additional partner proteins (5Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. ICSBP directs bipotential myeloid progenitor cells to differentiate into mature macrophages.Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To determine which domain of IRF8 is responsible for binding to BCOR, deletion constructs lacking either the N- or C-terminal domains of IRF8 (DelN and DelC, respectively) were prepared (Fig. 3A) and co-transfected with Myc-tagged BCOR into HEK293 cells. Expression levels of Myc-tagged BCOR were comparable in lines co-transfected with IRF8 DelN or DelC. Western blotting using anti-IRF8 antibody identified IRF8 DelN in pulldowns utilizing anti-Myc antibodies. However, IRF8 DelC was not detected in Western blot analyses of cells co-transfected with Myc-BCOR (Fig. 3B). This result clearly showed that the C-terminal domain of IRF8 is required for interactions with BCOR. To better understand the nature of the IRF8 C-terminal binding domain responsible for the interaction with BCOR, we generated a series of C-terminal truncation mutants of IRF8 (Fig. 3C) for co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The 390 construct co-precipitated with Myc-tagged BCOR, but the 356 construct did not (Fig. 3C). In addition, we expressed each of the GFP-IRF8 C-terminal deletion mutants in mammalian cells to determine the subcellular localization of IRF8-BCOR interactions by confocal microscopy. The GFP-tagged α-helix-deleted form of IRF8 (amino acids 1–356) was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm, whereas the full-length and 390 proteins localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the α-helix domain in the C terminus of IRF8 mediates interactions with BCOR much as it does for other IRF8 partner proteins. It also affects the nuclear localization of IRF8 protein and thus the ability of IRF8 to form a complex with BCOR in the nucleus. The structure of BCOR includes a BBD and an ANK domain as shown in Fig. 4. The BCOR BBD in residues 498–514 associates with the BCL6 POZ/BTB domain to form dimers, and the BTB/BBD domain determines the functional activity of BCL6 as a transcriptional repressor (24Ghetu A.F. Corcoran C.M. Cerchietti L. Bardwell V.J. Melnick A. Privé G.G. Structure of a BCOR corepressor peptide in complex with the BCL6 BTB domain dimer.Mol.

Breaking bad in the germinal center: how deregulation of BCL6 contributes to lymphomagenesis.Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested V5-tagged ANK domain- or BBD-deleted BCOR in pulldown assays to determine the region required for binding with IRF8. IRF8 was co-precipitated only with the ANK domain-deleted BCOR (Fig. 4). This result shows that the region of BCOR containing the BBD is important for binding with IRF8 directly as well as with BCL6. BCOR interacts with the POZ domain of BCL6 and acts as transcriptional corepressor to amplify transcriptional repression by BCL6 (19Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. BCoR, a novel corepressor involved in BCL-6 repression.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of IRF8 with BCOR enhances its corepressor activity, we performed luciferase assays in HEK293 cells using a 5× BCL6 binding site construct. In cells co-transfected with BCOR and BCL6, the transcriptional activity of the reporter construct was 10-fold lower than in cells transfected with BCL6 alone (Fig. 5A). Reporter activity in cells co-transfected with BCL6 and IRF8 was 4-fold lower than that in cells transfected with BCL6 alone. Remarkably, when cells were co-transfected with the combination of IRF8, BCOR, and BCL6 expression vectors, luciferase activity was 2-fold lower than in cells co-transfected with the BCOR and BCL6 expression constructs and 20-fold lower than in cells transfected with BCL6 alone. These results indicate that IRF8 augments the corepressor activity of BCOR. These findings prompted us to ask whether IRF8 might be interacting directly with BCL6 or only indirectly through binding to BCOR. We generated FLAG-tagged BCL6 recombinant protein that was co-transfected with IRF8 into HEK293 cells. The exogenous IRF8 protein was co-precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. When we increased the amount of IRF8, the amount of precipitated FLAG-BCL6 also increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). We also detected endogenous protein-protein interaction of IRF8 and BCL6 in the 18-81 pre-B cell line using immune complexes formed using an anti-IRF8 antibody (Fig. 5C). The endogenous BCL6 protein level was comparable for the 18-81 and MPC11 cell lines, but BCL6 was not precipitated with anti-IRF8 antibody in MPC11 cells that expressed no or very little IRF8 protein. This result strongly suggests that IRF8 interacts directly with BCL6 in B lineage cells. To determine whether the proposed nuclear interactions of IRF8 and BCOR are physiologically relevant, we examined the relationships of IRF8 and BCOR DNA targets by comparing ChIP-chip (16Shin D.M. Lee C.H. Morse 3rd, H.C.

Originally discovered in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the products of this gene family participate in the anti-pathogen defenses of the host animals. Full-length He185/333 genes and transcripts are identified. Complete open reading frames of He185/333 homologues are analyzed as to their element structure, single nucleotide polymorphisms, indels and sequence repeats and are subjected to diversification analyses. The sequence elements that compose He185/333 are different to those identified for Sp185/333. Differences between Sp185/333 and He185/333 genes are also evident in the complexity of the sequences of the introns. He185/333 proteins show a diverse range of molecular weights on Western blots. The observed sizes and pIs of the proteins differ from predicted values, suggesting post-translational modifications and oligomerization. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that He185/333 proteins are mainly located on the surface of coelomocyte subpopulations. Our data demonstrate that He185/333 bears the same substantial characteristics as their S. purpuratus homologues. However, we also identify several unique characteristics of He185/333 (such as novel element patterns, sequence repeats, distribution of positively-selected codons and introns), suggesting species-specific adaptations.

https://openalex.org/W1984011208,"Temperature, humidity, vision, and particularly odor, are external cues that play essential roles to mosquito blood feeding and oviposition. Entomological and behavioral studies employ well-established methods to evaluate mosquito attraction or repellency and to identify the source of the blood meal. Despite the efficacy of such methods, the costs involved in the production or acquisition of all parts, components and the chemical reagents involved are unaffordable for most researchers from poor countries. Thus, a simple and relatively low-cost method capable of evaluating mosquito preferences and the blood volume ingested is desirable.By using Evans blue (EB) vital dye and few standard laboratory supplies, we developed and validated a system capable of evaluating mosquito's choice between two different host sources of blood. EB-injected and PBS-injected mice submitted to a number of situations were placed side by side on the top of a rounded recipient covered with tulle fabric and containing Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Homogenates from engorged mosquitoes clearly revealed the blood source (EB- or PBS-injected host), either visually or spectrometrically. This method was able to estimate the number of engorded mosquitoes, the volume of blood ingested, the efficacy of a commercial repellent and the attractant effects of black color and human sweat.Despite the obvious limitations due to its simplicity and to the dependence of a live source of blood, the present method can be used to assess a number of host variables (diet, aging, immunity, etc) and optimized for several aspects of mosquito blood feeding and vector-host interactions. Thus, it is proposed as an alternative to field studies, and it could be used for initial screenings of chemical compound candidates for repellents or attractants, since it replicates natural conditions of exposure to mosquitoes in a laboratory environment."

This work evaluated the soybean biochemical foliar response to brown stink bug herbivory injury through an analysis of redox metabolism and proteomic 2DE profiles of susceptible (BRS Silvania RR) and resistant (IAC-100) varieties. The activity of lipoxygenase-3, guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase was monitored every 24 h up to 96 h. In the susceptible variety, injury caused an increase in the activities of lipoxygenase 3 and guaiacol peroxidase, no change in ascorbate peroxidase, and a decrease in catalase. In the resistant variety, injury did not cause an alteration of any of these enzymes. The proteomic profiles were evaluated after 24 h of injury and revealed to have a similar proportion (4-5%) of differential protein expression in both varieties. The differential proteins, identified by mass spectrometry, in the susceptible variety were related to general stress responses, to plant defense, and to fungal infections. However, in the resistant variety, the identified change in protein profile was related to Calvin cycle enzymes. While the susceptible variety showed adaptive changes in redox metabolism and expression of stress-responsive proteins, the resistant showed a defense response to circumvent the biological stressor."
https://openalex.org/W2140156980,"The Metnase fusion gene consists of a SET histone methyltransferase domain and a transposase domain from Mariner transposase. This transposable element is involved in chromosome decatenation, enhances DNA repair, promotes foreign DNA integration, and assists topoisomerase II function. This study investigates the role of Metnase in colon cancer homeostasis and maintenance of the stemness phenotype in colon cancer stem cells (CSCs). Silencing of Metnase was performed in human cancer cell lines before and after treatment with cisplatin, and in colon CSCs. Subsequent changes in the expression of genes involved in repair mechanisms, DNA synthesis, topoisomerase II function, and metastasis as well stemness transcription factors were studied with RT-qPCR experiments. Cellular viability and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. The results suggest that Metnase influences the expression of many genes involved in the above processes. Furthermore, Metnase levels appear to impact upon expression of NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2. Suppression of Metnase also led to an increase in apoptosis. Therefore, Metnase may possess an important role in DNA repair, topoisomerase II function, and the maintenance of stemness during colon cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2006242737,"In this study, we propose an approach aiming at fine-mapping adiposity QTL in chicken, integrating whole genome re-sequencing data. First, two QTL regions for adiposity were identified by performing a classical linkage analysis on 1362 offspring in 11 sire families obtained by crossing two meat-type chicken lines divergently selected for abdominal fat weight. Those regions, located on chromosome 7 and 19, contained a total of 77 and 84 genes, respectively. Then, SNPs and indels in these regions were identified by re-sequencing sires. Considering issues related to polymorphism annotations for regulatory regions, we focused on the 120 and 104 polymorphisms having an impact on protein sequence, and located in coding regions of 35 and 42 genes situated in the two QTL regions. Subsequently, a filter was applied on SNPs considering their potential impact on the protein function based on conservation criteria. For the two regions, we identified 42 and 34 functional polymorphisms carried by 18 and 24 genes, and likely to deeply impact protein, including 3 coding indels and 4 nonsense SNPs. Finally, using gene functional annotation, a short list of 17 and 4 polymorphisms in 6 and 4 functional genes has been defined. Even if we cannot exclude that the causal polymorphisms may be located in regulatory regions, this strategy gives a complete overview of the candidate polymorphisms in coding regions and prioritize them on conservation- and functional-based arguments."

It is known that oxLDL activates expression of a series of atherogenic genes and their oxPLs contribute to their biological activities. In this study we present the effects of 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) on gene expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages using cDNA microarrays. PGPC affected the regulation of 146 genes, whereas POVPC showed only very minor effects. PGPC preferentially influenced expression of genes related to cell death, angiogenesis, cholesterol efflux, procoagulant mechanisms, atherogenesis, inflammation, and cell cycle. Many of these effects are known from studies with oxLDL or oxidized 1-hexadecanoyl-2-eicosatetra-5′,8′,11′,14′-enoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (oxPAPC), containing PGPC in addition to other oxPL species. It is known that POVPC efficiently reacts with proteins by Schiff base formation, whereas PGPC only physically interacts with its biological targets. POVPC seems to affect cell physiology to a great extent on the protein level, whereas PGPC gives rise to both the modulation of protein function and regulation on the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2037942529,"The core alpha1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) catalyzes the transfer of a fucosyl moiety from GDP-fucose to the innermost asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue of glycoproteins. In mammals, this glycosylation has an important function in many fundamental biological processes and although no essential role has been demonstrated yet in all animals, FUT8 amino acid (aa) sequence and FUT8 activity are very well conserved throughout the animal kingdom. We have cloned the cDNA and the complete gene encoding the FUT8 in the Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) lepidopteran cell line. As in most animal genomes, fut8 is a single-copy gene organized in different exons. The open reading frame contains 12 exons, a characteristic that seems to be shared by all lepidopteran fut8 genes. We chose to study the gene structure as a way to characterize the evolutionary relationships of the fut8 genes in metazoans. Analysis of the intron-exon organization in 56 fut8 orthologs allowed us to propose a model for fut8 evolution in metazoans. The presence of a highly variable number of exons in metazoan fut8 genes suggests a complex evolutionary history with many intron gain and loss events, particularly in arthropods, but not in chordata. Moreover, despite the high conservation of lepidoptera FUT8 sequences also in vertebrates and hymenoptera, the exon-intron organization of hymenoptera fut8 genes is order-specific with no shared exons. This feature suggests that the observed intron losses and gains may be linked to evolutionary innovations, such as the appearance of new orders."
https://openalex.org/W2003375498,"Phosphorylation is a fundamental biochemical reaction that modulates protein activity in cells. While a single phosphorylation event is relatively easy to understand, multisite phosphorylation requires systems approaches for deeper elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this paper we develop a mechanistic model for single- and multi-site phosphorylation. The proposed model is compared with previously reported studies. We compare the predictions of our model with experiments published in the literature in the context of inflammatory signaling events in order to provide a mechanistic description of the multisite phosphorylation-mediated regulation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF-5) proteins. The presented model makes crucial predictions for transcription factor phosphorylation events in the immune system. The model proposes potential mechanisms for T cell phenotype switching and production of cytokines. This study also provides a generic framework for the better understanding of a large number of multisite phosphorylation-regulated biochemical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1976245903,"In total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) of upper thoracic spine including the second thoracic (T2) vertebra, T2 nerve roots are usually transected. In this study, we examined the association between transection of the T2 nerve roots and upper-extremity motor function in patients with upper thoracic TES.We assessed 16 patients who underwent upper thoracic TES with bilateral transection of the T2 nerve roots. Patients were divided into three groups: 3 patients without any processing of T1 and upper nerve roots (T2 group), 7 with extensive dissection of T1 nerve roots (T1-2 group), and 6 with extensive dissection of T1 and upper nerve roots (C-T2 group). Postoperative upper-extremity motor function was compared between the groups.Postoperative deterioration of upper-extremity motor function was observed in 9 of the 16 patients (56.3%). Three of the 7 patients in the T1-2 group and all 6 patients in the C-T2 group showed deterioration of upper-extremity motor function, but there was no deterioration in the T2 group. In the T1-2 group, 3 patients showed mild deterioration that did not affect their activities of daily living and they achieved complete recovery at the latest follow-up examination. In contrast, severe dysfunction occurred frequently in the C-T2 group, without recovery at the latest follow-up.The transection of the T2 nerve roots alone did not result in upper-extremity motor dysfunction; rather, the dysfunction is caused by the extensive dissection of the T1 and upper nerve roots. Therefore, transection of the T2 nerve roots in upper thoracic TES seems to be an acceptable procedure with satisfactory outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2030546462,"The continuous expansion of nosocomial infections around the globe has become a precarious situation. Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2054233363,"Eag (Kv10) and Erg (Kv11) belong to two distinct subfamilies of the ether-à-go-go K+ channel family (KCNH). While Erg channels are characterized by an inward-rectifying current-voltage relationship that results from a C-type inactivation, mammalian Eag channels display little or no voltage-dependent inactivation. Although the amino (N)-terminal region such as the eag domain is not required for the C-type inactivation of Erg channels, an N-terminal deletion in mouse Eag1 has been shown to produce a voltage-dependent inactivation. To further discern the role of the eag domain in the inactivation of Eag1 channels, we generated N-terminal chimeras between rat Eag (rEag1) and human Erg (hERG1) channels that involved swapping the eag domain alone or the complete cytoplasmic N-terminal region. Functional analyses indicated that introduction of the homologous hERG1 eag domain led to both a fast phase and a slow phase of channel inactivation in the rEag1 chimeras. By contrast, the inactivation features were retained in the reverse hERG1 chimeras. Furthermore, an eag domain-lacking rEag1 deletion mutant also showed the fast phase of inactivation that was notably attenuated upon co-expression with the rEag1 eag domain fragment, but not with the hERG1 eag domain fragment. Additionally, we have identified a point mutation in the S4-S5 linker region of rEag1 that resulted in a similar inactivation phenotype. Biophysical analyses of these mutant constructs suggested that the inactivation gating of rEag1 was distinctly different from that of hERG1. Overall, our findings are consistent with the notion that the eag domain plays a critical role in regulating the inactivation gating of rEag1. We propose that the eag domain may destabilize or mask an inherent voltage-dependent inactivation of rEag1 K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2011207892,"Afadin is an actin filament-binding protein that acts cooperatively in cell adhesion with the cell adhesion molecule nectin, and in directional cell movement with the small G protein Rap1 in a nectin-independent manner. We studied the role of afadin in the organization of the small intestinal epithelium using afadin conditional gene knockout (cKO) mice. Afadin was localized at adherens junctions of all types of epithelial cells throughout the crypt-villus axis. Paneth cells were localized at the base of the crypt in control mice, but not confined there, and migrated into the villi in afadin-cKO mice. The distribution of other types of epithelial cells did not change significantly in the mutant mice. The Paneth cells remaining in the crypt exhibited abnormal shapes, were buried between adjacent cells, and did not face the lumen. In these cells, the formation of adherens junctions and tight junctions was impaired. Rap1 and EphB3 were highly expressed in control Paneth cells but markedly down-regulated in the afadin-deficient Paneth cells. Taken together, the results indicate that afadin plays a role in the restricted localization of Paneth cells at the base of the crypt by maintaining their adhesion to adjacent crypt cells and inhibiting their movement toward the top of villi."
https://openalex.org/W2091650180,"Recruitment of bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (BMDEPCs) alleviates multiple organ injury (MOI) and improves outcomes. However, mechanisms mediating BMDEPC recruitment following septic MOI remain largely unknown. This study characterized the kinetics of BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation and defined the role of NF-κB in regulating BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation.Chimeric mice with an intact or disrupted NF-κB p50 gene and BMDEPC-restricted expression of green fluorescent protein were created and injected with LPS (2 mg/kg, i.p.). BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation in multiple organs were quantified. BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation are highly organ-dependent. Lungs had the highest number of BMDEPC recruitment, whereas heart, liver and kidney had only a small fraction of the number of BMDEPCs in lungs. Number of proliferating BMDEPCs was several-fold higher in lungs than in other 3 organs. Kinetically, BMDEPC recruitment into different organs showed different time course profiles. NF-κB plays obligatory roles in mediating BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation. Universal deletion of NF-κB p50 gene inhibited LPS-induced BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation by 95% and 69% in heart. However, the contribution of NF-κB to these regulations varies significantly between organs. In liver, universal p50 gene deletion reduced LPS-induced BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation only by 49% and 35%. NF-κB activities in different tissue compartments play distinct roles. Selective p50 gene deletion either in stromal/parenchymal cells or in BM/blood cells inhibited BMDEPC recruitment by a similar extent. However, selective p50 gene deletion in BM/blood cells inhibited, but in stromal/parenchymal cells augmented BMDEPC proliferation.BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation display different kinetics in different organs following endotoxemic MOI. NF-κB plays obligatory and organ-dependent roles in regulating BMDEPC recruitment and proliferation. NF-κB activities in different tissue compartments play distinct roles in regulating BMDEPC proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2058246242,"Genome-wide studies have revealed that genes commonly have a high density of RNA polymerase II just downstream of the transcription start site. This has raised the possibility that genes are commonly regulated by transcriptional elongation, but this remains largely untested in vivo, particularly in vertebrates. Here, we show that the proximal promoter from the Rhox5 homeobox gene recruits polymerase II and begins elongating in all tissues and cell lines that we tested, but it only completes elongation in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Relief of the elongation block is associated with recruitment of the elongation factor P-TEFb, the co-activator GRIP1, the chromatin remodeling factor BRG1, and specific histone modifications. We provide evidence that two mechanisms relieve the elongation block at the proximal promoter: demethylation and recruitment of androgen receptor. Together, our findings support a model in which promoter proximal pausing helps confer tissue-specific and developmental gene expression through a mechanism regulated by DNA demethylation-dependent nuclear hormone receptor recruitment."
