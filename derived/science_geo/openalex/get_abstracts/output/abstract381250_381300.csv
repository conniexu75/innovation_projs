https://openalex.org/W2045868744,"N-linked glycosylation is a biologically important protein modification, but only a small fraction of modification sites have been mapped. We developed a ""filter aided sample preparation"" (FASP)-based method in which glycopeptides are enriched by binding to lectins on the top of a filter and mapped 6367 N-glycosylation sites on 2352 proteins in four mouse tissues and blood plasma using high-accuracy mass spectrometry. We found 74% of known mouse N-glycosites and discovered an additional 5753 sites on a diverse range of proteins. Sites almost always have the N-!P-[S|T]-!P (where !P is not proline) and rarely the N-X-C motif or nonconsensus sequences. Combining the FASP approach with analysis of subcellular glycosite localization reveals that the sites always orient toward the extracellular space or toward the lumen of ER, Golgi, lysosome, or peroxisome. The N-glycoproteome contains a plethora of modification sites on factors important in development, organ-specific functions, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2077562677,"A genome-wide analysis in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana of the positioning of the nucleosomes — the nucleoprotein molecules that organize and control access to genomic DNA — combined with profiles of DNA methylation at single-base resolution, reveals 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA. The results suggest that nucleosome position influences DNA methylation patterning in the genome, and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. Similar trends were observed in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Nucleosomes are composed of around 147 bases of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. Here, a genome-wide analysis of nucleosome positioning in Arabidopsis thaliana has been combined with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, revealing 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA. The results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences the pattern of DNA methylation throughout the genome. Nucleosomes compact and regulate access to DNA in the nucleus, and are composed of approximately 147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer1,2. Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron–exon and exon–intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition."

Goldman et al. find that acupuncture elevates local tissue adenosine levels in a mouse model. The anti-nociceptive effect of acupuncture was absent in mice lacking the adenosine receptor A1. Acupuncture is an invasive procedure commonly used to relieve pain. Acupuncture is practiced worldwide, despite difficulties in reconciling its principles with evidence-based medicine. We found that adenosine, a neuromodulator with anti-nociceptive properties, was released during acupuncture in mice and that its anti-nociceptive actions required adenosine A1 receptor expression. Direct injection of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist replicated the analgesic effect of acupuncture. Inhibition of enzymes involved in adenosine degradation potentiated the acupuncture-elicited increase in adenosine, as well as its anti-nociceptive effect. These observations indicate that adenosine mediates the effects of acupuncture and that interfering with adenosine metabolism may prolong the clinical benefit of acupuncture."
https://openalex.org/W2123799993,"Many RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes to generate specialized sites for RNA replication. How membranes are remodeled and what properties make them conducive for replication are unknown. Here we show how RNA viruses can manipulate multiple components of the cellular secretory pathway to generate organelles specialized for replication that are distinct in protein and lipid composition from the host cell. Specific viral proteins modulate effector recruitment by Arf1 GTPase and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, promoting preferential recruitment of phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ) to membranes over coat proteins, yielding uncoated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) lipid-enriched organelles. The PI4P-rich lipid microenvironment is essential for both enteroviral and flaviviral RNA replication; PI4KIIIβ inhibition interferes with this process; and enteroviral RNA polymerases specifically bind PI4P. These findings reveal how RNA viruses can selectively exploit specific elements of the host to form specialized organelles where cellular phosphoinositide lipids are key to regulating viral RNA replication.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiYWYzMzZiMGIyOGVlMDUyOTU2NzU4ZjkyYzk2ZjBkYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkwMTMwMzI2fQ.QfSDmuOz0lNtiMfqGakMI6Grq6JTBVGIUPP5LmrMattOgv9Bj_ReyzlJowyVF26tbpPnUBE2FfNP0_mY8unclrzouNhn4CBNha2mAmbiV3Au82xH7sLY2x5DFeLw43lyc__BC1zFU8dLOAbTAnm9sgR8e1Z7Iy3KxpJDfOPFsgG5JcqZ9CXHA4IV6aT86vg645rN57lqspk-705KbC_sZIuw3snxNQ73p3vSOKHNo8R67itrIOO346XtXhLvyq-C6UXF4WlggFtLhvidSEwRtNxTpADT3PC1CyODcGnOQOLjtBqPgPER7Py4V-4TORjVXazANboG4A5BWaFOrpx_rA(mp4, (14.04 MB) Download video"

https://openalex.org/W2113455273,"NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic modifications, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are essential for brain development and function. LTD occurs mainly by the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of caspase-3 via mitochondria is required for LTD and AMPA receptor internalization in hippocampal neurons. LTD and AMPA receptor internalization are blocked by peptide inhibitors of caspase-3 and -9. In hippocampal slices from caspase-3 knockout mice, LTD is abolished whereas LTP remains normal. LTD is also prevented by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP or Bcl-xL, and by a mutant Akt1 protein that is resistant to caspase-3 proteolysis. NMDA receptor stimulation that induces LTD transiently activates caspase-3 in dendrites, without causing cell death. These data indicate an unexpected causal link between the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and LTD.

Long-lasting changes in the structure and function of synapses are important for CNS development and underlie information storage in the brain. LTP and LTD are long-lasting modifications of synapses, particularly well-studied in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Induction of NMDA receptor-dependent LTD in CA1 (typically by prolonged low frequency stimulation) requires Ca2+ influx and the serine/threonine phosphatases calcineurin/PP2B and PP1 (Malenka and Bear, 2004Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Trafficking of AMPA receptors to and away from the synapse determines the abundance of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. LTD involves the removal and internalization of AMPA receptors from synapses (Collingridge et al., 2004Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T. Wang Y.T. Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LTD, particularly the signaling pathways that couple NMDA receptor stimulation to AMPA receptor internalization, remain largely unknown. Recent studies have implicated the small GTPase Rap and protein kinases p38 and GSK3β in LTD (Peineau et al., 2007Peineau S. Taghibiglou C. Bradley C. Wong T.P. Liu L. Lu J. Lo E. Wu D. Saule E.

Caspases are cysteine proteases with well-established functions in the execution of apoptosis. The caspase-9-caspase-3 cascade is activated by proapoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c released from mitochondria, and restrained by cellular IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) (Srinivasula and Ashwell, 2008Srinivasula S.M. Ashwell J.D. IAPs: what's in a name?.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is inhibited by anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (such as Bcl-xL) and stimulated by proapoptotic members (such as BAX and BAK) (Youle and Strasser, 2008Youle R.J. Strasser A. The BCL-2 protein family: opposing activities that mediate cell death.Nature reviews. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, active caspases are also detected in nonapoptotic cells. In neurons, mitochondria as well as caspases are present in dendrites, axons and pre- and postsynaptic terminals, and there is evidence that caspases can be activated in dendrites, synaptosomes and growth cones (Campbell and Holt, 2003Campbell D.S.

Here, we report that LTD and AMPA receptor internalization in hippocampal neurons require the activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3/7, and can be blocked by overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and XIAP. Caspase-3 can be transiently activated via the mitochondrial pathway by stimulating NMDA receptors, without causing cell death; and hippocampal slices from caspase-3 knockout mice lose specifically their ability to undergo NMDA receptor-dependent LTD. These findings reveal a critical role of the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation in synaptic depression. We investigated the role of caspases in synaptic plasticity of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in acute rat hippocampal slices (3–4 weeks age) (Figure 1). In the first series of experiments, slices were incubated with cell-permeant caspase inhibitor peptides: DEVD-FMK (2 μM; an inhibitor with selectivity against caspases-3, -7, -8); LEHD-FMK (2 μM; a caspase-9-preferring inhibitor with less potent activity against caspases-6, -8, -2); YVAD-FMK (5 μM; caspase-1-selective inhibitor); and WEHD-FMK (200 nM; an inhibitor with preference for caspase-1 and caspase-8) (Garcia-Calvo et al., 1998Garcia-Calvo M.

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in area CA1 in response to stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs. Bath application of DEVD-FMK blocked LTD induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 1 Hz for 900 s; 98 ± 2% of baseline in DEVD-FMK; 75 ± 3% of baseline in control untreated slices, p < 0.01, n = 6, Figure 1A). Importantly, DEVD-FMK had no effect on LTP induced by tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz, 4 trains; 142 ± 5% of baseline in DEVD-FMK; 140 ± 5% in control, n = 6, Figure 1B), suggesting that the peptide was not nonspecifically toxic. A different peptide, LEHD-FMK, also blocked LTD (97 ± 3%, n = 6, Figure 1C), without affecting LTP (146 ± 5%, n = 6, Figure 1D). Neither LTD nor LTP were affected by YVAD-FMK and WEHD-FMK, similar to the negative control peptide FA-FMK (10 μM; which should not affect caspase activity) (Figures 1E and 1F; Figures S1A and S1B available online). In contrast to DEVD- and LEHD-FMK, bath application of LLY-FMK (5 μM; an inhibitor of calpain) blocked LTP but not LTD (Figures S1C and S1D). The sensitivity of LTP to a calpain inhibitor is consistent with a previous report (Denny et al., 1990Denny J.B. Polan-Curtain J. Ghuman A. Wayner M.J. Armstrong D.L. Calpain inhibitors block long-term potentiation.Brain Res. 1990; 534: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Figure S1Related to Figure 1, Caspase-1 Inhibitor WEHD-FMK and Calpain Inhibitor LLY-FMK No Not Inhibit LTD, and Lack of Effect of DEVD-FMK on Basal Synaptic TransmissionShow full caption(A–D) For extracellular field potential recordings, acute hippocampal slices were incubated with 200 nM WEHD-FMK or 5 μM LLY-FMK, as in Figure 1.

Error bars indicate the mean ± SEM. LFS, low frequency stimulation; Tet, tetanic stimulation. We measured basal fEPSP slope before and after the application of 2 μM DEVD-FMK, and found no significant change after 2 hr exposure (Figure S1E). Thus the caspase inhibitor blocked LTD without affecting basal synaptic transmission over the time course of LTD experiments. The fact that DEVD- and LEHD-FMK specifically blocked LTD without affecting LTP or basal synaptic strength argues against nonspecific effects of these peptides on synaptic transmission. DEVD-, LEHD-, YVAD- and WEHD-FMK show differential potency against individual caspases (Garcia-Calvo et al., 1998Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

We thus inferred that a subset of caspases (most likely caspase-3/7 and caspase-9) is required for induction of LTD, but not LTP. Because the peptide inhibitors show limited selectivity for individual caspases, we additionally used molecular approaches to inhibit caspases. We overexpressed caspase-inhibitor proteins XIAP, CrmA, and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in CA1 neurons of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. XIAP (X chromosome-linked inhibitory apoptosis protein) is an inhibitor of caspase-3, -7 and -9 (Deveraux et al., 1998Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M.

CrmA (a cowpox serpin) is a selective inhibitor of caspase-1, -5, and -8 (Garcia-Calvo et al., 1998Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

CA1 neurons were biolistically transfected with plasmids expressing Bcl-xL or XIAP (plus GFP as transfection marker) and recorded in whole-cell patch-clamp mode. LTD or LTP of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses was induced by pairing protocols (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We first analyzed the effect on basal synaptic transmission by comparing EPSCs evoked in pairs of transfected and neighboring untransfected cells in the same slice using the same stimulus position and intensity. Overexpression of Bcl-xL caused an increase in amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs (Bcl-xL-transfected cells: 286 ± 18 pA, n = 11; untransfected cells: 147 ± 14 pA, n = 11, p < 0.01; Figure 2A left). However, Bcl-xL had no effect on the NMDA receptor-mediated component of EPSC compared to untransfected cells in the same slices (transfected cells: 154 ± 9 pA; untransfected: 146 ± 13 pA, p > 0.05; Figure 2A, right). Overexpression of XIAP-Bir1,2 also caused an increase in basal AMPA-EPSCs (XIAP-Bir1,2: 316 ± 15 pA, n = 11; untransfected: 186 ± 15 pA, n = 11, p < 0.01; Figure 2B), without affecting NMDA-EPSCs (XIAP-Bir1,2: 188 ± 11 pA, n = 11; untransfected: 179 ± 10 pA, n = 11; Figure 2B). In contrast to Bcl-xL and XIAP-Bir1,2, CrmA did not change either AMPA-EPSC (CrmA: 202 ± 15 pA, n = 10; untransfected: 210 ± 16 pA, n = 10, p > 0.05; Figure 2C) or NMDA-EPSC amplitudes (CrmA: 164 ± 10 pA; untransfected: 174 ± 11 pA, p > 0.05; Figure 2C). Even though they showed a higher basal EPSC, neurons overexpressing Bcl-xL or XIAP-Bir1,2 were unable to undergo LTD (Bcl-xL: 97 ± 4%, n = 8; XIAP-Bir1,2: 97 ± 5%, n = 8; Figure 2D). Similarly, LTD was abolished in CA1 neurons transfected with XIAP-Bir3 (101 ± 3%, n = 8; Figure 2E). In cells transfected with CrmA, however, LTD was unaffected (66 ± 6%, n = 8; Figure 2E). The induction of LTP was normal in cells transfected with Bcl-xL, XIAP-Bir1,2 or XIAP-Bir3 (138 ± 5%, 146 ± 5% and 143 ± 8% of baseline, respectively; n = 7 for each condition; Figure 2F). Control untransfected neurons, as expected, showed robust LTD (64 ± 4%, n = 6; Figure 2D) as well as LTP (147 ± 9%, n = 6). The lack of effect on LTP implies that Bcl-xL, XIAP-Bir3 and XIAP-Bir-1,2 overexpression are not nonspecifically inhibiting synaptic function and plasticity. In line with the pharmacological data, the overexpression experiments support the idea that activity of caspases -9 and -3/7 are crucial for LTD. Moreover, the blockade of LTD by Bcl-xL and XIAP-Bir3 suggests that these caspases are activated by the mitochondrial pathway. The pharmacological approach has inherent problems with specificity, and there are also caveats with overexpression of proteins such as XIAP, Bcl-xL for several days. For further corroboration, we studied synaptic plasticity in caspase-3 knockout mice. In the C57BL/6 background, the homozygous caspase-3 knockout mice are viable, reach adulthood and display minimal brain histopathology (Leonard et al., 2002Leonard J.R. Klocke B.J. D'Sa C. Flavell R.A. Roth K.A. Strain-dependent neurodevelopmental abnormalities in caspase-3-deficient mice.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). LTD and LTP were measured in acute hippocampal slices taken from caspase-3 knockout (−/−) mice or wild-type controls (2–4 weeks age). There was no difference between wild-type and knockout animals with respect to input/output relationship upon stimulation of Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses (Figure 3A : p > 0.05, n = 16), indicating that loss of caspase-3 did not affect the strength of basal synaptic transmission. Although it robustly induced synaptic depression in wild-type hippocampal slices, LFS (1 Hz, 900 pulses) failed to induce LTD in caspase-3 knockout slices (caspase-3−/−: 97 ± 6% of baseline; wild-type: 77 ± 5%, n = 6 slices from 6 animals, p < 0.01; Figure 3B). The plasticity defect in caspase-3 deficient animals was specific for LTD, as induction of LTP was remarkably normal. Two trains of tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses) resulted in LTP that was similar in magnitude in caspase-3 knockout and wild-type hippocampus (caspase-3−/−: 154 ± 8% of baseline; wild-type: 149 ± 3%, n = 6 slices from 6 animals, p > 0.05; Figure 3C). The electrophysiological findings in knockout mice indicate a crucial role for caspase-3 in LTD, consistent with the results from pharmacological and overexpression experiments. The expression of AMPA receptors (GluR1 and GluR2) and NMDA receptors (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) in caspase-3−/− hippocampi was similar to wild-type by immunoblotting (Figure S2). The block of LTD by DEVD-FMK and LEHD-FMK suggests that caspases may regulate the inducible internalization of AMPA receptors. To test this hypothesis, we measured AMPA receptor endocytosis in dissociated hippocampal neurons using an “antibody feeding” internalization assay (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Clathrin adaptor AP2 and NSF interact with overlapping sites of GluR2 and play distinct roles in AMPA receptor trafficking and hippocampal LTD.Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Treatment of hippocampal neurons (DIV18) with NMDA (50 μM for 10 min) stimulated internalization of endogenous AMPA receptors (Figure 4). The internalization of GluR2 induced by NMDA was abolished by treatment with DEVD- and LEHD-, but not by YVAD- or WEHD-FMK (Figures 4A and 4C). DEVD and LEHD also blocked NMDA-induced internalization of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit (Figures 4B and 4C). The basal internalization of GluR2 (i.e., that occurring in unstimulated neurons) was unchanged by caspase inhibitors (Figure S3). These data indicate that DEVD- and LEHD-sensitive caspases are specifically required for the inducible internalization of AMPA receptors.Figure S3Related to Figure 4, Caspase Inhibitors Do Not Affect Basal Internalization of GluR2Show full captionAntibody-feeding internalization assay for endogenous GluR2 in cultured hippocampal neurons.(A) Neurons were pretreated with various caspase inhibitors (5 μM), as indicated.

The scale bar represents 20 μm. To obtain additional nonpharmacological evidence to support the importance of caspases in AMPA receptor internalization, we overexpressed in neurons XIAP, Bcl-xL or CrmA. Transfection of XIAP-Bir1,2, XIAP-Bir3 or Bcl-xL in hippocampal neurons prevented NMDA-induced internalization of GluR2 (Figures 5A and 5C ). NMDA-stimulated GluR1 internalization was also inhibited by XIAP-Bir1,2, XIAP-Bir3 and Bcl-xL, though not as completely as for GluR2 (Figures 5B and 5C). In contrast, overexpression of CrmA did not significantly reduce NMDA-induced internalization of GluR2 or GluR1 (Figures 5A–5C). Basal internalization of GluR2 (Figure S4A ) and surface expression of GluR2 (Figures S4B and S4C) were unaffected by any of these constructs. Finally, we found that NMDA-induced GluR2 internalization was completely abolished in hippocampal neurons from caspase-3 knockout mice (Figures S4D and S4E). Together, the molecular genetic and pharmacological data argue that the activity of caspases-9 and -3/7 is critical for inducible AMPA receptor internalization.Figure S4Related to Figure 5, Antiapoptotic Proteins Do Not Affect Basal Internalization and Surface Expression of GluR2, and Loss of NMDA-Induced GluR2 Internalization in Caspse-3 Knockout Hippocampal NeuronsShow full caption(A–C) Cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV14) were transfected with Bcl-xL, XIAP-Bir1,2, XIAP-Bir3, CrmA, or β-gal.

https://openalex.org/W1972013835,"Genes include cis-regulatory regions that contain transcriptional enhancers. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. It has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness. We tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of Drosophila larval trichomes. At optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. In embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. These temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cDNA. Finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning, causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. These results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability."

As Hox gene disruption often has pleiotropic effects, the root cause of this behavioral deficit was unclear. Here we report that, in the brain, Hoxb8 cell lineage exclusively labels bone marrow-derived microglia. Furthermore, transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into Hoxb8 mutant mice rescues their pathological phenotype. It has been suggested that the grooming dysfunction results from a nociceptive defect, also exhibited by Hoxb8 mutant mice. However, bone marrow transplant experiments and cell type-specific disruption of Hoxb8 reveal that these two phenotypes are separable, with the grooming phenotype derived from the hematopoietic lineage and the sensory defect derived from the spinal cord cells. Immunological dysfunctions have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, but the causative relationships are unclear. In this mouse, a distinct compulsive behavioral disorder is associated with mutant microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2113390309,"Spinal cord injury leads to flaccid paralysis resulting from the loss of descending serotonergic modulation. Murray et al. demonstrate that spontaneous recovery of motoneuron excitability is associated with alternative mRNA editing and increased expression of constitutively active 5HT2C serotonin receptors. Activation of these receptors leads to large persistent calcium currents, sustained muscle contractions and restoration of locomotion. However, in the absence of descending modulation from the brain, this leads to spasticity. Inhibiting constitutive 5-HT receptor activity is effective in reducing spasticity in rats and humans following spinal cord injury. Muscle paralysis after spinal cord injury is partly caused by a loss of brainstem-derived serotonin (5-HT), which normally maintains motoneuron excitability by regulating crucial persistent calcium currents. Here we examine how over time motoneurons compensate for lost 5-HT to regain excitability. We find that, months after a spinal transection in rats, changes in post-transcriptional editing of 5-HT2C receptor mRNA lead to increased expression of 5-HT2C receptor isoforms that are spontaneously active (constitutively active) without 5-HT. Such constitutive receptor activity restores large persistent calcium currents in motoneurons in the absence of 5-HT. We show that this helps motoneurons recover their ability to produce sustained muscle contractions and ultimately enables recovery of motor functions such as locomotion. However, without regulation from the brain, these sustained contractions can also cause debilitating muscle spasms. Accordingly, blocking constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors with SB206553 or cyproheptadine, in both rats and humans, largely eliminates these calcium currents and muscle spasms, providing a new rationale for antispastic drug therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2056775918,"Basophils initiate T helper type 2 responses after exposure to allergens and IgE immune complexes. Juan Rivera and his colleagues find that elevated amounts of IgE in Lyn−/− mice drive basophil activation, secretion of T helper type 2 cytokines and production of autoantibodies, leading to a lupus-like phenotype in mice and to glomerulonephritis. Depletion of basophils or deficiencies in IgE or interleukin-4 are sufficient to reduce autoantibody production and prevent kidney damage. Data from subjects with SLE suggest that increased IgE levels and activated basophils may contribute to disease. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), self-reactive antibodies can target the kidney (lupus nephritis), leading to functional failure and possible mortality. We report that activation of basophils by autoreactive IgE causes their homing to lymph nodes, promoting T helper type 2 (TH2) cell differentiation and enhancing the production of self-reactive antibodies that cause lupus-like nephritis in mice lacking the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn (Lyn−/− mice). Individuals with SLE also have elevated serum IgE, self-reactive IgEs and activated basophils that express CD62 ligand (CD62L) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), parameters that are associated with increased disease activity and active lupus nephritis. Basophils were also present in the lymph nodes and spleen of subjects with SLE. Thus, in Lyn−/− mice, basophils and IgE autoantibodies amplify autoantibody production that leads to lupus nephritis, and in individuals with SLE IgE autoantibodies and activated basophils are factors associated with disease activity and nephritis."

We find that resveratrol selectively remodels three of these conformers (soluble oligomers, fibrillar intermediates, and amyloid fibrils) into an alternative aggregated species that is non-toxic, high molecular weight, and unstructured. Surprisingly, resveratrol does not remodel non-toxic oligomers or accelerate Aβ monomer aggregation despite that both conformers possess random coil secondary structures indistinguishable from soluble oligomers and significantly different from their β-sheet rich, fibrillar counterparts.

In addition, the OC antibody also recognizes amyloid fibrils but not monomers or soluble prefibrillar oligomers. Importantly, both A11 and OC antibodies recognize many aggregated conformers that overlap in size on a Western blot (47Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J.

Neurodegener. 2007; 2: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), a finding that further emphasizes the importance of classifying such misfolded conformers in terms of structure. Although many small molecules have been identified that antagonize the aggregation of Αβ and related polypeptides (for review, see Refs. 53Bulic B. Pickhardt M. Schmidt B. Mandelkow E.M. Waldmann H.

Reasons for this include the difficulty in preparing and detecting different aggregated conformers, the lack of suitable conformational controls to evaluate if small molecules are sequence- or conformation-specific, and the overreliance on amyloid-specific dyes (which can be misleading) to detect inhibition of protein aggregation. Nevertheless, several insightful studies are emerging on the conformational specificity of small molecule antagonists of Αβ aggregation (40Necula M. Kayed R. Milton S. Glabe C.G. J. Biol.

Their findings suggest that different small molecules can selectively inhibit formation of two unique aggregated conformers (soluble prefibrillar oligomers and amyloid fibrils). A limitation of this intriguing study is that it is difficult to determine whether a small molecule prevents the formation of a specific aggregated conformer or accelerates its conversion into another one (e.g. Ref. 56Necula M.

We posit that analyzing the impact of small molecules on a panel of preformed Aβ conformational variants is the most direct approach for elucidating their conformational specificity. Therefore, we have formed four well characterized Αβ conformations (soluble oligomers, non-toxic oligomers, fibrillar intermediates, and amyloid fibrils) in addition to monomeric Αβ. For each of these conformations, we have evaluated the capacity of resveratrol, a small polyphenol of broad biological interest (64Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J.

Resveratrol (a well known constituent of red wine), like many other polyphenols, displays apparent anti-aggregation activity for Αβ (60Feng Y. Wang X.P. Yang S.G. Wang Y.J. Zhang X. Du X.T. Sun X.X.

Drug Des. 2007; 70: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), but its conformational specificity for different Aβ conformers is poorly understood. Herein, we report the discovery that resveratrol selectively remodels a subset of aggregated Aβ conformers with highly dissimilar biochemical properties into a common, off-pathway aggregated conformer that is non-toxic. Aβ1–42 (American Peptide) was dissolved in an aqueous 50% acetonitrile solution (1 mg/ml), separated into aliquots, dried under vacuum, lyophilized, and then stored at −20 °C. For preparing soluble prefibrillar oligomers and non-toxic oligomers under quiescent conditions and fibrillar intermediates under agitated conditions, aliquots of Aβ were first dissolved in 100% hexafluoroisopropanol (Fluka). The hexafluoroisopropanol was evaporated overnight at room temperature, and then the dried peptide was reconstituted in 50 mm NaOH for 30 min (1 mg/ml Aβ). Afterward, it was sonicated (30 s) and then diluted in PBS (25 μm Aβ). Next, the dissolved Aβ was subjected to centrifugation (22,000 × g for 30 min), and the pelleted fraction (5% of starting volume) was discarded. The supernatant was sonicated (1 min) and then incubated at 25 °C for 0–6 days either with agitation (lateral mixing rate of 250 rpm for assembling fibrillar intermediates) or without it (for assembling soluble oligomers and non-toxic oligomers). For preparing amyloid fibrils, aliquots of Aβ were dissolved in 50% hexafluoroisopropanol in water at a final concentration of 25 μm. The dissolved peptide was then sealed in a microcentifuge tube with Parafilm, and a single pin hole was introduced to allow slow evaporation of hexafluoroisopropanol (25 °C) over 2 days with agitation (250 rpm). After 2 days, the remaining solution was diluted with water to achieve a final concentration of 25 μm Aβ and then mixed for an additional 5 days (25 °C, 250 rpm). thioflavin T phosphate-buffered saline 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid atomic force microscopy (−)-epi-gallocatechine gallate. thioflavin T phosphate-buffered saline 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid atomic force microscopy (−)-epi-gallocatechine gallate. Aβ (25 μm) was diluted with ThT (44 μm) at a ratio of 1:19 by volume. The fluorescence was quantified in 384-well microtiter plates (Microfluor 1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Tecan Safire2 plate reader (450/482 nm excitation/emission, 15-nm bandwidth). Seeding experiments were conducted using Aβ monomers (25 μm) and various aggregated Aβ conformers (5 wt % seed) without agitation. Aβ samples (25 μm) were spotted on cut mica mounted on glass slides. The samples were adsorbed (30 min) and then washed with water and dried overnight. Images were taken using an Asylum Research MFP 3D AFM system with Olympus AC240TS cantilevers. Rat adrenal medulla cells (PC12, ATCC) were cultured in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). The cell suspension (110,000 cells/ml) was separated into aliquots (90 μl) in 96-well microtiter plates (CellBIND, Corning) and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Afterward, 10 μl of Aβ or control samples were added to the microtiter plate, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. Next, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (200 μl) and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma; 50 μl of 2.5 mg/ml) were added to each well for 3 h at 37 °C. Finally, these solutions were removed, 250 μl of DMSO was added, the plate was shaken (∼75 rpm) for 20 min, and the absorbance was measured at 562 nm. The toxicity values were normalized to the PBS control without Aβ. Aβ samples (25 μm) were diluted into sample buffer (Novex LDS, Invitrogen), sonicated, and analyzed using 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) with MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Each gel was silver-stained using a SilverXpress kit (Invitrogen). Aβ conformers (25 μm) were spotted (1 μl) on nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare). After the blots were dried, they were blocked overnight at 4 °C (10% nonfat dry milk in PBST) and washed 3 times in PBST. The blots were then incubated with A11 (Invitrogen), OC, or 6E10 (Millipore) antibodies diluted 1:500 to 1:1000 (5% nonfat dry milk in PBST). The blots were washed three times (PBST) and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit for A11 and OC, goat-anti-mouse for 6E10). After washing, the blots were exposed to substrate (ECL Western blotting Substrate, Thermo Fisher) and developed. The secondary structures of Aβ conformers (25 μm in water; 300 μl) were evaluated using a Jasco 815 spectrometer (1-mm path length cuvette) at 25 °C. Each sample spectra is the average of at least 10 readings. We first established assembly conditions under which Aβ1–42 forms toxic soluble oligomers recognized by the A11 antibody (49Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar) in a reproducible and well defined manner.

Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar) and our own experiments, we found that soluble, A11-positive oligomers formed after 1 day when assembled at 25 °C without agitation (Fig. 1A). Importantly, these oligomers remained stable for 2 days, after which time they mature into a conformer no longer recognized by the A11 antibody (Fig. 1A). We confirmed that these A11-positive conformers are SDS-soluble, ThT-negative, and toxic (supplemental Fig. S1). Intriguingly, we found that soluble Aβ oligomers do not convert into fibrillar conformers under these conditions. Using a second conformation-specific antibody (OC) that selectively recognizes fibrillar intermediates and fibrils (47Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J. Breydo L. Thompson J.L. Rasool S. Gurlo T. Butler P. Glabe C.G. Mol. Neurodegener. 2007; 2: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), we found that OC-positive conformers did not assemble either before or after formation of soluble prefibrillar oligomers (Fig. 1A). This suggests that soluble oligomers may mature into off-pathway aggregates. Indeed, we confirmed that Aβ conformers formed on days 4 and 5 were off-pathway conformers that possess similar morphologies to soluble oligomers, yet they were SDS-resistant, ThT-negative, and non-toxic (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, using circular dichroism we found that freshly dissolved Aβ (day 0), A11-positive oligomers (day 1), and off-pathway aggregates (day 5) all possess random coil secondary structures (Fig. 1B). Thus, soluble and off-pathway oligomers display indistinguishable secondary structures and aggregate morphologies, yet they possess unique toxicities and are differentially recognized by the A11 antibody. Given the subtle differences between soluble and off-pathway oligomers, we posited that resveratrol would either fail to remodel these conformers or modify them both in a similar manner. Therefore, we first performed SDS-PAGE analysis of the Aβ conformers that formed over 5 days before and after the addition of resveratrol and vanillin (a control phenolic compound) for 4 h at a near stoichiometric concentration (0.8:1 phenol:Aβ1–42; Fig. 1C). Strikingly, we found that resveratrol selectively remodels Aβ-soluble oligomers that form on days 1–3 (which are recognized by the A11 antibody) into high molecular weight aggregates. Moreover, resveratrol did not alter the aggregation behavior of freshly dissolved Aβ (day 0) or insoluble, off-pathway Aβ aggregates (day 5; Fig. 1C). We confirmed that the remodeled soluble oligomers are non-covalently associated by disassembling them with heat (100 °C for 10 min; Fig. 1C). We also confirmed that the resveratrol remodeling activity for A11-positive conformers is similar at 25 and 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S2) and is unaffected by the addition of non-ionic surfactant (0.1% Triton; supplemental Fig. S3). Finally, we confirmed that the A11-positive oligomer samples (days 1–3) contain little monomer, as when they were mixed with Aβ monomers, resveratrol fai"

Helical shape of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori may facilitate penetration of the thick gastric mucus where it replicates. We identified four genes required for helical shape: three LytM peptidoglycan endopeptidase homologs (csd1-3) and a ccmA homolog. Surrounding the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria, the peptidoglycan (murein) sacculus is a meshwork of glycan strands joined by peptide crosslinks. Intact cells and isolated sacculi from mutants lacking any single csd gene or ccmA formed curved rods and showed increased peptidoglycan crosslinking. Quantitative morphological analyses of multiple-gene deletion mutants revealed each protein uniquely contributes to a shape-generating pathway. This pathway is required for robust colonization of the stomach in spite of normal directional motility. Our findings suggest that the coordinated action of multiple proteins relaxes peptidoglycan crosslinking, enabling helical cell curvature and twist."

The molecular mechanisms by which nociceptors are able to sense multiple qualitatively distinct stimuli are not well understood. We found that the C. elegans PVD neurons are mulitidendritic nociceptors that respond to harsh touch and cold temperatures. The harsh touch modality specifically required the DEG/ENaC proteins MEC-10 and DEGT-1, which represent putative components of a harsh touch mechanotransduction complex. In contrast, responses to cold required the TRPA-1 channel and were MEC-10 and DEGT-1 independent. Heterologous expression of C. elegans TRPA-1 conferred cold responsiveness to other C. elegans neurons and to mammalian cells, indicating that TRPA-1 is a cold sensor. Our results suggest that C. elegans nociceptors respond to thermal and mechanical stimuli using distinct sets of molecules and identify DEG/ENaC channels as potential receptors for mechanical pain."

Nucleozin impeded influenza A virus replication in vitro with a nanomolar median effective concentration (EC(50)) and protected mice challenged with lethal doses of avian influenza A H5N1.

https://openalex.org/W2011081767,This study shows that cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1)-positive inhibitory interneurons in the entorhinal cortex selectively innervate those principal neurons that project to the hippocampal commissure. Principal neurons that form the perforant path from entorhinal cortex to hippocampal dentate gyrus were devoid of CB1-positive synapses. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is a major center for spatial navigation and memory. We found that cannabinoid type 1 receptor–expressing GABAergic basket cells selectively innervated principal cells in layer II of the rat MEC that projected outside the hippocampus but avoided neighboring cells that give rise to the perforant pathway to the dentate gyrus. These results indicate that the organization of GABAergic microcircuits reflects the long-distance axonal targets of principal neurons.
https://openalex.org/W2084929485,"Inner ear hair cells detect sound through deflection of mechanosensory stereocilia. Each stereocilium is supported by a paracrystalline array of parallel actin filaments that are packed more densely at the base, forming a rootlet extending into the cell body. The function of rootlets and the molecules responsible for their formation are unknown. We found that TRIOBP, a cytoskeleton-associated protein mutated in human hereditary deafness DFNB28, is localized to rootlets. In vitro, purified TRIOBP isoform 4 protein organizes actin filaments into uniquely dense bundles reminiscent of rootlets but distinct from bundles formed by espin, an actin crosslinker in stereocilia. We generated mutant Triobp mice (TriobpΔex8/Δex8) that are profoundly deaf. Stereocilia of TriobpΔex8/Δex8 mice develop normally but fail to form rootlets and are easier to deflect and damage. Thus, F-actin bundling by TRIOBP provides durability and rigidity for normal mechanosensitivity of stereocilia and may contribute to resilient cytoskeletal structures elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W2135572124,"Polarized trafficking of synaptic proteins to axons and dendrites is crucial to neuronal function. Through forward genetic analysis in C. elegans, we identified a cyclin (CYY-1) and a cyclin-dependent Pctaire kinase (PCT-1) necessary for targeting presynaptic components to the axon. Another cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK-5, and its activator p35, act in parallel to and partially redundantly with the CYY-1/PCT-1 pathway. Synaptic vesicles and active zone proteins mostly mislocalize to dendrites in animals defective for both PCT-1 and CDK-5 pathways. Unlike the kinesin-3 motor, unc-104/Kif1a mutant, cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutants have no reduction in anterogradely moving synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) as observed by dynamic imaging. Instead, the number of retrogradely moving SVPs is dramatically increased. Furthermore, this mislocalization defect is suppressed by disrupting the retrograde motor, the cytoplasmic dynein complex. Thus, PCT-1 and CDK-5 pathways direct polarized trafficking of presynaptic components by inhibiting dynein-mediated retrograde transport and setting the balance between anterograde and retrograde motors. Polarized trafficking of synaptic proteins to axons and dendrites is crucial to neuronal function. Through forward genetic analysis in C. elegans, we identified a cyclin (CYY-1) and a cyclin-dependent Pctaire kinase (PCT-1) necessary for targeting presynaptic components to the axon. Another cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK-5, and its activator p35, act in parallel to and partially redundantly with the CYY-1/PCT-1 pathway. Synaptic vesicles and active zone proteins mostly mislocalize to dendrites in animals defective for both PCT-1 and CDK-5 pathways. Unlike the kinesin-3 motor, unc-104/Kif1a mutant, cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutants have no reduction in anterogradely moving synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) as observed by dynamic imaging. Instead, the number of retrogradely moving SVPs is dramatically increased. Furthermore, this mislocalization defect is suppressed by disrupting the retrograde motor, the cytoplasmic dynein complex. Thus, PCT-1 and CDK-5 pathways direct polarized trafficking of presynaptic components by inhibiting dynein-mediated retrograde transport and setting the balance between anterograde and retrograde motors. C. elegans cyclin CYY-1 activates CDK-5-related kinase PCT-1 PCT-1 and CDK-5 parallel pathways localize presynaptic molecules to axons The pathways suppress retrograde movements of synaptic vesicles This is likely due to inhibition of the cytoplasmic dynein retrograde motor complex Neurons are highly specialized cells capable of transmitting and processing information through their polarized cellular processes: dendrites receive signals through neurotransmitter receptors and transform these signals into electrical impulses, while axons convert these electrical impulses into chemical signals at presynaptic sites through synaptic vesicle cycles. Therefore, the localization of synaptic vesicles and other active zone components at axonal presynaptic sites is absolutely essential for neuronal function. How are these axonal or dendritic molecules localized appropriately? There are multiple possible routes that diverge at the levels of sorting, trafficking, and retention (Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Neuronal polarity and trafficking.Neuron. 2003; 40: 277-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Proteins are sorted into different carrier vesicles in the cell body. Certain vesicles are specifically transported to one compartment, while others travel into multiple compartments before being selectively retained in one compartment. The sheer length of most axons and their lack of protein synthesis machinery demands efficient transport systems to traffic synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) and active zone components from the cell body to the axons. Intriguingly, studies in dissociated neuronal cultures showed that several axonal proteins such as synaptic vesicle v-SNARE VAMP2/synaptobrevin, cell adhesion molecule L1/neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule NgCAM, and sodium channel Nav1.2, are initially transported to both the axon and dendrites but later localize to the axon through transcytosis (Burack et al., 2000Burack M.A. Silverman M.A. Banker G.

These results indicate that there are trafficking mechanisms both to bring axonal cargo to the dendrite and to transport them into axons. The microtubule cytoskeleton and related molecular motors are largely responsible for the long-range trafficking of axonal components. Microtubules are oriented plus-end distal in the axon, while they have mixed polarity in dendrites (Baas et al., 1988Baas P.W. Deitch J.S. Black M.M. Banker G.A. Polarity orientation of microtubules in hippocampal neurons: uniformity in the axon and nonuniformity in the dendrite.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The vast majority of the members of the kinesin superfamily move unidirectionally toward the plus end of microtubules, while cytoplasmic dyneins transport cargo in the opposite direction (Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Molecular motors and mechanisms of directional transport in neurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, Vale, 2003Vale R.D. The molecular motor toolbox for intracellular transport.Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). These molecular motors are highly regulated. They recognize various cargo through direct binding or by utilizing different adaptors. Different adaptors are sufficient to guide motors toward axons or dendrites. Overexpression of the KIF-5-interacting domain of glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP) causes KIF-5 to accumulate in dendrites while overexpression of JIP3/Sunday driver leads to KIF-5 accumulation in axons (Setou et al., 2000Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Kinesin superfamily motor protein KIF17 and mLin-10 in NMDA receptor-containing vesicle transport.Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Other regulators can associate with motors and modulate their activity. For example, the retrograde motor dynein and its regulator LIS1 associate with Nudel, a factor phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK-5) (Niethammer et al., 2000Niethammer M. Smith D.S. Ayala R. Peng J. Ko J. Lee M.S. Morabito M. Tsai L.H.

Inhibiting CDK-5 phosphorylation of NUDEL in vitro disrupts neurite morphology, a defect observed in dynein mutants as well. The tight regulation of motors is not surprising given the wide array of cargo that they transport to diverse locations. In vivo studies identified two kinesin family motors and the dynein complex to be important for trafficking presynaptic components. UNC-104/Imac/KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family, is the primary motor responsible for transporting SVPs. Mutant worms and flies lacking this gene product show almost complete failure of axonal trafficking—most SVPs accumulate in neuronal cell bodies (Hall and Hedgecock, 1991Hall D.H. Hedgecock E.M.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 980-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The conventional kinesin-1/KIF5/KHC also plays a role in this process as it binds SVPs, and disruption of this motor or its adaptor reduces the levels of SVPs and the active zone protein bassoon at presynaptic sites (Cai et al., 2007Cai Q. Pan P.Y. Sheng Z.H. Syntabulin-kinesin-1 family member 5B-mediated axonal transport contributes to activity-dependent presynaptic assembly.J.

Third, disrupting components of the cytoplasmic dynein complex leads to misaccumulation of synaptic proteins (Fejtova et al., 2009Fejtova A. Davydova D. Bischof F. Lazarevic V. Altrock W.D. Romorini S. Schone C. Zuschratter W. Kreutz M.R. Garner C.C. et al.Dynein light chain regulates axonal trafficking and synaptic levels of Bassoon.J.

Mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans cytoplasmic dynein components reveal specificity of neuronal retrograde cargo.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3907-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the localization of presynaptic components requires the cooperation of multiple motors. However, how motors are regulated to distinguish between axons and dendrites, how presynaptic cargo is deposited specifically at presynaptic sites, and how different motors interact with one another are important questions that remain to be addressed. Here, we utilized an in vivo system in C. elegans to study the intracellular trafficking of SVPs and active zone proteins. We identified two cyclin-dependent kinase pathways that are essential for axonal localization of presynaptic components. Our results suggest that these kinase pathways regulate the localization of presynaptic components by inhibiting retrograde trafficking that is likely mediated through the dynein motor. The cholinergic motor neuron DA9 elaborates a morphologically and molecularly distinct axon and dendrite, and is well suited for the study of mechanisms regulating the polarized localization of axonal and dendritic proteins in vivo. We visualized both presynaptic components and dendritic proteins in DA9 using cell-specific promoters (itr-1 pB or mig-13) to express fluorescently tagged protein markers in vivo. Consistent with electron microscopic reconstruction data (White et al., 1976White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the ventral nerve cord of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 275: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), synaptic vesicle proteins and active zone markers localize only to a discrete segment of the axon while several proteins localize selectively to the dendrite (Klassen and Shen, 2007Klassen M.P. Shen K. Wnt signaling positions neuromuscular connectivity by inhibiting synapse formation in C. elegans.Cell. 2007; 130: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Poon et al., 2008Poon V.Y. Klassen M.P. Shen K. UNC-6/netrin and its receptor UNC-5 locally exclude presynaptic components from dendrites.Nature. 2008; 455: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To identify factors important for localizing presynaptic components, we visually screened randomly mutagenized animals for mutants with abnormal distribution patterns of presynaptic components. We isolated two mutants with similar and fully penetrant defects with presynaptic markers present in both axons and dendrites. In both wy575 and wy302 mutants, synaptic vesicle-associated RAB-3, active zone component SYD-2/liprin-α, synaptic vesicle transmembrane proteins SNB-1/synaptobrevin and SNG-1/synaptogyrin mislocalize to the DA9 dendrite (Figure 1B , Figure 1C, Figure 1H, and Figure 1I compared with Figure 1A and Figure 1G, and Figures S1A–S1L available online). DA9 axonal and dendritic morphology is otherwise normal. Furthermore, the majority of the presynaptic proteins is still distributed in the axon, and these proteins colocalize with one another in the normal synaptic domain (Figures 1H and 1I). These results indicate that except for mislocalized presynaptic components, many aspects of DA9 development, including axon guidance, dendrite outgrowth, and synaptic target selection, are normal in these two mutants. Consistent with this notion, while both wy575 and wy302 mutants have slightly lower brood sizes, they are fertile, active, and exhibit largely normal locomotion.Figure S1Mislocalization of Various Synaptic Vesicle Proteins in wy575 and wy302 Mutants and their Cloning, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–T) Synaptic vesicle proteins synaptobrevin/SNB-1, synaptogyrin/SNG-1 and RAB-3 mislocalize to the DA9 Dendrite in pct-1(wy575), cyy-1(wy302), cdk-5(ok626), and cdka-1/p35(tm648) Mutants.

Using single nucleotide polymorphism mapping, transgenic rescue, and sequence analysis, we mapped the wy575 mutation to pct-1, which encodes a highly conserved Pctaire kinase of the cyclin-dependent kinase family (Figures S1U and S1V). Pctaire kinases have been implicated in neurite outgrowth, exocytosis, and tau phosphorylation (Graeser et al., 2002Graeser R. Gannon J. Poon R.Y. Dubois T. Aitken A. Hunt T.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9852-9858Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). cDNA sequences predict three isoforms of PCT-1 with common C-terminal kinase domains and variable N-terminal sequences. wy575 is a missense mutation of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue in the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase (D377N). We also examined the phenotypes of two different deletion alleles of pct-1 in DA9: one affects two of the three isoforms (ok1707) while the other removes the kinase domain in all three isoforms and is a predicted null (tm2175). ok1707 mutants have no mislocalization defect, while tm2175 mutants are indistinguishable from wy575 mutants (Figure 2J ), suggesting that the third isoform is sufficient and that both wy575 and tm2175 are likely null alleles. Using similar methods, we mapped wy302 at the genetic locus ZK353.1. This gene encodes two highly similar isoforms containing a predicted cyclin domain. It is orthologous to mammalian cyclin Y that has not been studied previously (Figures S1X and S1Y). We named the gene CYY-1 (Cyclin Y). The wy302 allele results in a stop codon in the ninth amino acid and likely represents a null allele. Since the phylogenetic analysis shows that PCT-1 is most closely related to CDK-5 (Figure S1U), we further exam CDK-5 and other CDK mutants. While mutations in CDK-1, CDK-7, and CDK-8 have no effect (data not shown), null mutations in cdk-5 or its activator cdka-1/p35 lead to dendritic accumulation of presynaptic components (Figures 2A and 2B, Figure S1). Like the pct-1 and cyy-1 mutants, this mislocalization defect in cdk-5 or cdka-1/p35 mutants is fully penetrant. The mutant animals have normal DA9 guidance and morphology, and do not exhibit obvious defects in locomotory behavior. We subsequently determined if these four genes are expressed endogenously in DA9. Cytoplasmic fluorophore under the control of their endogenous promoters, revealed fluorescence in DA9 as well as other ventral cord motor neurons (data not shown). CYY-1 is also expressed in other tissues such as the gut and gonad. Using the itr-1 pB promoter that drives expression specifically in DA9 in the tail, we asked if DA9-specific expression of each gene is sufficient to rescue the mislocalization defect of SVPs. For each gene, we generated two independent transgenic strains expressing the corresponding cDNA or genomic fragment in DA9. Expression of these four genes in DA9 almost completely rescues the mutant phenotype, suggesting that PCT-1, CYY-1, CDK-5, and CDKA-1/p35 act cell-autonomously in DA9 (Figure 2C). Since pct-1, cyy-1, cdk-5, and cdka-1/p35 mutants have similar defects, we investigated their genetic relationships. Using putative null mutants, we generated all six combinations of double mutants and compared them with the single mutants (Figures 2D–2I). Quantitative analysis of GFP::RAB-3 distribution in the DA9 axon and dendrite showed that between 19%–47% of total RAB-3 fluorescence is present in the dendrite of these single mutants compared to 0.3% in wild-type animals (Figure 2J). As cyy-1; pct-1 double mutant animals are indistinguishable from each single mutants, PCT-1 and CYY-1 likely function in the same genetic pathway. Likewise, cdka-1/p35 cdk-5 double mutant animals have a mislocalization defect similar to cdk-5 single mutants, a result one would expect if CDKA-1/p35 activates CDK-5. The other four double mutants, on the other hand, exhibit dramatically enhanced mislocalization defects. Nearly all SVPs (86%–98%) are present in the DA9 dendrite in the cdk-5; pct-1, cdka-1/p35; pct-1, cyy-1 cdk-5, and cdka-1/p35 cyy-1 double mutants (Figures 2F–2J). The active zone protein SYD-2/liprin-α is similarly dramatically mislocalized in these double mutants, suggesting that trafficking and localization of multiple presynaptic components are defective (Figure S2). To address if these defects are specific to the cholinergic DA9 neuron, we examined the localization of synaptic vesicle-associated RAB-3 in other neurons. We found that the GABAergic DD motor neurons and the RIA interneurons are also severely affected in cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutants and GFP::RAB-3 mislocalizes to dendrites or dendritic segments (Figure S3). Intriguingly, the localization of synaptic vesicle markers in the cholinergic DB motor neurons is only mildly affected in cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutants (data not shown), suggesting that these two pathways are required for many but not all neurons. Not surprisingly, these four double mutants are largely paralyzed, indicating a loss of functional synapses in motor neurons. These results are consistent with pct-1 and cyy-1 acting in a pathway parallel to cdk-5 and cdka-1/p35 in multiple neurons. The observed drastic enhancement further highlights that these two pathways are essential for the polarized localization of presynaptic components.Figure S3Synaptic Vesicle-Associated RAB-3 Mislocalizes to the Dendrite in DD and RIA Neurons in cyy-1 cdk-5 Mutant Animals, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–F) Micrographs (A–C) and schematic diagram (C′) of a wild-type adult animal coexpressing GFP::RAB-3 and mCherry in DD neurons(wyIs202).

GLR-1 is unaffected while RAB-3 is present in the postsynaptic domain of RIA. Asterisk above cell body. The scale bar represents 10 μm. To definitively understand the synaptic structural defects in the cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutants, we reconstructed segments (4–7μm) of the dorsal nerve cord using serial electron microscopy (EM) from three cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutant animals and three wild-type control animals. Consistent with our findings with fluorophore-tagged synaptic markers, we found that the number of synaptic vesicles and active zones in the DA and DD axons are significantly reduced whereas presynaptic specializations in the DB neurons appear normal (Figure 3 and unpublished data, S.W. and K.S.). Since the reconstruction was performed where the DA1 to DA4 neurons form synapses, the synaptic vesicle localization defect in DA neurons is not limited to DA9, but is true for the anterior DA neurons as well. This EM analysis also revealed that the size and appearance of the synaptic vesicles in cyy cdk-5 mutants is indistinguishable from that in wild-type controls. Furthermore, the appearance of the muscle arms and their contacts with the motor neurons are largely normal, arguing that the wiring of the motor circuits remains intact in the mutant animals (data not shown). The close phylogenetic relationship, the similarity of their loss-of-function phenotypes, and the enhanced phenotype of the double mutants indicate that the PCT-1 and CDK-5 pathways might perform similar and redundant functions in DA9. To directly address this, we examined if over-activating one pathway could compensate for the loss of the other pathway. Indeed, we found that overexpression of PCT-1 in cdk-5 mutants significantly rescues their mislocalization defects, and likewise, overexpression of CDK-5 significantly rescues defects of pct-1 mutant animals (Figure 4A ). While it is well established that p35 directly binds to and activates CDK-5 (Lew et al., 1994Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

No vertebrate cyclin is known to activate Pctaire kinases (Liu et al., 2006Liu Y. Cheng K. Gong K. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Pctaire1 phosphorylates N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein: implications in the regulation of its hexamerization and exocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9852-9858Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We therefore tested if CYY-1 associates with and activates PCT-1 using tagged recombinant CYY-1 and PCT-1 in 293T cells. We observed that CYY-1 and PCT-1 robustly coimmunoprecipitate with each other regardless of the tag we used to perform the pull-down experiment (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the kinase activity of PCT-1 is strictly dependent on the presence of CYY-1 (Figure 4C). Consistently, overexpression of functional PCT-1 completely fails to rescue the cyy-1 mutants, indicating that the function of PCT-1 depends on CYY-1 (Figure 4D). These results strongly suggest that CYY-1 directly binds and activates PCT-1 to regulate the localization of presynaptic components. If PCT-1 is the only downstream factor of CYY-1, CYY-1 should have no activity in pct-1 null mutant animals. However, we observed that overexpression of CYY-1 significantly rescues the mislocalization defect in pct-1(tm2175) mutant animals (Figure 4D). This indicates that overexpression of CYY-1 can affect the localization of presynaptic components through a mechanism independent of PCT-1. A primary candidate is CDK-5 since it is closely related to PCT-1 and we observed that the CDK-5 transgene that robustly rescues pct-1 mutant animals only marginally rescues cyy-1 mutant animals (Figure 4A). As presented in Figure 4D, the CYY-1 transgene that rescues the mislocalization defect in pct-1 mutants completely fails to rescue the mislocalization defect in cdk-5; pct-1 or cdka-1/p35; pct-1 double mutants. Taken together, these genetic interaction studies indicate that CYY-1 acts upstream of PCT-1 and can also potentially activate the CDKA-1/p35-CDK-5 pathway. To further test whether CYY-1 can directly activate CDK-5, we performed in vitro kinase assays. We found that the kinase activity of CDK-5 can indeed be stimulated by CYY-1 suggesting that CYY-1 might also be an activator of CDK-5 (Figure S4A). Next, we examined the subcellular localization of PCT-1, CYY-1, CDK-5, and CDKA-1/p35. We found that CDK-5::YFP predominantly localizes to presynaptic sites and is present as faint puncta in the dendrite (Figure S4C). CDKA-1/p35::YFP shows a presynaptic distribution in the axon and a punctate localization pattern in the dendrite (Figure S4E). The localization of CDK-5 is completely dependent on UNC-104/KIF1A (data not shown). Consistent with the presynaptic localization of the vertebrate CDK-5 (Tomizawa et al., 2002Tomizawa K. Ohta J. Matsushita M. Moriwaki A. Li S.T. Takei K. Matsui H. Cdk5/p35 regulates neurotransmitter release through phosphorylation and downregulation of P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channel activity.J.

Certain tumor cells are largely nonresponsive to cytokine-mediated induction of the pro-survival cytokine interleukin (IL) 6. We have demonstrated that multiple nonresponsive tumor lines are able to undergo synergistic induction of IL6 following combinatorial treatment with IL1β and the AHR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Such data implicate the AHR in tumor expansion, although the mechanistic basis for the AHR-dependent synergistic induction of IL6 has not been determined. Here, we demonstrate that ligand-activated AHR is involved in priming the IL6 promoter through binding to nonconsensus dioxin response elements located upstream of the IL6 start site. Such binding appears to render the promoter more permissive to IL1β-induced binding of NF-κB components. The nature of the AHR-dependent increases in IL6 promoter transcriptional potential has been shown to involve a reorganization of repressive complexes as exemplified by the presence of HDAC1 and HDAC3. Dismissal of these HDACs correlates with post-translational modifications of promoter-bound NF-κB components in a time-dependent manner. Thus the AHR plays a role in derepressing the IL6 promoter, leading to synergistic IL6 expression in the presence of inflammatory signals. These observations may explain the association between enhanced expression of AHR and tumor aggressiveness. It is likely that AHR-mediated priming is not restricted to the IL6 promoter and may contribute to the expression of a variety of genes, which do not have consensus dioxin response elements.

The AHR-mediated signaling pathway has been documented extensively, as exemplified in the review by Beischlag et al. (1Beischlag T.V. Luis Morales J. Hollingshead B.D. Perdew G.H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2008; 18: 207-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Residing in the cytoplasm prior to activation, the AHR is complexed with a dimer of hsp90 and XAP2. The AHR binds an agonist, which induces translocation to the nucleus, followed by release of its chaperones and subsequent heterodimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). This heterodimer exhibits an ability to bind dioxin response elements (DREs) at the promoters of target genes and plays a role in transcription. The most common ligand studied that mediates AHR activation is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), although it binds a variety of xenobiotics including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are common environmental pollutants that result from car exhaust, manufacturing, iron foundries, cigarette smoke, etc. As a xenobiotic receptor, activated AHR binds to DREs in the promoters of cytochrome P4501A genes, which express enzymes that act in phase I drug metabolism. However, the AHR has recently been shown to have numerous physiological roles aside from drug metabolism. Such endogenous activities include differentiation of Th17 immune cells, regulation of acute phase response genes, antiestrogenic activities, and modulation of NF-κB protein activity (2Kimura A.

We have previously shown that, in both the human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and the ECC1 endocervical cancer cell line, IL6 production is synergistically increased following concomitant exposure to an AHR ligand and pro-inflammatory IL1β (6Hollingshead B.D. Beischlag T.V. Dinatale B.C. Ramadoss P. Perdew G.H. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3609-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The low level of AHR activation needed to mediate this response, combined with the fact that increased IL6 protein secretion continued for 72 h after the initial dose of ligand, points to a potentially low threshold that cancer cells must pass before producing and releasing extensive amounts of a known pro-growth signal. Furthermore, release of IL6 from tumor cells can lead to an autocrine loop that enhances other inflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. IL6 is an NF-κB-regulated gene; thus our initial findings verified that the p65 (RELA) subunit was involved in the synergistic increase. However, a more detailed transcriptional mechanism was not fully explored. Elucidating the means by which IL6 is synergistically activated by the AHR in MCF-7 cells has the potential to provide insight useful in other tissue and tumor situations. MCF-7 cells express low basal and low IL1β-induced levels of IL6 expression, but this is not the case for all cell lines (7Sasser A.K. Sullivan N.J. Studebaker A.W. Hendey L.F. Axel A.E. Hall B.M. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3763-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the lack of IL6 inducibility in MCF-7 cells is due to the presence of co-repressors and a closed chromatin structure at the promoter (8Armenante F. Merola M. Furia A. Tovey M. Palmieri M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4483-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An understanding of how the AHR can derepress this gene is important because of the pleiotropic nature of IL6 in the tumor microenvironment. For example, numerous carcinomas have shown pro-growth, anti-apoptotic, and pro-invasive abilities upon exposure to increased IL6 levels (9Cavarretta I.T. Neuwirt H. Untergasser G. Moser P.L.

The observation that NF-κB signaling is involved in both oncogenic and immune pathways has led to numerous reviews on the functional role of prominent family members (e.g. p65, RELB) and, to a lesser extent, other related family members such as IκBζ (15Yamamoto M. Takeda K. J. Infect. Chemother. 2008; 14: 265-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Perkins N.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). There are a number of pathways by which the NF-κB family of proteins are regulated that can lead to transcriptional activation, the most prevalent being the canonical pathway. In this cascade of events, the p50 and p65 family members are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκBα. Activating signals, including IL1β receptor signaling, lead to IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylating IκBα and dismissing it from the complex. This allows for nuclear localization of the p50-p65 heterodimer, which then binds to κB response elements in target gene promoters. Several tangential events also take place to maximize NF-κB activity, including acetylation of various p65 residues that enhance DNA binding and increase transcriptional activity (reviewed in Ref. 17Quivy V. Van Lint C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Nuclear IKKα can phosphorylate histones as well as neighboring transcription factors, and members of the IκB family have been shown to act as both repressors and activators when recruited to this DNA-bound complex (18Chen L.F. Greene W.C. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 19Kuwata H. Matsumoto M. Atarashi K. Morishita H. Hirotani T. Koga R. Takeda K. Immunity. 2006; 24: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The fact that NF-κB is intricately involved in cytokine regulation pointed to the REL family of proteins as likely targets for further study to uncover their role in AHR-mediated synergistic induction of IL6. Upon discovering that AHR activation leads to greatly increased IL6 production in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we then set out to investigate the mechanism by which this event occurs. The results revealed that activated AHR can bind imperfect DREs upstream of the IL6 promoter, leading to a regulatory region primed for NF-κB-mediated induction. The relative lack of IL6 induction in these cells following IL1β signaling alone appears to be due to the presence of co-repressors at the promoter, which is alleviated by the binding of AHR to its cognate response elements. Furthermore, AHR recruitment to the IL6 promoter results in a loss of HDAC1 occupancy, which coincides with an increase in acetylated p65 levels, a hallmark of optimal NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activity. MCF-7 breast tumor cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma), supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 1,000 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). CV-1 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin under identical incubation conditions. pGL3-promoter vector was subjected to digest with the restriction enzymes SacI and XhoI and subsequently ligated with sequences containing appropriate restriction sites. First, the pGL3–3.0kb vector was made by amplifying a 255-bp sequence spanning the region from −2897 to −3152 of the IL6 promoter with the primers 5′-TCACGCCTGTAAACCCAGCACTTT-3′ and 5′-GCGGTTGAAGTGAGCCAAGATCAT-3′. Second, the pGL3–3.0kb.synth vector was made by designing forward and reverse complimentary oligonucleotides containing three copies of a 15-base pair stretch of the IL6 promoter centered on the nonconsensus DRE found at −3050 bp. These sequences were 5′-GAGGCGCGTGGATCAGAGGCGCGTGGATCAGAGGCGCGTGGATCA-3′ and 5′-TGATCCACGCGCCTCTGATCCACGCGCCTCTGATCCACGCGCCTC-3′ (produced by Integrated DNA Technologies). Both inserts contained the appropriate restriction enzyme digest sites and were ligated into the pGL3-promoter vector. Vectors with insert were sequenced to verify PCR amplification fidelity or synthesis. A synthetic, codon-optimized cDNA sequence encoding the wild-type human AHR (produced by GenScript) was inserted into pcDNA3 vector to create pcDNA3-AHR. This same sequence was modified to create the human AHR-GS DNA-binding mutant. Construction and characterization of the AHR-GS DNA-binding mutant is outlined in the supplemental text. This modified sequence was inserted into the vector to create pcDNA3-AHR-GS. MCF-7 cells were serum-starved 18 h before treatment. Treatment of cells was performed by diluting compounds to the desired working concentration in serum-free medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRI reagent (Sigma) as specified by the manufacturer. The ABI high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to prepare cDNA from isolated RNA. mRNA expression for all samples was measured by quantitative real time PCR using the Quanta SYBR Green kit on an iCycler DNA engine equipped with the MyiQ single color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The expressed quantities of mRNA were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA levels and plotted using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Histograms are plotted as the mean values of biological replicates, and the error bars represent the standard deviation of replicates. Real time primers used are listed in the supplemental text. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the soluble fraction was collected as whole cell extract. Protein concentrations were determined using the detergent-compatible DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary antibodies used to detect specific proteins are shown in the supplemental text and were visualized using biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) in conjunction with [125I]streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences). MCF-7 cells were grown to ∼90% confluency in 150-cm2 dishes and serum-starved 18 h before treatment. The cells were treated in serum-free medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin by diluting compounds to the desired working concentration for specified time. Following treatment, the cells were washed once with warm PBS, and chromatin complexes were chemically cross-linked using a 1% formaldehyde/PBS solution (final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of glycine solution to a final concentration of 0.125 m; the cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected in 2 ml of harvest buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were centrifuged, washed in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA). Chromatin was sheared with the Bioruptor water bath sonicator (Diagenode, Sparta, NJ) to an average size of 500 bp to 1 kb. The complexes were precleared with protein A-agarose (Pierce) and incubated overnight with specific antibodies, which are listed in the supplemental text. Immunoadsorbed complexes were captured on protein A-agarose (exception: RNA polymerase II mouse monoclonal antibody was bound to streptavidin-agarose (Thermo) previously incubated with 5 μg/immunoprecipitation of goat anti-mouse IgG) and washed once with TE8 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 m EDTA). Agarose-bound complexes were then resuspended in TE8, layered on top of a sucrose solution (1 m sucrose, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), and centrifuged for 3 min. Agarose-bound complexes were then washed once with 0.5× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, followed by four washes with TE8. The samples were eluted off the agarose using 200 μl of elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1%SDS), and cross-links were reversed at 65 °C overnight. Eluted DNA was isolated, washed, and concentrated using the ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (ZYMO Research). Immunoadsorbed DNA was analyzed by PCR and/or quantitative real time PCR. Specific protein levels were decreased using the Dharmacon small interfering RNA (siRNA) (control oligonucleotide D001810-0X, AHR oligonucleotide J004990-07, ARNT oligonucleotide D007207-01, RELB oligonucleotide J004767-06, HDAC1 oligonucleotide J003493-10, and HDAC3 oligonucleotide J003496-09). Electroporation/nucleofection was performed using the Amaxa nucleofection system essentially as described in the manufacturer protocols. Briefly, the cells were washed and suspended at a concentration of 2.0 × 106/100 μl of nucleofection solution. Control or targeted siRNA was added to the sample for a final concentration of 1.5 μmol/liter. The samples were electroporated using the manufacturer’s MCF-7 high efficiency program and plated into six-well dishes in complete medium. The experiments were carried out as described by DiNatale and Perdew (20DiNatale B.C. Perdew G.H. Cytotechnology. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were electroporated with a control or AHR-targeted siRNA, along with control pcDNA3, pcDNA3-AHR, or pcDNA3-AHR-GS. CV-1 cells were grown in penicillin/streptomycin-free medium and transfected using the Mirus TransIT-TKO transfection system. Transfection was performed with control pGL3-promoter, pGL3–3.0kb, or pGL3–3.0kb.synth vectors. Beginning 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated for an additional 24 h, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in cell culture lysis buffer (2 mmtrans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). Cytosol was assayed for luciferase activity using the a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) as specified by the manufacturer. Light production was measured using a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Having previously shown that IL6 is synergistically induced in MCF-7 cells via AHR activation in conjunction with IL1β treatment, the signaling mechanism by which this event occurs was explored. MCF-7 cells pretreated with 250 ng/ml of IL1β receptor antagonist (R & D Systems; 280-RA/CF) for 1 h were subsequently treated with vehicle, 10 ng/ml IL1β, 1 nm TCDD, or co-treated with IL1β and TCDD. Pretreatment with IL1β receptor antagonist prevented IL1β signaling and inhibited any significant increase in IL6 mRNA production (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that IL1β is working through its membrane receptor to activate IL6 expression. Our prior research has shown that siRNA-mediated ablation of AHR protein prevents synergistic IL6 induction (6Hollingshead B.D. Beischlag T.V. Dinatale B.C. Ramadoss P. Perdew G.H. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 3609-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To clarify the manner in which the AHR participates in IL6 induction, the AHR signaling pathway was dissected, beginning with its heterodimerization partner, ARNT. siRNA-mediated ablation of ARNT protein levels was carried out, and MCF-7 cells were treated for 2 h with vehicle, IL1β, TCDD, or with a combination of these substances. Electroporation of MCF-7 cells with ARNT-targeting siRNA leads to nearly complete ablation of protein levels (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the loss of ARNT prevents TCDD-induced CYP1A1 expression, as expected. Similarly, ARNT is shown to be necessary for synergistic IL6 induction (Fig. 1D). This finding suggests that AHR/ARNT heterodimerization is required for AHR-mediated induction of IL6 expression. The AHR has been shown to play a role in regulatory pathways via AHR/ARNT-mediated binding to DRE sequences, as well as through protein-protein interactions. To determine whether the induction of IL6 required the AHR/ARNT heterodimer to bind to the gene promoter region, we replaced AHR protein expression with that of a DNA-binding mutant in MCF-7 cells. A characterized DNA-binding variant of the murine AHR that contains GS amino acid sequence inserts between residues has been shown not to have altered ligand binding, interaction with chaperones, or heterodimerization but is not capable of binding to DREs (21Bunger M.K. Glover E. Moran S.M. Walisser J.A. Lahvis G.P. Hsu E.L. Bradfield C.A. Toxicol. Sci. 2008; 106: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This mutation was created in human AHR (AHR-GS) and similarly characterized (supplemental text and Fig. S1). Having optimized electroporation conditions to attain nearly complete siRNA-mediated ablation of AHR protein in MCF-7 cells, receptor levels were reduced, and cells were co-transfected with a vector containing a synthetic, codon-optimized AHR cDNA construct that was not targeted by AHR siRNA. The AHR constructs expressing AHR or AHR-GS were utilized. This method of transient protein replacement has been previously characterized (20DiNatale B.C. Perdew G.H. Cytotechnology. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transfection with a control vector resulted in minimal change in AHR protein ablation. AHR expression and AHR-GS expression were equivalent although higher than basal AHR protein expression (Fig. 2A). The prototypical AHR target gene examined following ligand activation is CYP1A1. Although AHR knockdown resulted in the loss of CYP1A1 induction following TCDD treatment, the replacement with ectopic AHR expression rescued induction at a higher level because of the higher receptor expression. Treatment with TCDD following replacement of endogenous AHR protein with the AHR-GS mutant failed to induce CYP1A1 because of the loss of DRE binding in the CYP1A1 enhancer (Fig. 2B). Similarly, a loss of AHR expression prevents the synergistic induction of IL6 following combined IL1β and TCDD treatment, whereas replacement with a fully functional AHR protein allows for synergy to occur. Replacement of endogenous AHR with AHR-GS fails to rescue the induction of IL6 (Fig. 2C). Thus DRE binding appears to be required for the AHR to play a role in synergistic IL6 induction, as opposed to simply being the result of AHR-protein interactions. DRE sequences have been characterized for their AHR binding ability, and the optimal nucleotide sequence has been determined. Having established that AHR/ARNT binding to a DRE is required for AHR ligand-mediated induction of IL6, we wanted to determine which imperfect DRE(s) in the IL6 promoter are functional. Integral to receptor binding is the core (G/T)CGTG sequence, with flanking nucleotides being less important but increasing the affinity of the AHR for the DNA. Functional analyses have shown that having a G as the 5′ base of the core enhances binding and function of receptor (22Denison M.S. Elferink C.F. Phelan D. Denison M.S. Helferich W.G. Toxicant-Receptor Interactions in the Modulation of Signal Transduction and Gene Expression. Taylor and Francis, London1998: 3-33Google Scholar). However, studies have shown a lack of correlation between AHR binding to imperfect DREs in gel shift analyses and AHR-mediated induction of imperfect DRE-driven luciferase assays (23Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Gillesby B.E. Stanostefano M. Porter W. Safe S. Wu Z.F. Zacharewski T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that, with a modification of the 5′ core nucleotide, there is still potential for some receptor binding in the genomic context, thus creating the need to assess sequences containing only the four central bases of CGTG. Sequence analysis of the IL6 promoter reveals seven imperfect DREs in the span from the transcription start site to 5 kb upstream. All seven DREs contain the core CGTG sequence, but many have less than optimal flanking sequences (Fig. 3A). Initial attempts at luciferase assays using large stretches of the IL6 promoter show an inability to mimic the regulation observed in cells. This finding is not surprising, because previous research has encountered the same problem (25Faggioli L. Costanzo C. Merola M. Bianchini E. Furia A. Carsana A. Palmieri M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), such that the length of the promoter used in the assay is inversely proportional to the level of induction (supplemental Fig. S2). Because these limitations prevented a full promoter analysis utilizing reporter vectors, a different approach was adopted. MCF-7 cells treated with either vehicle or combinatorial TCDD and IL1β for 2 h were subjected to ChIP analysis of the IL6 promoter. Quantitative real time PCR was carried out using primers that scanned the 5 kb upstream from the transcription start site in 500-bp fragments. Maximal occupancy increases following treatment were observed in the region of the multiple DREs between −3.kb and −3.5 kb and, to a lesser extent, in the −4.5-kb region (Fig. 3B). Further analysis of the −3.0-kb region was carried out, because it included imperfect DREs at −2962 and −3050 bp (Fig. 3A). Both of these DREs contain a 5′ G next to the core CGTG, and their close proximity to each other could prompt a greater AHR-mediated effect. pGL3–3.0kb vector, which contained both the −2962-bp and the −3050-bp DREs, was transfected into the CV-1 cell line. The combination of a low level of basal activated AHR in CV-1 cells (26Chiaro C.R. Patel R.D. Marcus C.B. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the promoter contained within the pGL3 vector led to luciferase activity in the absence of transfected AHR or exogenous ligand (Fig. 4A, first column). Co-transfection with the WT AHR-expressing construct led to a significant increase with the −3.0-kb vector (Fig. 4A, second column), whereas co-transfection of the luciferase vector and the AHR-GS construct led to a significant decrease in luciferase activity compared with basal levels (Fig. 4A, third column) and, therefore, a significant difference between co-transfection with WT AHR compared with mutant AHR-GS. This is believed to be due to the mutant AHR binding a portion of the putative endogenous ligand and heterodimerizing with ARNT, sequestering part of the ARNT pool, and thus decreasing basal luciferase activity. Co-transfection of the reporter vector and WT AHR-expressing vector, followed by 24 h of treatment with 5 μm of the AHR ligand B[a]P, resulted in a significant 1.7-fold increase in luciferase activity, which is not observed upon expression of the DNA-binding mutant AHR-GS (Fig. 4A, fourth and fifth columns). Increases in AHR protein levels following co-transfection with both the AHR and AHR-GS were detected by Western blot (Fig. 4B). To further validate the functionality of the −3050 bp DRE, pGL3–3.0kb.synth vector, which contained three copies of the DRE in tandem, was transfected into CV-1 cells. As seen with the endogenous promoter construct, transfection of the vector alone resulted in basal luciferase activity caused by the low level of constitutively active AHR in CV-1 cells (Fig. 4C, second column). Addition of the WT AHR construct resulted in greater basal luciferase activity (Fig. 4C, third column), which was increased nearly 3-fold following B[a]P treatment (Fig. 4C, fourth column). The lower, albeit significant level of induction mediated by the promoter construct in Fig. 4A is not altogether surprising, because studies utilizing luciferase vectors containing a single DRE have shown low levels of AHR-mediated inducibility (27Gouédard C. Barouki R. Morel Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5209-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these studies clearly establish that the imperfect DREs at"

Ascorbate and cytochrome b5 reduce the oxidized Cygb-NOD intermediate with apparent second order rate constants of 1000 m−1 s−1 and 3 × 106 m−1 s−1, respectively. In rat hepatocytes engineered to express human Cygb, Cygb-NOD activity shows a similar kcat of 1.2 s−1, a Km(NO) of 40 nm, and a kcat/Km(NO) (k′NOD) value of 3 × 107 m−1 s−1, demonstrating the efficiency of catalysis. NO inhibits the activity at [NO]/[O2] ratios >1:500 and limits catalytic turnover. The activity is competitively inhibited by CO, is slowly inactivated by cyanide, and is distinct from the microsomal NOD activity. Cygb-NOD provides protection to the NO-sensitive aconitase. The results define the NOD function of Cygb and demonstrate roles for ascorbate and cytochrome b5 as reductants. Cytoglobin (Cygb) was investigated for its capacity to function as a NO dioxygenase (NOD) in vitro and in hepatocytes. Ascorbate and cytochrome b5 were found to support a high NOD activity. Cygb-NOD activity shows respective Km values for ascorbate, cytochrome b5, NO, and O2 of 0.25 mm, 0.3 μm, 40 nm, and ∼20 μm and achieves a kcat of 0.5 s−1.

The results define the NOD function of Cygb and demonstrate roles for ascorbate and cytochrome b5 as reductants. The functions of cytosolic O2-binding hemoglobins in eubacteria, archaebacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, nematodes, protozoa, and mammals have remained largely enigmatic (1Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N.

For example, several NO metabolic activities and sinks have been measured in various cells and organelles (22Coffey M.J. Natarajan R. Chumley P.H. Coles B. Thimmalapura P.R. Nowell M. Kühn H.

In addition, measurements of NO metabolism by globins with autooxidizable electron donors in the absence of SOD (13Smagghe B.J. Trent 3rd, J.T. Hargrove M.S. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) do not allow the discernment of catalytic NO dioxygenation from NO oxidation by O2̇̄. Understanding globin function(s) continues to demand a synthesis of knowledge of structure, ligand affinities, reactivities, autooxidation rates, and electron donors. Moreover, to assess the NOD function of a globin, knowledge of its interactions with NO and O2 within the cellular milieu is essential. Recently, Cygb-dependent NO dioxygenation and protection of NO-sensitive respiration within mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts was reported (25Halligan K.E. Jourd'heuil F.L. Jourd'heuil D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8539-8547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), yet the relative capacity of Cygb for a NOD function with NO, O2, and cellular reductant(s), as well as its relation to other cellular NO sinks, remains to be defined. Here we describe interactions of Cygb with NO, O2, and reductants that govern its capacity to function as a NOD in vitro and in rat hepatocytes. Investigations of the NOD activities of Cygb, Ngb, and Mb with ascorbate reveal a uniquely efficient redox coupling with Cygb that may be attributed to a unique Cygb structure. In addition, we report that the Cygb-NOD activity is physically and kinetically distinct from the microsomal NOD activity (23Hallstrom C.K. Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. Free Radic. Biol.

Globin expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside when the cell density, as measured by absorbance at 550 nm, was 1.2. The cells were treated with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 16 h and were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated in a cell:buffer volume ratio of 2:3 in chilled 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I, and 260 units/ml catalase. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the extracts were dialyzed extensively against 1 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Cell-free extracts were diluted to 20 mg/ml protein, heated for 10 min at 65 °C, chilled, and clarified by centrifugation. Cygb and Ngb were isolated by column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Superdex 75, and hydroxyapatite. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE using Brilliant Blue G staining. Heme was assayed using the alkaline-pyridine method (34Gardner P.R.

The rat hepatocyte, K9 (CRL-1439), the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 (CCL185), and the human colorectal carcinoma Caco-2 (HTB-37) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Cygb was measured by Western analysis and densitometry with purified human Cygb standards. The 995-bp EcoRI-XbaI fragment of cytoglobin cDNA Image clone 5193583 was isolated and ligated into the EcoRI-XbaI-restricted polylinker region of pcDNA3 v. 1.1 (Invitrogen) generating pcDNA3-hCygb. Rat hepatocytes were transfected with pcDNA3-hCygb or pcDNA3 DNA using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), and stable transfectants were selected with 0.3 mg/ml G418. The clones were isolated and screened for Cygb expression by Western blot analysis. NO consumption was measured with ISO-NOP and microchip NO electrodes (WPI Instruments, Inc.) as previously described (34Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). NO scavenging activities of globins were routinely measured at 37 °C in 2 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.3 mm EDTA and 1.0 mg of MnSOD (11 μm of the dimer). MnSOD was routinely added to NO consumption assays to competitively scavenge interfering O2̇̄ generated by reductants and reductases (34Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Copper- and zinc-containing SOD reacted with NO and was thus unsuitable. Cell NO metabolism was measured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm glucose and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (27Gardner P.R. Martin L.A. Hall D. Gardner A.M. Free Radic. Biol.

NO consumption measurements were corrected for background rates. NO-saturated water (1.94 mm) was prepared over AG 1-X8 resin as previously described (34Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CO-saturated water (1.0 mm) was prepared under 99.5% CO (34Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). O2-saturated buffer (1.14 mm) was prepared, and O2 concentrations were varied in reactions as previously described (27Gardner P.R. Martin L.A. Hall D. Gardner A.M. Free Radic. Biol.

O2 was depleted from buffers by bubbling with 99.99% argon and by preincubating for 5 min with 4 units of glucose oxidase and 260 units of catalase. O2 concentration was measured with an O2 electrode (YSI Co., Yellow Springs, OH). [O2] was 200 and 260 μm in air-saturated buffers at 37 and 20 °C, respectively. Buffer conductivity was measured at 37 °C with an inductive conductivity monitor (GE Healthcare). Nitrate was reduced to nitrite with NADPH and nitrate reductase. Nitrite was assayed using the Griess reagent (34Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2008; 436: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Reduction of ferric Cygb, Ngb, and Mb was measured by following the formation of the ferrous-CO complex at 422, 416, and 422 nm, respectively, in a 1-cm thermostatted quartz cuvette at 37 °C. The reactions were initiated by adding 10 μm of globin (heme) to an anaerobic 1-ml reaction mix containing buffer, 20 μm CO, and the indicated concentrations of ascorbate. O2 was depleted from reactions by scrubbing the reaction mix with N2 and reacting 5 mm glucose with 2 units of glucose oxidase and 260 units of catalase for 10 min prior to adding 4–8 μl of the concentrated globin. Freshly harvested K9neo and K9Cygb hepatocytes were resuspended at a density of 3.2 × 106 cells/ml in 3-ml of serum-free F12K medium buffered to pH 7.4 with 50 mm sodium HEPES and containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. O2, N2, and NO gas mixtures were delivered at 30 ml/min using three-way gas proportioners (27Gardner P.R. Martin L.A. Hall D. Gardner A.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, and the extracts were assayed for aconitase activity and protein as previously described (27Gardner P.R. Martin L.A. Hall D. Gardner A.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Tukey-Kramer (Honestly Significant Difference) statistical analysis method in the program JMP (SAS Institutes Inc.) was used for the analysis of significance (p < 0.05). The data presented are representative of the results of two or more trials. Ascorbate, a potential electron donor for plant hemoglobins (37Becana M. Klucas R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biophys. 1989; 273: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), was investigated for its ability to support enzymic NO scavenging by Cygb, Ngb, and Mb. With 10 mm ascorbate, the enzymic NO scavenging activity is linearly dependent upon globin concentration. Human Cygb shows a turnover rate of 0.25 NO/heme/s with 100 nm NO at 37 °C (Fig. 1A, ●). An ∼4-fold slower turnover is seen at 20 °C (Fig. 1A, ■). Mouse Ngb (Fig. 1B, ●) and sperm whale Mb (Fig. 1C, ●) show respectively 150- and 70-fold lower activities than Cygb. The Cygb activity shows an apparent Km(ascorbate) value of 2 mm (Fig. 2A), an apparent Km for NO of 40 nm, and kcat of 0.5 s−1 with saturating ascorbate and O2 in neutral phosphate buffer (Fig. 2B). With 100 nm NO, half-maximal activity is seen at ∼20 μm O2 (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of the activity occurs at [NO]/[O2] ratios >1:500 (see below), thus complicating the determination of a Km(O2) value. Similar to other NOD activities (3Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 23Hallstrom C.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26528-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the activity is inhibited by CO and inactivated cyanide. With 20 μm O2, 10 μm CO inhibits the Cygb activity by ∼50% (Fig. 2D). NO progressively inhibits the activity during turnover with 400 nm NO and 200 μm O2 (Fig. 2E, ●), and the activity is slowly inactivated by 250 μm cyanide (Fig. 2E, ○). Preincubation of Cygb with cyanide for 7 min does not cause a greater loss of activity (Fig. 2E, compare ○ and ▵), thus demonstrating the importance of turnover for cyanide-mediated inactivation. The results demonstrate Km values for NO and O2 within physiologically relevant concentration ranges. However, the Km(ascorbate) value of 2 mm is greater than the Km values of 0.4–0.9 mm reported for ascorbate-utilizing enzymes (41Tschank G. Sanders J. Baringhaus K.H. Dallacker F. Kivirikko K.I.

Salts were tested for effects on the Km(ascorbate) value and steady-state behavior of Cygb. Lowering the buffer sodium phosphate concentration from 100 to 10 mm decreases the Km(ascorbate) value to 0.25 mm (Fig. 3A, line 1). Salts, including potassium chloride (lines 2–4) or sodium chloride (line 5), competitively inhibit the activity with respect to [ascorbate]. Increasing the sodium phosphate concentration or including sodium phosphate or NaCl in a 25 mm sodium citrate buffer also competitively inhibits the activity and increases the Km(ascorbate) value (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the competitive effect of buffer salt depends more on the anion than the ionic strength. Salts do not significantly affect the kcat achieved with saturating ascorbate (Fig. 3A) or the Km(NO) (data not shown). The results suggest electrostatic interactions in the binding of the negatively charged ascorbate anion. The rates of ferric globin reduction were measured under conditions similar to those for ascorbate-driven NO metabolism (Fig. 2A). Globin reduction was measured in the presence of excess CO and the absence of O2 to stabilize the reduced heme from reoxidation. The rate of Fe2+(CO) complex formation was measured by following the absorbance increase at 422 nm as described under “Materials and Methods.” Under these conditions, the Cygb reduction rate shows a linear dependence upon [ascorbate] up to 8 mm (data not shown). The apparent second order rate constant for ascorbate-mediated reduction of ferric Cygb is 1.3 ± 0.2 m−1 s−1. The corresponding rate constants for Ngb and Mb are 0.10 and 0.13 m−1 s−1, respectively. The results demonstrate an ∼10-fold faster reduction rate for Cygb than for Ngb and Mb. However, these differences do not account for the larger differences in turnover rates measured in Fig. 1. Slow and gradual addition of 32 nmol of NO-saturated water (16-μl) with a gas tight syringe to a 2-ml reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ascorbate, 200 μm O2, 11 μm MnSOD, and 1.0 μm Cygb at 37 °C yields 28.7 ± 1.0 nmol of NO3− and 2.8 ± 0.5 nmol of NO2− or 91 ± 3% NO3− and 9 ± 2% NO2−. The results demonstrate a nitrate-generating NOD mechanism for Cygb (4Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Brashear W.T. Suzuki T. Hvitved A.N. Setchell K.D. Olson J.S. J. Inorg.

NADH and NADPH support a low Cygb-NOD turnover that is >15-fold slower than with ascorbate under otherwise comparable conditions (Table 1), demonstrating a preference for ascorbate. Reduced cytochrome b5 also supports the NOD activity of Cygb and shows saturation with half-maximal activity at 0.3 μm (Fig. 4A). Ferredoxin reductase and NADPH produce a low background activity in the cytochrome b5 reducing system. CYPOR can also support a low activity of Cygb-NOD (Fig. 4B). NCB5OR, an enzyme with a flavin-containing reductase domain and a cytochrome b5 domain that is found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (29Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A.

Cygb shows the highest activity of the three (Fig. 4D, compare ● with ■ and ▵). Microsomes containing membrane-bound CYPOR (14 milliunits) and incubated with 100 μm NADPH can supply electrons for the NO metabolic activity of Cygb. With 300 nm Cygb, microsomes show greater activity than that observed with NADPH alone and catalyzed by the microsomal NOD activity (Fig. 4E) (23Hallstrom C.K. Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. Free Radic.

Processive stepping along the long pitch helix of actin may provide a mechanism for disassembly of fascin-actin bundles. Forward steps and detachment are weakly force-dependent at all forces, consistent with rate-limiting and force-dependent ADP release. However, backward steps are nearly force-independent.

https://openalex.org/W2071320577,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases (V-ATPases) are responsible for organelle acidification in all eukaryotic cells. The yeast V-ATPase, known to be regulated by reversible disassembly in response to glucose deprivation, was recently reported to be regulated by extracellular pH as well (Padilla-López, S., and Pearce, D. A. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 10273-10280). Consistent with those results, we find 57% higher V-ATPase activity in vacuoles isolated after cell growth at extracellular pH of 7 than after growth at pH 5 in minimal medium. Remarkably, under these conditions, the V-ATPase also becomes largely insensitive to reversible disassembly, maintaining a low vacuolar pH and high levels of V(1) subunit assembly, ATPase activity, and proton pumping during glucose deprivation. Cytosolic pH is constant under these conditions, indicating that the lack of reversible disassembly is not a response to altered cytosolic pH. We propose that when alternative mechanisms of vacuolar acidification are not available, maintaining V-ATPase activity becomes a priority, and the pump is not down-regulated in response to energy limitation. These results also suggest that integrated pH and metabolic inputs determine the final assembly state and activity of the V-ATPase."

ArfGAP proteins stimulate Arf intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by a mechanism that is still unresolved. Using a fusion construct we solved the structure of the ArfGAP ASAP3 in complex with Arf6 in the transition state. This structure clarifies the ArfGAP catalytic mechanism and shows a glutamine((Arf6)) and an arginine finger((ASAP3)) as the important catalytic residues. Unexpectedly the structure shows a calcium ion, liganded by both proteins in the complex interface, stabilizing the interaction and orienting the catalytic machinery. Calcium stimulates the GAP activity of ASAPs, but not other members of the ArfGAP family. This type of regulation is unique for GAPs and any other calcium-regulated processes and hints at a crosstalk between Ca(2+) and Arf signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2021890127,"In growth cones of Xenopus spinal neurons, Hines et al. show that the chemorepellant myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) induces asymmetric endocytosis of β1-integrin, via a calcium- and PI3K-dependent mechanism. Further, they show that polarized β1-integrin function is necessary and sufficient for growth cone repulsion. Gradients of chemorepellent factors released from myelin may impair axon pathfinding and neuroregeneration after injury. We found that, analogously to the process of chemotaxis in invasive tumor cells, axonal growth cones of Xenopus spinal neurons modulate the functional distribution of integrin receptors during chemorepulsion induced by myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). A focal MAG gradient induced polarized endocytosis and concomitant asymmetric loss of β1-integrin and vinculin-containing adhesions on the repellent side during repulsive turning. Loss of symmetrical β1-integrin function was both necessary and sufficient for chemorepulsion, which required internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Induction of repulsive Ca2+ signals was necessary and sufficient for the stimulated rapid endocytosis of β1-integrin. Altogether, these findings identify β1-integrin as an important functional cargo during Ca2+-dependent rapid endocytosis stimulated by a diffusible guidance cue. Such dynamic redistribution allows the growth cone to rapidly adjust adhesiveness across its axis, an essential feature for initiating chemotactic turning."

https://openalex.org/W2080421302,"In mucosal tissues, epithelial M cells capture and transport microbes across the barrier to underlying immune cells. Previous studies suggested that high affinity ligands targeting M cells may be used to deliver mucosal vaccines; here, we show that particle composition and dispersion buffer ionic strength can independently influence their uptake in vivo. First, addition of a poloxamer 188 to nanoparticle formulations increased uptake of intranasally administered nanoparticles in vivo, but the effect was dependent on the presence of the M cell-targeting ligand. Second, solvent ionic strength is known to effect electrostatic interactions; accordingly, reduced ionic strength increased the electrostatic potential between the epithelium and the particles. Interestingly, below a critical ionic strength, intranasal particle uptake in vivo significantly was increased even when controlled for osmolarity. Similar results were obtained for uptake of bacterial particles. Surprisingly, at low ionic strength, the specific enhancement effect by the targeting peptide was negligible. Modeling of the electrostatic forces predicted that the enhancing effects of the M cell-targeting ligand only are enabled at high ionic strength, as particle electrostatic forces are reduced through Debye screening. Thus, electrostatic forces can have a dramatic effect on the in vivo M cell particle uptake independent of the action of targeting ligands. Examination of these forces will be helpful to optimizing mucosal vaccine and drug delivery."

The enzymes catalyzing this reduction are in general nonspecific and would also reduce d-xylose to xylitol, the first step in eukaryotic d-xylose catabolism. It is not clear whether microorganisms use different enzymes depending on the carbon source. Here we show that Aspergillus niger makes use of two different enzymes. We identified, cloned, and characterized an l-arabinose reductase, larA, that is different from the d-xylose reductase, xyrA. The larA is up-regulated on l-arabinose, while the xyrA is up-regulated on d-xylose. There is however an initial up-regulation of larA also on d-xylose but that fades away after about 4 h. The deletion of the larA gene in A. niger results in a slow growth phenotype on l-arabinose, whereas the growth on d-xylose is unaffected. The l-arabinose reductase can convert l-arabinose and d-xylose to their corresponding sugar alcohols but has a higher affinity for l-arabinose. The K(m) for l-arabinose is 54 + or - 6 mm and for d-xylose 155 + or - 15 mm."

We have previously identified a mutant plant toxin protein, RTA (ricin A-chain nontoxic mutant), as the first in vivo Png1 (the cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-dependent ERAD substrate. Here, we report a new genetic device to assay the Png1-dependent ERAD pathway using the new model protein designated RTL (RTA-transmembrane-Leu2). Our extensive studies using different yeast mutants identified various factors involved in RTL degradation. The degradation of RTA/RTL was independent of functional Sec61 but was dependent on Der1. Interestingly, ER-mannosidase Mns1 was not involved in RTA degradation, but it was dependent on Htm1 (ERAD-related α-mannosidase in yeast) and Yos9 (a putative degradation lectin), indicating that mannose trimming by Mns1 is not essential for efficient ERAD of RTA/RTL.

The distribution of AP sites was determined in DNA fibers from vertebrate cells maintained under normal culture conditions or stressed with exogenous H(2)O(2). AP lesions per unit length were enumerated in bulk DNA or at replication sites. The background density of AP sites in DNA fibers was 5.4 AP sites/10(6) nt, while newly replicated DNA contained 12.9 AP sites/10(6) nt. In cells exposed to 20 μM H(2)O(2), AP sites in newly replicated DNA increased to 20.8/10(6) nt. Determinations of AP site density in bulk DNA by fiber analysis or standard slot blot assays agreed to within 10%.

The cofactor, GroES, consists of a dome-shaped heptameric ring of identical 10-kDa subunits. The widely accepted model of protein folding mediated by the GroEL-GroES chaperonin system is as follows. (i) The denatured protein is injected into one of GroEL rings (cis-ring) upon the ATP-dependent formation of the GroEL-GroES complex. (ii) ATP hydrolysis in the cis-ring results in the formation of the GroEL-GroES complex with bound ADP. (iii) Subsequent ATP binding to the opposite ring (trans-ring) induces the release of GroES, ADP, and the encapsulated protein from the cis-ring.

Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide and streptavidin were from Invitrogen. Maleimide PEO2-biotin was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Cy3 maleimide and Cy5 NHS-ester were from GE Healthcare. Polyvinylphosphonic acid was from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Other reagents were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals. An expression plasmid of tandem-fused GroES heptamer containing ES98C subunit at the C terminus (t-ES98C) was generated as previously described (15.Sakane I. Hongo K. Motojima F. Murayama S. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16.Nojima T. Murayama S. Yoshida M. Motojima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18385-18392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ES98C is a GroES mutant with a cysteine residue added at the C terminus of each subunit (17.Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GroEL and GroES were expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (18.Motojima F. Makio T. Aoki K. Makino Y. Kuwajima K. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ES98C was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide and maleimide PEO2-biotin at a ratio of 1:1:1 in HKM buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). t-ES98C was labeled with Cy3 maleimide in HKM buffer. Wild-type GroEL was labeled with Cy5 monofunctional NHS-ester in HKM buffer containing 20 mm sodium bicarbonate to raise the pH (∼8.5). Fluorescently labeled proteins were purified using NAP5 columns (GE Healthcare). The concentrations of the fluorescently labeled GroES mutants were determined using the Bradford method (Protein Assay; Bio-Rad). The concentration of Cy5-labeled GroEL (Cy5-EL) was determined by correcting for the 280 nm absorbance of the conjugated dye using the molar extinction coefficient of 130,480 m−1cm−1. The concentrations of GroEL and GroES were expressed as the molar concentrations of the tetradecamer and heptamer. The concentrations of the fluorescent dyes were determined using the following molar extinction coefficients: Alexa Fluor 488, 72,000 m−1cm−1 at 494 nm; Cy3, 150,000 m−1cm−1 at 552 nm; Cy5, 250,000 m−1cm−1 at 649 nm. The molar ratios of Alexa Fluor 488 to the ES98C, Cy3 to t-ES98C, and Cy5 to wild-type GroEL were 0.86, 1.0, and 1.4, respectively. Fluorescently labeled GroEL and GroES exhibited behaviors similar to those of the wild-type proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). ZMWs were fabricated as previously described (19.Miyake T. Tanii T. Sonobe H. Akahori R. Shimamoto N. Ueno T. Funatsu T. Ohdomari I. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To immobilize Alexa488-labeled ES98C (A488bio-ES) selectively at the bottom of ZMWs, polyvinylphosphonic acid was deposited onto an aluminum film as previously described (20.Korlach J. Marks P.J. Cicero R.L. Gray J.J. Murphy D.L. Roitman D.B. Pham T.T. Otto G.A. Foquet M. Turner S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A flow cell was constructed from a glass slide and coverslip with ZMWs separated by two spaces of ∼50-μm thickness (Lumirror 50-S10; Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan). A488bio-ES was immobilized on to the bottom of the ZMWs through biotinylated bovine serum albumin and streptavidin as previously described (21.Suzuki M. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Miura T. Zako T. Akahori R. Miyake T. Shimamoto N. Aoki M. Tanii T. Ohdomari I. Funatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23931-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experimental results shown in this paper were obtained in HKM buffer containing 50 nm Cy5-EL, 300 nm Cy3-labeled t-ES98C (Cy3-ES), 2 mm ATP, 10 μm reduced LA (rLA), an ATP-regeneration system (5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase), an oxygen scavenging system (0.45% (w/v) d-glucose, 50 units/ml glucose oxidase, and 50 units/ml catalase), 7 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm Trolox. rLA (50 μm) was prepared by incubating LA with 10 mm dithiothreitol for >10 min at room temperature prior to experiments. rLA is a favorable substrate protein for this experiment because rLA exists in a denatured state irrespective of the presence of GroEL (22.Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The solution contained an ATP regeneration system to keep the ATP concentration constant. This is because formation of the football-shaped complex is inhibited by ADP (14.Sameshima T. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Ishii N. Terada N. Okabe K. Funatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23765-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Trolox was added to improve photophysical properties of Cy5 in solution (23.Rasnik I. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Because 300 nm Cy3-ES was required to form saturating amounts of the football-shaped complex (supplemental Fig. S2), experiments were performed in the presence of 300 nm Cy3-ES. Single molecules in ZMWs were observed using an epi-illumination configuration in an inverted microscope (IX71; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an oil-immersion objective (ApoN 60 × OTIRFM, NA 1.49; Olympus). The surface-immobilized A488bio-ES was illuminated with a 488-nm laser (Sapphire 488–200 CDRH; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Fluorescence signal from Alexa Fluor 488 was obtained with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera (C9100-13; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) through a dichroic mirror (505DRLP; Omega Optical, Inc., Brattleboro, VT) and an emission filter (520DF35; Omega Optical) (supplemental Fig. S3A). Cy3-ES and Cy5-EL molecules were simultaneously excited with 532-nm (COMPASS315M-100; Coherent) and 635-nm lasers (Radius 635-25; Coherent) reflected by a custom-made dichroic mirror (Asahi Spectra, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence signals from Cy3 and Cy5 were separated by a dichroic mirror and passed through emission filters (593DF40 for Cy3 and 680DF35 for Cy5; Omega Optical) in DualView optics (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) (supplemental Fig. S3B). The fluorescence images were recorded every 200 ms for 5 min. Observations were carried out at 23 °C. In the experimental conditions, photobleaching of Cy3 and Cy5 occurred with rate constants of 0.034 and 0.019 s−1, respectively. The recorded images were analyzed using a homemade program on a Halcon image processor (MVTec Software GmbH, München, Germany) to obtain the time courses of fluorescence intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 signals. To characterize the formation processes of the football-shaped complexes, we picked up the events that signals from Cy3-ES were detected while Cy5-EL molecules stayed on the surface of ZMWs. The duration of GroEL-GroES binding was determined by marking the association and dissociation events of Cy3-ES and Cy5-EL molecules. To determine decay rate constants, histograms of lifetimes of the football-shaped and bullet-shaped complexes were fitted by the following equation that makes correction of photobleaching of Cy3 and Cy5:N(t)=c⋅exp⁡(−(k+kb)t)(Eq. 1) where N(t) is the number of the football-shaped or bullet-shaped complexes at time t, t is the duration of the football-shaped or bullet-shaped complexes, and k is the decay rate constant, respectively. kb means the rate constant for photobleaching of Cy3 and Cy5 (0.034 and 0.019 s−1). Data fitting was carried out using the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software). We employed a single-molecule assay to probe the GroEL-GroES interaction, including the football-shaped complex. To detect the football-shaped complexes at a single-molecule level, we designed the following experimental system (Fig. 1). A cysteine-introduced GroES variant (ES98C) (17.Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) modified with Alexa Fluor 488 and biotin (termed A488bio-ES) was immobilized in ZMWs through a biotin-streptavidin linkage. We have previously confirmed that the immobilization of GroES does not perturb the binding to GroEL (21.Suzuki M. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Miura T. Zako T. Akahori R. Miyake T. Shimamoto N. Aoki M. Tanii T. Ohdomari I. Funatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23931-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Wild-type GroEL was fluorescently labeled with Cy5 (termed Cy5-EL). Additionally, a Cy3 fluorophore was specifically attached to the ES98C subunit of the tandem-fused GroES heptamer (15.Sakane I. Hongo K. Motojima F. Murayama S. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16.Nojima T. Murayama S. Yoshida M. Motojima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18385-18392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (termed Cy3-ES) in a 1:1 ratio. Surface-immobilized A488bio-ES was immersed in a solution containing 50 nm Cy5-EL, 300 nm Cy3-ES, 2 mm ATP, and excess amounts of LA, in which the disulfide bonds were reduced (i.e. rLA). 300 nm Cy3-ES was required to obtain saturating amounts of the football-shaped complexes (supplemental Fig. S2). In such conditions, conventional single-molecule imaging by total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy was not suitable because fluorescence from a single molecule could not be detected due to the high background signal from the fluorescent molecules in the solution. To overcome this issue, we adapted a single-molecule assay with ZMWs. ZMWs comprise nanoscale holes in an aluminum film deposited on a fused silica coverslip and can reduce the observation volume by more than 3 orders of magnitude relative to total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (24.Levene M.J.

Korlach J. Turner S. Science. 2009; 323: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar). The ZMWs used in this study were ∼80 nm in diameter and ∼160 nm in depth (Fig. 1). The aluminum surface was coated with polyvinylphosphonic acid to prevent nonspecific protein adsorption (20.Korlach J. Marks P.J. Cicero R.L. Gray J.J. Murphy D.L. Roitman D.B. Pham T.T. Otto G.A. Foquet M. Turner S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The positions of single molecules of surface-immobilized A488bio-ES were determined by the fluorescence of Alexa Fluor 488. Freely diffusing Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES were observed to bind to and dissociate from A488bio-ES. Each binding event caused an increase in the fluorescence signal because Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES in solution cannot be observed due to rapid Brownian motion (26.Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As expected, fluorescences of Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES were detected simultaneously at the position of the immobilized A488bio-ES, indicating that the football-shaped complexes are formed in ZMWs. The repeated appearance and disappearance of Cy3-ES fluorescence were often observed, whereas Cy5-EL fluorescence continued over time (data not shown). The events imply that multiple rounds of association and dissociation of Cy3-ES to and from the bullet-shaped complex formed with Cy5-EL and A488bio-ES located on the surface. In contrast, the simultaneous appearance of Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES fluorescence was hardly observed without immobilization of A488bio-ES in ZMWs (data not shown). According to the time course of fluorescence intensities of Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES, the formation process of the football-shaped complex could be classified into two types. In Type I, the bullet-shaped complex between Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES attached to A488bio-ES on the glass surface to form the football-shaped complex (Fig. 2, A and B). In Type II, Cy5-EL attached to A488bio-ES on the glass surface followed by attachment of Cy3-ES to form the football-shaped complex (Fig. 2C). Type I was classified further into subtypes, Type Ia and Type Ib, according to the decay process of the football-shaped complex. In Type Ia, the football-shaped complex dissociated to A488bio-ES and the bullet-shaped complex between Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES (Fig. 2A). In Type Ib, the football-shaped complex dissociated to Cy3-ES and the bullet-shaped complex composed of Cy5-EL and A488bio-ES (Fig. 2B). The percentage of each type was determined as follows: Type Ia, 30%; Type Ib, 48%; Type II, 22% (n = 926, Fig. 2D). We analyzed the decay process of the football-shaped complex to the bullet-shaped complex. The first GroES molecule to bind was sometimes the first GroES molecule to dissociate from the football-shaped complex (Type Ib), and the second GroES molecule to bind was sometimes the first GroES molecule to dissociate from the football-shaped complex (Type Ia). This observation indicates that the first GroES molecule to bind does not always dissociate from the football-shaped complex prior to the second GroES dissociation event. In other words, the dissociation of GroES molecules from the football-shaped complex can occur in a random order. We also found that GroEL exited in three different states, that is, GroEL alone, the bullet-shaped complex, and the football-shaped complex. This finding indicated the existence of two reaction cycles in the GroEL-GroES interaction: bullet cycle (GroEL ↔ bullet-shaped complex) and football cycle (bullet-shaped complex ↔ football-shaped complex) (Fig. 3C). We then examined the lifetimes of the football-shaped and the bullet-shaped complexes (Fig. 3). Time courses of fluorescence intensities of Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES under the Type Ia and Ib interactions were analyzed (Fig. 2, A and B). The type II interaction was excluded from the analysis because in this interaction it was difficult to obtain adequate amounts of data for statistical purposes. The lifetime of the football-shaped complex was measured as the dwell time of both Cy5-EL and Cy3-ES on the surface (Fig. 3, A and B). The histograms of the lifetime of the football-shaped complexes in Type Ia and Ib interactions fitted well to single-exponential decay curves (with the coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.943 and 0.979, respectively). The decay rate constants obtained were as follows: 0.21 ± 0.024 s−1 for Type Ia interactions and 0.34 ± 0.027 s−1 for Type Ib interactions (values are reported with the errors of the fits) (Fig. 3, A and B). The average lifetimes of the football-shaped complex determined from Type Ia and Ib interactions, the reciprocal of the decay rate constants, were ∼4.8 s and ∼2.9 s, respectively. The lifetime of the bullet-shaped complex was measured as the dwell time of Cy5-EL on the surface following the Cy3-ES dissociation in the Type Ib interaction (Fig. 3B). The histogram of the lifetime of the bullet-shaped complex was found to fit to a single-exponential decay (R2 = 0.950) with a rate constant of 0.18 ± 0.010 s−1 (the value is reported with the fitting error) (Fig. 3B). The average lifetime of the bullet-shaped complex was estimated to be ∼5.6 s. We developed a single-molecule assay using ZMWs to probe the GroEL-GroES interaction in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of fluorescently labeled GroES. The assay allowed the direct observation and characterization of the football-shaped and the bullet-shaped GroEL-GroES complexes in real time. The decay process of the football-shaped complex to the bullet-shaped complex was analyzed. Here, the initially bound GroES does not always dissociate from the football-shaped complex prior to the dissociation of the second GroES molecule, i.e. dissociation of GroES molecules from the football-shaped complex can occur in a random order. The football-shaped complex appears to be formed when both rings of GroEL are occupied with ATP (11.Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23774-23781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14.Sameshima T. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Ishii N. Terada N. Okabe K. Funatsu T. J. Biol.

Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), GroES can dissociate from the GroEL ring in which ATP hydrolysis occurs. The average lifetime of the football complex determined by the Type Ia interaction (∼4.8 s) was longer than that determined for the Type Ib interaction (∼2.9 s). The difference may be due to the GroEL ring with the initially bound GroES showing higher ATPase activity than the GroEL ring with a second GroES molecule bound. We have also found the existence of two cycles in the GroEL-GroES interaction: bullet cycle and football cycle (Fig. 3C). GroEL can use both the bullet cycle and the football cycle, and the choice of cycle is situation-dependent. The bullet-shaped complex is considered to work as a platform for two cycles. This study was performed in the presence of excess amounts of denatured proteins. In this situation, the lifetime of the football-shaped complex, that is, the transition time from the football-shaped complex to the bullet-shaped complex, was estimated to be 3–5 s, whereas the lifetime of the bullet-shaped complex, the transition time from the bullet-shaped complex to GroEL, was ∼6 s (Fig. 3C). It is now clear that the functional cycle of GroEL is too complicated to be fully understood by the use of conventional ensemble techniques. Single-molecule assays will play increasingly important and indispensable roles in the study of the molecular mechanism of the chaperonin reaction cycle.

In cell adhesion, it bridges the transmembrane cadherin and the actin-binding protein α-catenin and is essential for adherens junction formation, whereas in canonical Wnt signaling, it shuttles between the cytosol and nucleus and functions as an essential transcriptional activator. Schmidtea mediterranea β-catenin-1 was identified as a determinant of antero-posterior polarity during body regeneration by mediating Wnt signaling. Here we show that S. mediterranea β-catenin-2 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells in the gut and pharynx, where it has a putative role in mediating cell adhesion. We show evidence that planarian β-catenin-1 and -2 have distinct biochemical properties. β-Catenin-1 can interact with the components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway but not with α-catenin, whereas β-catenin-2 interacts with cell adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin and α-catenin, but not with Wnt signaling components. Consistent with their specific function, β-catenin-1 is a potent transcriptional activator, whereas β-catenin-2 has no transcriptional activity. Protein sequence alignment also indicates that the planarian β-catenin-1 and -2 retain distinct critical residues and motifs, which are in agreement with the differences in their biochemical properties. At last, phylogenetic analysis reveals a probable Platyhelminthes- specific structural and functional segregation from which the monofunctional β-catenins evolved.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). α-Catenin, in turn, binds and bundles actin filaments through its C-terminal domain (2Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R.

In addition, β-catenin also functions as a key component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates a variety of cellular processes (6Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The N terminus contains two α-catenin binding domains and one DSG motif (DpSGΦXpS, Φ represents a hydrophobic amino acid, and X represents any amino acid), in which the two phosphorylated serines (pS) could be recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and this causes the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin (10Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr.

The C terminus contains the transactivation domain and recruits multiple transcriptional coactivators and inhibitors (19Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Hecht A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Städeli R. Hoffmans R. Basler K. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 378-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the extreme C terminus, there is a PDZ binding motif that has been found to participate in cell adhesion and establish cell polarity in epithelial cells (21Perego C. Vanoni C. Massari S. Longhi R. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3978-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Vertebrates have two closely related β-catenin homologs, β-catenin and plakoglobin (also named γ-catenin). Both of them have a similar structure and function in adherens junctions through interaction with E-cadherin and α-catenin (22Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Science. 1992; 257: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition, plakoglobin is specifically involved in desmosome function. Both plakoglobin and β-catenin are able to interact with the major Wnt signaling components, including APC, Axin, and TCF/LEF (24Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Moreover, both can directly activate transcription when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or the HMG box (DNA binding domain) from LEF1 (19Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Hecht A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Unlike vertebrates, Drosophila melanogaster has only one β-catenin homolog, armadillo, which functions in both cell adhesion and canonical Wnt signaling (26Orsulic S. Peifer M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, however, at least three divergent β-catenin homologs, BAR-1, WRM-1, and HMP-2, have been identified. Among them, WRM-1 mediates Wnt signaling via the TCF homologue POP-1, and HMP-2 functions in cell adhesion via binding to the cadherin homologue HMR-1 (27Korswagen H.C. Herman M.A. Clevers H.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function studies indicate that each of the C. elegans β-catenins has distinct functions, yet overexpression of WRM-1 or HMP-2 can rescue the BAR-1 mutant phenotype (28Natarajan L. Witwer N.E. Eisenmann D.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 159-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, all of them can directly activate transcription when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in yeast, suggesting that all of the C. elegans β-catenins have retained their functional redundancy, remaining bifunctional (28Natarajan L. Witwer N.E. Eisenmann D.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 159-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, two full-length β-catenin homologs, β-catenin-1 and -2 (Smed-β-catenin-1/2) have been reported (29Petersen C.P. Reddien P.W. Science. 2008; 319: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Gurley K.A. Rink J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A.

Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). RNAi of β-catenin-1 resulted in an anteriorized phenotype during regeneration and in intact animals. In addition, RNAi of Smed-dishevelled, Smed-evi/wls, and Smed-WntP-1 caused a similar phenotype (30Gurley K.A. Rink J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. Science. 2008; 319: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 32Adell T. Salò E. Boutros M. Bartscherer K. Development. 2009; 136: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Petersen C.P. Reddien P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2009; 106: 17061-17066Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and RNAi of apc, the negative regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling, caused the opposite phenotype, the double-tail worms (30Gurley K.A. Rink J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. Science. 2008; 319: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that, similar to antero-posterior (A-P) axis determination in vertebrate embryos, A-P patterning in planarians is regulated by canonical Wnt signaling and that Smed-β-catenin-1 is involved in transducing the Wnt signal. In contrast, RNAi of Smed-β-catenin-2 did not reveal any obvious abnormality (30Gurley K.A. Rink J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. Science. 2008; 319: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Smed-β-catenin-1 but not -2 induced a secondary body axis in Xenopus embryos, a characteristic indication of Wnt signal activation, suggesting that planarian β-catenins have distinct signaling activities (31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Here we show that S. mediterranea β-catenin-2 is localized to cell junctions in the epithelia of the gut and pharynx. Biochemical analysis shows that Smed-β-catenin-1 functions specifically in Wnt signaling and Smed-β-catenin-2 in cell adhesion. This complete functional segregation is accompanied by a corresponding structural diversification. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis further reveal a unique evolutionary subfunctionalization of β-catenin genes in two planarian species and possibly also in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. The planarians used belong to an asexual race of S. mediterranea collected from Montjuïc (Barcelona, Spain) and maintained as described elsewhere (34Molina M.D. Saló E. Cebrià F. Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To generate the LEF1-HMG fusion constructs, the cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 268–394 of mouse LEF1 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pcDNA3-Myc vector at EcoRI/BamHI sites to obtain LEF1-HMG. The cDNAs encoding full-length Smed-β-catenins or their C terminus (Smed-β-cat1, amino acids 740–954; Smed-β-cat2, amino acids 508–701) were inserted into LEF1-HMG at EcoRI/KpnI sites. The fragment encoding amino acids 958–1287 of human APC was cloned into the vector pcDNA3-FLAG, and this partial APC was used to detect interaction with β-catenins. To generate the construct of Smed-β-cat1FL-2N, the N terminus of Smed-β-cat2(1–71) was inserted in front of full-length Smed-β-cat1. To create the mutants of F253D, F293D, and F253D/F293D, Phe242 and Phe282 of Smed-β-catenin-1 were mutated to aspartate separately or simultaneously (corresponding to human β-catenin Phe253 and Phe293). All constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids were transfected in triplicate with Vigofect transfection reagent (Vigorous). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 36 h after transfection using the Dual-Luc assay kit (Promega). TOPflash luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla. The following amounts of reporter plasmid were added per well: Super-TOPflash (1 ng) and pRL-TK (0.5 ng). PCS2+ DNA was used to adjust the total DNA amount to 150 ng/well. anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma; anti-Myc and anti-hemagglutinin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal antibody against Smed-β-catenin-2 was produced against the last 14 amino acids of Smed-β-catenin-2 protein (AC EU082825) by Invitrogen. It was used at a 1:2000 dilution. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase and highly cross-absorbed Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for immunodetection of Smed-b-catenin-2 in whole mount immunostainings. HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing in PBS twice for 5 min, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. Then the samples were washed three times for 10 min in PBS and then incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by washing three times for 10 min in PBS and staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science) for 2 min. Finally, cells were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at 4 °C before imaging. Images were recorded using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with plasmid DNA samples in the following day. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed and then sonicated in 400 μl of lysis buffer/well (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 15 min, 40 μl of supernatant was mixed with 8 μl of 6× SDS-loading buffer and treated at 95 °C for 2 min. The remaining supernatant was incubated with FLAG-M2 beads (Sigma) or other antibodies (anti-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin) at 4 °C for 4 h and followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight. The beads were than washed at least three times with lysis buffer at 4 °C for 5 min each, and bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. When testing the interactions between β-catenins with β-Trcp (β-transducin repeat-containing protein), 25 mm ALLN (Sigma) was added to the culture medium 4 h before harvesting the cells, and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate) were added to the lysis buffer. Total lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with specific antibodies. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (35Cebrià F. Newmark P.A. Development. 2005; 132: 3691-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After washing, staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science) was performed overnight, and animals were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at 4 °C before imaging. Images were recorded using a Leica SPII confocal microscope. RNAi analysis was performed by double-stranded RNA microinjection. Smed-β-catenin-2 double-stranded RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription (Roche Applied Science). Planarians were injected with around 50 ng of double-stranded RNA for 3 days, and on the next day they were amputated pre- and postpharyngeally, and the head, trunk, and tail pieces were allowed to regenerate. All animals where fixed with Carnoy solution at 20 days of regeneration. Control animals were injected with water. The full-length sequences of all β-catenin proteins were downloaded from NCBI and aligned using the ClustalW program. The armadillo repeats were identified with SMART (available from the EMBL Web site). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the minimum evolution method with bootstrap 1000 replications using the Mega 3.1 program. Gaps were completely deleted. Accession numbers were as follows: Homo sapiens, NP_002221.1, NP_001895.1; Mus musculus, NP_034723.1, AAA37280.1; Xenopus laevis, AAA49931.1; Danio rerio, AAH47815.1, NP_571252.1; Xenopus tropicalis, AAI35470.1; D. melanogaster, NP_476666.1; Nasonia vitripennis, XP_001603109.1; Pharhyale hawaiensis, ACH92925; Aplysia californica, AAY29569.1; Cerebratulus lacteus, ABY21456.1; Platynereis dumerilii, ABQ85061.1; Chaetopterus variopedatus, AAL49497.1; Dugesia japonica, BAD93243.1; Hydra magnipapillata, AAC47137.1; S. mediterranea, ABW79875.1, ABW79874.1; S. mansoni, XM_002573746.1 (Sm-β-catenin-1; see supplemental Fig. 2 for Sm-β-catenin-2); Dictyostelium discoideum, XP_646234. Smed-β-catenin-2 mRNA is mostly expressed in the digestive tissue (31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In order to detect the endogenous protein, we developed a polyclonal rabbit antibody against the last 14 amino acids of Smed-β-catenin-2. Immunohistochemistry using this antibody revealed staining of the gut branches, pharynx, and epidermal cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Higher magnification images showed that Smed-β-catenin-2 protein was clearly and specifically localized in the cell membrane of the epithelial cells of the epidermis (Fig. 1B) and pharynx (Fig. 1C). Note that both the inner and outer epithelial layers of the pharynx were labeled, whereas the nearby muscle cells were not stained (Fig. 1C and supplemental Movie 1). Higher magnification images of the gut indicated that the antibody labeled tubular structures (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Smed-β-catenin-2 protein is also strongly expressed in the cell membrane of the gut epithelial cells. Immunostaining of Smed-β-catenin-2 RNAi-treated animals with the anti Smed-β-catenin-2 antibody demonstrated the specificity of the antibody labeling (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that Smed-β-catenin-2 corresponds to the β-catenin responsible for mediating cell adhesion and is mostly localized to areas of cell-cell contact in the epithelia. It has been reported that Smed-β-catenin-1 acts in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to regulate A-P axis determination in planarians (29Petersen C.P. Reddien P.W. Science. 2008; 319: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Gurley K.A. Rink J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. Science. 2008; 319: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our immunohistochemical observations suggested that, in contrast, Smed-β-catenin-2 is involved in cell adhesion. To explore the biochemical differences between these two β-catenin proteins, we compared their signal transduction capacity and cell adhesion activities in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. In these experiments, human or Xenopus β-catenin were used as positive controls because they are functional in both contexts. Previous studies have shown that β-catenin mediates cell adhesion by bridging cadherin and α-catenin, which further links to actin fibers (4Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar, 5Jamora C. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis clearly indicated that Smed-β-catenin-2 contains the two conserved α-catenin-binding domains in the N terminus, whereas Smed-β-catenin-1 does not (supplemental Fig. 1) (31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As predicted, when co-transfected in HEK293T cells, Smed-β-catenin-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with α-catenin, whereas Smed-β-catenin-1 was not (Fig. 2A). Moreover, when these two α-catenin-binding domains of Smed-β-catenin-2 were transplanted to the N terminus of Smed-β-catenin-1, the resulting fusion protein (Smed-β-catenin-1FL-2N) regained α-catenin binding (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, however, when E-cadherin was co-expressed with the two Smed-β-catenins, it could interact with both, albeit to a slightly lesser extent with β-catenin-1 (Fig. 2C). We also found that the subcellular localization of the two planarian β-catenins were different. When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, Smed-β-catenin-1 localized mainly to the nucleus, where Smed-β-catenin2 was never observed. In contrast, Smed-β-catenin-2 was largely localized to the cytosol and weakly at the cell membrane (Fig. 2D, left panels). Furthermore, overexpressed E-cadherin was able to recruit both Smed-β-catenins to the cell membrane (Fig. 2D), indicating that both β-catenins are able to interact with E-cadherin. Because the three-dimensional structure of both human and zebrafish β-catenin has been resolved and the armadillo repeats of Smed-β-catenins are quite conserved (supplemental Fig. 1), we performed three-dimensional modeling. The predicted three-dimensional structures of Smed-β-catenin-1 and -2 both have very typical β-catenin backbones (data not shown), confirming the overall conservation of the protein family. Previous studies have revealed that within the central region of the protein, the armadillo repeat 4–9 in human β-catenin constitutes a core interacting platform for cadherin binding, in which Lys312 and Lys435 form the critical salt bridges with E-cadherin, and Asn387, Asn426, and His470 form the hydrogen bonds to strengthen the interaction (13Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In addition, Arg342, Tyr333, and Lys335 from armadillo repeats 3 and 4 also form salt bridges with phosphoserine residues in E-cadherin (13Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Tyr654 is also critical, such that β-catenin/E-cadherin binding would be 6 times weaker when it was phosphorylated (13Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). According to the predicted three-dimensional structure, we aligned the stretches of amino acid sequences that contain the critical residues for β-catenin/cadherin interaction (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the biochemical results, all of the mentioned residues were found to be conserved in both planarian β-catenins. The conservation of cadherin binding residues in planarian Smed-β-catenin-2 confirms that it is linked to cell adhesion. The conservation of these residues in Smed-β-catenin-1 is probably due to the fact that many of these residues are also essential for β-catenin to interact with TCF, APC, and Axin (see below). This may explain why Smed-β-catenin-1 still retains the capacity to interact with E-cadherin. These results suggested that Smed-β-catenin-2 is able to fulfill the adhesion function by interacting with both cadherin and α-catenin, whereas, despite retaining E-cadherin binding capacity, Smed-β-catenin-1 is incapable of functioning in cell adhesion due to a lack of α-catenin binding. Loss-of-function studies indicate that Smed-β-catenin-1 is required for A-P axis determination (29Petersen C.P. Reddien P.W. Science. 2008; 319: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Gurley K.A. Rink J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. Science. 2008; 319: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), whereas the expression pattern of Smed-β-catenin-2 suggests a role in cell adhesion in planarian. These findings are inconsistent with a bifunctional β-catenin as in most metazoans. As shown above, Smed-β-catenin-1 is unable to mediate cell adhesion due to lack of α-catenin binding. Because vertebrate plakoglobin and C. elegans HMP2, both of which are involved in cell adhesion alone in vivo, still retain signal transduction ability (28Natarajan L. Witwer N.E. Eisenmann D.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 159-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we addressed whether Smed-β-catenin-2 is able to directly trigger canonical Wnt signaling. Smed-β-catenin-1 but not -2 was reported to induce a secondary axis in Xenopus embryos (31Iglesias M. Gomez-Skarmeta J.L. Saló E. Adell T. Development. 2008; 135: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Here we used the Super-TOPflash reporter, a Wnt-responsive element-driven luciferase expression plasmid, to detect Wnt signaling in cultured mammalian cells. The reporter was significantly activated when increasing doses of Smed-β-catenin-1 were co-transfected, whereas Smed-β-catenin-2 had no affect at all (Fig. 3A). This reporter activation by Smed-β-catenin-1 was inhibited by co-transfection of Axin and further by Axin and GSK3β together (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the FOPflash reporter, a control reporter construct that contains mutant TCF binding sites, was not activated by Smed-β-catenin-1 (data not shown). These results indicate that Smed-β-catenin-1 is able to specifically activate canonical Wnt signaling in mammalian cells, whereas Smed-β-catenin-2 is inactive. Interestingly, these findings also confirm that cultured mammalian cells can be used to characterize planarian genes, at least for their signaling activities. Because the transcriptional activity of β-catenin is largely mediated by the LEF/TCF family of transcriptional factors (7Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar), we further tested the interaction of Smed-β-catenin-1/2 with TCF3. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments indicated that Smed-β-catenin-1 was able to interact with Xenopus TCF3, but Smed-β-catenin-2 was not (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that Smed-β-catenin-1 but not -2 has the potential to bind and function via a TCF transcription factor. Although an S. mediterranea TCF homolog has not been reported, several homologs are found in silico in the genome (data not shown). Binding to LEF/TCF transcription factors is a prerequisite for β-catenin to regulate target gene expression. The capacity to mediate direct transcriptional activation is also fundamental.

Transduced TNFR1 molecules lacking amino acid residues 229–244 (spanning the transmembrane/intercellular boundary) are expressed on the cell surface equivalently to full-length TNFR1 molecules but incompletely localize to caveolae. A peptide containing this sequence pulls down CAV-1 (caveolin-1) and TNFR1 from cell lysates but fails to do so following disruption of caveolae with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. We previously reported that methyl-β-cyclodextrin eliminates caveolae and blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced internalization of TNFR1 but not TNF-induced activation of NF-κB in EA.hy926 cells. Both CAV-1 and FLOT-2 (flotillin-2), organizing proteins of caveolae and lipid rafts, respectively, associate with caveolae in EA.hy926 cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CAV-1 but not FLOT-2 strikingly reduces caveolae number. Both knockdowns reduce total TNFR1 protein expression, but neither prevents TNFR1 localization to low density membrane domains, TNF-induced internalization of TNFR1, or NF-κB activation by TNF. Both CAV-1 and FLOT-2 knockdowns reduce TNF-mediated activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). However, both knockdowns reduce expression of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor-2) protein, and small interfering RNA targeting of TRAF2 also selectively inhibits SAPK activation. We conclude that TNFR1 contains a membrane-proximal sequence that targets the receptor to caveolae/lipid rafts. Neither TNFR1 targeting to nor internalization from these low density membrane domains depends upon CAV-1 or FLOT-2. Furthermore, both NF-κB and SAPK activation appear independent of both TNFR1 localization to low density membrane domains and to TNF-induced receptor internalization.

However, both knockdowns reduce expression of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor-2) protein, and small interfering RNA targeting of TRAF2 also selectively inhibits SAPK activation. We conclude that TNFR1 contains a membrane-proximal sequence that targets the receptor to caveolae/lipid rafts. Neither TNFR1 targeting to nor internalization from these low density membrane domains depends upon CAV-1 or FLOT-2. Furthermore, both NF-κB and SAPK activation appear independent of both TNFR1 localization to low density membrane domains and to TNF-induced receptor internalization."

Despite the biological importance of IRF3, its in vivo phosphorylation pattern has not been reported. In this study, we have identified residues in IRF3 that are phosphorylated in vivo after infection with Sendai virus. We found that Sendai virus induced phosphorylation of the C-terminal residues Thr390 and Ser396, in addition to either Ser385 or Ser386. Moreover, Ser173 and Ser175 were constitutively phosphorylated. Ser396 has previously been suggested to be the major target of the IRF3-activating kinase TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase-1), whereas Thr390 has not previously been implicated in IRF3 regulation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that phosphorylation of Thr390 promotes Ser396 phosphorylation and binding to the coactivator cAMP-response element-binding protein. Taken together, our results show that IRF3 is subject to multiple interdependent phosphorylations, and we identify Thr390 as a novel in vivo phosphorylation site that modulates the phosphorylation status of TBK1-targeted Ser396.

https://openalex.org/W1978377027,"Centrobin/NIP2 is a centrosomal protein that is required for centrosome duplication. It is also critical for microtubule organization in both interphase and mitotic cells. In the present study, we observed that centrobin is phosphorylated in a cell cycle stage-specific manner, reaching its maximum at M phase. PLK1 is a kinase that is responsible for M phase-specific phosphorylation of centrobin. The microtubule forming activity of centrobin was enhanced by PLK1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, mitotic spindles were not assembled properly with the phospho-resistant mutant of centrobin. Based on these results, we propose that centrobin functions as a microtubule stabilizing factor and PLK1 enhances centrobin activity for proper spindle formation during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1997369411,"Retroviral integration is executed by the preintegration complex (PIC), which contains viral DNA together with a number of proteins. Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a cellular component of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) PICs, has been demonstrated to protect viral DNA from autointegration and stimulate the intermolecular integration activity of the PIC by its DNA binding activity. Recent studies reveal that the functions of BAF are regulated by phosphorylation via a family of cellular serine/threonine kinases called vaccinia-related kinases (VRK), and VRK-mediated phosphorylation causes a loss of the DNA binding activity of BAF. These results raise the possibility that BAF phosphorylation may influence the integration activities of the PIC through removal of BAF from viral DNA. In the present study, we report that VRK1 was able to abolish the intermolecular integration activity of MMLV PICs in vitro. This was accompanied by an enhancement of autointegration activity and dissociation of BAF from the PICs. In addition, in vitro phosphorylation of BAF by VRK1 abrogated the activity of BAF in PIC function. Among the VRK family members, VRK1 as well as VRK2, which catalyze hyperphosphorylation of BAF, could abolish PIC function. We also found that treatment of PICs with certain nucleotides such as ATP resulted in the inhibition of the intermolecular integration activity of PICs through the dissociation of BAF. More importantly, the ATP-induced disruption was not observed with the PICs from VRK1 knockdown cells. Our in vitro results therefore suggest the presence of cellular kinases including VRKs that can inactivate the retroviral integration complex via BAF phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2084568024,"The molecular mechanisms regulating smooth muscle-specific gene expression during smooth muscle development are poorly understood. Myocardin is an extraordinarily powerful cofactor of serum response factor (SRF) that stimulates expression of smooth muscle-specific genes. In an effort to search for proteins that regulate myocardin function, we identified a novel HMG box-containing protein HMG2L1 (high mobility group 2 like 1). We found that HMG2L1 expression is correlated with the smooth muscle cell (SMC) synthetic phenotype. Overexpression of HMG2L1 in SMCs down-regulated smooth muscle marker expression. Conversely, depletion of endogenous HMG2L1 in SMCs increases smooth muscle-specific gene expression. Furthermore, we found HMG2L1 specifically abrogates myocardin-induced activation of smooth muscle-specific genes. By GST pulldown assays, the interaction domains between HMG2L1 and myocardin were mapped to the N termini of each of the proteins. Finally, we demonstrated that HMG2L1 abrogates myocardin function through disrupting its binding to SRF and abolishing SRF-myocardin complex binding to the promoters of smooth muscle-specific genes. This study provides the first evidence of this novel HMG2L1 molecule playing an important role in attenuating smooth muscle differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2005837890,"Reactive molecules have diverse effects on cells and contribute to several pathological conditions. Cells have evolved complex protective systems to neutralize these molecules and restore redox homeostasis. Previously, we showed that association of nuclear factor (NF)-erythroid-derived 2 (E2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) with the nuclear matrix protein NRP/B was essential for the transcriptional activity of NRF2 target genes in tumor cells. The present study demonstrates the molecular mechanism by which NRP/B, via NRF2, modulates the transcriptional activity of antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven genes. NRP/B is localized in the nucleus of primary brain tissue and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) enhances the nuclear colocalization of NRF2 and NRP/B and induces heme oxygenase 1 (HO1). Treatment of NRP/B or NRF2 knockdowns with H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis. Co-expression of NRF2 with members of the Kelch protein family, NRP/B, MAYVEN, or MAYVEN-related protein 2 (MRP2), revealed that the NRF2-NRP/B complex is important for the transcriptional activity of ARE-driven genes HO1 and NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). NRP/B interaction with Nrf2 was mapped to NRF2 ECH homology 4 (Neh4)/Neh5 regions of NRF2. NRP/B mutations that resulted in low binding affinity to NRF2 were unable to activate NRF2-modulated transcriptional activity of the ARE-driven genes, HO1 and NQO1. Thus, the interaction of NRP/B with the Neh4/Neh5 domains of NRF2 is indispensable for activation of NRF2-mediated ARE-driven antioxidant and detoxifying genes that confer cellular defense against oxidative stress-induced damage."
https://openalex.org/W2029745910,"Switch 3 is a polypeptide loop conserved in all multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RNAPs) that extends into the main cleft of the RNAP and contacts each base in a nascent transcript as that base is released from the internal DNA-RNA hybrid. Plasmids have been constructed and transformed into Thermococcus kodakaraensis, which direct the constitutive synthesis of the archaeal RNAP subunit RpoB with an N-terminal His(6) tag and the Switch 3 loop either intact (wild-type) or deleted (DeltaS3). RNAPs containing these plasmid-encoded RpoB subunits were purified, and, in vitro, the absence of Switch 3 had no negative effects on transcription initiation or elongation complex stability but reduced the rate of transcript elongation. The defect in elongation occurred at every template position and increased the sensitivity of the archaeal RNAP to intrinsic termination. Comparing these properties and those reported for a bacterial RNAP lacking Switch 3 argues that this loop functions differently in the RNAPs from the two prokaryotic domains. The close structural homology of archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs would predict that eukaryotic Switch 3 loops likely conform to the archaeal rather than bacterial functional paradigm."

These imprinted genes have been shown to be essential for perinatal survivability in a previous study reporting that embryos with MatD12 and PatD12 (maternal and paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 12) died late in gestation with biallelic or no expression of these genes (16Georgiades P. Watkins M. Surani M.A. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Development. 2000; 127: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Imprinting on the Dlk1-Dio3 domain is regulated primarily by an intergenic DMR (IG-DMR) that is methylated during spermatogenesis (5Lin S.P. Youngson N. Takada S. Seitz H. Reik W. Paulsen M.

In mice, when the IG-DMR deletion is inherited from the paternal allele, the mutants have a normal phenotype and gene expression. In contrast, the maternally inherited IG-DMR deletion (IG-DMR(−/+)) results in perinatal lethality as well as biallelic expression of the paternally expressed genes and repression of the maternally expressed genes. The overexpression of Dlk1 and Rtl1 induces partial perinatal lethality in mice; therefore, biallelic expression is a possible cause of the lethality (17da Rocha S.T. Charalambous M. Lin S.P.

However, this possibility has not been confirmed completely because the expression levels of all of the genes in this domain are significantly different between the IG-DMR(−/+) mutant and wild-type (WT) mice. To clarify the relation between the lethality of the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants and overexpression of Dlk1 and Rtl1, we attempted a rescue experiment by mating female IG-DMR heterozygous mutants with male Gtl2 heterozygous mutants. The paternally inherited Gtl2/Gtl2 DMR deletion (Gtl2(+/−)) leads to a decrease in the expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1; consequently, the double mutant mice (IG-DMR(−/+)/ Gtl2(+/−)) would have normal expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1 (Fig. 1) (19Takahashi N. Okamoto A. Kobayashi R. Shirai M. Obata Y. Ogawa H. Sotomaru Y. Kono T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The double mutants showed no lethality at the perinatal stage; however, most of them died at the postnatal stage. These results indicate that the restoration of Dlk1 and Rtl1 was necessary but insufficient for normal development in the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants. The IG-DMR deletion and Gtl2 knock-out (KO) mutant mice were produced as described previously (5Lin S.P. Youngson N. Takada S. Seitz H. Reik W. Paulsen M. Cavaille J. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Nat.

These mutant lines only could be maintained when the deletion was inherited from the father, as deletion of maternally inherited IG-DMR results in perinatal lethality and maternally inherited Gtl2 deletion results in postnatal lethality. The IG-DMR deletion and Gtl2 KO mutant mice were maintained in a C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 background, respectively. The IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutant mice were obtained by mating female IG-DMR(+/−) with male Gtl2(+/−) mutant mice. Genotyping of the mutants was conducted by PCR amplification of DNA as described previously. These mutant mice were marked at birth and weighed every 3 days from birth to 7 weeks. E18.5 embryos were eviscerated and fixed in 99.5% ethanol for 1 week. For cartilage staining, samples were incubated with 0.015% Alcian blue (Sigma) in 80% ethanol and 20% glacial acetic acid for 1 day. Samples were hydrolyzed overnight in 2% KOH. For bone staining, samples were stained with 0.001% Alizarin red (Sigma) in 1% KOH for 3 h. Total RNA was extracted from the brain, tongue, lungs, and liver of E18.5 embryos using a mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). The cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a reaction solution (20 μl) containing total RNA (1 μg). Finally, we performed quantitative analysis using real-time PCR (7500 Real-time PCR system; Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for the analysis have been described previously (19Takahashi N. Okamoto A. Kobayashi R. Shirai M. Obata Y. Ogawa H. Sotomaru Y. Kono T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To conduct the Northern blot hybridization analysis for Rtl1, we isolated total and poly(A)+ RNA from the tongue and placenta using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the PolyATract(R) mRNA isolation system (Promega). We used pooled samples (n = 3 for each genotype), and the analysis was conducted three times. Signal intensities were calculated using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). The probes and methods used for analysis have been described previously (8Kawahara M. Wu Q. Takahashi N. Morita S. Yamada K. Ito M. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Kono T. Nat.

By crossing female IG-DMR heterozygous with male Gtl2 heterozygous mutants, we generated three genotypes of mice: IG-DMR(−/+), Gtl2(+/−), and IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) (Fig. 2A). The IG-DMR(−/+) mutants died at the perinatal stage showing morphological phenotypes, including a short body length and broad neck, whereas the Gtl2(+/−) mutants showed perinatal lethality with growth retardation of the fetus and placenta (Fig. 2B; Table 1); these findings are consistent with those of previous studies (19Takahashi N.

In contrast, the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) mutant mice were born in the expected Mendelian ratio and had normal physical characteristics (Fig. 2, B–E; Table 1). Although the double mutants survived at the perinatal stage, 70% of them died within 3 weeks of birth. The remaining double mutants showed weight loss at the weaning stage but grew into normal adults with reproductive ability. This suggests that although perinatal lethality disappears, postnatal abnormalities appear in the double mutants.TABLE 1The postnatal lethality depending on genotypeStageNo. of alive pups/total (%)WTIG-DMR(−/+)Gtl2(+/−)IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−)∼1 day14/15 (93)0/6 (0)1/11 (9)13/15 (87)∼1 week14/14 (100)1/1 (100)9/13 (69)∼2 weeks14/14 (100)1/1 (100)5/9 (56)∼3 weeks14/14 (100)1/1 (100)4/5 (80)Adult14/14 (100)1/1 (100)4/4 (100)Total14/15 (93)0/6 (0)1/11 (9)4/15 (27) Open table in a new tab Over- or underexpression of Dlk1 leads to skeletal defects. The IG-DMR(−/+) mutants showed the abnormal attachment of the eighth rib to the sternum (two of four embryos), unlike the WT embryos in whom only seven ribs were attached to the sternum. The Gtl2(+/−) mutants lacked the fifth ossification center (four of five embryos) (Fig. 3). In contrast, these skeletal defects were absent in all the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutants (four embryos) (Fig. 3). This indicates that the defect induced by abnormal Dlk1 expression was resolved in the double mutants. To obtain a better understanding of the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutant phenotype, we performed gene expression analysis of the imprinted genes in this domain (Fig. 4, A and B). First, we assayed the expression of Dlk1 and Rtl1 to determine the reason for perinatal survivability in the double mutants. The assay results showed that the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants overexpressed Dlk1 and Rtl1, whereas the Gtl2(+/−) mutants had decreased expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1, as expected. In the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutants, the expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1 were similar to those of the controls in all the tissues examined. This suggests that the restoration of Dlk1 and Rtl1 expression rescued perinatal lethality in the double mutants. To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the postnatal lethality of the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutant mice, we performed gene expression analysis of Rian and Mirg. The expression of Rian and Mirg was repressed in the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants and enhanced in Gtl2(+/−) mutants, as expected. In the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutants, the average expression level of Rian and Mirg in the brain was reduced to nearly one-fourth of that in the controls, and the average expression level of these genes in the tongue and lungs were half that in the controls. This demonstrates that postnatal lethality might be caused by the decrease in the expression levels of Rian and Mirg. The expression levels of these ncRNAs varied among the double mutants. In four of five samples, the expression levels of Rian and Mirg in the lungs decreased to <54% of that in the control levels; however, one sample showed an expression level identical to that of the controls. Additionally, in one of the five samples, the Rian expression level in the brain was two times the average of the other four samples. This might explain why 30% of the double mutants survived. These data suggest that the expression levels of Rian and Mirg determine the viability of the double mutant at the postnatal stage. The correct dosage of Dlk1 and Rtl1 is necessary for normal development, which is clearly evidenced in overexpression and deletion studies on genetically modified mice. One-third of the mutants expressing twice the normal dose of Dlk1 exhibit skeletal defects and die within the first 3 days of life (17da Rocha S.T. Charalambous M. Lin S.P. Gutteridge I. Ito Y. Gray D. Dean W. Ferguson-Smith A.C. PLoS. Genet. 2009; 5e1000392Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Dlk1 KO mice show dwarfism, and half of them die at the perinatal stage (21Moon Y.S. Smas C.M. Lee K. Villena J.A. Kim K.H. Yun E.J. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5585-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutants overexpressing Rtl1 display partial lethality with placentomegaly, and Rtl1 KO mice show perinatal lethality with growth retardation (18Sekita Y. Wagatsuma H. Nakamura K. Ono R. Kagami M. Wakisaka N. Hino T. Suzuki-Migishima R. Kohda T. Ogura A. Ogata T. Yokoyama M. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These reports suggested that over- and underexpression of Dlk1 and Rtl1 induced perinatal lethality. The IG-DMR regulates the expression of all the imprinted genes in the Dlk1-Dio3 domain, and all of the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants die perinatally and show biallelic expression of Dlk1 and Rtl1 (5Lin S.P. Youngson N. Takada S. Seitz H. Reik W. Paulsen M. Cavaille J. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Dlk1 and Rtl1 overexpression caused perinatal lethality, we tried to restore the expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1 in the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants by mating IG-DMR(−/+) females with male Gtl2 heterozygous mutants. The paternally inherited Gtl2 deletion led to a lowering of the expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1; consequently, the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutants showed normal expression levels of Dlk1 and Rtl1. The double mutants were normal at birth and demonstrated no skeletal defects, indicating that the perinatal abnormalities were rescued by the restoration of the Dlk1 and Rtl1 expression dosage. However, all of the double mutants showed growth retardation at the weaning stage, and 70% of them died within 3 weeks of birth. These findings indicate that the restoration of Dlk1 and Rtl1 expression was not sufficient to rescue the lethality of the IG-DMR(−/+) mutants. Gene expression analysis showed that the levels of maternally expressed ncRNA in the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutants did not return to those in the WT. Our previous study showed that the maternal Gtl2 deletion led to postnatal lethality due to hypoplastic pulmonary alveoli and hepatocellular necrosis, probably due to the decreased expression of small nucleolar RNAs and miRNAs derived from Rian and anti-Rtl1/Mirg (19Takahashi N. Okamoto A. Kobayashi R. Shirai M. Obata Y. Ogawa H. Sotomaru Y. Kono T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1879-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Histological abnormalities of the liver and lungs also were observed in the IG-DMR(−/+)/Gtl2(+/−) double mutants (two of three; data not shown). Thus, it is highly likely that the postnatal abnormalities observed in the double mutants were caused by the decrease in the expression levels of these ncRNAs. We measured the gene expression levels in five double mutant samples and observed that the expression dosage of Rian and Mirg varied largely among the samples. One sample showed normal expression levels of Rian and Mirg in the lungs, while another sample had expression levels two times the average of the other double-mutant samples in the brain. Four out of the 15 double mutant mice survived; therefore, it can be considered that the sample-specific recovery of gene expression might induce partial survivability of the double mutants. Our finding would be supported by recently published reports indicating that ncRNAs in the Dlk1-Dio3 domain have a great influence on the pluripotency level of induced pluripotent stem cells (22Liu L. Luo G.Z. Yang W. Zhao X. Zheng Q. Lv Z. Li W. Wu H.J. Wang L. Wang X.J. Zhou Q. J. Biol.

In conclusion, the present study suggests that the decrease in the ncRNA expression downstream of Gtl2 might be involved in postnatal development and lethality. Further studies are required to identify the ncRNAs involved in the lethality induced by altered imprinting pattern in the Dlk1-Dio3 domain and to understand rhe mechanism by which these ncRNAs exert their effects.

https://openalex.org/W2128138101,"Inference of the topology of gene regulatory networks from experimental data is one of the primary challenges of systems biology. In an example of a genetic network of cyclins in the yeast cell cycle, we analyzed static genome-wide location data together with microarray kinetic measurements using a recurrent neural network-based model of gene expression and a newly developed, unbiased algorithm based on evolutionary programming principles. The modeling and simulation of gene expression dynamics identified cyclin genetic networks that were active during the cell cycle. We document that because there is inherent experimental variation, it is not possible to identify a single genetic network, only a set of equivalent networks with the same probability of occurrence. Analysis of these networks showed that each target gene was controlled by only a few regulators and that the control was robust. These results led to the reformulation of the cyclin genetic network in the yeast cell cycle as previously published. The analysis shows that with the methodologies that are currently available, it is not possible to predict only one genetic network; rather, we must work with the hypothesis of multiple, equivalent networks. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip experiments are not sufficient to predict the functional networks that are active during an investigated process. Such predictions must be considered as only potential, and their actual realization during particular cellular processes must be identified by incorporating both kinetic and other types of data.—To, C.
