https://openalex.org/W1596051159,"Two monoclonal antibodies directed to the Type II carbohydrate chain of glycosphingolipids have been prepared by the murine hybridoma technique. Their reactivity was determined by liposome lysis, plate-binding assay, complement fixation, and hemagglutination inhibition. One antibody was specific for glycolipids having the nonreducing terminal N-acetyllactosamine (Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to R) structure and did not react with glycolipids having either a Type I chain (Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc beta 1 leads to R), a ganglio-series structure (Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to R), or a sialosyl or fucosyl substitution at the N-acetyllactosamine residue. This antibody readily agglutinated adult human erythrocytes of all ABO types but did not agglutinate umbilical cord cells. The other antibody reacted with the Type II chain H structure (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to R) but reacted only weakly with the Type I chain H (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc beta 1 leads to R) and ganglio-series H (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to R) structures. At 37 degrees C this antibody agglutinated human erythrocytes of types O and A2 but was unable to cause detectable agglutination of types B and A1. Because of their narrow, well defined specificity, these monoclonal anticarbohydrate reagents will be useful in the study of the distribution, quantity, and function of specific carbohydrates on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1581586115,"The kinetics of high affinity heparin binding to human antithrombin III has been studied by stopped flow fluorimetry, using the 40% antithrombin fluorescence enhancement resulting from this interaction. At mu 0.15, pH 7.4, and 25 degrees C, the observed pseudo-first order rate constant varies hyperbolically with heparin concentration with a limiting rate constant of 440 +/- 90 s-1, demonstrating that heparin binding is a two-step process involving a conformational change in antithrombin III. An identical dependence is produced when antithrombin is varied, consistent with a symmetrical mechanism in which heparin binding induces a conformational change in antithrombin rather than perturbing an equilibrium between two conformational states of the protein. The rate constant for dissociation of the antithrombin-heparin complex is 1.1-1.5 s-1 at mu 0.15, as determined from the ordinate intercept at low heparin concentrations or by dissociation of the antithrombin-heparin complex with iodide. Observation of a single pseudo-first order binding rates over a 400-fold heparin concentration range with no detectable lags is compatible with the initial binding step being in rapid equilibrium with a KD of 4.3 +/- 1.3 X 10(-5) M at mu 0.15. Variation in ionic strength primarily affects the KD for the initial binding step with little effect on the conformational change rate constants, implying that binding involves ionic interactions. Calculation of the overall dissociation equilibrium constant from these rate parameters agrees with the directly determined value of 7.2 +/- 1.9 X 10(-8) M at mu 0.15. A major function of the conformational change is, thus, to increase the affinity of heparin for antithrombin III greater than 300-fold. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of the heparin-catalyzed inhibition of coagulation proteases by antithrombin III are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585720781,"The Lewis blood group-specified N-acetylglucosaminide alpha 1 goes to 4 fucosyltransferase and an N-acetylglucosaminide alpha 1 goes to 3 fucosyltransferase have been copurified over 500,000-fold from human milk by affinity chromatography on GDP-hexanolamine agarose. The purified enzyme preparation migrates as two major bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent Mr = 53,000 and 51,000. Analysis of the acceptor substrate specificity of the transferase(s) and structural characterization of the reaction products indicate that the enzyme(s) forms the Fuc alpha 1 goes to 4GlcNAc, Fuc alpha 1 goes to 3GlcNAc, and Fuc alpha 1 goes to 3Glc linkages with oligosaccharide acceptors containing the nonreducing terminal sequences Gal beta 1 goes to 3GlcNAc, Gal beta 1 goes to 4GlcNAc, and Gal beta 1 goes to 4Glc, respectively. The two fucosyltransferase activities are activated to the same extent by a variety of divalent metal ions, inactivated at identical rates by thermal denaturation or reaction with N-ethylmaleimide, and inhibited to the same extent by rabbit antiserum prepared against the purified fucosyltransferase(s). In addition, kinetic analysis of the initial rate data obtained using acceptors for one of the fucosyltransferase activities as an inhibitor of the second suggests that acceptors for both fucosyltransferase activities bind at a single active site."
https://openalex.org/W1566514223,"A five-component enzyme system which catalyzes synthesis of acetylphosphate from methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) plus pyruvate has been purified from the homoacetate-fermenting bacterium, Clostridium thermoaceticum. One of the components was identified as the low potential electron carrier, ferredoxin, and the other 4 protein components have been designated F1, F2, F3, and F4. F1, F2, and F4 have been purified to homogeneity and, as estimated by gel filtration, have native molecular weights of 88,100, 58,900, and 255,000, respectively, while the subunit molecular weights obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are 20,000, 25,500, and 120,000, respectively. F3 contains 3 to 4 protein bands and has not been characterized with respect to molecular weights. Acetylphosphate synthesis by the purified system is optimal at pH 6.0 and 65 degrees C and requires ATP, CoA, and, to a lesser extent, thiamin pyrophosphate and Fe2+. S-Adenosylmethionine is not required. The F1 component has been identified as phosphotransacetylase and in its absence, the product is acetyl-CoA. Some properties of the phosphotransacetylase are presented. A scheme is given indicating present views of the functions of the individual components."
https://openalex.org/W1491447867,"NH2OH, the first intermediate in the oxidation of NH4+ to nitrite by the nitrifying bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea, was recovered as the oxime of cyclohexanone. 15N, 18O-tracer experiments using highly enriched 15NH4Cl and 18O2 yielded oxime that was correspondingly highly enriched (greater than or equal to 92 atom %) in these isotopes. These results show that the source of NH2OH is largely or entirely NH4+, as opposed to hydrazine, which was added to inhibit the further oxidation of NH2OH to nitrite, and that NH4+ yields NH2OH by way of a monooxygenase reaction involving direct insertion of O from O2. The oxidation of NH4+ and NH2OH must be functionally linked in N. europaea, inasmuch as the reducing equivalents required by the monooxygenase to reduce the second atom of O2 to water can arise only through the concomitant oxidation of NH2OH."
https://openalex.org/W1555778502,"Band 3 is the predominant membrane-spanning polypeptide and the mediator of anion transport in the human erythrocyte. In addition, it provides the sites of association for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and other cytoplasmic proteins with the membrane. The aldolase-binding activity of water-soluble fragments of band 3 was measured by their inhibition of aldolase catalytic activity and by their displacement of aldolase from ghosts. At saturation, the binding of one band 3 or certain of its fragments per aldolase molecule partially inhibited the catalytic activity and band 3 binding of the unliganded subunits of the tetramer through an apparently cooperative mechanism. An NH2-terminal 23,000-dalton fragment generated by S-cyanylation of the cytoplasmic pole of band 3 was approximately 20% as avid in binding aldolase as was native band 3. Several fragments cleaved from the NH2-terminal portion of the 23,000-dalton peptide by trypsin, mild acid hydrolysis, and cyanogen bromide digestion all bound aldolase, while fragments from the rest of the polypeptide were essentially inactive. The first 31 residues of band 3 contained 16 Asp plus Glu, no basic residues, and a blocked alpha-amino terminus. The highly acidic composition of this region is consistent with the strongly electrostatic character of the interaction between band 3 and aldolase, presumably at the strongly basic catalytic center of the enzyme. We conclude that the NH2-terminal region of band 3 bears the membrane-binding site for aldolase."

https://openalex.org/W1570821412,"The relationship between sodium transport and the intra- and extracellular pH was examined employing dog kidney epithelial cells (MDCK). Increases in the medium pH led to a stimulation of 22Na+ influx and an inhibition of efflux. Kinetic analysis of the pH effects showed that the apparent Km values for Na+ were substantially altered (28 mM at pH 9 versus 95 mM at pH 6), indicating that H+ and Na+ ions competed for the extracellular binding sites of the transport system. Addition to the medium of organic acids, such as acetate and isobutyrate, led to an enhancement of the initial rate of 22Na+ uptake into sodium-depleted cells and to an induction of dome formation by monolayer cultures. [14C]Dimethyloxazolidinedione (DMO) was used to estimate the pH gradient across the cell membrane. [14C] DMO uptake in the presence of the respiratory chain inhibitor, antimycin, was influenced by the extracellular pH as well as by the addition of sodium to the medium. Sodium and lithium, but not potassium, were capable of increasing the cellular [14C]DMO concentration by an amiloride-sensitive mechanism. These increases were largely unaltered when valinomycin and 3.5 mM K+ were present in the uptake buffer, a condition designed to diminish any Na+-induced changes in the membrane potential. The results are consistent with the existence of a Na+-H+ antiport system in MDCK cells. The significance of this system is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1501799230,"The cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was released from spectrin-depleted, acetic acid-stripped erythrocyte membrane vesicles by mild chymotryptic digestion. After purification by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, the fragment preparation was found to be greater than 90% pure on polyacrylamide disc gels in the presence of 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The subunit Mr from the electrophoretic procedure was estimated at approximately 40,000. The isolated cytoplasmic fragment ws judged to be a dimer, since (i) the unmodified fragment and its disulfide-cross-linked (dimeric) counterpart eluted in the same peak fraction from a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column, and (ii) the sedimentation velocity molecular weight of the native fragment was calculated to be approximately 95,000. No evidence of either larger or smaller aggregates was obtained. The frictional ratio of the fragment was measured at 1.6, suggesting a highly elongated morphology. The circular dichroism spectrum of the fragment corresponded to approximately 37% alpha helix. Titration of the cytoplasmic fragment over the physiological pH range gave rise to a reversible 2-fold increase in the intrinsic fluorescence quantum yield (lambda ex, 290 nm; lambda em, 335 nm) between pH 6 and 9. Computer analysis of the data yielded a temperature-dependent apparent pKa of 7.8 at 37 degrees C and 8.1 at 20 degrees C, both with Hill coefficients less than or equal to 1. Calorimetric experiments revealed a similar sensitivity to pH, where the denaturation temperature of the fragment titrated from 74 degrees C at pH 6 to 59 degrees C at pH 8.5, with an apparent pKa of 7.3 and a Hill coefficient less than 1. The enthalpies and widths at half-height of the transitions were also exquisitely sensitive to pH. The fluorescence and calorimetric data could all be described by the titration of a single ionizable group of apparent pKa of 7.8 at 37 degrees C and delta pKa/degrees C of -0.018. The ionization of this critical group is suggested to exert significant control over the structure/stability of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3."

https://openalex.org/W1504064118,"Crude rat liver microsomal preparations catalyze a reduced vitamin K- and oxygen-dependent carboxylation of peptide-bound glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxyglutamyl residues. The same preparations convert reduced vitamin K to its 2,3-epoxide. The stoichiometry of this relationship has been investigated. At saturating concentrations of CO2, equal amounts of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid are formed. As the CO2 concentration is lowered, this ratio shifts to a large excess of epoxide. Alterations in glutamyl substrate concentration or Mn2+ concentration cause equal alterations in both activities, while addition of KCN stimulated epoxidation and inhibited carboxylation. The release of 3H from a gamma-[3H]glutamyl substrate was tightly coupled to epoxide formation, and both of these activities were inhibited by glutathione peroxidase. These data are consistent with a reaction mechanism in which an oxygenated form of vitamin K activates the substrate glutamyl residue by hydrogen removal in a reaction that is coupled to vitamin K epoxide formation."
https://openalex.org/W1596208811,"We have recently purified a cyclic nucleotide-independent, heparin-sensitive nuclear protein kinase (NII) from Morris hepatoma 3924A and demonstrated an apparent relationship of this kinase to the two subunits (Mr = 42,000 and 24,600) of RNA polymerase I. When homogeneous protein kinase NII was recombined with purified homologous RNA polymerase I containing limiting quantities of endogenous kinase, RNA synthesis was stimulated as much as 5-fold during a 90-min incubation. The enhanced RNA synthesis was due to an increase in the average RNA chain length; protein kinase did not alter the number of RNA molecules synthesized by the polymerase. Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase occurred at serine and threonine moieties. Unlike the NII kinase, purified homologous NI kinase did not phosphorylate RNA polymerase I and, as a result, did not alter transcription. These data indicate that 1) RNA polymerase I is activated by protein kinase NII, 2) endogenous protein kinase NII remaining with highly purified RNA polymerase I does not fully phosphorylate RNA polymerase I in vitro, and 3) protein kinase NII is capable of regulating RNA polymerase I activity by preventing premature termination of RNA chains."
https://openalex.org/W1505863883,"The calcium concentration required to inhibit tubulin polymerization by 50% (Ca2+ sensitivity) extends from the micromolar to the millimolar range and is a function of a number of factors that include 1) a steep, inverse dependence on tubulin concentration: two-cycle tubulin has lower Ca2+ sensitivity than pure tubulin (prepared by a novel method described under Appendix); 2) temperature: Ca2+ sensitivity shows a steep increase below 24 degrees C; 3) microtubule seeds: these decrease sensitivity to Ca2+ inhibition; 4) the presence of 16 S oligomers or microtubule-associated proteins. Ca2+ increases the critical concentration for microtubule protein and decreases the initial rate of polymerization. All tubulin preparations examined contain small amounts of calmodulin. However, the molar ratio of calmodulin to tubulin is less than 0.01, hence this protein is not required for high Ca2+ sensitivity. Nevertheless, calmodulin at high molar ratios can increase the sensitivity of microtubule assembly toward Ca2+. We conclude that tubulin possesses high intrinsic as well as a calmodulin-mediated Ca2+ sensitivity, and propose that high Ca2+ sensitivity may be a property of the nucleation process."
https://openalex.org/W2150675804,"A new manganese-containing acid phosphatase has been isolated and crystallized from sweet potato tubers. The pure enzyme contains one atom of manganese per Mr = 110,000 polypeptide and shows phosphatase activity toward various phosphate substrates. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 5.8 and the enzyme activity was inhibited by Cu2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, AsO43-, and MoO42-. This stable metalloenzyme is red-violet in color with an intense absorption band at 515 nm (epsilon - 2460). Our electronic, circular dichroism, and electron spin resonance findings strongly indicate that the Mn-valence state of the native enzyme is trivalent. When the Mn-enzyme is excited by the 5145 A line of Ar+ laser, prominent Raman lines at 1230, 1298, 1508, and 1620 cm-1 were detected. This Raman spectrum can probably be interpreted in terms of internal vibration of a coordinated tyrosine phenolate anion. The tryptophan-modified enzyme showed a positive Raman band at 370 cm-1, which is preferentially assigned to a Mn(III)-S streching mode. The modification of the Mn-enzyme by N-bromosuccinimide led to a large decrease in the fluorescence intensity of 335 nm which was dominated by its tryptophan residues within a considerable hydrophobic environment. The acid phosphatase activity was significantly decreased by the tryptophan modification. With respect to the active site donor sets, the Mn(III)-containing acid phosphatase is distinctly different from the Zn(II)-containing alkaline phosphatase. Of interest is also the appreciable similarity of some enzymatic and spectroscopic properties between the present enzyme and uteroferrin."
https://openalex.org/W1589922196,"The technique of hydrophobic photolabeling with photoreactive lipids was used to study the topology of interaction of cholera toxin with liposomes containing galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetyl neuraminyl]-galactosyl glucosyl ceramide (GM1). The toxin appears to locate itself superficially on the lipid bilayer. The interaction is mediated only by the gamma beta 5 part. On reduction of the disulfide bridge joining the alpha and gamma subunits, the alpha subunit penetrates deeply into the lipid bilayer. The mere binding of cholera toxin to GM1 is not sufficient to allow the insertion of the enzymatically active alpha subunit in the membrane. Some processing, which may involve a modification of covalent bonds of the toxin molecule (such as that caused by reduction) appears to be necessary. The specific reduction of the alpha-gamma disulfide bond on the external surface of the membrane as a prerequisite for the membrane penetration of the alpha subunit is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1874129056,"A bromoperoxidase has been isolated and purified from the marine green algae, Penicillus capitatus. The purified enzyme is homogenous as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Bromoperoxidase can utilize bromide ions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a halogen acceptor for the catalytic formation of carbon-halogen bonds. Based on equilibrium ultracentrifugation results the molecular weight of bromoperoxidase is 97,600. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows a single band having the mobility of a 55,000 molecular weight species. We thus conclude that bromoperoxidase exists in solution as a dimeric species. The heme prosthetic group of bromoperoxidase is ferriprotoporphyrin IX. The spectral properties of the native and reduced enzyme and cyanide, azide, and carbonmonoxy-reduced derivatives are reported. Amino acid analyses indicate that bromoperoxidase is rich in aspartic and glutamic acid residues, while being deficient in basic amino acid residues. In terms of enzymic activity, comparative data places bromoperoxidase closer to horseradish peroxidase than to chloroperoxidase and catalase."
https://openalex.org/W1528679381,"The rate of appearance and extent of reconstituted adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) upon mixing cholate extract of rat liver 10,000 X g particulate preparation and S49 cyc- cell membranes was dependent on Mg ion concentration. Increasing concentrations of Mg ion lead to progressively shorter lag times in the appearance of reconstituted activity. In contrast, at 20 mM MgCl2, the rate of appearance of reconstituted activity was insensitive to concentrations of GMP-P(NH)P, cyc- membrane protein, and untreated cholate extract protein, but became sensitive to cholate extract protein concentration after treatment with GMP-P(NH)P and Mg ion. Treatment of cholate extract with GMP-P(NH)P and Mg ion resulted in a faster appearance of reconstituted activity upon exposure to S49 cyc- membranes as compared to treatment in the presence of GMP-P(NH)P and EDTA. Activation of the regulatory component by GMP-P(NH)P occurred only in the presence of Mg ion. Mn2+, Ca2+, or Ba2+ did not appear to substitute for Mg. The effect of Mg ion allowing for the rapid appearance of reconstituted activity was reversible in the presence or absence of S49 cyc- membranes. However, while dilution of GMP-P(NH)P in the absence of S49 cyc- membranes resulted in relatively rapid reversal, treatment of cholate extract with 5 microM GMP-P(NH)P and 20 mM Mg ion followed by reconstitution at 5 or 0.1 microM GMP-P(NH)P showed similar reconstituted activities for up to 15 min. The rate of activation of the regulatory component was faster at 20 mM Mg ion as compared to that at 1 mM Mg ion. Similarly, the rate of activation of the regulatory component by NaF was also accelerated by increasing the concentration of Mg ion. These data indicate that the rate-limiting step in the activation of adenylyl cyclase is conversion of the regulatory component from its inactive to active form. In the presence of saturating concentration of guanine nucleotides and NaF, both the rate and extent of this activation is regulated by Mg ion."
https://openalex.org/W1942335925,"Kininogen was isolated from human urine by batch adsorption with immobilized antibody to the immunologically identical heavy (H) chains of both high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) human plasma kininogens. All releasable kinin in the guanidinium chloride eluate was associated with kininogen antigen in gel filtration fractions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the eluate gave major stained and antigenic bands corresponding to the major form of plasma LMW kininogen. Also, the staining patterns and antigenic profiles obtained upon alkaline disc gel electrophoresis of the urinary and plasma LMW kininogens were strikingly similar. When antibody to H chain was used in an indirect immunofluorescence technique, cytoplasmic staining was observed in cells of distal tubules and c cortical and medullary collecting ducts of human kidneys. No fluorescence was observed using antibody to the unique light (L) chain of plasma HMW kininogen and no intact HMW kininogen was found in urine by radioimmunoassay. We conclude that the kidney is a source of urinary kininogen, while the L chain antigen in urine probably represents filtered degradation products of plasma HMW kininogen."

https://openalex.org/W1657072534,"Band 3 glycoprotein purified from human blood group A erythrocyte membranes was subjected to hydrazinolysis to release carbohydrate moieties. The neutral oligosaccharide fraction, which constituted more than 85% of the total carbohydrates released, was fractionated by gel chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-50 into two fractions, i.e. higher molecular weight and lower molecular weight fractions. From the lower molecular weight fraction, three oligosaccharides were obtained by chromatographies on columns of Bio-Gel P-4, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and lentil lectin-Sepharose. Their structures were investigated by a combination of compositional analyses, glycosidase treatments, methylation and Smith periodate degradation, and proposed to be: Gal beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 2Man alpha 1 - 6(GlcNAc beta 1 -4) (Gal beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 2Man alpha 1 - 3)Man beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 4(Fuc alpha 1 - 6)GlcNAc, Gal beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 2Man alpha 1 - 6(Gal beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 2Man alpha 1 - 3)Man beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 4(Fuc alpha 1 - 6)GlcNAc, and GlcNAc beta 1 - 2Man alpha 1 - 6(GlcNAc beta 1 - 4) (Glc NAc beta 1 - 2Man alpha 1-3) Man beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 4(+/-Fuc alpha 1 - 6)GlcNAc. It was also demonstrated in this study that most of the higher molecular weight oligosaccharides, whose peripheral structure had previously been reported (Tsuji, T., Irimura, T., and Osawa, T. (1980) Biochem. J. 187, 677-686), also contained the same core hexasaccharide structure, Man alpha 1 - 6(Man alpha 1-3)Man beta 1 - 4GlcNAc beta 1 - 4(Fuc alpha 1-6)GlcNAc, as that of the lower molecular weight oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1564443351,"In energy-depleted cells the formation of mannosylphosphoryldolichol is inhibited. Glucosyl-phosphoryldolichol, di-N-acetylchitobiosyl-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol and also GDP-mannose are still present, indicating that the formation of mannosyl-phosphoryl-dolichol and hence glycosylation of proteins via the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (Glc)3(Man)9(GlcNAc)2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol, are under metabolic control. In the energy-depleted cells the endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant, lipid-linked oligosaccharides (Man)x(GlcNAc)2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol (X = 1 to 5) are still formed. Despite the absence of mannosyl-phosphoryl-dolichol protein glycosylation is not blocked. The influenza virus hemagglutinin is glycosylated with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant, but not complex, oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides can be processed to protein-linked (Man)5(GlcNAc)2 and (Man)4(GlcNAc)2, and may represent glucosylated species. However, the rate at which the hemagglutinin leaves the rough endoplasmic reticulum and, probably therefore, the rate of oligosaccharide-processing are decreased in the energy-depleted cells. Both inhibition of formation of mannosyl-phosphoryl-dolichol and of intracellular migration are reserved when the energy status is brought back to normal levels."

https://openalex.org/W2142275679,"During ATP hydrolysis, myosin or subfragment 1 catalyzes the exchange of oxygens between water and phosphate, so that on average, each product Pi molecule contains more than one oxygen atom derived from water. Using quenched-flow techniques, the exchange process in both ATP and Pi was studied in the rabbit skeletal muscle subfragment 1 ATPase. The exchange in protein-bound ATP (M*.ATP) and protein-bound ADP.Pi (M**.ADP.Pi) was followed as a function of time. The pattern of exchange follows closely a model in which M*.ATP + H2O and M**.ADP.Pi are interconverted directly, without any characterizable intermediate between these species. All oxygen atoms of Pi are equivalent with respect to loss to solvent, and elimination of water to re-form ATP occurs with a rate constant of 15 s-1 (at pH 8.0, I 0.015 M, 20 degrees C). This is the first direct measurement of the rate constant for the transformation of M**.ADP.Pi to M*.ATP. Oxygen exchange during steady state ATP hydrolysis in the presence of acto-subfragment 1 also fits well to this model, with actin reducing the time available for M*.ATP and M**.ADP.Pi to undergo exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1576759875,"A new glycosphingolipid, provisionally named Lipid III in our previous work (Hori, T., Sugita, M., Kanbayashi, J., and Itasaka, O. (1977) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 81, 107-114), was extracted and purified from the spermatozoa of the fresh water bivalve, Hyriopsis schlegelii. The yield of the glycolipid was 1.8 mg/g dry weight of the spermatozoan preparation. Its chemical structure was characterized by compositional analysis, partial acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The following structure is proposed: 3-O-MeFuc alpha 1 leads to 2.3-O-MeXyl beta 1 leads to 4(3-O-MeGalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3)Fuc alpha 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3(Xyl beta 1 leads to 2)Man beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer. This glycolipid contains the same backbone as the pentaglycosyl ceramide (Lipid II) reported previously (Hori, T., Takeda, H., Sugita, M., and Itasaka, O. (1977) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 82, 1281-1285). Lipid III is structurally related to Lipid II by linking it with a fucose and three kinds of O-methyl sugars, namely, 3-O-methylxylose, 3-O-methylfucose, and 3-O-methyl-N-acetylgalactosamine, through an internal fucose moiety. Unlike most vertebrate glycolipids, Lipid III appears to be unique in having an internal fucose and O-methyl sugars as well as mannose. To our knowledge, this is the first instance for the natural occurrence of 3-O-mehylxylose. Aliphatic constituents of the lipid are palmitic acid and stearic acid as the principal fatty acids, and octadeca-4-sphingenine as the major long chain base."
https://openalex.org/W1595174870,"Two methods have been developed for the purification of equine platelet tropomyosin in amounts adequate for chemical and physical characterization. The first method, which avoids denaturing conditions, involves successive extractions with 0.10 M and 1.0 M NaCl buffer at pH 8.0, several isoelectric precipitations at pH 4.6, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. In the second method, tropomyosin is extracted at low pH, subjected to two isoelectric precipitations, a heating step to 85 degrees C, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. The yields in the two methods were 20% and 30%, respectively, with a final purity of greater than 95% in both cases. No significant differences were observed in the properties of the products prepared by the two methods. The amounts of actin and tropomyosin as a percentage of the total protein of platelets were estimated to be about 16% and 1.6%, respectively, values which correspond to an approximate molar ratio of actin to tropomyosin of 13-14:1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis yielded a subunit Mr of 28,500 for the platelet tropomyosin. Two subunit forms of the protein, designated alpha and beta, in a molar ratio of 1:2, were observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6 M urea, and evidence is presented for the presence of both alpha alpha and beta beta dimers. Circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, and paracrystal studies all indicate that, like muscle tropomyosin, the platelet protein exists as an asymmetric two-stranded coiled coil of alpha-helices."
https://openalex.org/W1523242896,"Erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase has been highly purified from five unrelated patients with a deficiency of this enzyme. Affinity chromatography using either GMP-Sepharose or an immunoadsorbent was the most productive step in the purifications. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was unchanged for patients L. P. and G. S., and slightly decreased for patient R. H., as compared to control subjects. Enzyme from patient I. V. and from patient E. S. exhibited markedly reduced specific activities when purified to near homogeneity. The level of immunoreactive protein in patient I. V. appeared to be significantly higher than normal. The apparent subunit molecular weight of the enzyme from patient G. S. was decreased by approximately 1000 while it was increased by approximately 400 from patient I. V. The isoelectric points of the subunit isozymes were shifted to higher pH values from patients I. V. and E. S., and to lower pH values from patient L. P.; the subunit isozymes from patient G. S. were identical with normal. These studies provide direct evidence for the existence of at least four different mutations in the structural gene for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The four different mutant forms of human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase that have been identified are named as follows: patient L. P., HPRTToronto; patient G. S., HPRTLondon; patient E. S., HPRTKinston; and patient I. V., HPRTMunich."
https://openalex.org/W1592392458,"The hydrolysis of phosphoric monoesters by acid phosphatases is thought to proceed via the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate, but no stereochemical evidence exists on this point. We have carried out the transphosphorylation from phenyl (R)-[16O, 17O, 18O] phosphate to (S)-propane-1,2-diol in the presence of homogeneous bovine liver acid phosphatase, and have found that the reaction proceeds with greater 90% overall retention of configuration at phosphorus. This stereochemical course of phospho transfer during the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of the phosphoric monoester is consistent with a double displacement mechanism in which each step proceeds with inversion of the stereochemistry at phosphorus, and is similar to the behavior of the bacterial alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1482221994,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) from rat liver cytosol is activated by micromolar concentrations of Mn2+ under conditions where GTP is present as the MgGTP complex and free Mg2+ is present in excess. The purified, homogeneous enzyme rapidly loses the ability to be activated by Mn2+ upon storage, incubation with oxidized glutathione, or incubation with Mn2+. These changes are prevented by reducing agents. Under certain conditions, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Mr = 72,000) co-purifies with a protein of Mr = 29,000. This complex co-elutes on gel permeation chromatography but can be separated by chromatography on GTP-agarose in the presence of Mn2+. The Mr = 29,000 protein stabilizes the activity of the enzyme and protects against the changes which lead to the loss of the Mn2+ activation. These results suggest that the Mn2+ activation of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is dependent on the degree of oxidation of cysteine sulfhydryls. The role of the Mr = 29,000 protein in in vitro experiments is to stabilize the enzyme oxidation state which permits activation by Mn2+."

https://openalex.org/W1625066205,"We have measured the binding of highly radioactive (2'-5')pppA4-5[32P]cytidine 3',5'-diphosphate to human, mouse, and rabbit cell and tissue extracts. A binding activity for this oligonucleotide is present in all extracts examined and high levels of this activity are found in some cells of lymphoid origin. In particular, the mouse thymoma cell line W7 has about 10 times higher binding activity than other cell lines. The oligonucleotide is bound with a single high affinity constant, as shown by Scatchard plot analyses. Cell extracts fractionated by centrifugation on glycerol gradients show a single peak of binding activity, which co-sediments with (2'-5')oligo(A)-dependent endoribonuclease (RNase L). This enzyme apparently binds the oligonucleotide, as shown by experiments with an analog of (2'-5')oligo(A) which competes in the binding and inhibits the RNase L. This endonuclease cannot be directly assayed in unfractionated cell or tissue extracts with high levels of other nuclease activities. The binding assay for the oligonucleotide may provide an estimate of RNase L levels in such cell and tissue extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1528878766,"NAD-specific pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase was earlier reported, on the basis of gel filtration experiments, to have a molecular weight of approximately 340,000. In the present study, the enzyme is shown by equilibrium ultracentrifugation to have a weight average molecular weight of approximately 224,000 which can be attributed to a rapidly associating-dissociating protein system. The results of light-scattering measurements are consistent with the lower value of molecular weight. The enzyme exhibits an average frictional ratio, f/f0, of 1.39 as determined from ultracentrifuge experiments, and this deviation from typical proteins may account for the previous high molecular weight estimates. An average Stokes radius of 6.0 nm was calculated from the present gel filtration experiments. By use of this value and a sedimentation coefficient of 9.1 S, an average molecular weight of 245,000 has been calculated. Previous studies (Ramachandran, N., and Colman, R. F. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8859-8864) have indicated that the enzyme is composed of three different subunits, present in the ratio 2:1:1, each of which has a molecular weight of about 40,000. These results, together with the present observations, lead to the conclusion that, under stabilizing conditions in solution, the NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase predominantly exhibits a minimum, molecular weight of 160,000 but behaves as a mixture of oligomeric species with an average Mr of about 224,000."
https://openalex.org/W1525107915,"Homogeneous rat liver carbamyl phosphate synthetase I is activated by ornithine and other amino acids. A strong correlation is observed between the ability of each amino acid to chelate heavy metal ions and to activate carbamyl phosphate synthetase I. The enzyme is also activated by the chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and o-phenanthroline. The thiols cysteine, dithiothreitol, and glutathione also activate the enzyme, apparently by chelating inhibitory metal ion(s). Experiments carried out under essentially metal ion-free conditions have established directly that micromolar concentrations Of Zn2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ inhibit carbamyl phosphate synthetase I. Previous in vivo studies have shown that carbamyl phosphate synthetase I is rapidly activated by the addition of ornithine. The present in vitro findings, as well as the previous in vivo findings, suggest a regulatory scheme for carbamyl phosphate synthetase I in which (a) the enzyme is inhibited by physiological levels of heavy metal ions and (b) this inhibition can be relieved by the addition of ornithine or other amino acids."

Since each Fe3+ heme carries one extra charge, it should be possible, in theory, to resolve the spectrum of intermediate compounds between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide, which was originally present in solution. In this study we report: 1) the development of a simple and rapid method to quench aqueous hemoglobin solutions into a hydro-organic solvent at subzero temperatures; 2) the determination of suitable experimental conditions to isolate valence hybrids between carbonmonoxy- and methemoglobin by isoelectric focusing at temperatures as low as -25 degrees C; and 3) the identification and isolation of all valence hybrids of different charge between carbonmonoxy- and methemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1490342289,"Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate: L-tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase (dimethylallyl tryptophan synthetase) has been purified from Claviceps strain SD58 to a homogeneous crystalline form. The enzyme is pure as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contains two similar subunits of 34,000 molecular weight as shown by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Since the enzyme was determined to have a molecular weight of 70,000 by gel exclusion chromatography, it is dimeric. The substrates dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and tryptophan each have mixed (negative to positive) cooperativity with a minimum Hill coefficient of 0.37 and 0.73, respectively. Calcium ion is a positive allosteric effector and, at 20 mM concentration, deregulates the enzyme. The deregulated enzyme has Km values of 7.2 microM for dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and 8.8 microM tryptophan. The Vmax under deregulated conditions is 953 nmol/min/mg, giving a turnover number of 14. Ca2+ has a S[0.5] of 4.5 mM. The kinetic mechanism is random sequential."
https://openalex.org/W1577774739,"Abstract Lipoprotein lipase released from the rat heart during a 30-s perfusion with heparin was compared to the lipase remaining in the heart tissue. The perfusate, containing the heparin-releasable enzyme, as well as the heart tissue extract (residue), was purified on heparin-Sepharose affinity columns. Both purified fractions showed pronounced inhibition by 1 M NaCl and by antiserum to heart lipoprotein lipase, thus displaying mainly lipoprotein lipase activities. However, their apparent Km values for triglyceride differed significantly (perfusate, 0.4 mM; residue, 4.0 mM). Also, the pattern of the immunotitration curves for the two fractions differed, the perfusate being more susceptible to antibody inhibition than the residue. Addition of heparin (0.5 unit/ml) inhibited the perfusate activity up to 60%, whereas the residual activity was actually stimulated by 15%. Based on these findings, we propose that the heart tissue contains a less active, low affinity enzyme form, possibly representing the precursor of the high affinity, functional, endothelial-bound lipoprotein lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1499804373,"A small quantity of 125I-labeled human asialotransferrin type 3 (2 to 4 microgram/100 g) was injected in intact rats and the distribution of the hepatic radioactivity analyzed by fractionation of liver homogenates on continuous sucrose density gradient. The ligand rapidly partitioned between plasma membrane and the interior of the cell at an approximate ratio of 1 to 4. The ratio remained constant between 3 min and 1 h. Intracellular 125I was encapsulated in a particle that was of a median equilibrium density of 1.11 (1.109 to 1.114) g/cm3 at 20 degrees C. The ligand recovered from the particles showed no sign of proteolytic digestion and was bound by the immobilized asialoglycoprotein-binding lectin from rabbit liver. The electron microscopic appearance of the subfractions containing of the entrapped ligand closely resembled that of an intermediate Golgi preparation. Various attempts were made to separate the ligand-containing particles from sialyltransferase and phosphodiesterase I activities, but complete separation could not be accomplished. 125I-Asialoorosomucoid studied in the same quantities and under the same conditions as asialotransferrin, yielded a subcellular distribution which was distinct from that of asialotransferrin type 3. Increasing the dose of asialotransferrin, to a level at which rapid catabolism of this asialoprotein occurs, profoundly changed the subcellular distribution of radioactivity. The subcellular distribution thus obtained was comparable with that found for asialoorosomucoid. These findings suggest that asialotransferrin type 3 is associated with different intracellular vehicles (different endosomes?) depending on whether the protein is simply diacytosed or is en route to lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1596619196,"Abstract Steady state velocities for the rate of exchange of extracellular dithionite for intracellular sulfate were measured in the presence of single and pairs of cis inhibitors. The purpose of these kinetic studies was to test the current two site model used to explain the nonhyperbolic transport kinetics characteristic of the erythrocyte anion exchange system. This model suggests the existence of a transport site and an external, pure noncompetitive inhibitory modifier site, both of which are thought to exist on each subunit of the band 3 protein dimer. Our results show negative cooperative transport curves when the velocity is plotted versus the external anion concentration at constant trans anion concentration. Reversible inhibition by SITS (4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate) caused the degree of negative cooperativity to change nonlinearly as a function of SITS concentration. This nonlinear dependence was such that SITS actually increased the calculated degree of negative cooperativity and then decreased it suggesting site-site interactions. Multiple inhibition studies confirm the existence of site-site interactions by showing that SITS and acetate are nonmutually exclusive inhibitors with negative interactions or mutually hindered inhibitor binding. These results are not consistent with the transport site-modifier site kinetic model in its original form since that model proposes only one pathway for transport with no effect of one inhibitor on the binding of the other. Possible kinetic models are discussed in an attempt to explain the present results and to relate them to what is currently known about the structure of band 3 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1576243683,"The amino acid sequences of 13 of the 14 cyanogen bromide peptides of horse muscle 3-phosphoglycerate kinase have been determined. These peptides together constitute 75% of the structure of the enzyme. Except for the smallest peptides, automated sequence analysis of the parent peptide was employed together with the automated or manual (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-Edman method) sequencing of relevant peptides obtained by proteolytic digestion. In the case of the five smallest peptides, all between 6 and 11 residues in length, sequences were derived from analyses of the intact peptides. CB14a, a peptide produced in low yield during the preparation of the cyanogen bromide fragments, was helpful in the sequence analysis of CB14. This peptide appeared to have arisen as the result of a cyanogen bromide cleavage on the carboxyl side of a tryptophanyl residue. The sequences of these 13 cyanogen bromide peptides, together with that of CB1, reported previously (Hardy, G. W., Darbre, A., and Merrett, M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10284-10292), have been combined with data obtained from the sequence analysis of tryptic peptides derived from the methionine-containing regions of the enzyme to determine the complete sequence. Isolation of these overlap peptides was facilitated by the labeling of methionyl residues with iodo[2-14C]acetic acid prior to tryptic digestion. Tryptophan-containing tryptic peptides were also isolated, and their sequence analysis enabled the positions of the four tryptophanyl residues to be established. In this way, the problem caused by tryptophan degradation during the preparation of the cyanogen bromide fragments was overcome. The NH2 terminus of CB1, the NH2-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide, was identified as N-acetyl serine by mass spectrometry. The alignment of the cyanogen bromide fragments of horse muscle 3-phosphoglycerate kinase described here is in complete agreement with that based on X-ray analysis of the enzyme reported previously (Banks, R. D., Blake, C. C. F., Evans, P. R., Haser, R., Rice, D. W., Hardy, G. W., Merrett, M., and Phillips, A. W. (1979) Nature 279, 773-777).

https://openalex.org/W1488805263,"The methylation of erythrocyte membrane components in sickle cell anemia has been studied and found to differ considerably from that of normal erythrocytes. When sickle erythrocytes were incubated under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4, 37 degrees C) in the presence of L-[methyl-3H]methionine or S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H] methionine, a 50% decrease in the protein-carboxyl methylation was observed compared to the normal erythrocyte. This reduction in degree of methylation was reflected in all of the major methylated protein bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since this methylation is catalyzed by the cytosolic protein methylase II (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-carboxyl O-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.24), the in vitro substrate capability of sickle erythrocyte ghosts and pH 11 treated ghosts were tested by incubation with purified protein methylase II and S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-14C]methionine. Both types of sickle cell ghost preparations showed the same 50% decrease in methylation as was seen in the intact cells. Since it was also shown that the protein methylase II and methyl acceptor membrane protein levels in the sickle erythrocytes are the same as the normal control, the data suggest that the observed reduced methylation may be due to an altered membrane conformation. The methylation of phospholipid was also studied and found to be decreased in sickle cell erythrocytes. However, this methylation was extremely minor in comparison to protein-carboxyl methylation which represents the bulk of the membrane methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1589515536,"The arginine esteropeptidase gamma subunit of the 7 S nerve growth factor complex contains six different molecular species which arise by post-translational modifications. An endopeptidase cleavage of the larger of the two peptide chains in two-chain gamma species produces the three-chain species and introduces a new COOH-terminal lysine residue. The charge heterogeneity of the various species arises from the removal, by a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme in the submaxillary gland, of this lysine residue and/or the original COOH-terminal arginine residue of the shorter Mr = 10,000 chain. These latter interconversions of the gamma species have been reproduced in vitro using carboxypeptidase B. The significant decrease in the proportion of two-chain gamma species in saliva compared to submaxillary gamma subunit suggests that the endopeptidase cleavage can occur during secretion of saliva; however, the subcellular localization of the enzyme has not been ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W1503914281,"Antisera were raised in rabbits against kringle 4, one of the five homologous domains of human plasminogen, and one which contains a site that binds lysine. A double antibody radioimmunoassay was developed for kringle 4 and used for cross-reactivity studies with plasminogen, kringle 1 + 2 + 3, kringle 5 + light chain, and the plasmin-antiplasmin complex, as competitors of either 125I-kringle 4 or 125I-Lys-plasminogen for binding to anti-kringle 4 antisera. Lys- and Glu-plasminogen caused 50% inhibition of anti-kringle 4 binding to 125I-kringle 4 at ratios of 4 and 20 mol/mol (competitor/kringle 4), respectively. The plasmin-antiplasmin complex behaved similarly to Glu-plasminogen. Kringle 1 + 2 + 3 inhibited at a ratio of about greater than 1000 mol/mol. Our results suggest that most of the surface antigenic sites of kringle 4 are exposed on Lys-plasminogen, Glu-plasminogen, and the plasmin-antiplasmin complex. There may be weak antigenic homology between kringle 4 and kringle 1 + 2 + 3, but there is little or no homology with kringle 5 + light chain and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2. Both 6-aminohexanoic acid and trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid can cause a maximum of 30% inhibition, with the latter being a much better inhibitor. Our results suggest that part of the antibody population is directed against a region of kringle 4 containing a lysine-binding site."

Activation by saturating ATP converted the velocity versus substrate plot to hyperbolic with a Michaelis constant of 1.2 mM and the same maximum velocity in either salt.

Using snake venom-treated microsomes to remove endogenous NADH-utilizing activities, we observed inhibition of overall demethylation at concentrations of NADH as low as 2.5 microM. At 20 microM NADH, overall demethylation had been reduced to 60% of optimal activity. In the presence of NADH, oxidative metabolism of [30,31-14C]4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol resulted in formation of an intermediate which was metabolized anaerobically to 14CO2 in the presence of NAD+. This intermediate and its acetylated derivative had coincident mobility on silicic acid thin layer chromatograms with 3 beta-hydroxy-[14C]4 beta-methyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-[14C] 4 alpha-carboxylic acid sterol and its acetylated derivative. The inhibition by NADH is transitory. Normal rates return after approximately 5 min if NADH/NAD+ = 0.2, and after approximately 15 min if NADH/NAD+ = 2. At an NADH/NAD+ ratio of 10, the return to normal rates is even slower, exceeding 30 min. Further, the inhibition, though transitory, occurs again upon introduction of additional NADH to the assay mix."
