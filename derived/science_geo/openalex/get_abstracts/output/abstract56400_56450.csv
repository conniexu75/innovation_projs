https://openalex.org/W1586487499,"Abstract This study characterizes microsomal heme oxygenase, a previously undescribed enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of heme at the α-methene bridge to form biliverdin. This step is then coupled with soluble NADPH-dependent biliverdin reductase to form bilirubin; microsomal heme oxygenase is rate-limiting in this pathway. By all analytical criteria, the product of this reaction is bilirubin. Most, if not all, of the bilirubin is of the IX α configuration, which is the sole isomeric form of bilirubin occurring physiologically. Heme oxygenase is localized specifically to the microsomal fraction, has an absolute and stoichiometric requirement for NADPH and molecular oxygen, generates carbon monoxide in amounts equimolar to bilirubin, and is inhibited by carbon monoxide. These and other data suggest that this enzyme is a mixed function oxygenase. The enzyme is most active with protohemin IX or methemalbumin; substrates with less activity are methemoglobin, the α and β chains of hemoglobin, deuterohemin IX, coprohemin I, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex, in this order. Oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, myoglobin, and free porphyrins are not acted upon by the enzyme. The apparent Km for protohemin IX is 5.0 µm, and for the other substrates ranges from 4.5 to 5.1 µm. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, lipase, phospholipase, trypsin, potassium cyanide, sodium azide, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibit the enzyme. The kinetics and tissue distribution of this enzyme suggest that it is of major importance in the physiological degradation of hemoglobin and other hemoproteins to bile pigment."

https://openalex.org/W1603947018,"Abstract The enzyme system in liver microsomes which catalyzes the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids in the presence of molecular oxygen and a reduced pyridine nucleotide has been solubilized and resolved into fractions containing cytochrome P-450, a cytochrome P-450 reductase, and a heat-stable factor. The apparent Km values of TPNH and DPNH are 2.0 x 10-5 m and 6.3 x 10-4 m, respectively. As a further indication of the role of cytochrome P-450, ω-hydroxylation is enhanced in microsomes prepared from animals previously treated with phenobarbital and is inhibited in the presence of carbon monoxide, with partial reversal of the inhibition by exposure to light. The soluble preparation of cytochrome P-450 exhibits a carbon monoxide difference spectrum, an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum, and substrate difference spectra similar to those previously attributed to the microsome-bound form. The difference spectrum obtained in the presence of laurate, with a peak at about 388 mµ and a trough at 419 mµ, is of the type given by hexobarbital rather than aniline. The Ks of laurate, determined from difference spectra, is 6.3 x 10-4 m, and the Km, determined in the complete hydroxylation system, is 4.4 x 10-5 m. The partially purified reductase was shown to catalyze electron transfer from TPNH to cytochrome P-450 under anaerobic conditions. The TPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity of the enzyme preparations was found to be unrelated to their ability to reduce cytochrome P-450, and therefore to function in the hydroxylation system. The activity of the heat-stable fraction is attributed to a lipid component which enhances the rate of the hydroxylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1535516014,"Abstract The ability of sulfite ions to form an adduct with the flavin prosthetic group has been examined for a large number of flavoproteins. Reaction was found with glucose oxidase (1), d- and l-amino acid oxidases, oxynitrilase, lactate oxidase, and glycollate oxidase. The dissociation constant of the reversible reaction was determined under a variety of conditions. With glycollate oxidase the stoichiometry was found to be 1 mole of sulfite reacting with each equivalent of enzyme-bound flavin. No reaction of sulfite was detected with the other flavoproteins studied, even at high concentrations of sulfite. The correlation is made that those enzymes which react readily with sulfite are those which react catalytically with oxygen as a hydrogen acceptor; no sulfite reaction was found with flavoprotein dehydrogenases. An attempt has been made to correlate various properties of flavoproteins, such as the type of flavin semiquinone they exhibit, evidence for charged groups in the vicinity of the flavin, their ability to react with sulfite, and their reactivity with oxygen and with one-electron acceptors. A possible scheme is developed which might account for the different pathways of oxygen reactivity exhibited by the flavoprotein oxidases, dehydrogenases, and hydroxylases."
https://openalex.org/W1590222530,"Abstract In the present study, ethanol oxidation by the perfused rat liver has been used to investigate the interrelationships between the pathways of glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and the citric acid cycle. In the absence of exogenous fatty acids, the production of glucose from alanine was stimulated 2-fold by 10 mm ethanol, whereas, in the presence of 1 mm oleate, ethanol caused an inhibition of net glucose production. Measurements of the rates of ethanol utilization and acetate formation showed that over 80% of the ethanol metabolized was converted to acetate. The increased rate of generation of reducing equivalents in the cytosol during ethanol oxidation increased the oxidation-reduction state of pyridine nucleotides in both the intra- and extramitochondrial compartments. This fact was established by analyses of the tissue content of pyridine nucleotides and substrate couple ratios, and directly by surface fluorometry. Changes of flavin and pyridine nucleotide fluorescence intensity from the surface of the liver showed that the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytosol to mitochondria during ethanol oxidation was very rapid. Analyses of intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway of livers perfused in the absence of fatty acids indicated an activational site at the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase step upon ethanol addition. The stimulatory effect of ethanol on gluconeogenesis from alanine, therefore, results from the increased availability of the NADH in the cytosol. On the other hand, when ethanol was added to livers perfused in the presence of oleate, an inhibitory site was observed between fructose-1, 6-di-P and fructose-6-P. Measurement of the tissue levels of the known modifiers of phosphofructokinase and fructose diphosphate phosphatase indicated that this effect was caused primarily by deinhibition of phosphofructokinase resulting from a fall of the citrate content. Oxidation of NADH produced during ethanol metabolism inhibited the activity of the citric acid cycle. Sites of inhibition were identified at the citrate synthase and iso-citrate dehydrogenase steps. The relative strengths of the inhibitory interactions at these sites were dependent on the rate of β oxidation. It is proposed that a coordinated inhibition of citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase is mediated primarily by the increased state of reduction of intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1522871639,"Abstract The effects of oleate (1.0 to 1.5 mm) were studied in livers from fasted rats perfused with alanine (5 to 10 mm), l(+)-lactate (8 to 12 mm), pyruvate (1.5 to 2.0 mm), or dihydroxyacetone (10 mm) as gluconeogenic precursors. Rates of glucose production in control livers perfused with alanine, lactate, or pyruvate were 60, 120, and 95 µmoles per 100 g, body weight, per hour, respectively. Oleate increased these rates to 132, 250, and 194 µmoles per 100 g, body weight, per hour with the three substrates. With lactate as substrate, glucose formation accounted for 60% and 78% of the lactate uptake in the absence and presence of oleate. With pyruvate as substrate, about half of the pyruvate taken up by the liver was converted to glucose, both in the presence and absence of oleate. With dihydroxyacetone as substrate, the rate of glucose production was 250 µmoles per 100 g, body weight, per hour, and was not increased further by oleate. This indicates that the rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis is prior to the formation of triose phosphates. Oleate increased the state of reduction of the pyridine nucleotide systems in both mitochondrial and cytosolic spaces as shown by increases in the ratios of lactate to pyruvate, β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, and malate to oxalacetate. Total tissue levels of the reduced forms of the pyridine nucleotides also increased after oleate administration. Measurements of metabolic intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway were made in order to identify sites of interaction in the enzyme sequence. The significance of these interactions was analyzed by the crossover theorem. Glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase appeared as a control site only with alanine as substrate. It is proposed that this reaction was stimulated by the elevated NADH:NAD+ ratio maintained in the cytosol during enhanced fatty acid oxidation. With lactate and pyruvate as substrates, control sites were observed at pyruvate carboxylase (activation) and phosphofructokinase (inhibition). These effects were interpreted as being caused by elevated levels of acetyl coenzyme A and citrate. The interaction between fructose-1,6-di-P and fructose-6-P is interpreted as indicating recycling of these intermediates, which is at least as rapid as the increased glucose flux observed after oleate addition. This results in a wasteful use of ATP, but probably represents no more than 10 to 20% of the oxygen consumption. Control of pyruvate carboxylation is considered to represent the most physiologically meaningful interaction between fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1492538071,"Abstract Neurospora crassa (5297a) NADPH-nitrate reductase (NADPH:nitrate oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.6.2), a soluble, sulfhydryl-containing protein with FAD, a cytochrome b designated cytochrome b557 (N. crassa), and molybdenum as prosthetic groups, has been purified 500-fold by procedures including pH adjustment, ammonium sulfate fractionation of the resultant supernatant solution, phase separation to remove nucleic acids, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and, finally, Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Other enzymatic activities associated with NADPH-nitrate reductase throughout the purification and maintaining a proportional relationship with it are NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, FADH2-nitrate reductase, and reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the most highly purified enzyme preparations yielded a major buffalo black-staining zone containing the above enzymatic activities, a somewhat smaller zone, and several faint zones. In unstained gels, a red zone, which was apparently due to the presence of cytochrome b557, was visible at the position corresponding to the major buffalo black-staining zone. By the use of sucrose density gradient centrifugation, a relative s20, w0.725 value of 8.0 for the nitrate reductase was found, and with Sephadex G-200 gel filtration techniques, a Stokes radius of 70 A was determined. From the relationship, mol wt = 6πeNas/(1 - vp), a molecular weight of 228,000 was calculated, assuming v = 0.725 cc per g. All enzymatic activities associated with nitrate reductase are heat-labile but to varying degrees, with the NADPH-nitrate and -cytochrome c reductases being most sensitive, and FADH2- and reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase activities being progressively less so, in that order. The reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase activity showed a marked increase in activity as the NADPH activities declined. The cytochrome b557 associated with nitrate reductase activity shows a typical cytochrome b type visible absorption spectrum at liquid nitrogen temperature and is a protoporphyrin IX heme as judged from the spectrum of its pyridine hemochromogen derivative. Studies with the inhibitor, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, reveal the presence of one or more readily accessible sulfhydryl groups functioning between NADPH and FAD. FADH2-nitrate reductase and reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase are considerably less sensitive to this —SH reagent. Inhibition by metal-binding agents has suggested the possible involvement of a second metal moiety (in addition to the molybdenum), functioning earlier in the electron transfer scheme. No negative feedback phenomena at the enzymatic level could be found with the variety of nitrogen compounds tested."
https://openalex.org/W1535127553,"Abstract Ferredoxin-triphosphopyridine nucleotide reductase (FTR) forms complexes with spinach ferredoxin, bacterial ferredoxin, rubredoxin, and flavodoxin. The protein-protein interactions are complete within 3 msec after mixing and the resulting complex contains 1 molecule of FTR and 1 molecule of electron carrier. Complex formation causes changes in the visible spectrum. The complexes are sensitive to ionic strength; they are completely dissociated at high ionic strength. The effect of ionic strength on a catalytic assay involving FTR and these electron carriers suggests that the complexes are important catalytically. The calculated values for ΔF', ΔH', and ΔS' and the sensitivity of the complexes to ionic strength suggest that the interactions are mainly hydrophilic in nature. TPN also causes perturbations in the visible spectrum of FTR. The changes are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those obtained with the protein electron carriers. Formation of the difference spectrum is affected by ionic strength, although the effect is less marked than in the protein-protein complexes. The initial changes, which occur rapidly, are followed by a slower first order decay to a second species."
https://openalex.org/W1491129049,Abstract Injection of Triton WR 1339 into strain A/HeJ mice caused a marked increase in the rate of sterol synthesis from acetate in liver slices and an increase of similar magnitude in the β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase activity of liver microsomes. The increases in sterol synthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity were prevented by puromycin and were variably inhibited by actinomycin D. The mice showed a cycle in the rate of sterol synthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity during the period from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. that was inversely correlated with changes in the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis. Treatment with puromycin prevented the cyclic increases in sterol biosynthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity. The procedure used to determine HMG-CoA reductase utilized gas chromatography to measure 14C-mevalonic acid produced from 314C-HMG-CoA. Some of the properties of the enzyme system are described.
https://openalex.org/W1538151656,"Abstract The N6,O2'-dibutyryl analogue of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) elevates the level of hepatic tyrosine-α-ketoglutarate transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) some 3- to 6-fold in intact and adrenalectomized rats. The response of this enzyme is more rapid to dibutyryl cyclic AMP than to any other inducer of the transaminase. Hourly injection of dibutyryl cyclic AMP can maintain the elevated transaminase level for at least 5 hours. The rate of synthesis of tyrosine transaminase, as measured by an isotopic-immunochemical procedure, is enhanced by treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. There is no detectable effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the synthesis of total soluble proteins, however. Combinations of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone produce additive or, in some cases, synergistic increases in transaminase activity, but the responses to combinations of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and either glucagon or insulin are not additive. Two other soluble liver enzymes, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase transphosphorylating, EC 4.1.1.32) and serine dehydrase (l-serine hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.13) are also elevated by treatment of intact rats with either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or glucagon, but another, tryptophan pyrrolase (l-tryptophan:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.1.12, tryptophan oxygenase), is not affected by either agent. Hydrocortisone induces both the transaminase and pyrrolase 3- to 5-fold but the steroid has no effect on either the carboxykinase or the dehydrase. The results support the view that cyclic AMP is the intracellular mediator of the action of glucagon on hepatic enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2162050937,"Abstract In fetal rat liver maintained in organ culture, the activity of tyrosine-α-ketoglutarate transaminase (L-tyrosine:2-oxo-glutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) is elevated by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and those hormones (glucagon, catecholamines) that stimulate formation of this nucleotide, as well as by hydrocortisone and insulin. Hydrocortisone is the most effective inducer, but the lag period for response to glucagon, isoproterenol, and cyclic AMP is somewhat shorter than with the steroid. The results obtained with combinations of the different inducers suggest that there may be three basic mechanisms for regulation of the transaminase: one stimulated by hydrocortisone, one by insulin, and one by cyclic AMP. The effect of cyclic AMP on the transaminase was found to be due to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis as determined by immunochemical isotopic analysis. Very low concentrations of either hydrocortisone or cyclic AMP markedly potentiated the effects of optimal concentrations of the other. Glucagon, isoproterenol, and cyclic AMP were found to stimulate the activity of another hepatic enzyme, soluble phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase transphosphorylating, EC 4.1.1.32), but not glucose 6-phosphatase (D-glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.9) within a 4-hour period. Hydrocortisone and insulin did not affect either of these enzymes; rather, insulin inhibited induction of the carboxykinase by glucagon, isoproterenol, or cyclic AMP. Both cycloheximide and actinomycin largely prevented the effects of all agents on both the transaminase and the carboxykinase. Possible sites of action of the different inducers are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1570602387,"Abstract Hen liver microsomes, when extracted with aqueous acetone, lose their ability to desaturate stearyl coenzyme A to oleate. The desaturase activity of these particles is partially restored by addition of lipid micelles prepared from microsomal lipid. Fractionation of the microsomal lipid yields fractions which are tested for their ability to restore the desaturase activity. A mixture of phospholipids, triglycerides, and fatty acids is able to restore the desaturase activity of the acetone-extracted microsomes to the level of the original microsomes. Phosphatidylcholine, isolated from the phospholipid, can partially replace phospholipids in this mixture. The properties of the reconstituted system are similar to those of the original microsomes. There is an absolute requirement for oxygen and a reduced pyridine nucleotide, although DPNH, rather than TPNH, is the preferred electron donor. The similarities between the lipid requirements of the DPNH-cytochrome c reductase and the stearyl-CoA desaturase support the suggestion that the two systems share a common electron transfer pathway or carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1594630507,"Abstract Peptostreptococcus elsdenii flavodoxin is completely reduced by 1 mole of sodium dithionite per mole of proteinbound flavin mononucleotide; 0.5 mole of dithionite generates almost maximum flavin semiquinone. The amount of semiquinone formed is dependent on pH. Semiquinone formation constants determined at pH 8.3 and 9.26, were 910 and 110, respectively. Fully reduced flavodoxin reacts rapidly with oxidized flavodoxin to form semiquinone. The rate of this reaction is pH-dependent and decreases from 105 m-1 min-1 at pH 6.7 to 1.6 x 104 m-1 min-1 at pH 9.26. The oxidation-reduction potential (E2) for the couple oxidized flavodoxin/flavodoxin semiquinone was determined by equilibrium experiments with indigo dyes. E2 was -0.115 volt at pH 7. The oxidation-reduction potential (E1) for the couple semiquinone/fully reduced flavodoxin was determined from the equilibrium concentration of these components after treating flavodoxin with hydrogen and hydrogenase. E1 was -0.373 volt at pH 7. A value for E1 was also obtained from the concentrations of fully reduced flavodoxin and flavodoxin semiquinone formed in equilibrium with excess TPNH in the presence of spinach ferredoxin-TPN reductase. By this method E1 was -0.371 volt at pH 7. The effect of pH on E1 suggests an ionization in fully reduced flavodoxin with a pK = 5.8. When reduced flavodoxin is mixed with air, the semiquinone is formed rapidly. Air oxidation of flavodoxin semiquinone is slow; the observed rate is markedly dependent on pH."
https://openalex.org/W1517073579,"Abstract The outer membranes have been separated from the inner membranes of rabbit heart mitochondria. The isolation of one unit from the other has been confirmed by assay of enzymes which have specific membranous locations and by electron microscopic examination. Fatty acid synthetic capacity and the products were studied in each of the subfractions. Two synthetic systems were present. A synthetic system de novo responsible for the complete synthesis of C14 to C18 fatty acids was contained in the inner membrane. The outer membrane possessed a chain elongation mechanism which added 1 or 2 acetate units to previously formed acyl compounds to make fatty acids 14 to 24 carbon atoms in chain length. The two systems differed in cofactor requirements and responsiveness to added NADH. It is suggested that the outer membrane synthetic system could function as an NADH shuttle by transferring cytoplasmic-reducing equivalents inside the mitochondrion as elongated fatty acids. The inner membrane system, which has a much larger capacity, could reoxidize intramitochondrial NADH in order to facilitate substrate level phosphorylation at times of respiratory chain inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1491391587,"Abstract A procedure is presented for the purification of l-tyrosine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase from the livers of rats previously treated with the synthetic glucocorticosteroid, triamcinolone (9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyprednisolone diacetate). A 2500-fold purification over crude liver extract was obtained. The final preparation, which appeared to be over 95% homogeneous by ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic criteria, has twice the specific activity of the most active fraction previously reported. The purified enzyme showed three enzymically active components when examined by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major component (approximately 95% of the total protein applied to the gel) migrated more rapidly than the two minor components which appeared to be aggregates of the principal component. The purified enzyme which sediments as a single boundary with an s020,w of 5.3 in the ultra-centrifuge has a molecular weight of 115,000 calculated from sedimentation equilibrium studies. The amino acid composition was determined. The enzyme binds approximately 4 moles of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per 115,000 g of protein but no cortisol binding was detected."

https://openalex.org/W2040705834,"PERIODIC phenomena are common in biology, and the nature of the oscillator which drives them is of great interest. Recently clear oscillations at the level of enzymatic reactions have been reported in the glycolytic system1–3. Damped oscillations have also been found in the horse-radish peroxidase systems which oxidize reduced pyridine nucleotide4,5 and indoleacetate or di-hydroxyfumarate6. The peroxidase system oscillated between ferriperoxidase and compound III (possibly ferriperoxidase–O2− complex) in the same oscillatory cycle of oxygen consumption. The conditions which gave stable oscillations were rather limited and the oscillation ceased after several cycles even when the reaction was started from an optimal condition. Acid pH favoured oscillation5."
https://openalex.org/W1482233886,"Abstract The conditions for stabilization of the enzyme uridine disphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase in crude extracts of Dictyostelium discoideum have been characterized. The dramatic increase in the activity of this enzyme during development, observed previously and confirmed here, is shown to be real and not due to differential instability in extracts from early and late developmental stages, as had been previously suggested by some workers. The enzyme appears to be pleomorphic with respect to sucrose density sedimentation. Two varieties, distinguished by this property and also differing with respect to stability, both increase 8- to 10-fold in activity during development. Such multiple forms may serve to regulate the flow of UDP-glucose into competing biosynthetic pathways during the developmental cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1570534073,"The nonenzymatic reduction of metmyoglobin and methemoglobin by NADH or NADPH in the presence of ethylene-diaminetetraacetate can occur at rates greater than most of those previously reported for enzymatic reduction. The reduction rate is considerably enhanced by the mediation of various flavins, including FAD, flavin mononucleotide, and riboflavin. The system is generally more active at pH 6.4 than at pH 7.4. The presence of Amytal is without effect. Coenzyme Q6 and menadione do not function as mediators of the reduction. Myoglobins from mammalian and fish sources behave similarly, but tuna metmyoglobin requires a mediator for reduction. Flavins, particularly flavin mononucleotide, in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate can catalyze the photooxidation of oxymyoglobin, as well as the photoreduction of metmyoglobin. However, the flavin-mediated reduction of metmyoglobin by NADH or NADPH just mentioned takes place equally well in the dark."
https://openalex.org/W1508926709,"Abstract The neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, and structurally related primary catecholamines inhibited rat hepatic tyrosine transaminase activity (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) in vitro. The inhibition was competitive with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor and an apparent Ki of 4.0 x 10-6 m was determined. (The apparent Km was 6.6 x 10-7 m.) Those amines which were associated with enzyme inhibition formed spectrophotometrically demonstrable complexes with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and full enzyme inhibition was achieved by the preliminary incubation of norepinephrine and cofactor alone. The relevance of this mechanism of regulation was examined in vivo. Increasing doses of norepinephrine suppressed and ultimately abolished the pyridoxine-induced rise of tyrosine transaminase activity in the fasted, adrenalectomized rat."
https://openalex.org/W1543463078,"Abstract The l-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD(P) oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.8), referred to as glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, was purified from extracts of Escherichia coli by a combination of chromatographic procedures. The over-all purification was approximately 1000-fold and the yield was about 10%. The elution profile from the final DEAE-Sephadex column and zone electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme preparation was not homogenous. Kinetic studies showed that the enzyme was both stabilized and inhibited by 0.1 to 1.0 m salts, and that l-glycerol 3-phosphate specifically inhibited dihydroxyacetone phosphate reduction. The curve describing the degree of inhibition as a function of l-glycerol 3-phosphate concentration was sigmoid, with 35 µm glycerol 3-phosphate producing 50% inhibition. Michaelis-Menten type kinetics were found with glycerol 3-phosphate, acting as a substrate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and TPNH. The calculated Km values were 210 µm, 170 µm, and 10 µm, respectively. Glycerol 3-phosphate was a competitive inhibitor with respect to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to TPNH. The addition of TPNH to the enzyme solution quenched the fluorescence of the protein at 340 mµ and enhanced the TPNH fluorescence at 450 mµ. Glycerol 3-phosphate further enhanced the fluorescence of the TPNH-enzyme complex in the 430 to 440 mµ region. The fluorimetric titration of the TPNH-enzyme complex with glycerol 3-phosphate gave a sigmoid curve with the same characteristics as the inhibition curve. The inhibition of the pyridine nucleotide-linked glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli, whose most likely function is to provide glycerol 3-phosphate for lipid syntheses, could act in the cell as an effective mechanism for the restriction of the pool size of glycerol phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1623926801,"Abstract A series of N-alkylmaleimides was shown to effectively inhibit d-amino acid oxidase at pH 7.0 and 7.5. Apparent second order rate constants for maleimide inactivation of the enzyme increased with increasing chain length of the alkyl substituents of the maleimide derivatives. It is suggested that this chain length effect is due to an enhanced binding of the longer chain compounds through nonpolar interactions with the enzyme. N-Phenylmaleimide and N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide were used to label d-amino acid oxidase. Product studies indicated that the maleimides were reacting only with cysteine residues of the enzyme. Peptide mapping was used to show that d-amino acid oxidase is composed of identical subunits having a molecular weight of 50,000. Product studies and spectrophotometric studies indicated that 3 moles of maleimide were bound per 50,000 g of protein. d-Amino acid oxidase was shown to be saturated with high concentrations of the N-alkylmaleimides, thus indicating the binding of the maleimides to the enzyme before the rate-limiting inactivation step. FAD and adenine derivatives were very effective in protecting the enzyme against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. Prior inactivation of the enzyme by N-ethylmaleimide prevented the binding of FAD to the enzyme. These results indicated that there is at least one reactive sulfhydryl group made less accessible by the binding of adenine derivatives at the FAD-binding site of d-amino acid oxidase."

The conversion of lycopene-15,15'-3H to β-carotene by spinach chloroplasts was maximal when incubations were performed under nitrogen in light at 25° in the presence of NADP. When soluble preparations of spinach chloroplasts were used, an absolute requirement for FAD and a partial requirement for NADP were observed. Proof of the conversion of lycopene-15,15'-3H to cyclic carotenes by plastids, and by soluble extracts of plastids of fruit of and tomato selections is also presented. Tritiated lycopene was converted to neo-β-, α-, β-, δ-, and γ-carotenes by hi-β tomato fruit plastids and to α-, β-, δ-, and γ-carotenes by a soluble preparation of these plastids. Both plastids and a soluble preparation of plastids of hi-δ tomato fruits converted tritiated lycopene to α-, β-, and δ-carotenes. Proof of the formation of the above cyclic carotenes from tritiated lycopene was obtained by chromatography with authentic carotenes on two different adsorbents. A close correspondence between radioactivity and optical density was observed for each carotene. Additional proof was obtained by crystallization of β-carotene to constant specific radioactivity and by gas-liquid chromatography of each hydrogenated carotene. Coincidence between mass and radioactivity of the hydrogenated carotenes was obtained. A mechanism is proposed for the formation of cyclic carotenes from lycopene."

https://openalex.org/W1553695298,"Abstract Submitochondrial particles prepared from rat liver mitochondria or Triton extracts of these particles incorporate 1-14C-acetyl coenzyme A into fatty acids in the presence of ATP and reduced pyridine nucleotides. Added acyl-CoA primers can substitute for ATP. NADPH is 25% as active as NADH, and its activity is not explicable on the basis of its conversion to NADH. It appears that NADPH may also be a direct reductant in the elongation reaction. It was shown that ATP supports acetyl-CoA incorporation by activating endogenous fatty acids via an acyl-CoA synthetasecatalyzed reaction. Gas-liquid chromatographic separation of the products and analysis of the amount of radioactivity present in the carboxyl carbon of the synthesized fatty acids were consistent with the operation of a chain elongation mechanism. The fatty acid products of the reaction were identified as CoA esters, 2 to 4 carbon atoms longer than the primer fatty acyl-CoA. The elongation reaction was found to occur in both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes as well as in the soluble fraction. The inner membrane and the soluble fraction were highly active with decanoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA but exhibited almost no activity with long chain acyl-CoAs. On the other hand, the specific activity of the outer membrane preparation with palmitoyl-CoA was three times higher than that found in the inner membrane. The elongation reaction was inhibited by oxidized nucleotides, CoA—SH, and acyl-CoAs. The incorporation of 2-14C-malonyl-CoA was considerably lower than that of acetyl-CoA and could be accounted for by the presence of a highly active malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in the preparations. Both the acyl-CoA deacylase and the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase appeared to be localized in the matrix fraction of rat liver mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1575743922,Abstract Isolation of d and l isomers of erythro-fluorocitric acid was accomplished by first separation of diastereomeric racemates as cyclohexylamine salts of diethyl fluorocitrate. This was followed by resolution of the erythro-diastereoisomer into optical isomers by fractional crystallization as (+)- and (-)-deoxyephedrine salts. Partial hydrolysis to the monoethyl ester of resolved fluorocitrate was achieved by guanidine carbonate and complete hydrolysis to the free acid in NaOH. Purification to the final stage of optically resolved free acids was carried out by fractionation as barium and cyclohexylamine salts. Only the l isomer inhibited aconitase activity of rat kidney mitochondria.
https://openalex.org/W1509762313,"Abstract Hexose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a microsomal enzyme form rat liver, has been shown to reduce NAD+ or NADP+ in the presence of galactose-6-P or glucose-6-P. The reaction product of hexose 6-phosphate and galactose-6-P, uniformly labeled with 14C was isolated by Dowex 1-chloride column chromatography. It readily formed lactone on boiling with 1 n HCl and was identified as 6-phosphogalactonic acid by paper chromatography. Incubation of liver fractions with 6-phosphogalactonic acid-1-14C resulted in formation of only minimal amounts of 14CO2, quantities that could readily have come from trace contaminants of 6-phosphogalactonic acid-1-14C. The product of glucose-6-P oxidation by hexose 6-phosphate and NAD+ provided substrate for the reduction of NADP+ in the presence of 6-phosphogluconic acid dehydrogenase, and was hence identified as 6-phosphogluconic acid. Incubation of uniformly labeled galactose-14C with rat liver supernatant fractions failed to disclose the formation of detectable quantities of galactonic acid. Thus, the existence of a galactose dehydrogenase in rat liver could not be confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W1598606332,"Abstract A soluble, cytoplasmic, macromolecular steroid-binding fraction has been identified and partially purified from hepatoma tissue-cultured cells, a line of rat hepatoma cells in which tyrosine aminotransferase is induced by adrenal steroid hormones. Adrenal corticosteroids, progresterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone form a strong association with the macromolecule which can be disrupted by heating the complex briefly at 65°. Treatment with proteolytic but not nucleolytic enzymes caused a slow release of the hormones, suggesting that the macromolecule is a protein. The binding substance was estimated to have an s20,w0 value of 2.6 by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The possible role of this component in cell function is discussed."

However, the continued induced synthesis of tyrosine transaminase, elicited by repeated doses of hydro-cortisone, is inhibited approximately 64 percent in the presence of the analog after 7 to 8 hours and appears to be almost completely inhibited by 9 to 10 hours; this suggests that the induction cycle involves the activation and renewal of a pool of preexisting messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2614802750,"Abstract The chloroplast flavoprotein has by amperometric titration four sulfhydryl groups and one disulfide per molecule. Inactivation by mercurials follows first order kinetics. From the order of this inactivation reaction with respect to mercurial, it is found that integrity of one sulfhydryl group is essential for catalytic activity. NADP affects the rate of inactivation of the flavoprotein by mercurials. This substrate protects against inactivation by polar mercurials, whereas it accelerates the inhibition by nonpolar ones. Reactivation studies show that the enzyme inactivated by mercurials, although completely fluorescent, partially recovers its catalytic activity upon removal of inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1571771496,"Abstract Guinea pig liver has previously been reported to contain a highly specific NADP-linked xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.10) and NAD-linked xylitol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.9) of broad substrate specificity. The NADP-linked enzyme, which interconverts xylitol and L-xylulose, has been obtained from mitochondria, while NAD-linked xylitol dehydrogenases, which interconvert xylitol and D-xylulose, have been obtained from both mitochondria and cytosol. This report describes a fourth xylitol dehydrogenase activity, which occurs in the cytosol of guinea pig liver. This enzyme is similar to the mitochondrial NADP-linked xylitol dehydrogenase in its coenzyme requirement, substrate specificity, and Km for xylitol, and its activity is much higher than that of the mitochondrial enzyme. The two soluble xylitol dehydrogenases were separated from each other on the basis of differential adsorption on alumina Cγ gel. The occurrence of high activities of these enzymes in the cytosol allows the required conversion of L-xylulose to D-xylulose via xylitol in the glucoronate-xylulose pathway without involvement of the mitochondria. Questions regarding the origin and role of the mitochondrial xylitol dehydrogenases are discussed."

These fractions are free of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Both proteins are required, and no partial reaction has been observed under various conditions in the presence of either protein fraction alone. A mutant of S. typhimurium which cannot synthesize CDP-abequose was found to be missing E1. Some preliminary observations regarding the mechanism of the reaction are described and have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1483855607,"Abstract The induction and subsequent inactivation of hepatic tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) have been studied in the isolated perfused rat liver. This study was undertaken to confirm that the inhibition in vivo by 8-azaguanine and cycloheximide of tyrosine transaminase inactivation results from a direct action of these inhibitors on the liver. When hydrocortisone was administered at the start of perfusion, the maximal activity of tyrosine transaminase attained was approximately 50% of that normally observed after induction in vivo. Furthermore, the return of the activity to the basal level occurred 3 to 4 hours sooner than it did in vivo. This limited response appears to be attributable to the lower protein-synthetic capacity of the perfused liver, as witnessed by a gradual conversion of a portion of the polyribosomes in the postmitochondrial supernatant of the liver to monomers and dimers during the course of perfusion. The effect of the inhibitors was studied with this system after the induction of tyrosine transaminase by hydrocortisone had been allowed to proceed for 4 hours in vivo. 8-Azaguanine or cycloheximide given at the start of perfusion prevented the normal fall in enzyme activity from the steroid-induced to the basal level. No such inhibition was observed when 8-azaxanthine, pyridoxal, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, α-ketoglutarate, glucagon, or insulin was added to the perfusate. The data show conclusively that the prevention of tyrosine transaminase inactivation results from a direct action of 8-azaguanine and cycloheximide on the liver, and confirm that this phenomenon depends upon an inhibition of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1571642674,"Abstract Evidence is presented for the concerted inhibition of a TPN+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from Crithidia fasciculata by two biosynthetic intermediates, oxalacetate and glyoxylate. This inhibition is competitive with substrate, and the presence of either inhibitory compound greatly increases the affinity of the enzyme for the second. This inhibition has been shown not to be due to the formation of oxalomalate, the nonenzymatic condensation product. Structural analogues of the substrate are not inhibitory, so that steric configurational analogy is apparently not the mechanism of inhibition. In view of this, it is believed that an alteration in the protein must be induced by the combination of the two inhibitors, as has been demonstrated previously with this enzyme for ATP. This work confirms the allosteric nature of the ATP inhibition and substantiates the requirement for 2 moles of ATP per mole of enzyme. Since isocitrate can either enter the glyoxylate cycle or be metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, it is believed that the inhibition of this enzyme by oxalacetate and glyoxylate has biological significance."

https://openalex.org/W1491166557,"Abstract A soluble TPN+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase has been isolated from Crithidia fasciculata. Although this enzyme obeys classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, it has been shown to be inhibited by nucleoside triphosphates. A kinetic study, with ATP as a model inhibitor, indicated that the nucleotide acted at a locus separate from the catalytic site of the enzyme. Both the purine or pyrimidine and a β and γ-phosphate group were required for inhibition of the enzyme, since nucleoside mono- and diphosphates were not inhibitory. The nucleotides did not compete with either isocitrate or TPN+ for the active site; the effect of the nucleotide was upon the Vmax for both substrate and coenzyme rather than on their apparent Km. Two molecules of ATP appeared to be required for inhibition. The inhibition was found to be of a cumulative type when all four trinucleotides were used. Studies on the changes in entropy and free energy of the reaction, although not conclusive, indicated that the protein was probably capable of undergoing a physical change during combination with the nucleotide inhibitor. It is suggested that allosteric modification of enzymes which do not exhibit sigmoid rate-substrate relationships may be a more general phenomenon than is realized."

The 17β-estradiol-activated transhydrogenase of human placenta has been shown to be free from 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase activity by a direct assay procedure which utilizes 17β-estradiol-6,7-3H-17α-2H. Rechromatography of the 17β-estradiol-activated transhydrogenase did not cause generation of dehydrogenase activity. Its activation does not involve oxidation-reduction at C-17 of 17β-estradiol. The 17β-estradiol-activated transhydrogenase is stimulated by 17β-estradiol-17α-2H without loss of 2H and by diethylstilbestrol, but not by estrone or by 17αmethylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol. The transhydrogenase function of 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase involves a cyclic oxidation-reduction of the C-17 alcohol, as shown by formation of estrone and loss of 2H from 17β-estradiol-17α2H. It is stimulated by 17β-estradiol and by estrone but neither by diethylstilbestrol nor by 17α-methylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol."
https://openalex.org/W1541143525,"Abstract A new anthranilic acid hydroxylase which catalyzes the conversion of anthranilic acid to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, has been partially purified from crude extracts of the mycelial felts of Aspergillus niger, grown in the presence of anthranilic acid. Neither 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid nor salicylic acid is an intermediate in this conversion. The enzyme is stabilized by glutathione and requires substrate amounts of NADPH. The optimum pH for anthranilic acid hydroxylase activity is around 8.2. The Km values for anthranilic acid and NADPH at pH 8.2 and 30° are 0.15 and 0.16 mm, respectively. The partially purified enzyme is highly specific for anthranilic acid and does not act on related substances such as 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, salicylic acid, m-hydroxybenzoic acid, methylanthranilic acid, and ethylanthranilic acid. Cupric, mercuric, and cadmium ions have a pronounced inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. Metal-chelating agents like o-phenanthroline, α,α'-dipyridyl, salicylaldoxime, and diethyl dithiocarbamate also inhibit the reaction. Sulfhydryl reagents such as p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide irreversibly inhibit anthranilic acid hydroxylase activity. Crude extracts of the mycelium have the ability to hydroxylate anthranilic acid to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid in addition to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. This activity, however, is lost on purification."
https://openalex.org/W1587573371,"In spinach chloroplasts which have been shaken with n-heptane, photophosphorylation coupled to the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is inhibited about 95% while the photoreduction of NADP+ (and ferricyanide) is stimulated as much as 50%. Photophosphorylation catalyzed by phenazine methosulfate, however, is inhibited only 50%. These data are interpreted to indicate that there are two sites of photophosphorylation in spinach chloroplasts. Both sites are utilized in cyclic photophosphorylation, whereas one of the sites is common to both cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation. In heptane-treated chloroplasts the only site functioning is that site associated exclusively with cyclic electron flow. Heptane treatment also has a differential effect upon the adenosine triphosphatase activities of chloroplasts. Trypsin-activated Ca++-dependent ATPase is not affected by heptane treatment, whereas Mg++-dependent ATPase activated by light in the presence of dithiothreitol is inhibited 80 to 90%. After heptane treatment, the ability of chloroplasts to accumulate protons upon illumination is inhibited 40 to 60% and their ability to synthesize ATP when transferred from acidic to alkaline environment is inhibited 50%."
https://openalex.org/W2155250437,"Abstract Inactivation of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase by the anionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate, occurs by two different mechanisms, depending upon detergent concentrations: (a) uncompetitive inhibition and (b) denaturation. Uncompetitive inhibition kinetic data with sodium dodecyl sulfate (0 to 0.1 mm) indicate detergent combination with enzyme-NADP+-glutamate complex. Use of a structural analogue of glutamate indicated that sodium dodecyl sulfate did not interfere with binding of substrate to free enzyme. Dialysis of 0.1 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated solutions of enzyme, enzyme-NADP+ complex, and enzyme-glutamate complex completely reversed inhibition, whereas dialysis of enzyme-NADP+-glutamate-detergent complex did not restore activity. A modified Hill plot of enzyme Vm values versus detergent concentrations showed that cooperativity is involved in uncompetitive inhibition by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Denaturation of glutamate dehydrogenase occurs upon treatment with higher concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate, as evidenced by loss of protein fluorescence, loss of enzyme binding capacity for NADH and NADPH, and protein dissociation. Surface active or micellar properties of sodium dodecyl sulfate may be involved in denaturation, since surface tension measurements may have indicated mixed protein-detergent micelle formation at 0.12 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate."

Hydranths then regress and are absorbed, and their cellular materials are utilized by the colony for continued growth. Hydranth life spans can be extended to 20 days in isolated hydranths if, repeatedly, the pedicel is damaged by pinching and is allowed to partially regen-erate. This suggests that tissue damage and reorganization function to maintain the hydranth."
