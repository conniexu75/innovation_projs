Most carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the burning of fossil fuels will eventually be absorbed by the ocean1, with potentially adverse consequences for marine biota2,3,4. Here we quantify the changes in ocean pH that may result from this continued release of CO2 and compare these with pH changes estimated from geological and historical records. We find that oceanic absorption of CO2 from fossil fuels may result in larger pH changes over the next several centuries than any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 million years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as bolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing."
https://openalex.org/W2081007547,"The recent discovery that a spin-polarized electrical current can apply a large torque to a ferromagnet, through direct transfer of spin angular momentum, offers the possibility of manipulating magnetic-device elements without applying cumbersome magnetic fields. However, a central question remains unresolved: what type of magnetic motions can be generated by this torque? Theory predicts that spin transfer may be able to drive a nanomagnet into types of oscillatory magnetic modes not attainable with magnetic fields alone, but existing measurement techniques have provided only indirect evidence for dynamical states. The nature of the possible motions has not been determined. Here we demonstrate a technique that allows direct electrical measurements of microwave-frequency dynamics in individual nanomagnets, propelled by a d.c. spin-polarized current. We show that spin transfer can produce several different types of magnetic excitation. Although there is no mechanical motion, a simple magnetic-multilayer structure acts like a nanoscale motor; it converts energy from a d.c. electrical current into high-frequency magnetic rotations that might be applied in new devices including microwave sources and resonators."

Here, we show that these aggregates are composed of small Sup35 prion polymers and associated proteins. In contrast to other protein complexes of yeast lysates, but similarly to amyloid fibers, these polymers are insoluble in SDS at room temperature. The polymers on average are about 30-fold smaller than the aggregates and comprise from 8 to 50 Sup35 monomers. The size of polymers is characteristic of a given [PSI+] variant and differs between the variants. Blocked expression of Hsp104 chaperone causes gradual increase in the size of prion polymers, while inactivation of Hsp104 by guanidine HCl completely stops their fragmentation, which shows indispensability of Hsp104 for this process.

Some proteins can change their fold from normal to a specific alternative form, called prion, which is able to catalyze this change (1.Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). In man and animals such process causes prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and scrapie of sheep. A similar autocatalytic mechanism is shared by human amyloid diseases, which are noninfectious, in contrast to prion diseases (2.Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). In yeast, there are several proteins, which can undergo prion-like structural conversion. The most studied of them are translation termination factor eRF3, also called Sup35, and Ure2 involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism (3.Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The prion state of these proteins can propagate stably for many cellular generations. This may be observed by characteristic phenotypes, [PSI+] and [URE3], since these proteins in their prion form are aggregated and functionally inactive. In particular, the prion state of Sup35 results in low levels of soluble functional Sup35 and impaired translation termination, which is manifested as a nonsense-suppressor [PSI+] determinant. Similarly to mammalian prions, different variants or “strains” of [PSI+] were observed, apparently related to variations in prion structure. “Strong” [PSI+] variant exhibited strong suppression and high mitotic stability, while “weak” [PSI+] showed weak suppression and low stability. The efficiency of the suppression correlated inversely with the levels of soluble Sup35 (4.Zhou P. Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Patino M.M. Lindquist S. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5.Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Valouev I.A. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 2001; 18: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The prion aggregates formed by prionogenic proteins in vivo represent large complexes, whose structure is not well characterized. In vitro, purified Sup35 and Ure2 formed fibers of uniform structure, which shared the key properties of amyloid fibers (6.Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 811-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 7.King C.Y. Tittmann P. Gross H. Gebert R. Aebi M. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6618-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This allowed proposing that the prion aggregates in vivo are composed of similar structures (called, hereafter, prion polymers). It is not clear whether the aggregates represent single prion polymers or their higher order complexes. The electron microscopy of [URE3] cells revealed networks of small fibers coinciding in location with the Ure2 molecules (8.Speransky V.V. Taylor K.L. Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which indicates in favor of the latter opportunity. The [PSI+] propagation may be affected by the chaperones of Hsp70 and Hsp40 families, but the most significant role is played by Hsp104, which is the only chaperone strictly required for [PSI+] and other prions. The overexpression of Hsp104, however, caused frequent [PSI+] loss or antisuppressor effect when [PSI+] was not lost (9.Chernoff Y.O. Lindquist S.L. Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Hsp104 was shown to break large aggregates of denatured protein into smaller pieces (10.Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 11.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). We proposed that Hsp104 acts similarly on fiber-shaped prion polymers, thus fragmenting them into shorter polymers and increasing their number (12.Kushnirov V.V. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This is essential for their inheritance and accelerates the prion conversion by multiplying the ends of prion polymers, where the conversion occurs. The overproduction of Hsp104 should cause excessive fragmentation, increased levels of soluble Sup35, and possibly [PSI+] loss. An alternative model proposed that Hsp104 is primarily required to facilitate the prion conversion in one or another way (13.Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 14.Serio T.R. Lindquist S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 98-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These two models may be distinguished, since they make different predictions for alteration of the size of prion particles upon inhibition of the Hsp104 function. By the former model, the size should increase due to blocked fragmentation, while by the latter it should stay constant or decrease due to block of polymerization. Recent studies provided some support for the “fragmentation” model. Decrease of the Hsp104 expression caused increase in the size of Sup35 prion aggregates, suggesting decreased disaggregation by Hsp104 (15.Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The activity of Hsp104 is inhibited by growing yeast cells in the presence of 3-5 mm guanidine HCl (GuHCl) 1The abbreviations used are: GuHClguanidine HClGFPgreen fluorescent proteinSDD-AGEsemi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis. (16.Ferreira P.C. Ness F. Edwards S.R. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Such treatment cures efficiently [PSI+] (17.Tuite M.F. Mundy C.R. Cox B.S. Genetics. 1981; 98: 691-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other known yeast prions. Study of the kinetics of [PSI+] loss in the presence of GuHCl allowed concluding that it blocks replication of prion “seeds” (18.Eaglestone S.S. Ruddock L.W. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19.Jung G. Masison D.C. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, Hsp104 inhibition correlates with the block of fragmentation (replication) of prion particles (seeds). However, in these experiments the relation of the studied prion entities to the Sup35 polymers considered by the above models was not characterized. The prion seeds were defined genetically, but their physical nature was not studied. In the work (15.Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) the size of prion aggregates was estimated by fluorescence of Sup35-GFP fusions or immunofluorescent staining. However, this approach insufficiently characterizes the role of Hsp104, since (i) the fluorescence reveals only the largest aggregates, not all of them; (ii) it is unclear whether the observed fluorescent foci represent single prion particles or their higher order complexes; and (iii) the lack of quantitative estimates does not allow to conclude whether Hsp104 is critical for the fragmentation or just moderately modulates it. guanidine HCl green fluorescent protein semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis. To study the structure of prion aggregates and characterize the role of Hsp104, we developed here a novel approach for purification of prion particles and determination of their size. Using it, we showed that the Sup35 prion aggregates observed in vivo represent complexes of relatively small prion polymers with amyloid-like properties. The size of these polymers varied significantly between different [PSI+] variants. It depended greatly on the activity of Hsp104 in a manner that strongly supports the idea that Hsp104 mediates fragmentation of Sup35 prion polymers. Strains and Genetic Methods—The following yeast strains were used: 5V-H19 (MATa ade2-1 SUQ5 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 can1-100 [psi-]), PS-5V-H19 (obtained from 5V-H19 by replacing SUP35 for the chimerical SUP35-PS allele encoding amino acids 1-186 of Sup35 of the yeast Pichia methanolica instead of amino acids 1-123 of Sup35 of S. cerevisiae (20.Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and their derivatives carrying independently isolated [PSI+] (5V-H19) and [PSI+PS] (PS-5V-H19) variants. The variants [PSI+1] (21.Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), [PSI+PS-1] and [PSI+PS-2] (20.Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were described earlier, and others were obtained in this work. The strong [PSI+1] variant was mainly studied unless otherwise indicated.Yeast were grown at 30 °Cin rich (YPD, 10 g yeast, 20 g peptone, 20 g glucose per 1 liter) or synthetic (SC, 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base, 20 g glucose supplemented with the required amino acids) media (22.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 177-179Google Scholar). 3 mm GuHCl or 5 μg/ml doxycycline was added where indicated. Plasmids—To obtain a repressible HSP104 gene, plasmid pCM188 was used that contains tetracycline-repressible TET promoter (23.Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The ARS1-CEN4 block of pCM188 was deleted by EheI and BstXI sites, to produce pCM188i. The BsaAI-HindIII fragment containing the 5′-half of the HSP104 ORF was cloned into the HpaI and HindIII sites of pCM188i. For genomic integration into 5V-H19, this plasmid was cut by unique BglII site. The integration resulted in the complete HSP104 gene under the control of TET promoter and a non-functional 5′ part of HSP104 and the strain T104-5V-H19. The overexpression of Hsp104 was achieved by transforming yeast cells with the pFL44L-HSP104 plasmid (24.Chacinska A. Boguta M. Krzewska J. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7220-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Preparation and Analysis of Yeast Cell Lysates—Yeast cultures were grown in liquid media to an OD600 of 1.5. The cells were harvested, washed in water, and lysed by glass beads in a buffer A: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. To prevent proteolytic degradation, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. To equalize the amount of protein in the electrophoretic samples, the protein concentration was determined according to Ref. 25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar. To determine the size distribution of Sup35, the cell lysates were fractionated by centrifugation through 15-40% sucrose gradient in the SW-41 rotor (Beckman) for 15 min at 35,000 rpm (170,000 × g). To check that glass beads lysis does not impair prion polymers, 5V-H19 [PSI+] cells were treated with zymolyase to remove cell walls. The obtained spheroplasts were lysed either by adding SDS to 1% or by vortexing with glass beads with standard intensity and duration. The experiment was also performed for the cells, in which the size of prion polymers was increased 4-fold by growth in the presence of 3 mm GuHCl for two generations. In both cases, the size of prion polymers did not depend on the lysis method (data not shown). Electrophoresis—Protein electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Ref. 26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, except that where indicated, boiling of the samples was avoided, and agarose was used for the concentrating gel. For separation of prion particles we used horizontal 1.8% agarose gels in the Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.16-B.23Google Scholar) with 0.1% SDS. Samples were incubated in the sample buffer (0.5× Tris-acetate-EDTA, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 37 °C. After the electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from gels to Immobilon-P PVDF sheets (Millipore) by vacuum blotting overnight or electrophoretically. Bound antibody was detected using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. Determination of the Nonsense Read-through—The UAA nonsense read-through levels were determined as a ratio of β-galactosidase activity in cells transformed with pUKC817 plasmid to that in cells with pUKC815 as described previously (28.Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Tuite M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Calculations—The masses of Sup35-containing complexes in the sedimentation experiment (Fig. 3A) were calculated relatively to the material in fraction 2 by assuming that the mass is proportional to the sedimentation distance to the power of 3/2 (29.Laue T.M. Rhodes D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 566-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The average masses were calculated as Σ(Mn × Pn), where Mn is a relative mass of the fraction n, and Pn is a proportion of Sup35 in this fraction relatively to the total amount of Sup35. The molecular mass of prion polymers was calculated from their mobility in agarose gels assuming a linear dependence of the logarithm of mass and the migration distance: lgMX = aSX + b, where MX is mass, SX is migration distance, and a and b are constants (29.Laue T.M. Rhodes D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 566-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The same equations are true for titin and nebulin, for which the masses MT = 4200 kDa and MN = 740 kDa, and migration ST and SN, are known. Solving the system of these three equations, we obtain: (lgMX - lgMN)/(lgMT - lgMN) = (SX - SN)/(ST - SN). Then MX = MN × (MT/MN){(SX - SN)/(ST - SN)} = 5.68{(SX - SN)/(ST - SN)}. The relative increase in the molecular mass of Sup35 polymers in the experiments presented in Fig. 5 was calculated as a ratio of masses corresponding to the geometric centers of Sup35 spots in each lane.Fig. 5The effects of GuHCl (A), decreased (B), and increased (C) expression of Hsp104 on the size of Sup35 prion polymers. SDD-AGE analysis with immunostaining for Sup35 is shown. A, the 5V-H19 [PSI+] cells were grown for three generations in the presence of 3 mm GuHCl and then for 3 h in the absence of GuHCl. The average size of Sup35 polymers relative to the wild type was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the expression of Hsp104 in the strain T104-5V-H19 was repressed by doxycycline for six generations. The levels of Hsp104, determined by scanning SDS-PAGE blots of the samples stained for Hsp104, are indicated as percent relative to the wild type level. C, the Hsp104 level in the 5V-H19 and PS-5V-H19 strains was either wild type (W) or increased (M) about 30-fold (36.Kushnirov V.V. Kryndushkin D.S. Boguta M. Smirnov V.N. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1443-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by introduction of the multicopy pFL44-HSP104 plasmid. Molecular mass standards are the same as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [PSI+] Prion Aggregates Are Composed of Sup35 Prion Polymers—To check the available models for the structure and maintenance of yeast prions, it was required to determine the size of yeast prion polymers. However, the methods, which would allow doing this with a reasonable precision, were unavailable. Furthermore, it was likely that the aggregates observed by the existing methods, e.g. centrifugation or GFP visualization (13.Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 21.Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), represent not polymers, but their higher order complexes possibly including some other molecules. This prompted us to develop an electrophoresis-based approach for analysis of prion polymers. First, it was required to find the conditions, which destroy associations of prion particles with other molecules and with each other, but do not disrupt these particles. Earlier, Paushkin et al. (30.Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Science. 1997; 277: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) used GuHCl at high concentrations to obtain Sup35 prion aggregates containing no detectable contaminants. However, we found later that while GuHCl solubilized the majority of cellular proteins, it also caused secondary precipitation of some proteins of yeast lysates (data not shown). We tested several other reagents at different concentrations for their ability to purify prion particles, including urea, high salt (KCl), deoxycholate, zwittergent 3-10, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, N-lauroyl sarcosyl, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). For this, the aggregated fraction of 5V-H19 [PSI+] lysates was dissolved in buffers containing these reagents and centrifuged at high speed, and the proportion of Sup35 to other proteins in the pellets was studied (data not shown). The best purification of Sup35 was achieved with N-lauroyl sarcosyl and SDS applied at room temperature. Further tests were focused on the use of SDS, which had minor advantages over sarcosyl. It was important to confirm that the presence of SDS does not impair the Sup35 prion particles. For this, the aggregate fraction of 5V-H19 [PSI+] lysate was dissolved in the Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% SDS, and aliquots were incubated at different temperatures ranging from 20 to 100 °C. Without further boiling the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed for Sup35 by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Sup35 was represented by two bands: a monomer band of about 80 kDa and polymers stuck at the top of the separating gel. In the samples incubated at 42 °C or lower temperatures, low levels of monomers were observed, which are likely to represent ribosome-bound monomeric Sup35. Thus, Sup35 prion particles were resistant to SDS at these temperatures. They dissolved to a small extent at 50 °C and almost completely at 70 °C and higher temperatures. Earlier, a similar ability to withstand SDS at room temperature was demonstrated for Sup35 amyloid-like polymers obtained in vitro (31.Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). This supports the structural similarity of Sup35 prion polymers and Sup35 amyloid fibers. The described properties of SDS allow its use for electrophoretic analysis of the prion particles. However, since boiling of the samples was excluded, correct estimation of the mass of Sup35 prion particles required showing that no additional proteins remained associated with them in the presence of SDS. For this, we analyzed the proteins trapped at the top of the separating gel together with prion Sup35. A strip of the separating gel, containing Sup35 polymers, was cut off, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins separated using another SDS-PAGE gel as described in the legend to Fig. 1B. In this way, one can observe the proteins, which run as polymers before boiling, but as monomers after boiling. These should include Sup35 prion, other proteins with similar properties, and the proteins associated with Sup35 particles during the first electrophoresis. The only abundant protein band represented Sup35 (Fig. 1B), as confirmed by immunoblotting (not shown). Although in this experiment some minor proteins could escape detection by Coomassie Blue, it is possible to conclude that SDS dissolves most of the yeast non-prion protein complexes and removes most of the proteins, which could be associated with Sup35 prion polymers. The large size of prion polymers, presumably of the megadalton range, precluded the use of polyacrylamide gels, even at lowest possible concentration of about 3%. So, in further experiments agarose gels were used. As a molecular mass standard, the preparation of rabbit myofibrils, which contains giant proteins titin and nebulin, was used (32.Wang K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We assumed that the molecular masses of titin and nebulin are equal to 4200 and 740 kDa, which corresponds to the coding capacities of respective human genes (33.Bang M.L. Centner T. Fornoff F. Geach A.J. Gotthardt M. McNabb M. Witt C.C. Labeit D. Gregorio C.C. Granzier H. Labeit S. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 34.Fritz J.D. Wolff J.A. Greaser M.L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The homologous rabbit genes were not completely sequenced, but the partial amino acid sequence of rabbit titin was highly similar (99%) to its human counterpart (34.Fritz J.D. Wolff J.A. Greaser M.L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A range of SDS concentrations for the treatment of samples was tried using 5V-H19 [PSI+] lysate to check that they do not affect the size of prion particles. The samples were analyzed using horizontal agarose gel as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). The mobility of Sup35 oligomers did not increase when the SDS concentration increased from 0.5 to 5% or duration of treatment increased from 3 to 10 min. This confirms that SDS does not impair Sup35 polymers; otherwise, we would observe a decrease in the polymer size with the increase of SDS concentration and duration of treatment. The polymer mobility was somewhat decreased at SDS concentrations lower than 0.5%. Most likely, these low levels of SDS were insufficient to destroy all non-prion interactions. In further work, buffers containing 2% SDS were used for incubation of lysate samples at 37 °C. This removes the associated proteins from Sup35 prion polymers but leaves them intact and allows to analyze their size using agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS. This method was called semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE). A comparison of [PSI+] and [psi-] lysates with this method distinguished them clearly (Fig. 2). In [PSI+] lysate, Sup35 was mostly in the polymer form, while in [psi-] it was monomeric. In contrast, in the centrifugation analysis a significant portion of Sup35 was usually found in the aggregated fraction of both [PSI+] and [psi-] lysates (Fig. 3A). The prion polymers were heterogeneous in size, ranging from 700 to 4000 kDa, which should correspond to 9-50 Sup35 monomers. Since we found that SDS removes associated proteins from Sup35 prion polymers, it was of interest how the size of these polymers compares with the size of Sup35-containing aggregates observed under the native conditions used in standard centrifugation methods. For this, we analyzed the lysate of 5V-H19 [PSI+] strain by centrifugation in the presence of 2% SDS and its absence. Comparison of the Sup35 sedimentation profiles showed that the presence of SDS greatly reduced the size of Sup35 prion complexes (Fig. 3A). On average, the mass of Sup35 prion aggregates was 35-fold greater than that of the polymers (see “Experimental Procedures”). So great a difference in sizes of prion polymers and aggregates may be due to two reasons, the association of Sup35 polymers in aggregates with some other proteins and macromolecular complexes, such as ribosome, and the presence of more than one Sup35 polymer per aggregate. However, the relative contribution of these two factors is difficult to determine. The Sup35 prion aggregates varied greatly in their size. The smallest of them were comparable with prion polymers, and the largest were about 100-fold bigger. However, the prion polymers, constituting these aggregates, differed much less in their size. The centrifugation fractions obtained without SDS were analyzed by SDD-AGE (Fig. 3B). The average size of Sup35 polymers in the slowest sedimenting fraction was about 900 kDa and in the pellet about 1500 kDa, which constitutes only 1.7-fold difference. [PSI+] Variants Differ in the Size of Sup35 Polymers—Different isolates of [PSI+] may vary in the strength of the nonsense suppressor phenotype and in mitotic stability (35.Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such variation was also observed for hybrid prion [PSI+PS] based on Sup35 prion domain from yeast P. methanolica (20.Kushnirov V.V. Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Frolova N.S. Ter Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Usually, stronger suppression correlates with higher stability. It was proposed that the variation in [PSI+] properties reflects the difference in structure of prion particles (36.Kushnirov V.V. Kryndushkin D.S. Boguta M. Smirnov V.N. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1443-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37.King C.Y. J. Mol.

This may result in variation of prion polymerization speed and the frequency of fragmentation of prion polymers and, therefore, in their different size (12.Kushnirov V.V. Ter Avanesyan M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To check this, we compared the size of Sup35 polymers in different [PSI+] isolates. A significant variation was found, with the size being inversely related to the strength of [PSI+] (Fig. 4). Strong [PSI+] isolates had smaller Sup35 polymers than weak ones. Among hybrid [PSI+PS], strong variants also had smaller Sup35 polymers, though with one exception: the strong [PSI+PS-1] showed large Sup35 polymers. The minimal size of prion polymer observed among the studied [PSI+] variants corresponded to ∼600 kDa or about eight Sup35 monomers. GuHCl Inhibits Fragmentation of Sup35 Prion Polymers—GuHCl was shown to inactivate Hsp104, which should be a reason of its prion curing effect (16.Ferreira P.C. Ness F. Edwards S.R. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19.Jung G. Masison D.C. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of GuHCl on the size of prion polymers, the 5V-H19 [PSI+] strain was grown in the YPD medium containing 3 mm GuHCl. A half-volume of the culture was taken for analysis once per generation and replaced with an equal amount of fresh medium with GuHCl to keep the culture density constant. After the third generation, the cells were transferred to YPD lacking GuHCl, and aliquots were taken once per hour. Cell lysates were obtained and analyzed by SDD-AGE (Fig. 5A). In the presence of GuHCl the average size of the Sup35 polymers increased about 2-fold per generation. Therefore, the fragmentation of Sup35 polymers was impaired, rather than their growth by accretion of new Sup35 molecules. Furt"

Although evidence suggests that apolipoprotein E plays an important role in modifying systemic and brain inflammatory responses, there is little data investigating apoE isoform-specific effects in vivo. In this study, we compared the inflammatory responses of targeted-replacement mice expressing the human APOE3 and APOE4 genes after intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide. Animals expressing the E4 allele had significantly greater systemic and brain elevations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 as compared with their APOE3 counterparts, suggesting an isoform-specific effect of the immunomodulatory properties of apoE.

These results suggest that apoE plays an isoform-specific role in mediating the systemic and brain inflammatory responses.

There are three common human isoforms of apoE, designated E2, E3, and E4, encoded for by distinct alleles on human chromosome 19. The isoforms differ by single amino acid interchanges at residues 112 and 158: E3(Cys112-Arg158), E4 (Arg112-Arg158), and E2(Cys112-Cys158) (1.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The allele frequency of APOE4 is ∼14% and has been associated with the early onset of Alzheimer's disease and poor prognosis in neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis (2.Strittmatter W.J.

The presence of the APOE4 allele is also associated with poor prognosis following traumatic brain injury (4.Sorbi S. Nacmias B. Piacentini S. Repice A. Latorraca S. Forleo P. Amaducci L. Nat.

ApoE is the major apolipoprotein produced in the central nervous system (CNS). Independently of its role in cholesterol metabolism, apoE modulates innate and acquired immune responses in vitro and in vivo (7.Laskowitz D.T. Lee D.M. Schmechel D. Staats H.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE-deficient animals have impaired immunity after bacterial challenge with Listeria monocytogenes (8.Roselaar S.E. Daugherty A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 740-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). They also have increased susceptibility to endotoxemia after intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration and inoculation with Klebsiella pneumonia (9.de Bont N. Netea M.G. Demacker P.N.

A recent report confirmed the observation that apoE-deficient animals had an increased systemic inflammatory response and higher mortality following LPS injection, and that the administration of exogenous apoE improved mortality by down-regulating the inflammatory cascade (10.Van Oosten M. Rensen P.C. Van Amersfoort E.S. Van Eck M. Van Dam A.M. Breve J.J. Vogel T. Panet A. Van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8820-8824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The immunomodulatory properties of apoE may be of particular relevance in the CNS, where the absence of endogenous apoE has been shown to exacerbate cerebral edema and functional deficit after traumatic brain injury (11.Lynch J.R. Pineda J.A. Morgan D. Zhang L. Warner D.S. Benveniste H. Laskowitz D.T. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12.Chen Y. Lomnitski L. Michaelson D.M. Shohami E. Neuroscience. 1997; 80: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which apoE exerts these immunomodulatory effects remain incompletely understood. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to its role in lipid transport, apoE is capable of binding high affinity receptors and initiating a calcium-dependent signaling response in immunocompetent cells (13.Misra U.K. Adlakha C.L. Gawdi G. McMillian M.K. Pizzo S.V. Laskowitz D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, the lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α-2 macroglobulin receptor is capable of initiating signal transduction and modulating immune responses (14.Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although not extensively studied, isoform-specific differences in immune regulation may also play a particularly important role in mediating the CNS response to injury. For example, apoE4 is less effective than apoE3 or apoE2 at suppressing the activation of microglia in cell culture paradigms of brain inflammation (15.Laskowitz D.T. Thekdi A.D. Thekdi S.D. Han S.K. Myers J.K. Pizzo S.V. Bennett E.R. Exp. Neurology. 2001; 167: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16.Barger S.W. Harmon A.D. Nature. 1997; 388: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In humans, isoform-specific differences are suggested by autopsy reports demonstrating increased numbers of scattered microglia and microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease patients carrying the APOE4 allele (17.Egensperger R. Kosel S. von Eitzen U. Graeber M.B. Brain Path. 1998; 8: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although there is increasing evidence that apoE plays a biologically relevant role in modulating immune responses, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remain unclear. It has been postulated that the protective effect of lipoproteins in endotoxemia is mediated by the binding and redirection of LPS from Kupffer cells to parenchymal liver cells, where endotoxin is inactivated and secreted into bile (18.Harris H.W. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Read T.E. Kane J.P. Jones A.L. Eichbaum E.B. Bland G.F. Rapp J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19.Read T.E. Harris H.W.

Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis is that, independent of lipid binding, apoE down-regulates activation of immune cells by binding to high affinity receptors and initiating a signaling cascade (13.Misra U.K. Adlakha C.L. Gawdi G. McMillian M.K. Pizzo S.V. Laskowitz D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which apoE exerts its immunomodulatory effects, we looked at the ability of an apoE mimetic peptide to suppress the systemic and CNS inflammatory responses in vivo. This peptide is derived from the receptor-binding region of apoE and is composed of amino acid residues 133–149 (15.Laskowitz D.T. Thekdi A.D. Thekdi S.D. Han S.K. Myers J.K. Pizzo S.V. Bennett E.R. Exp. Neurology. 2001; 167: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that apoE-(133–149) retains the bioactivity of the intact apoE holoprotein in its ability to suppress brain macrophage activation and initiate a macrophage signaling cascade in cultured cells (13.Misra U.K. Adlakha C.L. Gawdi G. McMillian M.K. Pizzo S.V. Laskowitz D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized an LPS model of induced inflammation in targeted replacement (TR) mice expressing the human E3 and E4 genes to establish whether systemic and brain inflammatory responses were influenced by apoE in an isoform-specific manner. These animals have the human apoE3 or E4 genes at the correct murine genetic locus and do not express murine apoE (20.Harris H.W. Rockey D.C. Chau P. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The inflammatory response was monitored by measuring the temporal secretion and expression profiles of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6, in the central nervous system and peripheral circulation. In this series of experiments, wild-type C57BL6/J mice were treated with a single intravenous injection of the apoE-mimetic peptide after LPS administration with TNFα and IL-6 levels were determined. TNFα and IL-6 were selected to monitor the systemic and CNS immune response because they are both released from immune cells in the periphery during inflammation, are expressed in many CNS cells including microglia, neurons, and astrocytes. In addition, TNFα and IL-6 play an important role in neuronal cell death and survival during injury and pathological conditions (22.Sternberg E.M.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2641-2647Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Mice—APOE TR model was created by gene targeting of E14TG2a embryonic stem cells from 129P2/OlaHsd mice with the human apoE3 or human apoE4 construct in combination with flanking sequences from the 129 mouse. The targeted embryonic stem cells were injected into C57BL6/J blastocysts, and the resulting chimeras were bred to C57BL6/J mice. Then, they underwent eight generations of back-crossing to C57BL6/J. The colony was maintained by homozygous matings. Genotype was confirmed prior to each experiment. In addition, age-matched male C57BL6/J mice were used in the peptide experiments. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized from the Peptide Synthesis Laboratory at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC) to a purity of 95% and were reconstituted in sterile isotonic PBS. For each peptide, the amino terminus was acetylated, and the carboxyl terminus was blocked with an amide moiety. The 17-amino acid peptide was derived from apoE residues 133–149 (the receptor-binding region): Ac-LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL-amide. Control injections utilized the identical vehicle of PBS. To rule out the possibility of nonspecific peptide effects, controls included a scrambled peptide of identical size and amino acid composition. LPS and Peptide Injections—This study was approved by the Duke University Animal and Care Use Committee. 14–16-week-old male C57-BL6 and matched APOE3-TR and APOE4-TR mice were injected with LPS (40 μg/kg in 100 μl of PBS) via tail vein and then immediately with vehicle (100 μl of isotonic sterile PBS) or peptide (apoE-(133–149)) (6.0 mg/kg, prepared in isotonic saline). Serum samples were obtained in LPS + vehicle and LPS + peptide groups (n = 20 animals/group) at the following timepoints: baseline and at 1, 3, and 24 h after injection. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia and ventilated with 21% oxygen. Blood was collected by transcardiac puncture and allowed to clot for 30 min. Serum samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, quick-frozen by immersing in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. To remove systemic blood from the cerebral vasculature, mice were perfused with 20 ml of PBS via transcardiac puncture. Brains were removed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Quantification of Cytokine Protein—Cytokine levels in murine serum and brain homogenate were determined by using mouse cytokine ELISA kits for murine IL-6 and TNFα following the manufacturer's specifications (Pierce). Murine brains were isolated and quick-frozen by immersing in liquid nitrogen. The frozen brains were ground up into a fine powder in a liquid nitrogen pre-cooled mortar. Homogenates were generated by placing brains in ice-cold homogenized buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% ethanol, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized by using a Teflon pestle and a motor-driven tissue homogenizer. Samples were maintained on ice throughout the homogenization procedure. After homogenization, the sample was clarified by centrifuging at 5 °C for 15 min at 1,500 × g to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was removed and divided into several smaller working aliquots and stored at –70 °C until ELISA analysis. Quantification of mRNA—Murine brain total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manual. Cytokine gene expression will be determined by relative quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using gene specific relative RT-PCR kits (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. This method provides reagents, controls, and methodology to yield reliable, relevant information about the relative abundance of different mRNA species in different RNA samples. It uses a reverse transcription-PCR approach in which two primer sets were used in a single reaction: one set was used to amplify the cDNA of interest, and a second was used to amplify an invariant endogenous control (18S rRNA). In addition to primers for the test gene and 18S PCR primer pair, a set of 18S PCR competitors are included to prevent loss of relative quantification. The PCR products were run on 6% acrylamide gels and visualized using a PhosphorImager and Image Quant version 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics). For each sample, the signal obtained for the gene-specific amplicon was divided by the signal obtained for the 18S amplicon, yielding a corrected relative value for the gene-specific product in each sample. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences in cytokine mRNA and protein were determined by using 2-way ANOVA when data was parametric and a Wilcoxon rank test for nonparametric data. Effect of apoE Isoform on Inflammatory Response—To determine whether apoE modified systemic inflammatory responses in an isoform-specific manner, APOE3-TR and APOE4-TR animals were injected with LPS via the tail vein. Serum cytokine levels for TNFα and IL-6 were determined by ELISA at several intervals up to 3 h after injection. Administration of LPS resulted in a strong induction of serum TNFα protein levels in both groups of transgenic animals. At 1 h after injection, serum TNFα was significantly higher in APOE4-TR animals compared with APOE3-TR animals (Fig. 1A). At 3 h, there was no measurable TNFα protein in either group (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the same groups of animals exhibited a strong induction of serum IL-6 after injection of LPS (Fig. 1B). IL-6 peaked at 3 h in both groups yet was significantly higher in the APOE4-TR animals relative to the APOE3-TR mice. The observation that animals bearing the human APOE3 gene had reduced serum cytokine levels for two markers of inflammation suggests that apoE3 is a more potent anti-inflammatory protein in a murine model of LPS-induced inflammation compared with apoE4. We next determined whether endogenous apoE could similarly modify the primary brain inflammatory response in an isoform-specific manner. Peak brain TNFα RNA occurred 1 h after the peripheral LPS injection and was significantly higher in APOE4-TR animals compared with APOE3-TR animals. TNFα RNA was still elevated above baseline at 3 h, but there were no significant differences at this time point (Fig. 2A). Brain IL-6 mRNA was also elevated at 1 h after injection, and peaked at 3 h. APOE4 animals had significantly higher levels at 1 h, and no significant group differences were observed at 3 h (Fig. 2B). At 24 h, both TNFα and IL-6 RNA were below the limits of sensitivity of this assay. Taken together, these results suggest an isoform-specific differential effect of apoE on modulating systemic and CNS inflammatory responses, with endogenous E4 less effective than E3. Next, we investigated whether apoE-(133–149), a peptide fragment derived from the receptor-binding region of apoE, would down-regulate inflammatory responses in the same fashion as the intact apoE. When co-administered with LPS, the apoE-mimetic peptide significantly reduced serum TNFα levels at 1 h, and reduced serum IL-6 levels at 1 and 3 h in wild-type C57BL6/J mice (Fig. 3). There was no measurable TNFα or IL-6 protein at 24 h after injection in either group. The anti-inflammatory effects of the peptide were similar in the brain, where the single intravenous injection of peptide significantly reduced TNFα and IL-6 RNA expression 3 h after LPS injection (Figs. 4, A and B). The cytokine protein levels in the brain paralleled the RNA expression, and both TNFα and IL-6 protein were reduced after peptide injection (Fig. 5).Fig. 5An apoE-mimetic peptide significantly reduces cytokine levels in the brain after LPS stimulation. Peak inflammatory cytokine protein levels in brain were present 3 h after LPS injection (40 μg/kg). A, at 1 and 3 h, there was a significant reduction in brain TNFα protein after LPS injection in animals treated with apoE-(133–149) peptide compared with controls (p < 0.05). B, at 3 h, there was a significant reduction in brain IL-6 protein after LPS injection in animals treated with apoE-(133–149) peptide compared with controls (p < 0.05). Each point of the data represents eight animals and is presented as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To rule out the possibility that the down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines in the CNS and systemic circulation were a nonspecific peptide effect, we repeated these experiments using the scrambled apoE-(133–149) sequence co-administered with LPS. We observed no differences in serum IL-6 between the scrambled peptide and vehicle group in serum IL-6 at 1 h (18.1 ± 5.3 versus 21.5 ± 6.9 ng/ml) or 3 h (56.4 ± 15.3 versus 52.9 ± 3.7 ng/ml). Similarly, we found no significant difference in serum TNFα between the scrambled control and vehicle groups (443 ± 191 versus 778 ± 225 pg/ml at 1 h and 3.1 ± 3 versus 3.9 ± 2.8 pg/ml at 3 h). There was no difference in brain IL-6 at 3 h after injection (9.8 ± 0.5 versus 9.3 ± 0.3 pg/ml in vehicle and scrambled peptide treated animals, respectively). Brain TNFα levels were also not significantly different in scrambled peptide and vehicle (56 ± 6 versus 39.1 ± 4 pg/ml). These results demonstrate that the scrambled apoE peptide retained no immunomodulatory bioactivity and would suggest specificity for the apoE-(133–149) peptide derived from the apoE receptor-binding region. ApoE has been demonstrated to exert in vitro immunomodulatory effects by a number of investigators (23.Avila E.M. Holdsworth G. Sasaki N. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5900-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pepe M.G. Curtiss L.K. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3716-3723PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Curtiss L.K. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1382-1386PubMed Google Scholar). The current study indicates that apoE is a biologically relevant immunomodulatory protein that exerts isoform-specific effects. In particular, mice expressing the human APOE4 gene had higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 in blood after LPS injection. Although the interaction of APOE genotype on immune function has not been definitively proven clinically, these results are consistent with a preliminary report demonstrating that patients with the APOE4 allele had a more robust systemic inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass (6.Grocott H.P. Newman M.F. El-Moalem H. Bainbridge D. Butler A. Laskowitz D.T. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2001; 122: 622-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, apoE seems to mediate nitric oxide release after injury in an isoform-specific fashion (26.Colton C.A. Brown C.M. Cook D. Needham L.K. Xu Q. Czapiga M. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D.E. Rasheed K. Vitek M.P. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27.Brown C.M. Wright E. Colton C.A. Sullivan P.M. Laskowitz D.T. Vitek M.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We also found that the APOE4-TR mice have a more robust CNS inflammatory reaction than APOE3-TR mice following peripheral injection of LPS. Because all animals were perfused to remove systemic blood from the cerebral vasculature, the increase in inflammatory cytokine RNA that we observed likely represents a primary brain inflammatory response. These results are consistent with a growing body of literature implicating apoE in modulating glial activation and the CNS response to injury. In cell culture experiments, apoE down-regulates glial activation and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators. This effect is isoform-specific: apoE4 is less effective than apoE3 (15.Laskowitz D.T. Thekdi A.D. Thekdi S.D. Han S.K. Myers J.K. Pizzo S.V. Bennett E.R. Exp. Neurology. 2001; 167: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16.Barger S.W. Harmon A.D. Nature. 1997; 388: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The possibility that apoE4 is associated with a partial loss of function is also consistent with prior data demonstrating that apoE-deficient mice have a more robust systemic and CNS inflammatory response to a variety of stimuli (28.de Bont N. Netea M.G. Demacker P.N. Kullberg B.J. van der Meer J.W. Stalenhoef A.F. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 30: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29.Lynch J.R. Morgan D. Mance J. Matthew W.D. Laskowitz D.T. J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 114: 107-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the relative ineffectiveness of the apoE4 isoform at suppressing the brain inflammatory response may play an important role in clinical neurological diseases associated with neuroinflammation and glial activation. In fact, the presence of the APOE4 allele has been associated with poor clinical outcome in multiple sclerosis, head injury, and an increased susceptibility of developing Alzheimer's disease (2.Strittmatter W.J.

The traditional mechanism by which apoE is thought to protect from LPS-induced lethality is by binding and redirecting LPS from macrophage to hepatocytes, with subsequent biliary excretion (18.Harris H.W. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Read T.E. Kane J.P. Jones A.L. Eichbaum E.B. Bland G.F. Rapp J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19.Read T.E. Harris H.W.

Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, apoE directly down-regulates brain macrophage activation after exposure to a variety of structurally diverse stimuli, including LPS, amyloid precursor protein, and polyinosinic acid (15.Laskowitz D.T. Thekdi A.D. Thekdi S.D. Han S.K. Myers J.K. Pizzo S.V. Bennett E.R. Exp. Neurology. 2001; 167: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16.Barger S.W. Harmon A.D. Nature. 1997; 388: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This fact suggests that apoE may also exert direct immunomodulatory effects that are independent of LPS binding. Given the fact that apoE initiates a signaling cascade in macrophages, another possible mechanism of protection from LPS toxicity is that apoE directly modulates inflammatory responses by specific receptor interactions. In particular, apoE binds a family of lipoprotein receptor-related proteins/α-2 macroglobulin, which have immunomodulatory properties and are present on macrophage and microglia (13.Misra U.K. Adlakha C.L. Gawdi G. McMillian M.K. Pizzo S.V. Laskowitz D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that both apoE and the apoE mimetic peptide used in the present study compete directly for the same high affinity receptor on macrophages and initiate a signaling cascade associated with increased production of inositol triphosphate and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. This signaling cascade is inhibited by pretreatment with receptor-associated protein and Ni2+, and it is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (13.Misra U.K. Adlakha C.L. Gawdi G. McMillian M.K. Pizzo S.V. Laskowitz D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore this hypothesis, we created a series of small peptides derived from the receptor-binding region of apoE. Several of these peptides, such as apoE-(133–149), retain a significant degree of the native helical structure of the receptor-binding region in the holoprotein, compete directly with the intact apoE protein for macrophage receptor binding, and retain the ability of the intact protein to down-regulate microglial activation (15.Laskowitz D.T. Thekdi A.D. Thekdi S.D. Han S.K. Myers J.K. Pizzo S.V. Bennett E.R. Exp. Neurology. 2001; 167: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the apoE peptide used in this study does not include residues 112 or 158, which are associated with the common human polymorphisms. In vivo, there is minimal difference in the protein structure between the apoE isoforms, although the free cysteine on residue 112 allows E2 and E3 to form homodimers (1.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this polymorphic region is distinct from the receptor-binding region, it is possible that the conformational changes induced by these adjacent amino acid substitutions affect the receptor-binding region and subsequent apoE-receptor interactions. For example, the substitution of a cysteine for an arginine at position 158 significantly reduces the ability of apoE2 to bind the low density lipoprotein receptor, even though this residue lies outside the receptor-binding region (1.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2518-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that endogenous apoE plays an important role in modifying both systemic and brain inflammatory responses. These effects seem to be isoform-specific, with the apoE4 isoform being less effective than apoE3 at down-regulating inflammatory cytokines in the brain and peripheral circulation. Moreover, in this study we found that an apoE-mimetic peptide suppressed the release of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 after LPS injection. These results strongly suggest that the apoE-mimetic peptide retains the anti-inflammatory bioactivity of the parent protein. Unlike the intact apoE protein, which consists of 299 amino acid residues and has minimal penetration into the CNS compartment, small apoE-mimetic peptides can potentially be modified to optimize blood-brain barrier penetration. This possibility has implications for the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting diseases characterized by systemic or CNS inflammation, such as septic shock, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury."

Here we show that BACE1 acts on the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1), which mediates leukocyte adhesion in inflammatory reactions. In human monocytic U937 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing endogenous or transfected BACE1, PSGL-1 was cleaved by BACE1 to generate a soluble ectodomain and a C-terminal transmembrane fragment. No evidence of the cleavage fragment was seen in primary cells derived from mice deficient in BACE1. By using deletion constructs and enzymatic deglycosylation of the C-terminal PSGL-1 fragments, the cleavage site in PSGL-1 was mapped to the juxtamembrane region within the ectodomain. In an in vitro assay BACE1 catalyzed the formation of the PSGL-1 products seen in vivo. The cleavage occurred at a Leu—Ser peptide bond as identified by mass spectrometry using a synthetic peptide.

The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease attributes the pathogenesis of the disease to accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), 1The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid β-peptidePSGL-1P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1APPamyloid precursor proteinBACE1β-site APP-cleaving enzymeAPalkaline phosphatasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTNFtumor necrosis factorTNFRTNF receptorHAhemagglutininCTFsC-terminal fragmentsGFPgreen fluorescent protein. a fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). APP is one of a large number of membrane proteins that are proteolytically converted to their soluble counterparts. This process is referred to as ectodomain shedding and is an important way of regulating the biological activity of membrane proteins (2.Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 3.Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding has been described in many multicellular organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and humans and is important in embryonic development, the inflammatory response, and other biological processes (3.Blobel C.P.

The shedding of APP may occur through two different protease activities termed α- and β-secretase, which cleave APP within its ectodomain close to its transmembrane domain (1.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). α-Secretase is a member of the ADAM family of proteases (ADisintegrin And Metalloprotease), which typically carry out the ectodomain shedding of numerous proteins (2.Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 3.Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because the ADAM proteases cleave within the Aβ-sequence, they preclude the generation of the Aβ-peptide. In contrast, the β-secretase activity cleaves at the N terminus of the Aβ-peptide domain, thereby catalyzing the first step in Aβ-peptide generation. The β-secretase has recently been identified and is a novel aspartyl protease called BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme) (6.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P.

Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Once APP is cleaved by BACE1, the remaining C-terminal APP fragment may be cleaved by the so-called γ-secretase within its transmembrane domain at the C terminus of Aβ, leading to the secretion of the Aβ-peptide (11.Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the ectodomain shedding of APP by BACE1, but not by ADAM proteases, is the first step of Aβ-peptide generation, inhibition of BACE1 activity is considered to be a highly promising approach to treat Alzheimer's disease (1.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar, 12.Vassar R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13.Citron M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether BACE1 predominantly cleaves APP and a recently identified sialyltransferase (14.Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or also additional proteins. In the latter case, like the ADAM metalloproteases, BACE1 could be a basic cellular mediator of the ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins. Because APP is mainly cleaved by a metalloprotease of the ADAM family and only to a smaller extent by BACE1 (1.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar), we reasoned that additional membrane proteins known to undergo ectodomain shedding by a metalloprotease might also be cleaved to a smaller extent by BACE1. By testing selected candidate proteins, we found that the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a novel substrate for BACE1. PSGL-1, which is expressed as a homodimer, mediates leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and is critically involved in the inflammatory response both in brain and in peripheral tissues (15.McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to APP, PSGL-1 is a type I membrane protein. It consists of a signal peptide, a prodomain, which is presumably removed by furin or one of its homologues upon maturation of the protein, a receptor binding domain, 15 to 16 repeats of 10 amino acids (decamer repeats), which are highly O-glycosylated, a juxtamembrane domain, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain (15.McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents—Antibodies and reagents were purchased from the indicated companies: HA.11 (Covance), AU1 (Covance), FLAG M2 (Sigma), PL1 (Immunotech Coulter), BACE1 (ProSci) with blocking peptide (ProSci), IgG1 control antibody (Pharmingen), phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako), PMA (Sigma), and PSGL-1 peptide (Peptide Specialty Laboratories). The deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F (Prozyme) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody 6687 against the C terminus of APP was described earlier (16.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfections, Retroviral Transductions, and Flow Cytometric Analysis—293-EBNA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Human monocytic U937 cells and the human T cell clone Jurkat 10104 were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% lipopolysaccharide-free fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. 293 cells stably expressing AP-TNFR2 or AP-PSGL-1 were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Clonal 293 cells expressing AP-APP and Bcl-XL/CrmA were selected in 0.3 μg/ml puromycin and 40 μg/ml hygromycin. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). In the transient transfections, the medium was replaced with fresh medium 1 day after transfection. After another overnight incubation, the conditioned medium and the cell lysate were collected. For the alkaline phosphatase measurements, aliquots of the conditioned medium were treated for 30 min at 65 °C to heat-inactivate the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. In transient transfections, where multiple plasmids were cotransfected, luciferase or alkaline phosphatase was included to normalize the expression levels for transfection efficiencies. To produce retroviral supernatants, plasmids encoding VSV-G, gagpol, and either P12/MMP-GFP or P12/MMP-BACE were transfected into 293 cells. The retroviral transductions were carried out using Polybrene (Sigma). Flow cytometric analysis was carried out on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur using the indicated antibody. To analyze the effect of PMA on shedding, the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 3 h with the addition of 1 μm PMA in ethanol or with ethanol alone. For treatment with the metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI (25 μm), the cells were pretreated for 45 min with inhibitor. Next the medium was replaced with fresh medium for 3 h containing the inhibitor dissolved in Me2SO or with Me2SO alone. To detect secreted and cellular PSGL-1, aliquots of lysate or conditioned medium were directly loaded onto an electrophoresis gel. The concentration of β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer was 10%. At lower concentrations PSGL-1 and its C-terminal fragments were detected not only at the monomeric but also at the dimeric apparent molecular weight. Western blot detection was carried out by using the indicated antibodies. To study the effect of γ-secretase inhibition on the amount of C-terminal fragments, 293 cells were transiently transfected with PSGL-1 or as a control with APP. Two days after transfection the cells were preincubated for 45 min in the presence of the inhibitor and then incubated for additional 8 h with fresh medium containing the inhibitor. The specific γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT (1 μm; kindly provided by Dr. Boris Schmidt, Darmstadt, Germany) or L-685,458 (5 μm; Bachem) were dissolved in Me2SO. Control cells were treated with Me2SO alone. Aliquots of the cell lysate were analyzed by blot analysis. Plasmid Construction—All cDNAs (PSGL-1, BACE1, BACE2, ADAM10, APP, luciferase, L-selectin, TNFR2, and mutants and fusion proteins thereof) were cloned into the expression vector peak 12. The cDNA of ADAM10 was amplified by PCR from an activated T cell library; the cDNAs of secretory alkaline phosphatase was kindly provided by Michael Brown, and the cDNA of BACE2 was kindly provided by Hyeryun Choe and Mike Farzan. The identity of all constructs obtained by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid encoding Bcl-XL and CrmA was described previously (17.Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. Immunity. 1999; 11: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Phosphatase Assay—For alkaline phosphatase activity measurements, 200 μl of reaction solution (0.1 m glycine, pH 10.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2 containing 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate, Sigma) were added to 20 μl of the conditioned medium. The absorbance was read at 405 nm. Infection of Primary Neurons with Semliki Forest Virus—Cortical neurons were prepared from E14 mice embryos from BACE1 heterozygote crosses as described (18.De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Embryo tails were used for the genotyping. The BACE knock out was verified by Northern and Western blot detection and by functional analysis demonstrating that APP cleavage by BACE was virtually eliminated in the neurons. 2P. Saftig, D.-i. Dominguez, and B. De Strooper, unpublished results. Preparation of recombinant Semliki Forest virus stocks has been described previously (19.De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Virus was diluted 1:100 in conditioned culture medium and added to 4-day-old neurons. Three hours post-infection, cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in TBS buffer). PSGL-1 full-length and CTFs were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitated material was separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro BACE1 Cleavage Assay and Mass Spectrometry—Cell lysates from PSGL-1-expressing 293 cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with or without BACE1-containing membrane preparations in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.4. Membranes from BACE1-transfected and non-transfected 293 cells were extracted according to a previously published protocol (20.Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) using 1% Triton X-100 and STE buffer instead of DDM lysis buffer. The following protease inhibitors were included where indicated. The BACE1 inhibitor (GL189) H-EVNstatineVAEF-NH2 was synthesized by K. Maskos and W. Bode and used at 2 μm. Pepstatin A was used at 2 μg/ml. and the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of the synthetic peptide AASNLSVNYPVGAPDHISVKQCONH2 were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without the purified, soluble BACE1 ectodomain in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.4. The reaction mixture was purified using ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol and was directly eluted from the ZipTips with a saturated solution of α-cinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid onto a stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization target plate. Mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DESTR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometer. Alkaline Phosphatase Fusion Protein Assay Identifies PSGL-1 as a New BACE1 Substrate—To identify new BACE1 substrates, alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins of L-selectin, TNF-receptor 2, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) were generated. Like APP, the three proteins are known to undergo ectodomain shedding in a metalloprotease-dependent manner. As a control an AP fusion protein of APP was included. All four proteins were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which are widely used for studying APP processing and BACE activity. The AP activity was measured in the conditioned medium. The AP fusion proteins were shed in the same manner as the corresponding wild-type proteins (5.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L.

Next, the cells were transfected with vectors encoding either BACE1, a catalytically inactive BACE1 mutant (BACE1 D93A) (23.Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.C. Citron M.

Transfection of BACE1 strongly induced the shedding of the AP fusion proteins of APP and PSGL-1 but not of L-selectin and TNF receptor 2 (Fig. 1). This result suggests that PSGL-1, but not L-selectin and TNFR2, could be a novel substrate for the protease BACE1. A catalytically inactive mutant of BACE1 (BACE D93A) (23.Bennett B.D. Denis P.

Interestingly, ADAM10 and BACE2 showed the same cleavage pattern as BACE1 by stimulating the shedding of APP and PSGL-1 but not of L-selectin and TNFR2 (Fig. 1). Proteolytic Processing of PSGL-1 by BACE1—To analyze in more detail the cleavage of PSGL-1 by BACE1, we used blot analysis to study the proteolytic processing of PSGL-1 in the human monocytic cell line U937, which expresses endogenous PSGL-1, as well as in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293, which has been used for several studies of BACE1 activity. To facilitate detection of the proteolytic fragments, PSGL-1 was tagged with three small epitope tags at the N terminus of the immature protein (HA), in the ectodomain of the mature protein (AU1), and in the cytoplasmic domain (FLAG; Fig. 2A). PSGL-1 was transfected into 293 cells, where it could be detected on the cell surface by flow cytometry using an antibody against PSGL-1 (PL1) or against the AU1 tag (data not shown). In the cell lysate, the immature form and the mature, fully O-glycosylated form of PSGL-1 showed the expected molecular masses of ∼85 and ∼120 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B, lane 2, FLAG blot), and were not visible in control cells not transfected with PSGL-1 (lane 1). Two types of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of PSGL-1 were observed in the lysate (Fig. 2B, lane 2 Flag blots): two fragments with a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa and three fragments with a molecular mass of around ∼30 kDa. The fragments of ∼20 kDa were dramatically enriched in a dose-dependent manner when BACE1 was overexpressed (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that they arise through cleavage of PSGL-1 by the endogenous BACE1 of the 293 cells. Upon BACE1 overexpression a third C-terminal fragment of a slightly lower molecular weight was detected. This fragment was not detected in cells expressing endogenous BACE1, presumably because its amount was below the detection limit. The apparent molecular weight of these C-terminal fragments is nearly identical to the molecular weight of a PSGL-1 deletion mutant (PSGL-1 noecto) in which the ectodomain was replaced by the short HA epitope tag (Fig. 2C), suggesting that BACE1 cleavage occurs close to the transmembrane domain. Interestingly, similar to the PSGL-1 C-terminal fragments, PSGL-1 noecto was present as three different bands. At present it is unknown whether the three bands represent three conformations with differing electrophoretic mobility or might differ by post-translational modifications. However, the three bands have the same N terminus, since they could be detected with an antibody against their N-terminal HA tag (Fig. 2C). The C-terminal PSGL-1 fragments of ∼30 kDa were enriched when the metalloprotease ADAM10 was overexpressed (Fig. 2B, lane 5), and therefore most likely represent the CTFs generated by ADAM protease cleavage of PSGL-1 in the 293 cells. Thus, like those of APP, PSGL-1 CTFs of different length seem to be generated by BACE1 or by metalloproteases of the ADAM family. Overexpression of BACE1 not only led to the increased generation of PSGL-1 CTFs but also to a reduction in quantity of mature, full-length PSGL-1. This was particularly apparent when more BACE1 plasmid was used for transfection (Fig. 2B, FLAG blot; high BACE and low BACE), suggesting that BACE1 very efficiently cleaves the mature PSGL-1. The reduction of mature, full-length PSGL-1 was accompanied by a reduction of PSGL-1 detected on the surface of 293 cells using flow cytometry (data not shown). In the conditioned medium, the secreted ectodomain of PSGL-1 was detected with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 2, top panel). Additionally, smaller fragments of 80–100 kDa were observed (Fig. 2B, top panel, PSGL-1 short), suggesting that the soluble form of PSGL-1 is subject to further proteolytic cleavage. This was particularly visible upon BACE1 transfection, where the full-length ectodomain could barely be detected (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 3 and 4, secreted PSGL-1), but instead an increased amount of the apparent degradation products was visible. After the initial ectodomain cleavage the C-terminal fragments of APP and other type I membrane proteins may undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase. For example, treatment of APP-expressing 293 cells with the two specific γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT (26.Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B.

In contrast, no accumulation of PSGL-1 C-terminal fragments was observed in PSGL-1-expressing 293 cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that PSGL-1 is not a substrate for γ-secretase. Proteolytic Processing of PSGL-1 in U937 Cells—The monocytic U937 cell line showed essentially the same proteolytic processing of PSGL-1 (Fig. 3) as the 293 cells (Fig. 2B), including the strong reduction of full-length PSGL-1 from the cell surface of U937 cells upon transduction of BACE1 (Fig. 4). The U937 cells were retrovirally transduced with PSGL-1 and additionally with a retrovirus encoding BACE1 or GFP as a control. In a control experiment, the U937 cells were stimulated with the phorbol ester PMA, which induced the secretion of PSGL-1 (not shown), as reported previously (21.Davenpeck K.L. Brummet M.E. Hudson S.A. Mayer R.J. Bochner B.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) for human neutrophils.Fig. 4Flow cytometric analysis of the endogenous PSGL-1 in monocytic U937 cells. U937 cells were retrovirally transduced with GFP as a control (Con) or with BACE1 and stained with antibody PL-1 against the N terminus of PSGL-1. The dotted line represents the isotype control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the findings from 293 cells, only one C-terminal fragment was visible in the lysate of U937 cells overexpressing BACE1 (Fig. 3, lane 3, Flag blot). In control cells transduced with GFP instead of BACE1, the C-terminal fragment was detected after longer exposure of the film (see Fig. 3, bottom panel), similar to the results from 293 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2, Flag blot), suggesting that this C-terminal fragment resulted from cleavage induced by the endogenous BACE1 of the U937 cells. Similar results were observed in the human Jurkat T cell line (data not shown), which also expresses endogenous PSGL-1. The nature and the position of the C-terminal epitope tag of PSGL-1 did not influence its proteolytic processing (data not shown). C-terminal Fragments of PSGL-1 Are Not Generated in BACE1-deficient Cells—Next we analyzed whether the PSGL-1 CTFs were absent in BACE1-deficient cells. To this aim, we made use of BACE1 knock-out mice.2 Although BACE1 is expressed in most tissues and cell lines including leukocytes (8.Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R.

Thus, primary neuronal cultures were used for the subsequent experiments. The neurons were infected with Semliki Forest virus encoding the epitope-tagged PSGL-1. Full-length PSGL-1 and its CTFs were detected by [35S]methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG tag antibody. In neurons of wild-type mice, PSGL-1 was processed to the same C-terminal fragment as detected in U937 and 293 cells (Fig. 5, lane 5). Coinfection of the neurons with virus encoding BACE1 led to an increased generation of the PSGL-1 CTF (Fig. 5, lane 6). In contrast, in neurons of BACE1–/– mice, no CTF of PSGL-1 could be detected (Fig. 5, lane 2). Virally induced expression of BACE1 restored the generation of the C-terminal fragment in the BACE1–/– neurons (Fig. 5, lane 3), showing that BACE1 is required for the generation of the PSGL-1 C-terminal fragment of ∼20 kDa. In Vitro, BACE1 Induces the Cleavage of PSGL-1—To analyze whether PSGL-1 is directly cleaved by BACE1, the following in vitro assay was used. Cell lysates of 293 cells expressing full-length PSGL-1 were incubated with membrane extracts from control 293 cells (Fig. 6, lane 3) or from 293 cells overexpressing BACE1 (Fig. 6, lanes 4–7). In the presence (Fig. 6, lane 4) but not the absence (Fig. 6, lane 3) of the BACE1 extract, the same PSGL-1 CTFs were generated as in vivo (Fig. 6, lane 2). The addition of a specific BACE1 inhibitor (GL189) (28.Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suppressed the generation of the PSGL-1 CTFs (Fig. 6, lane 5), whereas the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A (Fig. 6,"

FMD diet-induced tumors exhibit global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation. Restriction landmark genome scanning analysis with methylation-sensitive enzyme NotI (RLGS-M) of genomic DNA isolated from control livers, PNNs and tumor tissues was performed to identify the genes that are differentially methylated or amplified during multistage hepatocarcinogenesis. Out of the 1250 genes analysed, 2 to 5 genes were methylated in the PNNs, whereas 5 to 45 genes were partially or completely methylated in the tumors. This analysis also showed amplification of 3 to 12 genes in the primary tumors. As a first step towards identifying the genes methylated in the PNNs and primary hepatomas, we generated a rat NotI-EcoRV genomic library in the pBluescriptKS vector. Here, we describe identification of one methylated and downregulated gene as the rat protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) and one amplified gene as rat C-MYC. Methylation of PTPRO at the NotI site located immediate upstream of the trancription start site in the PNNs and tumors, and amplification of C-MYC gene in the tumors were confirmed by Southern blot analyses. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the CpG island encompassing exon 1 of the PTPRO gene revealed dense methylation in the PNNs and tumors, whereas it was methylation free in the livers of animals on normal diet. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed significant decrease in the expression of PTPRO in the tumors and in a transplanted rat hepatoma. The expression of PTPRO mRNA in the transplanted hepatoma after demethylation with 5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, further confirmed the role of methylation in PTPRO gene expression. These results demonstrate alteration in methylation profile and expression of specific genes during tumor progression in the livers of rats in response to folate/methyl deficiency, and further implicate the potential role of PTPRO as a novel growth regulatory gene at least in the hepatocellular carcinomas."

The degree to which DC function can be polarized to induce immune sensitization or tolerance is highlighted by advances toward the therapeutic use of DCs to both boost (for neoplasia and vaccination) and inhibit (for transplantation and autoimmunity) antigen-specific cellular immunity (1.Banchereau J.

This functional plasticity is linked with a collection of phenotypic changes (termed maturation) that convert the DC from a cell with modest antigen-presenting capacity to one with high surface levels of peptide·major histocompatibility complex complexes and costimulatory ligands (1.Banchereau J.

There are five known mammalian Rel/NF-κB proteins, Rel (c-Rel), p65 (RelA), RelB, p50 (NF-κB1), and p52 (NF-κB2), that function as dimers held latently in the cytoplasm by inhibitor proteins (IκB). Cellular activation leads to IκB phosphorylation and translocation of NF-κB dimers to the nucleus, where they act directly upon regulatory elements within the promoter regions of many genes (8.Baldwin Jr., A.S.

O'Sullivan B. Low P. Thomas R. Immunity. 2003; 18: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RelB nuclear translocation in DCs has also been observed following the use of tolerogenic immunosuppressive regimens in experimental models of allotransplantation (14.Hutchings A.

We have recently reported that the active form of the steroid hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25-(OH)2D3) and its analogs, which are known to potently inhibit DC maturation (15.Griffin M.D. Xing N. Kumar R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 117-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), selectively inhibit mRNA and protein expression of RelB in bone marrow-derived DCs (15.Griffin M.D. Xing N.

The inhibition of RelB in DCs is further attenuated by addition of glucocorticoid, and DCs generated in the combined presence of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and glucocorticoid agonists exhibit a highly immature phenotype (16.Xing N. Maldonado M.L. Bachman L.A. McKean D.J. Kumar R. Griffin M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The functional effects of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 and its analogs are predominantly mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which then acts as a transcriptional regulator by binding to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) within the promoters of responsive genes, most commonly as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) (17.Jones G.

Negative regulation by 1α,25-(OH)2D3 of immune-related gene products such as interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-γ, and IL-12 p40 has been documented, but it has not been possible to clearly identify VDREs in the promoters of these genes (19.Alroy I.

In this report, we present evidence that 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of RelB in DCs is a VDR-dependent process that operates through bona fide VDREs within the promoter regions of both human and mouse relB genes and that may be augmented by concurrent interference with separate NF-κB response elements (NF-κB-REs) in the relB promoter.

Med. 1993; 178: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids, the pRL-TK reference Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), and expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Day 7 BMDCs from wild-type VDR and VDR knockout mice were seeded on 10-well microscope slides (Erie Scientific Co., Portsmouth, NH), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and washed with PBS. After blocking for 1 h in PBS and 5% nonfat dry milk, cells were incubated with anti-mouse RelB polyclonal antibody (1:150 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS and 5% nonfat dry milk. Finally, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 4 μg/ml) for 45 min in PBS and 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by three washes. Slides were mounted with Vectashield® mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and examined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Göttingen, Germany). Expression Constructs and Reporter Plasmids—A polynucleotide fragment containing the entire coding region of the mouse VDR transcript (GenBank™/EBI accession number D31969) was amplified by PCR using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers (sense primer, 5′-CTGTGAGTCTTCCAGGAGAGCACC-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-TCAGGAGATCTCATTGCCAAACACC-3′) and cDNA prepared from activated murine T-cells and then ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) by the restriction sites HindIII and XbaI. The cloning of the human relB promoter (containing 1.1 kb of sequence 5′ to the translational start site) and its corresponding NF-κBI and NF-κBII mutants into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) has been described previously (25.Bren G.D. Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Pennington K.N. Pobst L.J. Paya C.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7722-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A fragment of genomic DNA containing 0.8 kb of sequence 5′ to the start site of the mouse relB gene was isolated by screening a genomic library prepared from D3 embryonic stem cell DNA (mouse strain 129/Sv) with a mouse full-length cDNA probe. One phage encoding the relB promoter region was isolated and digested with XbaI and XhoI. The resulting 1.48-kb fragment was ligated into a modified pBluescript vector and then transferred to pGL3 upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Mutagenesis of plasmid constructs was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following mutated plasmid constructs were generated: the human relB promoter with mutated VDRE motif A, the human relB promoter with mutated VDRE motif B, the human relB promoter with mutated VDRE motifs A and B, the mouse relB promoter with mutated VDRE, the human relB promoter with mutated NF-κBI and NF-κBII, and the mouse relB promoter with mutated NF-κBI and NF-κBII (see Fig. 2B for mutated sequences). The sequences of all wild-type and mutant constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing. Gel Shift Assays and Immunoblotting—30–33-base oligonucleotide probes were prepared that straddled the putative VDRE motifs present in the human and mouse relB promoter regions. Complementary strands were synthesized and annealed to sense strands at a molar ration of 1:1 in 100 mm Tris and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) by heating to 100 °C for 10 min and then cooling down to room temperature slowly. The annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). Unincorporated oligonucleotides were removed using a NucTrap® probe purification column (Stratagene). Non-radiolabeled competitor oligonucleotides containing sequence for the mouse osteopontin VDRE and the human AP-1 (c-Jun)-binding sequence were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Recombinant human full-length VDR and RXRα were prepared as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (26.Wu Y. Craig T.A. Lutz W.H. Kumar R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2654-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides (2 pmol), with or without varying ratios of competitor oligonucleotides (10:1, 50:1, and 100:1), were mixed with VDR and RXRα (1 μg each) in the binding buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then separated by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. Immunoblotting for VDR was carried out using total cell lysates from D2SC1 cells transiently transfected with empty pcDNA3.1(+) vector or pcDNA3.1(+) containing the mouse VDR coding region. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin), and kept on ice for 15 min. After preclearing, the whole cell lysate protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Aliquots of 50 μg were separated on 10% precast Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with a 1:400 dilution of anti-VDR antibody, washed, incubated with a 1:8000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A, and then visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Mouse D2SC1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid-encoded promoter construct and 10 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (encoding Renilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter) as an internal control. In some experiments, the cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of mouse VDR expression construct in pcDNA3.1. Ten hours later, the medium was removed and replaced with control medium or with medium containing D3 analog at final concentrations of between 10-12 and 10-8m with or without 10-7m dexamethasone. After an additional 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for reporter gene activity and Renilla luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Final results for each sample were recorded as Renilla adjusted relative light units. Data Analysis—All experiments were carried out a minimum of three times with consistent results. For all reporter assays, duplicate or triplicate samples for each condition were prepared, and final results are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical differences between individual experimental conditions were determined using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test with significance assigned to p < 0.05. Inhibited DC Expression of RelB by 1α,25-(OH)2D3Agonist Is a VDR-dependent Process—To determine whether 1α,25-(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of RelB in DCs is dependent on the physiologic receptor (VDR), BMDCs were generated from wild-type VDR and VDR-deficient mice in the absence or presence of an optimized concentration (23.Griffin M.D. Lutz W. Phan V.A. Bachman L.A. McKean D.J. Kumar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) of D3 analog and were immunofluorescently stained for RelB (Fig. 1). Cultures treated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone were also examined. Untreated day 7 BMDCs stained strongly for RelB, with many cells having intranuclear as well as cytoplasmic staining. A clear reduction in RelB immunofluorescence was induced by both D3 analog and dexamethasone in wild-type VDR BMDCs, but only by dexamethasone in VDR-deficient BMDCs. The results are consistent with a VDR-mediated inhibitory action of D3 analog on RelB expression. Human and Mouse relB Promoter Regions Contain Putative VDREs That Bind to the VDR·RXRα Complex—Genomic DNA sequences 5′ to the start codons of the human and mouse relB genes were examined for potential VDREs. With the canonical DR3 VDRE hexamer ((A/G)G(T/G)TCA) as a benchmark (18.Carlberg C. Polly P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), motifs consisting of two hexameric repeats conforming to an N(G/C)N(T/A)(G/C)(T/A) sequence and separated by three nucleotides were sought. Two such sequences were identified in the human relB promoter region (designated as human relB motif A (-799 to -785) and human relB motif B (-443 to -429)), and one was identified in the mouse promoter region (designated as the mouse relB motif (-602 to -588)). The positions and sequences of these motifs are illustrated in Fig. 2A. The sequences of the mutated motifs that were generated for use as controls in subsequent experiments are shown in Fig. 2B. The abilities of these three putative VDREs to complex with VDR and RXRα were tested in gel shift experiments (Fig. 3). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing human motifs A and B were found to complex with VDR and RXRα together, but not with either protein alone (Fig. 3A). The binding was competed in a dose-dependent fashion by non-radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the same sequence or the sequence of a positive regulatory VDRE from the mouse osteopontin promoter (26.Wu Y. Craig T.A. Lutz W.H. Kumar R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2654-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but not by oligonucleotides containing an AP-1-binding site. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides in which the putative VDREs were mutated demonstrated an absent or markedly reduced ability to complex with VDR and RXRα. Comparable results were obtained with oligonucleotides incorporating the mouse wild-type and mutant relB motifs (Fig. 3B). The relative affinity of the mouse motif for VDR and RXRα was compared with that of the human motifs and with the osteopontin VDRE in a competitive gel shift assay (Fig. 3C). The ability of human motifs A and B to compete with the radiolabeled mouse motif was less than that of the mouse motif itself, whereas the osteopontin VDRE competed more potently than any of the relB sequences. At a 10-fold excess of non-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, the mouse relB motif was associated with a 50% reduction in the density of the shifted band compared with 16, 30, and 93% for human motifs A and B and the osteopontin motif, respectively (Fig. 3C). We concluded that the identified sequences from the human and mouse relB promoter regions represent bona fide binding motifs for the VDR·RXRα complex, with the single mouse sequence having greater affinity than either of the two human sequences. Human and Mouse relB Promoter Activities Are Negatively Regulated by 1α,25-(OH)2D3Agonist in a Manner That Is Dependent on the Putative VDREs and That Is Enhanced by Increased VDR Expression—Promoter region sequences from the human and mouse relB genes, including the putative VDREs, were ligated into a luciferase-encoding plasmid and employed in reporter assays using the murine DC-derived cell line D2SC1 (24.Paglia P. Girolomoni G. Robbiati F. Granucci F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Detectable low level expression of VDR by this cell line was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels (data not shown). Constructs were also generated in which the putative VDRE motifs were mutated to sequences shown by gel shift to have little affinity for VDR·RXRα (Figs. 2B and 3). For the human construct, motifs A and B were mutated singly and together. Promoter activities for this panel of reporter constructs were measured in D2SC1 cells in the absence and presence of D3 analog and are expressed as the percent reduction associated with D3 analog treatment (Fig. 4, two similar experiments shown). Both human and mouse wild-type promoter activities were significantly inhibited by 1α,25-(OH)2D3 agonist. In >10 separate experiments, D3 analog treatment was associated with a consistent significant reduction in both human and mouse wild-type promoter activities that varied between 30 and 80%. In contrast, the human double mutant VDRE and mouse mutant VDRE promoters were minimally inhibited (0–10% in multiple experiments). The human single mutants were inhibited by D3 analog to a lesser degree than the human wild-type promoter, although the difference did not consistently reach statistical significance. The influence of VDR expression levels on inhibition of human and mouse relB promoter activities by D3 analog was next examined using the same reporter assay protocol with cotransfection of a plasmid encoding mouse VDR or an empty expression vector (Fig. 5). The concentration of D3 analog was titrated from 10-12 to 10-8m, and results were compared with untreated D2SC1 cells in the absence or presence of VDR overexpression. For both human and mouse relB promoters, the absolute promoter activity was significantly lower, and the percent reduction compared with that in untreated cells was greater at all concentrations of D3 analog for the VDR-overexpressing cells. For example, at the suboptimal concentration of 10-12m D3 analog, the percent reduction in promoter activity for cells overexpressing VDR was 40% for the human relB promoter and 45% for the mouse relB promoter compared with 25 and 9%, respectively, for cells not overexpressing VDR. At the optimal concentration of 10-10m, the equivalent results were 86 and 71% versus 68 and 43% (Fig. 5). In multiple reporter assay experiments, closely comparable results were obtained when 1α,25-(OH)2D3 was substituted for D3 analog (data not shown). The results clearly support the contention that the VDR·RXRα-binding motifs identified in the human and mouse relB promoters represent negative regulatory VDREs and are necessary for 1α,25-(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of RelB expression in DCs. Furthermore, the magnitude of 1α,25-(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of relB gene transcription in DCs is influenced by the expression level of VDR. Inhibition of the relB Promoter by 1α,25-(OH)2D3Agonist Is Independent of NF-κB-REs, but the Additive Effects of Glucocorticoid Are Mediated through NF-κB-REs—Transcriptional expression of the human relB gene is positively regulated by two NF-κB-REs (25.Bren G.D. Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Pennington K.N. Pobst L.J. Paya C.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7722-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As 1α,25-(OH)2D3 has been reported to interfere with NF-κB signaling (21.D'Ambrosio D. Cipitelli M. Cocciolo G. Mazzeo D. Di Lucia P. Lang R. Sinigaglia F. Panina-Bordignon P. J. Clin.

Cells were cotransfected with VDR along with the human wild-type relB reporter construct or wit"

https://openalex.org/W1977451682,"In previous studies we found that overexpression of the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, COX-2, in the brain exacerbated β-amyloid (Aβ) neuropathology in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. To explore the mechanism through which COX may influence Aβ amyloidosis, we used an adenoviral gene transfer system to study the effects of human (h)COX-1 and hCOX-2 isoform expression on Aβ peptide generation. We found that expression of hCOXs in human amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-APPswe) cells or human neuroglioma (H4-APP751) cells resulting in 10-25 nm prostaglandin (PG)-E2 concentration in the conditioned medium coincided with an ∼1.8-fold elevation of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) peptide generation and an ∼1.8-fold induction of the C-terminal fragment (CTF)-γ cleavage product of the APP, an index of γ-secretase activity. Treatment of APP-overexpressing cells with the non-selective COX inhibitor ibuprofen (1 μm, 48 h) or with the specific γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 significantly attenuated hCOX-1- and hCOX-2-mediated induction of Aβ peptide generation and CTF-γ cleavage product formation. Based on this evidence, we next tested the hypothesis that COX expression might promote Aβ peptide generation via a PG-E2-mediated mechanism. We found that exposure of CHO-APPswe or human embryonic kidney (HEK-APPswe) cells to PG-E2 (11-deoxy-PG-E2) at a concentration (10 nm) within the range of PG-E2 found in hCOX-expressing cells similarly promoted (∼1.8-fold) the generation of the CTF-γ cleavage product of APP and commensurate Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) peptide elevation. The study suggests that expression of COXs may influence Aβ peptide generation through mechanisms that involve PG-E2-mediated potentiation of γ-secretase activity, further supporting a role for COX-2 and COX-1 in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.

Moreover there is evidence that COX-1 expression is also elevated in the AD brain, raising the possibility that both COX-1 and COX-2 may contribute to AD neuropathology (21Yasojima K. Schwab C.

Thus, the characterization of COX activities and subsequent PG generation in the brain as well as their potential roles in amyloidosis is receiving a great deal of attention.Further studies implicating COX in neuronal dysfunction in vivo include work by Andreasson et al.

Moreover a recent study has shown that overexpression of human (h)COX-2 in neurons of PSAPP transgenic mice (a transgenic mouse model of AD expressing both mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and mutant presenilin-1 (A246E-PS1)) significantly potentiated amyloidogenic Aβ peptide generation and amyloid plaque deposition in the brain (27Xiang Z.

Aging. 2002; 23: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), indicating that conditions of elevated COX expression can promote neuronal dysfunction and amyloidosis in vivo.In this study, we continued to explore the role of COXs in AD amyloidogenesis by testing the hypothesis that COXs may directly influence Aβ peptide generation in vitro. We found that a mechanism through which COX may promote amyloidogenic generation of Aβ peptides might involve PG-E2-mediated promotion of γ-secretase activity. Understanding the apparent mechanistic relationship of COXs and Aβ generation is highly relevant to the successful development of COX inhibitors and other NSAID-based therapeutic strategies for AD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 Adenoviruses—hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 cDNA constructs (described previously by our laboratories (28Kelley K.A. Ho L. Winger D. Freire-Moar J. Borelli C.B. Aisen P.S. Pasinetti G.M. Am. J.

In brief, the full-length hCOX-1 cDNA was subcloned into the pShuttle vector cassette via MluI and ApaI, and the full-length hCOX-2 cDNA used for generation of hCOX-2 transgenic mice (28Kelley K.A. Ho L. Winger D. Freire-Moar J. Borelli C.B. Aisen P.S. Pasinetti G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pShuttle vector cassette via ApaI and XbaI. Both pShuttle/hCOX-1 and pShuttle/hCOX-2 were then transferred into the Adeno-X viral DNA via I-CeuI and PI-CseI sites; the identity of the hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 Adeno-X viral DNA was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (not shown). The recombinant viruses were then packaged by transfecting PacI-linearized recombinant viral DNA into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with the aid of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). HCOX-1 or hCOX-2 Adeno-X viral titer was determined by the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) method (29Nyberg-Hoffman C. Shabram P. Li W. Giroux D. Aguilar-Cordova E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This identical strategy was used to generate recombinant LacZ adenovirus (Clontech) expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Clontech), which served as a negative control.Cell Cultures and Treatments—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) carrying the K670N,M671L Swedish mutation (APPswe) (CHO-APPswe, a gift from Dr. Robakis) were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Invitrogen) and 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Human H4 neuroglioma cells with constitutive APP751 expression (H4-APP751, a gift from Dr. Buxbaum) were generated by stable transfection with pCMV-APP751 and pBABE (which confers resistance to puromycin). H4-APP751 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1μg/ml tetracycline, 200 μg/ml G418, 150 μg/ml hygromycin, and 1μg/ml puromycin. HEK cells carrying APPswe (HEK-APPswe, a gift of Dr. Brian M. Austen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Invitrogen) and 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen).For viral infection, CHO-APPswe or H4-APP751 cells were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Following 48 h of incubation, cultures (50% confluence) were infected with recombinant hCOX-1, hCOX-2, or LacZ adenovirus with doses of virus defined as 10 multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) (29Nyberg-Hoffman C. Shabram P. Li W. Giroux D. Aguilar-Cordova E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected 48 h postinfection for Aβ detection. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay of the cell lysate as described previously (30Mirjany M. Ho L. Pasinetti G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Ibuprofen and 11-deoxyprostaglandin E2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Harbor, MI) and L-685,458 (a gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, Terlings Park, Harlow, UK) were stored at -20 °C (in Me2SO). Disposable aliquots of Me2SO (final concentration, 0.01%) were also stored at -20 °C to mimic freeze-thaw conditions in vehicle-treated cultures. All cultures and reagents were demonstrated to be free of endotoxin (<10 pg/ml) by Limulus lysate assay (Sigma) (not shown).hCOX-1, hCOX-2, and APP Immunodetection—Following adenoviral infection and/or incubation with drugs for 48 h, conditioned media were collected, and tissue cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mm EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) on ice and stored at -20 °C. For immunoblot analysis, protein content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), samples were boiled and centrifuged, and proteins were resolved electrophoretically by SDS-PAGE (10%). Proteins were transferred to nylon Transblot membranes (Bio-Rad) and immunoreacted with appropriate antibody. In these studies immunoreactivities were visualized by fluorescence autoradiography using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection kit, Pierce).Polyclonal C8 antibody (raised against amino acids 676-695 of human APP, a gift from Dr. Selkoe) was used for detection of total human holo-APP. Monoclonal 22C11 antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) recognizing amino acids 60-100 of an N-terminal epitope of human APP was used to quantify total soluble (s)APP released into the conditioned medium of CHO-APPswe cells. Monoclonal 6E10 antibody (Senetek, St. Louis, MO) recognizing amino acids 1-17 of the Aβ domain of APP (a site that constitutes the C terminus of sAPP peptide) was used to quantify the level of sAPPα released into the conditioned medium.For detection of hCOX-2 (or hCOX-1) expression in transfected CHO-APPswe cells, specific antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl region of hCOX-2 or hCOX-1 sequence were used (Cayman Chemical). Specificities of hCOX-2 and hCOX-1 antibodies were reported previously by our laboratories (28Kelley K.A. Ho L. Winger D. Freire-Moar J. Borelli C.B. Aisen P.S. Pasinetti G.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and β-actin immunoreactivity (anti-β-actin, Sigma) was used to control for variations in gel loading.C-terminal Fragment (CTF)-γ Assay—In hCOX-2- or hCOX-1-infected cells, levels of CTF-γ cleavage product of APP were assessed from membrane preparations as described previously (31McLendon C.

In brief, cell monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice, scraped from tissue culture dishes, and centrifuged (1,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were then resuspended (0.5 ml/10-cm dish) in homogenization buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm potassium chloride, 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and homogenized by passing cell suspensions through a 23-gauge needle 10 times. Homogenates were then centrifuged (2,500 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant (membrane and postnuclear supernatant) was then centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and rinsed in homogenization buffer. Membranes were then resuspended in assay buffer (150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 1× Complete protease inhibitor) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 25 μl of incubation buffer/assay sample to allow for generation of the CTF-γ cleavage product; negative control samples were maintained on ice. CTF-γ cleavage products (as well as CTF-α and CTF-β) were resolved electrophoretically in 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad) and identified using the anti-APP polyclonal C8 antibody. Immunoreactivities were visualized autoradiographically using a chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal, Pierce).Aβ Peptide Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—For detection of Aβ peptide generation, conditioned media from CHO-APPswe cells were centrifuged (3,500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cellular debris. Aβ-(1-40) or Aβ-(1-42) was assessed by sandwich ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions (BioSource, Camarillo, CA).PG-E2Assay—PG-E2 content was assessed in the same conditioned medium used for Aβ peptide determinations using a commercially available ELISA (Cayman Chemical) as described previously (34Pompl P.N. Ho L. Bianchi M. McManus T. Qin W. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In brief, conditioned medium was applied to 96-well plates precoated with goat anti-mouse IgG and incubated (18 h at 4 °C) with PG-E2 monoclonal antibody and a recovery tracer. After incubation with PG-E2 monoclonal antibody, plates were rinsed fives times with washing buffer and developed (1 h at room temperature) using Ellman's reagent. Specific PG-E2 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and calculated by plotting (percentage of sample or standard bound/maximum bound) the protein standard versus PG-E2 concentration in pg/ml.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between means were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test. In all analyses, the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were performed using the Prism Stat program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTSAdenovirus-mediated hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 Delivery System—In control studies the dose-dependent adenoviral mediated expression of hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 at 10, 20, and 40 m.o.i. 48 h postinfection was confirmed in CHO-APPswe and H4-APP751 cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, a and b and d and e, respectively). No apparent endogenous COX-1 or COX-2 immunoreactivity was found in LacZ adenovirus-infected CHO-APPswe or H4-APP751 cells (Fig. 1, a and b); although endogenous expression of COX(s) in LacZ adenovirus-infected cells could also be detected at longer exposure time (not shown).The functional expression of hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 in CHO-APPswe (Fig. 1c) and H4-APP751 (Fig. 1f) cells was monitored by PG-E2 generation by ELISA. We found that hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 infection at 10 m.o.i. resulted in 10-25 nm PG-E2 in the conditioned medium, which is within the physiological concentration of PG-E2 described previously in the human brain (35Iwamoto N. Kobayashi K. Kosaka K. J. Neurol. 1989; 236: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently a virus titer of 10 m.o.i. was selectively utilized throughout this study to assess the role of hCOXs in Aβ peptide generation. In control adenoviral LacZ infection studies (using β-galactosidase staining as an indicator of adenoviral infection) we found that 10 m.o.i. resulted in 90% efficiency of infection with no apparent cytotoxicity as assessed by MTT assay 48 h postinfection (data not shown).hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 Infection of CHO-APPswe Cells Promotes Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) Generation—hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 adenoviral infection (10 m.o.i.) of CHO-APPswe (Fig. 2, a and b) or H4-APP751 (Fig. 2, c and d) cells resulted in ∼1.8-fold elevation of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) content in the conditioned medium relative to LacZ-infected cells 48 h postinfection. In parallel studies, MTT assay revealed no cell toxicity in hCOX-1, hCOX-2, or LacZ adenovirus-infected CHO-APPswe or H4-APP751 cell cultures 48 h postinfection at 10 m.o.i. (data not shown).Fig. 2hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 potentiate Aβ peptide generation in CHO-APPswe and H4-APP751 cells.a and b, hCOX-1 (a) and hCOX-2 (b) overexpression-mediated potentiation of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) generation in the conditioned medium from infected CHO-APPswe cells assessed by ELISA 48 h postinfection (10 m.o.i.). In c and d, the same parameters shown in a and b were derived from H4-APP751 cells. Results are expressed as a percentage of LacZ infection in the control group; values represent means ± S.E. of determinations made in three separate culture preparations; n = 3 per culture. *, p < 0.01 versus LacZ control group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 Promotes CTF-γ Generation in CHO-APPswe Cells That Is Prevented by COX Inhibition—Based on the evidence that both hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 expression promotes Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) generation, we next examined the influence of expression of hCOXs on APP processing by assessing the generation of CTF-γ APP cleavage product (known index of γ-secretase activity). For this study, fresh membranes from CHO-APPswe cells were isolated and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow generation of CTFs. Unlike other conventional assays, this in vitro γ-secretase assay detects enzymatic cleavage under physiologic conditions wherein CTF-γ is generated by cleavage of membrane-bound APP.In this experiment, we found that, compared with the LacZ control group, both hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 adenovirus infection in CHO-APPswe cells leads to a functional >3-fold induction of PG-E2 content in the conditioned medium (Fig. 3g). Elevation of PG-E2 content in the conditioned medium coincided with potentiation of the ∼6-kDa CTF-γ generation (Fig. 3, a and c, lanes 3 and 4, respectively, and b and d, relative to steady-state content of holo-APP) from fresh membrane preparations 48 h postinfection, strongly suggesting hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 overexpression leads to an induction of γ-secretase activity. Increased CTF-γ signal further coincided with significant elevation of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) content in the conditioned medium of these same cultures (Fig. 3, e and f, respectively). As expected, in control studies, no detectable CTF-γ cleavage product was detected in membrane preparations from either hCOX-1- (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 2) or hCOX-2 (Fig. 3c, lanes 1 and 2)-transfected CHO-APPswe cells kept on ice during the entire period of the reaction time.Fig. 3hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 promote CTF-γ generation in CHO-APPswe cells that is prevented by treatment with the non-selective COX inhibitor ibuprofen.a and c, immunoblot analysis of APP CTF-γ cleavage product generation from fresh membrane preparations of hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 adenovirus-infected CHO-APPswe cells in the absence or presence of co-treatment with ibuprofen 48 h postinfection (10 m.o.i.). No detectable changes in total holo-APP (105 kDa) or CTF-α and -β cleavage products (13- and 10-kDa cleavage products) were observed in either hCOX-1- or hCOX-2-transfected CHO-APPswe cells relative to LacZ controls. b and d, quantification of the CTF-γ fragment of APP (an index of γ-secretase activity) following hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 infection. In a and c, the induction of CTF-γ (lane 4 versus lane 3) following hCOX-1 and hCOX-2 infection was prevented by co-treatment of CHO-APPswe cultures with the non-selective COX inhibitor ibuprofen at 1 μm. e and f, ELISA-based quantification of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42), respectively. g, PG-E2 content following hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 adenoviral infection. In a and c, lack of incubation of purified CHO-APPswe membrane preparations (kept on ice versus 37 °C, 2 h) resulted in negative CTF-γ product formation as expected (lanes 1 and 2). In b and d-f, results are expressed as a percentage of LacZ infection in the control group. In g, changes in ibuprofen-treated groups are expressed as percentage of each respective condition in the vehicle-treated group. In b-g, values represent means ± S.E. of determinations made in three separate culture preparations; n = 3 per culture.

We found that hCOX-1- and hCOX-2-mediated promotion of the ∼6-kDa CTF-γ generation was prevented by co-treatment of CHO-APPswe cells with the non-selective COX inhibitor ibuprofen (Fig. 3, a and c, lane 4 versus lane 6, and b and d) at 1 μm, which coincided with the reduction of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) peptides (Fig. 3, e and f, respectively) and hCOX-1- and hCOX-2-mediated promotion of PG-E2 content (Fig. 3g) to LacZ levels as assessed by ELISA of the conditioned medium 48 h postinfection.No significant alteration of CTF-γ generation (Fig. 3, a and c, lane 3 versus lane 5, and b and d) or Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) peptide content (Fig. 3, e and f) was found in LacZ adenovirus-infected CHO-APPswe cells treated with 1 μm ibuprofen relative to vehicle-treated LacZ control CHO-APPswe cells. Moreover no detectable cell toxicity was found following ibuprofen treatment (1 μm) in either LacZ-, hCOX-1-, or hCOX-2-infected CHO-APPswe cultures as assessed by MTT assay (not shown). Finally in this assay no detectable change in total holo-APP (105 kDa) was observed in either hCOX-1 or hCOX-2 CHO-APPswe cells relative to LacZ adenovirus-transfected cells (Fig. 3, a and c, lane 3 versus lane 4) irrespective of ibuprofen treatment (Fig. 3, a and c, lane 5 versus lane 6) (quantification not shown).hCOX-1- and hCOX-2-mediated Induction of Aβ Peptide Generation Is Prevented by the γ-Secretase Inhibitor L-685,458—To further assess the specific role of hCOX-1- and hCOX-2-mediated induction of γ-secretase activity, in parallel studie"
https://openalex.org/W2086983623,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), the enzyme responsible for production of endothelial NO, is under tight and complex regulation. Proper cellular localization of eNOS is critical for optimal coupling of extracellular stimulation with NO production. In addition, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 interacts with eNOS and positively regulates eNOS activity. Hsp90 is modulated by physical interaction with its co-chaperones. CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is such a co-chaperone that remodels the Hsp90 heterocomplex and causes protein degradation of some Hsp90 substrates through the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity of CHIP. Here we show that CHIP incorporated into the eNOS·Hsp90 complex and specifically decreased soluble eNOS levels in transiently transfected COS cells. Surprisingly, in contrast to the effects of the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which induces eNOS ubiquitylation and its subsequent protein degradation, CHIP did not target eNOS for ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation. Instead, CHIP partitioned soluble eNOS into an insoluble and inactive cellular compartment, presumably through its co-chaperone activity. This effect seems to be due to displacement of eNOS from the Golgi apparatus, which is otherwise required for trafficking of eNOS to the plasmalemma and subsequent activation. Consistent with observations from overexpression studies, eNOS localization to the membrane and activity were increased in mouse lung endothelial cells lacking CHIP. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel co-chaperone-dependent mechanism through which eNOS trafficking is regulated and suggest a potentially generalized role for CHIP in protein trafficking through the Golgi compartment.

Three NOS isoforms exist in mammalian cells, neuronal (nNOS; NOS1), inducible (iNOS; NOS2), and endothelial (eNOS; NOS3), named after the cell types in which they were originally discovered. All NOS isoforms have similar primary structures, including an oxygenase domain at the N terminus, a reductase domain at the C terminus, and a hinge calmodulin domain in between. eNOS is unique among the NOS isoforms in that it is dually acylated by myristate and palmitate. Cysteine palmitoylation is necessary for targeting of eNOS to the specific plasmalemmal microdomain, caveolae (1.Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Correct subcellular trafficking and localization to the plasmalemma is necessary for eNOS function. eNOS produces NO (and/or other reactive nitrogen species) in vascular endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes in response to a variety of agonists and mechanical stimuli (i.e. shear) (3.Garcia-Cardena G.

The 90-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90) are one of the most abundant proteins in cells, accounting for 1-2% of cytosolic protein. Hsp90 is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone with essential roles in stress tolerance and protein folding. Most of its known substrates are signaling proteins, including steroid receptors, some transcription factors (aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Sim, MyoD1, etc.), and a variety of tyrosine kinases (ErbB-2, Src, insulin receptor, focal adhesion kinase, etc.) and serine/threonine kinases (Raf, Cdk4, MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase), etc.) (reviewed in Ref. 7.Richter K.

Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is physically associated with eNOS in resting endothelial cells. Activation of endothelial cells by vascular endothelial growth factor, histamine, fluid shear stress, and estrogen enhances the interaction between eNOS and Hsp90 and increases eNOS activity. The mechanism of this activation is presently unclear. Hsp90 may act as an allosteric activator of eNOS (3.Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

Hsp90 associates with nNOS and chaperones its maturation (13.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol.

Whether similar effects are involved in eNOS regulation remains to be determined, although both proteins have similar structure. In vivo, Hsp90 is not functional unless associated in heterocomplexes with a range of accessory proteins. The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing proteins are one major group of Hsp90 partner proteins. Various TPR proteins compete for binding to a TPR acceptor site at the C terminus of Hsp90 and thus regulate the chaperone function of Hsp90. CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is a recently identified Hsp90 cofactor (15.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). CHIP interacts with Hsp90 through its N-terminal TPR domain and stimulates protein degradation of the following Hsp90 substrates: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR), and ErbB-2 (15.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 16.Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M.

Moreover, CHIP-induced protein degradation is not simply a consequence of interference with chaperone function, as is thought to be the case for the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA). CHIP contains a U-box domain at its C terminus and directly targets diverse chaperone substrates to the ubiquitin-proteasome system through its ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity (18.Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 19.Jiang J. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In this way, CHIP shifts the balance from protein folding to protein degradation during protein quality control, although, at the present time, the range of substrates for CHIP ubiquitination activity is not known. Although CHIP is a ubiquitous protein, its high level expression in heart and endothelial cells (21.Ballinger C.A. Connell P.M. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) suggests that CHIP may interact with proteins that play important roles in cardiovascular function. In this study, we sought to determine whether the effects of CHIP on Hsp90 substrates such as GR and ErbB-2 could be generalized to the Hsp90 substrate eNOS in consideration of eNOS modulation by Hsp90 and its significant role in the cardiovascular system. Instead, we found that CHIP elicited partitioning of eNOS to the insoluble compartment and impaired trafficking through the Golgi apparatus, indicating a novel chaperone-dependent mechanism for regulation of eNOS activity. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (19.Jiang J. J. Biol.

Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed with the Ad-Easy system, and cultures were routinely infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence were performed as described previously (15.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Mouse lung endothelial cells were isolated from CHIP-/- or wild-type mice. 2Q. Dai and C. Patterson, submitted for publication. Lungs from mice were finely minced and incubated in 0.1% collagenase for1hat37 °C. Cells were further homogenized by passage through a 14-guage needle and sieved to remove undigested material. Isolated cells were washed and then incubated with rat anti-mouse ICAM-2 (intercellular adhesion molecule-2) antibody coupled to magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal, Inc.). After magnetic selection, cells were plated in tissue culture flasks and cultured as described previously (22.Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol.

The endothelial phenotype of isolated cells was confirmed by staining for PECAM (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule). Antibodies and Chemicals—The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: mouse anti-eNOS (clone H32; BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.), mouse anti-iNOS and rabbit anti-nNOS (Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-ubiquitin (Babco), mouse anti-Hsp90 and mouse anti-Hsc/Hsp70 (Stressgen Biotech Corp.), mouse anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-CHIP (21.Ballinger C.A.

Mouse anti-Hsp90 (3G3), mouse anti-eNOS, and mouse anti-Myc antibody-agarose conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation. GA was purchased from Calbiochem and used at 2 μm. The proteasome inhibitors MG132, lactacystin, and proteasome inhibitor I were purchased from Calbiochem and used as indicated. nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose was from QIAGEN Inc. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Transfected COS cells were harvested 36-48 h after transfection and lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) (23.Garcia-Cardena G.

Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). In some experiments, proteins in the pellets were recovered by resuspension of pellets in the lysis buffer and sonication. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (19.Jiang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). For some immunoprecipitations, 20 mm sodium molybdate was added in the lysis buffer to stabilize the interaction between Hsp90 and its substrate eNOS. Immunoprecipitated proteins or cell lysates were mixed with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (2 μg) was prepared as described previously (21.Ballinger C.A. Connell P.M. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). eNOS and 18 S cDNAs were labeled with 32P by random priming and used to hybridize filters. Filters were autoradiographed. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Reactions—Bacterially expressed eNOS (0.25 μg) was incubated in reactions containing 0.1 μm purified rabbit ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) (Calbiochem), 8 μm UBCH5a, 4 μm CHIP, 2.5 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), and 5 mm ATP in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 2 h at 30 °C. In some reactions, 2 μm Hsp70 and 4 μm Hdj1 or Hdj2 were included. Reactions were stopped with SDS loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. For ubiquitylation of in vitro translated eNOS, eNOS was transcribed and translated with the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Following translation, 35S-labeled eNOS was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-eNOS antibody, and the immunocomplex was immobilized on anti-mouse IgG-agarose conjugate. The washed immobilized complex was used as a substrate in ubiquitin conjugation reactions. Reactions were stopped with SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. Ni-NTA-Agarose Conjugate Pull-down Assay—His-tagged proteins were precipitated following a previously described method (24.Honda K. Mihara H. Kato Y. Yamaguchi A. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Furukawa K. Urano T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2812-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) as modified. Briefly, 45 h after transfection, COS cells were treated with 2.5 μm MG132 for 2.5 h and lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), and 10 mm imidazole)/100-mm dish. Lysates were passed through a 26-gauge needle to reduce viscosity and then mixed on a rotator with 15 μl (settled volume) of Ni-NTA-agarose/250 μg of lysates for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, twice with 1 ml of buffer A diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 20 mm imidazole (1:4), and twice with 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 1× SDS sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm EDTA and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Cellular Fractionation—Transfected or primary culture cells were lysed in Tris/Triton extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, and 10 mm EGTA (pH 8.0)) (25.Kuppuswamy D.

The supernatant from this low speed centrifugation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 60 Ti rotor. The supernatant from this centrifugation was considered the cytosol, and the insoluble pellet was considered the membrane fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Tris/Triton extraction buffer and sonicated until fully dissolved. Fractions were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and immunoblot analysis was performed. NOS Activity Assay—NOS activity from transiently transfected COS cell lysates or mouse lung endothelial cells was measured by the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline with the NOS activity kit from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Briefly, COS cells were transfected as described above and harvested 48 h after transfection. The cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors and pelleted at 16,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Both supernatant and pellets were used for eNOS activity determinations (25-50 μg of protein/reaction). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by an unpaired Student's t test. Detergent-soluble eNOS Protein Levels Are Decreased by CHIP in Transfected COS Cells—To test the hypothesis that CHIP regulates eNOS through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism, we first examined whether CHIP has effects on eNOS expression in COS cells. COS cells are a good system for this purpose because previous studies have shown that exogenously expressed eNOS in COS cells behaves similarly to endogenous eNOS with respect to intracellular trafficking and activation (3.Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). COS cells (which do not express NOS) were cotransfected with eNOS and CHIP, and the expression of eNOS protein was measured by Western blotting. Detergent-soluble eNOS levels in both cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were markedly reduced in cells overexpressing CHIP (Fig. 1A), whereas eNOS mRNA expression was not altered (Fig. 1B). The effects of CHIP were dose-dependent; with increasing amounts of CHIP, eNOS levels decreased further (Fig. 1C). Kinetics of Detergent-soluble eNOS Stability Is Altered by CHIP—Having shown previously that CHIP targets chaperone substrates for ubiquitylation and rapid degradation in vivo (15.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 16.Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 18.Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we examined whether the stability of eNOS is altered in the presence of increased levels of CHIP using pulse-chase experiments. We cotransfected eNOS with or without CHIP, pulse-labeled the cells with [35S]methionine, and harvested at different time points. The detergent-soluble fraction of the lysate was immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing eNOS. At time 0, similar levels of eNOS were present in control cells and in cells that overexpressed CHIP. An increased rate of eNOS disappearance was observed in cells that overexpressed CHIP (Fig. 1D), suggesting either that CHIP induced an accelerated rate of eNOS degradation or that CHIP caused eNOS redistribution into a detergent-insoluble pool. Effect of CHIP on eNOS Expression Is Hsp90-dependent—To determine whether CHIP elicits its effect through Hsp90-dependent mechanisms, we overexpressed Hsp90 in transfected cells. These studies were designed to test whether an increase in the cellular ratio of Hsp90 to CHIP would be able to rescue eNOS expression, as should be the case if this event is mediated through interactions between CHIP and eNOS·Hsp90 complexes. Cotransfection of Hsp90 with CHIP blocked the ability of CHIP to decrease eNOS levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). In addition, we compared the effects of CHIP with those of GA, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, on eNOS levels. Both CHIP and GA caused similar decreases in eNOS protein levels (Fig. 2A), whereas CHIP increased nNOS levels and GA decreased nNOS levels (Fig. 2B). Having shown previously that CHIP interacts with the TPR acceptor site of Hsp90 through the CHIP N-terminal TPR domain (15.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we examined the requirement of this domain for CHIP action. Deletion of the TPR domain (ΔTPR) markedly reduced the effects of CHIP on eNOS (Fig. 3, left panel), suggesting that the effects of CHIP are TPR domain- and most likely Hsp90-dependent. Several lines of evidence suggested to us that decreased eNOS expression by CHIP is likely mediated through its inhibition of Hsp90 function: 1) increasing Hsp90 overcomes the effect of CHIP, and 2) CHIP action is dependent on its ability to interact with Hsp90 (i.e. it is TPR domain-dependent).Fig. 3Effects of CHIP require both the TPR and U-box domains of CHIP, and CHIP shows different effects on different NOS isoforms. COS-7 cells were transfected with eNOS (left panels), iNOS (middle panels), or nNOS (right panels) expression plasmids with or without the wild type or deletion mutants lacking the TPR (residues 1-145; ΔTPR) or U-box (residues 196-303; ΔU) domain of CHIP. Western blots (WB) were probed with antibodies to the respective NOSs (upper panels), to CHIP (middle panels), or to endogenously expressed β-actin (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the specificity of this effect, we examined the activity of CHIP on other NOS isoforms. The effects of CHIP on soluble eNOS and iNOS levels were similar (Fig. 3). In contrast, we noticed a consistent increase in nNOS protein levels in cells overexpressing CHIP (Fig. 3, right panel), the consequence and mechanisms of which are unclear at present. We found as well that endogenous β-actin expression was unaffected by CHIP (Fig. 3). Together, these data demonstrate a surprising specificity of the effects of CHIP on NOS isoforms. We therefore explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of CHIP on steady-state eNOS levels in more detail. CHIP Interacts with eNOS and Hsp90 —Previous studies have shown that Hsp90 interacts with eNOS and activates eNOS activity (3.Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). If CHIP directly modulates eNOS expression through the chaperone activity of Hsp90, then we should be able to detect stable interactions between CHIP and eNOS. We examined interactions between these proteins by co-immunoprecipitation in COS cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged CHIP (which enabled us to measure only ectopically expressed CHIP) and eNOS and harvested cells with a buffer containing molybdate (which mimics nucleotide binding and stabilizes the association of Hsp90 and its client proteins (27.Hutchison K.A. Stancato L.F. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13952-13957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Although eNOS levels were decreased in CHIP-expressing cells, CHIP was still present in a stable complex with eNOS and Hsp90 (Fig. 4, A and B). These data indicate the likely formation of a ternary complex containing these three proteins. Binding domains of eNOS and Hsp90 have recently been mapped to the oxygenase domain of eNOS and the M domain of Hsp90 (which is far away from the C-terminal CHIP-binding site) (8.Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To further characterize the spatial arrangement among these three proteins, we conducted the same experiment with a molybdate-free buffer. Association of Hsp90 and its substrate eNOS could not be detected with the molybdate-free buffer. Although the interaction between eNOS and CHIP was abrogated, Hsp90 could still bind CHIP (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the association of CHIP and eNOS is probably not direct"

Pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed this interaction and showed that it is dependent on the PDZ domain of GIPC and the C-terminal tetrapeptide of the hLHR. To characterize the functional consequences of the GIPC-hLHR interaction, we used a small interfering RNA against GIPC to generate a clonal cell line that is deficient in GIPC. Studies with this cell line reveal that GIPC is partially responsible for the recycling of the hormone that is internalized by the hLHR and also for maintaining a relatively constant level of hLHR at the cell surface during hormone internalization.

G protein-coupled receptor lutropin receptor human choriogonadotropin rat human glutathione S-transferase human choriogonadotropin small interfering RNA fluorescein isothiocyanate wild type. We have taken advantage of the high degree of amino acid sequence homology and divergent post-endocytotic fates of the rat (r) and human (h) lutropin receptor (LHR) to identify motifs present in the C-terminal tail of the LHR that are involved in the sorting of one of the internalized LHR ligands (i.e. human choriogonadotropin (hCG)) to a recycling or a degradation pathway (11.Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 12.Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on these findings we hypothesized the following: (a) the hCG internalized by the hLHR is sorted to a recycling pathway by virtue of the ability of the hLHR to bind to intracellular proteins(s) that promote recycling; (b) that the interaction of the hLHR with these putative proteins is mediated by one or more of the recycling motifs identified previously; and (c) that the hCG internalized by the rLHR is sorted to a degradation pathway because the rLHR lacks these motifs. Because these putative sorting motifs are located in the extreme C-terminal tail of the hLHR but absent in the corresponding region of the rLHR, we sought to identify these putative proteins by using these regions of the hLHR and rLHR as “bait” in a differential yeast two-hybrid screen of a 293 cell library (the cell line where all trafficking experiments have been conducted). The studies presented here describe the identification of a ubiquitous protein that binds to the hLHR and is involved in the post-endocytotic trafficking of the internalized hCG and in maintaining the levels of cell surface hLHR during endocytosis of the bound hormone. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The Matchmaker™ two-hybrid system 2 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was used according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. By using PCR-based strategies, we subcloned the C-terminal 42 residues of the hLHR (i.e. residues 657-699) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pAS2-1 vector to generate a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. This plasmid was used as bait to screen a human kidney 293 cells cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector to generate fusion products with the GAL4 activation domain. This library was also purchased from Clontech. Plasmids and Cells—Full-length cDNAs encoding for the hLHR and rLHR (14.Minegishi T. Nakamura K. Takakura Y. Miyamoto K. Hasegawa Y. Ibuki Y.

The preparation and characterization of myc-rLHR-wt- (in pcDNAI/Neo) and myc-hLHR-wt (in pcDNA 3.1)-modified forms of the LHR containing the Myc epitope at the N terminus have also been described (16.Fabritz J.

The different mutants of the rLHR and hLHR used here were constructed by standard PCR strategies using the myc-rLHR-wt or myc-hLHR-wt as templates. An expression vector (pFLAG-CMV from Sigma) coding for an N-terminal FLAG-tagged version of human GIPC (18.Liu T.F. Kandala G. Setaluri V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35768-35777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. V. Setaluri (Wake Forest University). A bacterial expression vector (pGEX-3X) coding for a GST fusion protein of the full-length EBP50 (19.Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J.

A bacterial expression vector coding for a GST fusion protein of human GIPC was prepared by amplifying the full-length GIPC sequence from the FLAG-GIPC vector described above followed by subcloning into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pGEX-5x1 vector. The GST fusion protein of human GIPC lacking its PDZ domain (designated GIPC(ΔPDZ)) was prepared by deletion of the nucleotides coding for amino acid residues 125-225. This was done by standard PCR strategies using the full-length GIPC GST fusion construct described above as a template. GST fusion proteins were prepared as described elsewhere (19.Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol.

An oligonucleotide corresponding to inverted copies of nucleotides 240-260 (AAGGAGCTGTATGGCAAGATT) of the human GIPC mRNA separated by a 6-nucleotide spacer (GAGTACTG) and containing SalI and XbaI sites was synthesized commercially and subcloned into the SalI and XbaI sites of the pSupressor2 vector from Imgenex® according to their instructions. This siRNA expression vector was then used to transfect 293 cells (see below) to prepare a clonal line of GIPC-deficient 293 cells (see below). Human kidney 293T cells are a derivative of 293 cells that express the SV40T antigen (21.Margolskee R. McHenry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) and were provided to us by Dr. Marlene Hosey (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 10% newborn calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.4, and used for all the transient transfection assays. Cells were plated in gelatin-coated 35-mm wells and transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA, using the calcium phosphate methods of Chen and Okayama (22.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar), when 70-80% confluent. After an overnight incubation with the transfection mixture, the cells were washed and used 24 h later. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1573). They were maintained and transfected as described above, but they were used only to obtain clonal lines of stably transfected cells expressing the GIPC siRNA vector described above or a control vector that confers G418 resistance. Clonal lines of transfected cells were obtained by selection with 700 μg/ml G418 as described elsewhere (23.Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The desired lines were selected based on the expression of endogenous GIPC as measured by Western blots using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GIPC (18.Liu T.F. Kandala G. Setaluri V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35768-35777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) kindly provide to us by Dr. V. Setaluri of Wake Forest University. GST Pull-down Assays—The interactions between the Myc-tagged forms of the LHR and mutants thereof with GIPC, EBP50, and derivatives were determined by measuring the ability of detergent lysates prepared from transiently transfected cells to bind to the indicated GST fusion proteins. Lysates of cells expressing the Myc-tagged LHR constructs were prepared and partially purified on a wheat germ agglutinin-agarose column as described elsewhere (16.Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24.Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that the lysis buffer contained 1% Nonidet P-40 and 60 mm octyl glucoside. Aliquots of lysates containing equivalent amounts of receptors were incubated with 25 μg of the appropriate GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose and washed as described previously (19.Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the resin at 37 °C for 30 min followed by vigorous vortexing for 15 min at room temperature. The eluted samples were resolved on SDS gels and electrophoretically blotted as described elsewhere (24.Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using a monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (9E10) followed by a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The complexes were directly visualized in the blots by using a combination of the Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity system of detection (Pierce) and a Kodak digital imaging system. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—These assays were done using a co-transfection/cross-linking/co-immunoprecipitation approach recently developed in this laboratory (25.Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26.Kishi H. Krishnamurthy H. Galet C. Bhaskaran R.S. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2003; 204: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected cells were stabilized by cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate). The transfected myc-hLHR or FLAG-GIPC was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (9E10) or a monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope (M2) and resolved on SDS gels. The gels were electrophoretically blotted, and the blots were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2) or anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibodies covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase as described elsewhere (25.Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26.Kishi H. Krishnamurthy H. Galet C. Bhaskaran R.S. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

The complexes were directly visualized using a combination of the Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity system of detection (Pierce) and a Kodak digital imaging system. Fate of the Internalized hCG—Transiently transfected cells were allowed to internalize 125I-hCG during a 2-h incubation at 37 °C with a saturating concentration of hormone (52 nm). After washing to remove the free hormone, the surface-bound 125I-hCG was released by a brief exposure of the cells to an isotonic pH 3 buffer (12.Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1624-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28.Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Bhaskaran R.S. Hirakawa T. Ascoli M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 204: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This was defined as t = 0, and the cells (which now contain only internalized 125I-hCG) were incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C in medium containing an excess of non-radioactive hCG (4 μg/ml). These conditions facilitate the detection of the recycled hormone by preventing the reassociation of the recycled and released hCG with the receptor (30.Krishnamurthy H. Kishi H. Shi M. Galet C. Bhaskaran R.S. Hirakawa T. Ascoli M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 204: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At the end of this second incubation the medium was saved, and the cells were washed with cold medium. They were then briefly exposed again to the isotonic pH 3 buffer to release and measure any of the internalized hormone that had recycled back to the surface. The acid-stripped cells were solubilized with NaOH to measure residual radioactivity that remained internalized. Finally, the saved medium was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to determine the amount of degraded and undegraded 125I-hCG released (12.Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1624-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28.Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Down-regulation of the Cell Surface LHR—293T cells transiently transfected with the myc-hLHR-wt or mutants thereof were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4), pH 8, and then biotinylated for 30 min at room temperature by incubation with a freshly prepared solution (0.5 mg/ml) of sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, (Pierce) as described before (17.Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After biotinylation, the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES and 10% newborn calf serum and incubated for 5 min in the same medium to quench the excess unreacted biotin. Cells were then washed once with cold assay medium (Waymouth's MB752/1 supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.4). Some cells were saved on ice and processed immediately (t = 0 samples), whereas others were incubated in 1 ml of warm assay medium containing 52 nm hCG for 6 h at 37 °C. At the indicated times, the cells were placed on ice and lysed as described before (17.Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The receptors were immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 antibody (17.Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (31.Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The blots were revealed using streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The complexes were finally visualized and quantitated using the Super Signal West FEMTO Maximum Sensitivity system of detection from Pierce and a Kodak digital imaging system as described elsewhere (17.Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This image capture system is set up to alert us when image saturation occurs and to prevent us from measuring the intensity of such images. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy experiments were accomplished as described recently (13.Galet C. Min L. Narayanan R. Kishi M. Weigel N.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25.Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were plated in eight-chamber coverslip culture vessels coated with polylysine (Biocoat from BD Biosciences). They were transfected (in a total volume of 400 μl) with 100 ng of the expression vector for the myc-hLHR-wt or cotransfected with 100 ng of the expression vector for the myc-hLHR-wt and 10 ng of the expression vector for the FLAG-GIPC. Two days after the transfection the myc-hLHR was visualized by incubating the cells for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) diluted 1/100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the endogenous or transfected GIPC were visualized using the polyclonal GIPC antibody diluted 1/500 in the same buffer. After washing three times, the cells were incubated for another hour at room temperature with a 1/100 dilution of Cy™5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or with a 1/2000 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Finally, the cells were washed three or four times, dried, and mounted as described previously (13.Galet C. Min L. Narayanan R. Kishi M. Weigel N.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25.Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Cy™5-labeled receptors and the FITC-labeled GIPC were visualized with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope at the Central Microscopy Facility of the University of Iowa. An oil 60× objective was used, and the iris opening was 2 to 2.2 for each color filter. Hormones and Supplies—Purified hCG (CR-127, ∼13,000 units/mg) was purchased from Dr. A. Parlow of the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of the NIDDK. Recombinant human hCG was kindly provided by Ares Serono. Partially purified hCG (∼3,000 units/mg) was purchased from Sigma, and it was used only to correct for nonspecific binding. 125I-hCG was prepared as described previously (32.Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning Glass and Invitrogen, respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from commonly used suppliers. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Screening of ∼107 independent colonies of a human 293 cell library with a fragment corresponding to the last 42 residues of the C-terminal tail of the hLHR resulted in the identification of 13 positive clones. Four of these clones coded for regions of human GIPC (33.De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34.Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that overlap extensively with the single PDZ domain of this protein (Fig. 1). Because clone 4 coded only for the PDZ domain of GIPC, these data suggest that the interaction of the hLHR and GIPC occurs through the PDZ domain of GIPC. Structural Determinants That Influence the Formation of the GIPC·hLHR Complex—The association of GIPC with the hLHR was next documented in vitro using extracts of 293T cells transiently transfected with the myc-hLHR-wt or mutants thereof and a GST fusion protein of the full-length human GIPC. As expected, lysates of 293T cells expressing the myc-hLHR-wt reveal the presence of 85- and 68-kDa bands (Fig. 2A) that represent the mature cell surface receptor and its immature intracellular precursor, respectively (11.Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). With the exception of hLHR-E698A, which was expressed only as the 68-kDa precursor, all other mutants tested were expressed as the 85- and 68-kDa bands, and their levels of expression were similar to that of the hLHR-wt (Fig. 2A). 2The reasons for the inability of the hLHR-E698A to be processed properly were not investigated.Fig. 2B shows that the hLHR-wt can bind to GST-GIPC. A C-terminal truncation that deletes the C-terminal Cys699 or progressive truncations that delete the C-terminal tetrapeptide (YTEC) of the hLHR greatly inhibit or completely abolish the formation of the hLHR·GIPC complex. The importance of each of these four residues was also documented by alanine-scanning mutagenesis performed in the context of the full-length hLHR. As shown in Fig. 2B, the individual mutation of each of these four residues also inhibited or abolished the formation of the hLHR·GIPC complex. Fig. 3B confirms the initial observations made with the yeast two-hybrid screen by showing that deletion of the PDZ domain of GIPC (residues 125-225, see Fig. 1) abolishes the formation of the hLHR·GIPC complex. Because we (12.Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1624-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have previously noted a weak interaction between the hLHR-wt and EBP50, another PDZ-domain containing protein (35.Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), we also tested the binding of the hLHR-wt and hLHR-t695 to a GST-EBP50 fusion protein. The results presented in Fig. 3B with the hLHR-wt recapitulate the data published previously (12.Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1624-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Those obtained with hLHR-t695 show that the hLHR/EBP50 interaction also involves one or more of the last four residues of the hLHR. Fig. 4 also confirms and expands the initial observations made with the yeast two-hybrid screen by showing that GST-GIPC does not bind the rLHR-wt, a homologous protein that terminates in an ALTH sequence rather than the YTEC sequence present in the hLHR (see Fig. 4A). This figure also shows that grafting the C-terminal YTEC tetrapeptide of the hLHR into the rLHR induces the binding of the rLHR to GIPC but not to EBP50. In contrast, grafting the C-terminal tetrapeptide (DSLL) of the β2-adrenergic receptor to the rLHR promotes the binding of the rLHR to EBP50 as shown previously (12.Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1624-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but does not promote the binding of the rLHR to GIPC (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data show that the GIPC/hLHR interaction involves binding of the C-terminal tetrapeptide of the hLHR to the single (type I) PDZ domain of GIPC. Moreover, the results obtained with EBP50 suggest that the hLHR may also interact weakly with other proteins that have type I PDZ domains. Association of the hLHR and GIPC in Transfected Cells—The association of the hLHR and GIPC was next documented in 293T cells transiently co-transfected with the myc-hLHR-wt and FLAG-GIPC. Immunoprecipitation of the myc-hLHR-wt followed by immunoblotting for FLAG-GIPC readily showed the formation of an hLHR·GIPC complex (Fig. 5, left panel). The data presented in the middle panel of Fig. 5 also show that the detection of this complex can be enhanced if the complex is stabilized by cross-linking the cells prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation of the receptor. Because the association of GST-GIPC with the hLHR was abolished by truncation of the hLHR at position 695 (see Figs. 2 and 3), we also tested for the presence of GIPC in receptor immunoprecipitates of cells co-transfected with the myc-hLHR-t695 and FLAG-GIPC. In agreement with the GST pull-down assays, these intact cell experiments revealed that the myc-hLHR-t695 does not associate with FLAG-GIPC (Fig. 5, right panel). In a complementary set of experiments, we co-transfected 293T cells with the myc-hLHR-wt and FLAG-GIPC and incubated them with or without a saturating concentration of agonist (hCG). The cells were then cross-linked, and the receptor or GIPC was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies, and the complementary binding partner was detected in each of the immunoprecipitates. These data (Fig. 6A) revealed that the formation of the GIPC·hLHR complex occurs independently of agonist stimulation. In four independent experiments, the ratio of GIPC to hLHR present in the immunoprecipitates was 0.78 ± 0.03 and 0.72 ± 0.13 (mean ± S.E.) in the control and hCG treated cells, respectively. The results summarized in Fig. 6B also show that GIPC binds to the mature cell surface LHR as well as its immature intracellular precursor. This latter conclusion is based on the finding that the 85- and 68-kDa species of the hLHR can be detected in FLAG-GIPC immunoprecipitates. The association of the transfected myc-hLHR-wt with endogenous GIPC was also documented by probing for the presence of endogenous GIPC in immunoprecipitates of 293T cells transfected with the myc-hLHR. These data show that endogenous GIPC co-immunoprecipitates with the transfected myc-hLHR-wt but not with the transfected myc-hLHR-t695 (Fig. 7). Examination of 293T cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 8) revealed that the endogenous or transfected"

Greater than 70% of the homocysteine in plasma is disulfide-bonded to protein cysteine residues. The identity and functional consequences of protein homocysteinylation are just now emerging. The amyloidogenic protein transthyretin (prealbumin), as we now report, undergoes homocysteinylation at its single cysteine residue (Cys10) both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, when human plasma or highly purified transthyretin was incubated with 35S-l-homocysteine followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImaging, two bands corresponding to transthyretin dimer and tetramer were observed. Treatment of the labeled samples with β-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE removed the disulfide-bound homocysteine. Transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–homocysteine was then identified in vivo in plasma from normal donors, patients with end-stage renal disease, and homocystinurics by immunoprecipitation and high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry. The ratios of transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–homocysteine and transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–sulfonate to that of unmodified transthyretin increased with increasing homocysteine plasma concentrations, whereas the ratio of transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–cysteine to that of unmodified transthyretin decreased. The hyperhomocysteinemic burden is thus reflected in the plasma levels of transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–homocysteine, which in turn may contribute to the pathological consequences of amyloid disease.

Most of the homocysteine in circulation (>70% of tHcy) is disulfide-linked to albumin and other plasma proteins (9.Refsum H. Helland S. Ueland P.M. Clin.

The remaining free homocysteine is found as low molecular weight disulfide forms such as homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide (12.Büdy B. Sengupta S. DiBello P.M. Kinter M. Jacobsen D.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Less than 1% of tHcy is found as free, reduced (i.e. –SH) form (13.Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Protein-homocystamide (homocysteine-N-protein), the reaction product formed between a protein lysine residue and homocysteine thiolactone, is also found in circulation (14.Jakubowski H. J. Biol.

The functional consequences of protein homocysteinylation are beginning to emerge. For example, in vitro studies have shown that homocysteinylation of the Cys9 residue of annexin II, the endothelial cell surface docking protein for tissue plasminogen activator, inhibits the binding (15.Hajjar K.A.

Homocysteinylation appears to activate latent elastolytic metalloproteinase pro-MMP-2 by disulfide bond formation with the “cysteine switch” on the propeptide (18.Bescond A. Augier T. Chareyre C. Garçon D. Hornebeck W. Charpiot P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that homocysteine binds to the fibrin-binding domain of plasma fibronectin in vitro and inhibits its ability to bind fibrin (19.Majors A.K. Sengupta S. Willard B. Kinter M.T. Pyeritz R.E. Jacobsen D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together, these in vitro studies suggest that post-translational modification of proteins by homocysteine may have important functional consequences. Transthyretin (prealbumin) is a 13.8-kDa protein that is synthesized predominantly in the liver and secreted into plasma. As a homotetramer transthyretin binds and transports the hormone thyroxine and the retinol-binding protein-retinal complex (20.Rostom A.A. Sunde M. Richardson S.J. Schreiber G. Jarvis S. Bateman R. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proteins. 1998; 2: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transthyretin has been implicated in the formation of amyloid deposits in familial transthyretin amyloidosis and senile systemic amyloidosis (21.Falk R.H. Comenzo R.L. Skinner M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 22.Benson M.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. Vol. 4. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 5345-5378Google Scholar). Familial transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disorder involving the deposition of transthyretin as amyloid fibrils in tissues and organs. The deposits may contain wild type transthyretin, transthyretin variants, and/or their fragments. Variant tetrameric transthyretin is destabilized by certain amino acid substitutions, which form self-associating amyloidogenic intermediates and amyloid fibrils that deposit in tissues and organs (23.Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 24.Schormann N. Murrell J.R. Benson M.D. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin.

Senile systemic amyloidosis is a nonhereditary disorder that affects about 25% of individuals over 80 years old (26.Cornwell G.G. Murdoch W.L. Kyle R.A. Westermark P. Pitkänen P. Am. J. Med. 1983; 75: 618-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Here the amyloid fibrils and deposits are usually made up of wild type transthyretin and/or its fragments, which are found mainly in the heart. Monomeric transthyretin has a single cysteine residue at position 10. In the normally folded tetrameric protein, the Cys10 residues are in exposed sites at the start of the helical regions. Because the Cys10 residue of transthyretin can conjugate with cysteine and other sulfur-containing ligands (27.Théberge R. Conners L. Skinner M. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28.Kishikawa M. Nakanishi T. Miyazaki A. Shimizu A. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Investig. 1999; 6: 48-53PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that it could be homocysteinylated and, with increasing homocysteine burden, stable transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–homocysteine might become the predominant form of circulating transthyretin. In vitro as well as in vivo evidence in support of this hypothesis is now reported. β2-Microglobulin is found in amyloid deposits of patients with end-stage renal disease who are on dialysis. It too is a potential candidate for homocysteinylation because this 11.8-kDa protein has a β-sandwich structure stabilized by a singe cross-sheet disulfide bond formed by Cys25 and Cys80 (29.Verdone G. Corrazza A. Viglino P. Pettirossi F. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Andreola A. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Esposito G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It theoretically could be homocysteinylated in a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction by homocysteine thiolate anion. Moreover, nearly all dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease have elevated levels of β2-microglobulin (30.Gorevic P.D. Casey T.T. Stone W.J. DiRaimondo C.R. Prelli F.C. Frangione B. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 2425-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and hyperhomocysteinemia (31.Robinson K. Gupta A. Dennis V. Arheart K. Chaudhary D. Green R. Vigo P. Mayer E.L. Selhub J. Kutner M. Jacobsen D.W. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to determine whether β2-microglobulin might be another carrier of homocysteine in human plasma. Materials—35S-l-Homocysteine thiolactone was synthesized from l-[35S]methionine by a slight modification of the method of Mudd et al. (32.Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Irreverre F. Laster L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4382-4392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 35S-l-Homocysteine (500 μm final concentration; specific activity 50 μCi/μmol) was prepared from 35S-l-homocysteine thiolactone (33.Duerre J.A. Miller C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 17: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The thiol content of l-homocysteine was determined using Ellman's reagent (34.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21618) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted with fresh preparations of l-homocysteine and 35S-l-homocysteine. Purified human transthyretin was obtained from Lee Scientific (St. Louis, MO), and purified β2-microglobulin was obtained from Sigma. Human plasma was obtained from healthy donors, subjects with chronic renal failure, and subjects with homocystinuria using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. All other reagents and solvents of analytical grade or better were obtained from Sigma. In Vitro Binding of 35S-l-Homocysteine to Human Plasma Proteins, Purified Transthyretin, and Purified β2-Microglobulin—35S-l-Homocysteine (500 μm final concentration) was incubated with 50% human plasma in 0.050 m TES buffer at pH 7.4, or with purified human transthyretin (1 mg/ml in 0.050 m TES buffer, pH 7.4), or with purified human β2-microglobulin (1 mg/ml in 0.050 m TES buffer, pH 7.4) for 5 h at 37 °C. Plasma proteins, transthyretin, and β2-microglobulin were then precipitated with 1.5 m perchloric acid, washed three times with 1.5 m perchloric acid, and dissolved in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.062 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). To one-half of each sample, 3 μl of β-mercaptoethanol was added, and the sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min to reduce disulfide bonds. Aliquots of the β-mercaptoethanol-treated and untreated samples were applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the electrophoresis was carried out according to standard protocol (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager to identify 35S-labeled proteins. Binding of l-Homocysteine to Transthyretin—l-Homocysteine (500 μm final concentration) was added to purified transthyretin (180 μm final concentration) in 0.050 m TES buffer, pH 7.4, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a shaking water bath. Aliquots were withdrawn after 30 min and added directly to tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1.5 m perchloric acid to precipitate the transthyretin. The tubes were vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The protein pellet was washed 3 times with perchloric acid and was solubilized in Tris-HCl (0.50 m, pH 8.5). The concentrations of S-cysteinylated and S-homocysteinylated transthyretin were determined as described previously (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Isolation and Purification of Transthyretin from Human Serum— Transthyretin was immunoprecipitated from human serum as described previously (36.Kishikawa M. Nakanishi T. Miyazaki A. Shimizu A. Nakazato M. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of serum was treated with 80 μl of goat anti-human transthyretin antiserum (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN) for 12 h at 37 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed three times with 100 μl of water, dried in a Speedvac concentrator, and then stored at –80 °C. The transthyretin-antibody immunoprecipitate pellets were thawed, dissolved in 80:10:10 (v/v/v) water/acetonitrile/acetic acid, and passed through a Millipore Microcon YM-100 centrifugal filter (100,000 molecular weight cut-off) to remove the antibody. The filtrate was then applied to an analytical Vydac C-4 HPLC column (25 × 0.46 cm, 5-μm particle size) and eluted at 0.75 ml/min over 30 min using a gradient of 40–85% acetonitrile. Transthyretin and its Cys10 conjugates eluted between 52 and 54% acetonitrile. The solvent mixture was removed from the protein using a Speedvac concentrator. Mass Spectrometry of Transthyretin and Transthyretin-Cys10 Conjugates—The masses of the intact transthyretin-related components were determined using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). Briefly, each HPLC-purified transthyretin sample was dissolved in 60 μl of 50:50:0.01 methanol/water/formic acid (ESI buffer). A 5-μl aliquot was taken and diluted in the ESI buffer; 3 μl of this transthyretin solution was nanosprayed (37.Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) into an Applied Biosystems/MDS-SCIEX QSTAR Pulsar i ESI quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The capillary potential was increased slowly from 0 up to 1.2 kV until a stable ion current was observed. The declustering potential was held at 35 V. The instrument was calibrated using the [M + 2H]2+ ion (m/z 879.9704) and [M + 4H]4+ ion (m/z 440.4892) of porcine renin substrate tetradecapeptide. After calibration, this instrument was capable of achieving ∼10 ppm mass accuracy with a minimum resolution of 1:9000 (full-width half-maximal). The relative abundance of the transthyretin-related components was determined using the abundance at the apex of each peak shown in the deconvoluted ESI mass spectra. Determination of tHcy—tHcy was determined as described previously (38.Jacobsen D.W. Gatautis V.J. Green R. Robinson K. Savon S.R. Secic M. Ji J. Otto J.M. Taylor Jr., L.M. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasma samples were reduced with sodium borohydride to liberate free reduced homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and glutathione. These reduced products were then derivatized with monobromobimane. The protein was removed by perchloric acid precipitation and centrifugation. The thiol-bimane adducts were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected fluorometrically (38.Jacobsen D.W. Gatautis V.J. Green R. Robinson K. Savon S.R. Secic M. Ji J. Otto J.M. Taylor Jr., L.M. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to determine whether homocysteine forms disulfide conjugates with the amyloid proteins transthyretin and β2-microglobulin under in vitro conditions and, more importantly, in vivo. Human plasma from healthy donors and purified transthyretin were incubated with 35S-l-homocysteine for 5 h at 37 °C. The samples, before and after treatment with β-mercaptoethanol, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImaging. As shown in Fig. 1, lane 1, incubation of normal human plasma with 35S-l-homocysteine produced faint bands corresponding to the transthyretin dimer (27.5 kDa) and tetramer (55 kDa). The heavily labeled band in lane 1 is albumin, which forms a disulfide bond with homocysteine (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When purified human transthyretin was incubated with 35S-l-homocysteine (Fig. 1, lane 2), labeling was found primarily on the dimeric form of transthyretin. Treatment of the plasma or purified transthyretin sample with β-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE analysis resulted in the removal of homocysteine from transthyretin (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the homocysteine was indeed disulfide-linked to the protein. These in vitro experiments provide strong evidence that l-homocysteine readily reacts with Cys10, the only cysteine residue found in transthyretin. In contrast, when human plasma from healthy donors and purified β2-microglobulin were incubated with 35S-l-homocysteine for 5 h at 37 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by PhosphorImaging, no bands corresponding to homocysteinylated β2-microglobulin were visualized, suggesting that homocysteine does not react with the single disulfide bond of the molecule (data not shown). Our attention was then focused on transthyretin alone. Human plasma from a healthy donor was treated with increasing concentrations of l-homocysteine (0–500 μm)for 5 h at 37 °C. Plasma transthyretin was then immunoprecipitated and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The masses of the transthyretin-related components were determined using ESI MS. The deconvoluted ESI mass spectra of immunoprecipitated transthyretin and purified by HPLC from the plasma of a healthy individual without and with the addition of 500 μm homocysteine is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The ESI mass spectrum of the transthyretin sample in the absence of homocysteine (Fig. 2A) showed peaks corresponding to the unmodified transthyretin molecule (mass = 13,761 Da) and the Cys10 adducts for S-sulfonate (TTR-Cys10—S–SO3H, mass = 13,841 Da), S-cysteine (TTR-Cys10–S–S–Cys, mass = 13,880 Da) S-cysteinylglycine (TTR-Cys10–S–S—CysGly, mass = 13,937 Da), and S-glutathione (TTR-Cys10–S–SG, mass = 14,067 Da). S-Homocysteine of transthyretin (TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy, mass = 13,894) was detected as a minor component. In contrast, the ESI mass spectrum of the transthyretin sample in the presence of 500 μm homocysteine (Fig. 2B) displayed a major peak corresponding to TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy, in addition to peaks corresponding to the transthyretin-related components seen in Fig. 2A. These ESI mass spectra were analyzed to determine the relative abundance of the TTR-Cys10–S–S–Cys and TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy adducts to that of the unmodified transthyretin molecule. These ratios were plotted as a function of l-homocysteine concentration in the in vitro dose-response study (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3A, the ratio of the relative abundance of TTR-Cys10–S–S–Cys to that of unmodified transthyretin decreased from 1.71 in normal plasma (0 μm exogenous homocysteine) to 1.09 in the presence of 50 μm exogenous homocysteine. The ratio then increased up to 1.21 when 250 μm homocysteine was added. The ratio then substantially increased when the transthyretin was incubated with 500 μm homocysteine (Fig. 3A). This substantial increase is attributed to the increase in the concentration of free cysteine in plasma due to the interaction of homocysteine with albumin-Cys34–S–S–Cys (S-cysteine albumin), wherein albumin-Cys34–S–S–Hcy is formed releasing free cysteine in a two-step process (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ratio of TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy to that of the unmodified transthyretin remained essentially unaltered up to 50 μm added homocysteine (Fig. 3B). The ratio then increased, albeit not substantially, up to 250 μm homocysteine. Like TTR-Cys10–S–S–Cys (Fig. 3A), the ratio of the TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy to that of the unmodified transthyretin substantially increased at 500 μm homocysteine (Fig. 3B). However, the ratios of the TTR-Cys10–S–SO3H, TTR-Cys10–S–S—CysGly, and TTR-Cys10–S–S–G to that of the unmodified TTR remained relatively constant over the entire concentration range of l-homocysteine (data not shown). We had reported earlier (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that during the reaction of homocysteine with human serum albumin, homocysteine strips the cysteine attached to Cys34 of albumin (albumin-Cys34–S–S–Cys), resulting in the formation of albumin thiolate anion and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide in the first step of the reaction. To determine whether a similar reaction is involved here, we incubated 500 μm homocysteine with 180 μm purified transthyretin and found that after 30 min, homocysteine had stripped almost all of the cysteine from TTR-Cys10–S–S–Cys (Fig. 4). During the same time period, only 10 μm of TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy was formed, indicating that homocysteine attacks the S-cysteine sulfur on TTR-Cys10–S–S–Cys, resulting in the formation of TTR-Cys10-S– thiolate anion and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide. These observations are similar to those reported by us previously (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) for the reaction of homocysteine with albumin. All the results clearly suggest that homocysteine readily forms a disulfide conjugate with transthyretin in vitro. Next, we wanted to determine whether transthyretin is a carrier of homocysteine in vivo. Transthyretin from plasma of healthy individuals and patients with hyperhomocysteinemia due to chronic renal failure or homocystinuria was immunoprecipitated, HPLC-purified, and subjected to the same analysis as those used in the in vitro studies. Representative ESI deconvoluted mass spectra of the transthyretin isolated from the plasma of a patient with end-stage renal disease (tHcy = 20.7 μm) and a homocystinuric patient (tHcy = 434 μm) are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. In the plasma from the patient with end-stage renal disease, the transthyretin existed predominantly as in S-cysteine form (Fig. 5A). Only a small amount of the S-homocysteine transthyretin was detected (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the majority of the transthyretin isolated from the plasma of the homocystinuric patient was S-sulfonate (Fig. 5B). Additionally, the S-homocysteine transthyretin was now a major adduct, whereas the amount of the S-cysteine transthyretin was greatly reduced (Fig. 5B). Like the results obtained for the in vitro studies, the ratios of the relative abundance of the S-sulfonate, S-cysteine, and S-homocysteine adducts of the transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin molecule were plotted as function of l-homocysteine concentration (Fig. 6). The ratio of the relative abundance of the S-sulfonate transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin increased with increasing concentrations of plasma homocysteine and plateaued at about 200 μm homocysteine (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the ratio of the S-cysteine transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin from the hyperhomocysteinemic patients decreased up to ∼200 μm plasma homocysteine and then increased (Fig. 6B). However, the ratio of the S-homocysteine transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin increased initially to a small extent and then there was a substantial increase after the 200 μm plasma homocysteine concentration (Fig. 6C). Overall, the ratio of Cys10-conjugated transthyretin to Cys10-free transthyretin increased linearly as the concentration of tHcy increased (Fig. 6D). These studies show that l-homocysteine reacts with transthyretin in human plasma to form a stable covalent adduct both in vitro and in vivo. Transthyretin is the third plasma protein, after albumin (9.Refsum H. Helland S. Ueland P.M. Clin. Chem. 1985; 31: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 10.Togawa T. Sengupta S. Chen H.

Because transthyretin contains only one cysteine residue (Cys10), the homocysteine adduct must be TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy. Earlier reports (27.Théberge R. Conners L. Skinner M. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28.Kishikawa M. Nakanishi T. Miyazaki A. Shimizu A. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin.

Investig. 1999; 6: 183-186PubMed Google Scholar) have identified other transthyretin-Cys10 adducts as S-sulfonate, S-cysteine, S-cysteinylglycine, and S-glutathione. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of S-homocysteine transthyretin in normal human serum. The relatively low abundance of S-homocysteine transthyretin in normal human serum probably explains why it was not detected in earlier studies. It should be noted that while this work was under review, Sass et al. (40.Sass J.O. Nakanishi T. Sato T. Sperl W. Shimizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also identified TTR-Cys10–S–S–Hcy in the plasma and serum from hyper-homocysteinemic individuals. Our in vitro studies show that homocysteine displaces cysteine from TTR-Cys10–S–S–cysteine (Fig. 4) to form homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide (Hcy–S–S–Cys) and transthyretin thiolate anion (TTR-Cys10-S–) (Reaction 1),Hcy-S-+TTR-Cys10-S-S-Cys→TTR-Cys10-S-+Hcy-S-S-CysReaction 1 which is consistent with our studies on the interaction of homocysteine with albumin-Cys34–S–S–cysteine (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol.

(About one-third of the albumin molecules in normal plasma are cysteinylated at Cys34 (42.Peters Jr., T. All About Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 51Google Scholar).) When normal human plasma was treated with increasing concentrations of l-homocysteine, the ratio of the relative abundance of S-homocysteine transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin remained relatively constant up to 50 μm added l-homocysteine. This was followed by a small increase in the ratio up to about 200 μm added l-homocysteine. However, at higher concentrations of added homocysteine (>250 μm), the formation of S-homocysteine transthyretin increased substantially (Fig. 3B). This phenomenon can be explained if we consider that, in plasma, albumin is the most abundant protein, accounting for ∼50–60% of total plasma proteins. We propose that transthyretin thiolate anion and the albumin thiolate anion competitively attack the low molecular weight disulfides homocysteinecysteine mixed disulfide or homocystine. Because the concentration of albumin is about 100 times greater than that of transthyretin in plasma, homocysteinylation of albumin would be the predominant reaction. However, the in vivo binding capacity of plasma albumin for homocysteine is ∼150–200 μm (43.Mansoor M.A. Ueland P.M. Aarsland A. Svardal A.M. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1481-1485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 44.Wiley V.C. Dudman N.P.B. Wilcken D.E.L. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 191-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We determined that the in vitro binding capacity of plasma albumin for homocysteine was similar (10.Togawa T. Sengupta S. Chen H. Robinson K. Nonevski I. Majors A.K. Jacobsen D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T.

Therefore, when the binding capacity of albumin for homocysteine is reached, homocysteine will then react with transthyretin. This explains the substantial increase in the formation of S-homocysteine transthyretin when exogenously added homocysteine exceeds 200 μm. The in vivo study results are similar. The in vivo ratio of the relative abundance of S-homocysteine transthyretin to that of unmodified transthyretin increased to a small extent with increasing concentrations of tHcy (Fig. 6C). However, at homocysteine concentrations >200 μm, the ratio increased dramatically. In contrast, the ratio of the relative abundance of the S-cysteine transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin decreased initially and then increased at higher homocysteine concentrations (Fig. 6B). Based on these results, we propose that homocysteine, upon entering circulation, preferentially strips cysteine from both albumin-Cys34–S–S–Cys and transthyretin-Cys10–S–S–Cys forming the respective protein thiolate anions and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide. The protein thiolate anions then react with the mixed disulfide to form the respective S-homocysteine protein adducts and cysteine thiolate anion (Reaction 2).Protein-S-+Hcy-S-S-Cys→Protein-S-S-Hcy+Cys-S-Reaction 2 Because the pKa of cysteine (∼8.3) is at least an order of magnitude lower than the pKa of Hcy (∼9.5) (45.Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5877-5881Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar), the cysteine thiolate anion would be much more stable and the preferred leaving group at neutral pH as we found for the albumin reaction (11.Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The in vivo ratio of the relative abundance of the S-sulfonate transthyretin (TTR-Cys10—S–SO3H) to that of the unmodified transthyretin also increased with increasing homocysteine concentrations until it plateaued at about 200 μm added homocysteine (Fig. 6A). The in vitro ratio of the relative abundance of the S-sulfonate transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin remained essentially unchanged on addition of exogenous homocysteine (data not shown). Why the concentration of the S-sulfonate transthyretin increases in hyperhomocysteinemic patients is unknown. It is possible that the flux of cysteine through the catabolic pathway leading to cysteine sulfinic acid and then sulfite may increase in homocystinurics. Enhanced cysteine flux may be due to the reaction between homocysteine and S-cysteine albumin followed by the reaction of albumin thiolate anion with homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide (Reaction 2). The sulfite formed as a result of enhanced cysteine catabolism in homocystinurics could then react with transthyretin and/or its S-conjugated forms to produce S-sulfonate transthyretin. The formation of S-sulfonate albumin and S-sulfonate fibronectin has been reported previously (46.Gregory R.E. Gunnison A.F. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1984; 49: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in rabbit plasma. Irrespective of the underlying mechanism, the formation of S-sulfonate transthyretin may have pathophysiological consequences. Transthyretin forms amyloid fibrils under weakly acidic conditions (pH 4.0 to 4.5) (23.Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Kishikawa et al. (39.Kishikawa M. Nakanishi T. Miyazaki A. Shimizu A. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Investig. 1999; 6: 183-186PubMed Google Scholar) reported that S-sulfonation enhanced the amyloidogenicity of transthyretin. The formation of transthyretin fibrils was studied with three different preparations: unmodified transthyretin (with thiol compounds attached to Cys10 and containing ∼20% S-sulfonated transthyretin), dithiothreitol-treated transthyretin (with a free sulfhydryl group at Cys10), and transthyretin conjugated with sulfite (S-sulfonate transthyretin). At pH 4.0 there was a 3-fold enhancement of fibril formation with S-sulfonate transthyretin compared with unmodified transthyretin, whereas reduced transthyretin had very low capacity to form fibrils. These results show that sulfonation of Cys10 of transthyretin might increase the fibril forming capacity of transthyretin, which could lead to a more rapid progression of familial transthyretin amyloidosis or senile systemic amyloidosis. Interestingly, a higher percentage of S-conjugated transthyretin to the unmodified transthyretin has been reported in patients with symptomatic amyloid disease (47.Suhr O.B. Svendsen I.H. Ohlsson P. Lendoire J. Trigo P. Tashima K. Ranlov P.J. Ando Y. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Investig. 1999; 6: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our studies show that the amyloid protein transthyretin can undergo homocysteinylation in human plasma. In contrast, the amyloid protein β2-microglobulin, although it has a single disulfide bond that could be targeted by homocysteine thiolate anion, is not homocysteinylated under the same in vitro reaction conditions used to homocysteinylate transthyretin. The reason that β2-microglobulin is resistant to homocysteinylation is probably due to the buried nature of the disulfide bond in the native protein (48.Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ratio of the relative abundance of the S-homocysteine transthyretin to that of the unmodified transthyretin increases with increasing tHcy concentrations. Thus, homocysteinylated transthyretin is a novel indicator of plasma homocysteine burden in hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. It remains to be determined whether post-translational modification of transthyretin by homocysteine plays a role in its pathogenicity in amyloidosis and other diseases."

The cellbinding component of anthrax toxin, protective antigen, mediates entry of the toxin into cells by first binding directly to the extracellular integrin-like inserted (I) domain of the cellular anthrax toxin receptor, ATR. Here we report that this interaction requires an intact metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the receptor as well as the presence of specific divalent cations. Also, we demonstrate that the toxin-receptor interaction is critically dependent on the Asp-683 carboxylate group of protective antigen, which projects from the receptor binding surface.

EF is an adenylate cyclase that disrupts water homeostasis and impairs immune function in the host (1.Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 2.O'Brien J. Friedlander A. Dreier T. Ezzell J. Leppla S. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 306-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LF is a Zn2+-dependent metalloproteinase that cleaves members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family of protein kinases and disrupts signal transduction pathways (3.Duesbery N.S.

PA binds EF and LF to target cells and transports these catalytic subunits into the host cell cytosol where they carry out their enzymatic functions. A cellular receptor that binds PA was identified as anthrax toxin receptor (ATR), a protein encoded by the tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM8) gene (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Recently, a second cellular receptor for PA was identified as the human capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) (8.Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PA binds directly to the extracellular integrin-like inserted (I) domains present in ATR and CMG2 (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 8.Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of PA to the ATR I domain is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, as EDTA was able to disrupt this interaction (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar).Nine of the 18 integrin α-subunits contain I domains, and when present, these conserved domains constitute major ligand-binding sites in the integrins. In addition, integrin I domains contain a conserved MIDAS motif, defined by the amino acid sequence DXSXS... T..D (where X is any amino acid), which functions to promote ligand binding through coordination of a divalent metal ion, usually Mg2+ or Mn2+ (9.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 10.Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Physiological I domain ligands interact directly with the MIDAS-coordinated metal, explaining the strict metal dependence reported for these integrin-ligand interactions (10.Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The ATR I domain also contains a conserved MIDAS motif that we hypothesized may play a role in the metal-dependent binding of PA. In this study we identify amino acids in the MIDAS motif of ATR, a carboxylate group in PA, and specific divalent cations that are important for PA-receptor interaction. These data suggest that anthrax toxin binds ATR in a manner that is similar to the binding interactions described for integrin I domains and their natural ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction and Expression of ATR Variants—QuikChange™ mutagenesis was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) to introduce the D50A and T118A mutations into the full-length ATR cDNA (TEM8 splice variant 2) (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 5′-GTACTTCATTTTGGCTAAATCAGGAAGTGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCAGGAGGAGACGCCTACATGCATGAAGG-3′, and their complements respectively. ATR-, ATR(D50A)-, and ATR(T118A)-EGFP were generated by PCR amplification of the ATR coding region followed by subcloning into the SalI and BamHI sites of pLEGFP-N1 (Clontech).ATR-mycHis was generated by PCR amplification of the 5′ fragment of ATR corresponding to amino acids 1-229 and subcloning this fragment between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1/mycHis(-)A (Clontech). The D50A and T118A mutants of this construct were generated using QuikChange™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) with oligonucleotides 5′-ACTTCATTTTGGCCAAATCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCAGGAGGAGACGCCTACATGCATGAAGG-3′, and their complements, respectively. The resulting constructs were transiently transfected into 293 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation or 293 Freestyle cells using 293fectin (Invitrogen), and proteins were isolated from the culture media by purification over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and dialysis against Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). All PCR inserts and genes mutated by QuikChange™ were sequenced and shown to contain no additional mutations.Based on the sequence of the ATR I domain, the wild type and mutant ATR-mycHis proteins are predicted to contain a single N-linked glycosylation site and have a protein mass of ∼29 kDa. To verify that the ATR-mycHis proteins were of the expected size, 3 μg of purified wild type or mutant ATR-mycHis was incubated with peptide N-glycosidase F (500 units), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5) in 30 μl for 4 h at 25 °C. In addition, protein folding was probed by adding trypsin (3194 units/mg) to final concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5 μg/μl. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 60 min and were stopped by adding reducing SDS sample buffer and heating to 100 °C for 10 min followed by separation on 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and images collected using a MultiImage system (Alpha Innotech).PA Mutant Proteins—The plasmid pET22b-PA was mutated by QuikChange™ mutagenesis according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides 5′-GAAATTGAAGATACTCAAGGGCTTAAAGAAG-3′, 5′-CTGAAGGGCTTAAACAAGTTATAAATGACAG, 5′-CTTAAAGAAGTTATAAATAACAGATATGATATGTTG-3′, and 5′-GATTTTAAAAAATATAATAATAAATTACCGTTATATATAAG-3′ and their complements were used to construct PA-E648Q, PA-E654Q, PAD658N, and PA-D683N, respectively. The PA genes in these constructs were sequenced and contained no additional mutations. Wild type and mutant PA proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (11.Wesche J. Elliott J.L. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Transduction of CHO-R1.1 Cells with Retroviral Vectors—Wild type and mutant forms of ATR were stably introduced into CHO-R1.1 cells via transduction with retroviral vectors. Pseudotyped retroviruses encoding ATR fusion proteins were generated by transfecting 293 cells with 15 μg of pMD.GagPol (murine leukemia virus structural genes), 5 μg of pMD.G (G-spike envelope protein from vesicular stomatitis virus), and 20 μg of pLEGFP-N1 encoding ATR, ATR(D50A), or ATR(T118A) (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Infections were performed by adding retroviruses to CHO-R1.1 cell cultures in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene.ATR-PA Binding Assays—ELISAs were performed by binding 0.3 μg of PA83 (ListLabs) in TBS to each well of a 96-well plate (Maxisorp, Nalge Nunc). Purified ATR-mycHis proteins were then added in a range of concentrations in the presence of absence of specified cations in TBS supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin as a blocking agent. Binding of ATR-mycHis proteins was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against the His6 tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal ELISA Pico substrate, Pierce).ATR-EGFP-expressing cells were tested for their ability to support PA binding in a previously described flow cytometric analysis involving the sequential addition of PA, anti-PA rabbit serum, and a secondary antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (Molecular Probes) (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The level of fusion protein expression was assessed by EGFP-associated fluorescence and the amount of PA binding by allophycocyanin-associated fluorescence.GST pull-down assays were performed by mixing 5 μg of GST-D4, GST-D4(D683N), or GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and bound to 0.1 μg purified ATR-mycHis in the presence of TBS with 1 mm MnCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The complexes as well as 0.1 μg of ATR-mycHis were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Biotinylation—An equal number of CHO-R1.1 cells overexpressing wild type, D50A, or T118A forms of ATR-EGFP were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 5 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 20 mm glycine, and cells were washed three times in PBS with 20 mm glycine and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science)). Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and an equivalent amount of protein (0.1 mg) from each supernatant was subjected to precipitation with avidin-agarose (Pierce). The beads were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) and then an anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.).Cell Killing Assays—PA proteins were mixed in increasing concentrations with a constant amount of LFN-DTA and incubated with CHO or RAW 264.7 cells on 96-well plates. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, cell viability was measured using the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's protocol or by staining with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min. The crystal violet was solubilized in ethanol, and the optical density at 595 nm was measured.RESULTSA Role for the ATR MIDAS Motif in Toxin Binding—To address the role of the ATR MIDAS motif in PA binding, we first used an ELISA to test the requirement for specific metal ions in the toxin-receptor interaction. The wells of a microtiter plate were coated with purified PA followed by incubation with an epitope-tagged version of the ATR I domain (ATR-mycHis) in the presence or absence of defined divalent cations. Binding of PA to ATR-mycHis was supported by either Mn2+ or Mg2+, with Mn2+ supporting optimal binding among the metals tested (Fig. 1A). Consistent with other MIDAS-dependent integrin-ligand interactions (10.Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12.Leitinger B. McDowall A. Stanley P. Hogg N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Ca2+ was not able to support toxin-receptor binding (Fig. 1A). PA-ATR binding was dependent on the concentration of Mg2+ or Mn2+, whereas Ca2+ neither supported toxin binding nor inhibited Mn2+-dependent toxin binding at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mm (data not shown).To directly test the role of the ATR MIDAS in toxin binding, the first conserved residue of this motif, an aspartate residue at amino acid 50, was changed to alanine (D50A). Similar amino acid substitutions were previously shown to disrupt metal coordination and ligand binding in integrins with MIDAS-containing I domains (13.Michishita M. Videm V.

The D50A mutation was introduced into ATR-mycHis, and this change was sufficient to abrogate binding to PA in an ELISA (Fig. 1B). Consistent with mutational analysis of α integrin I domains, the D50A mutation did not cause gross misfolding of the ATR I domain, as determined by limited proteolysis experiments (Fig. 1C).Integrin I domains can adopt multiple conformations that differ in their affinities for ligands (17.Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A.

The conserved MIDAS threonine makes a direct contact to the coordinated metal in the “open” or high affinity conformation but not in the “closed” or low affinity conformation. Whereas the ATR(D50A) mutation is predicted to disrupt metal coordination and block all metal-dependent ATR interactions, mutation of the MIDAS threonine (Thr-118 in ATR) is predicted to lock the I domain into a closed conformation, blocking only those MIDAS-dependent interactions that require an open conformation (18.Leitinger B. Hogg N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 614-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19.Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consistent with a direct role for the ATR MIDAS in PA binding, engineering the T118A mutation into the ATR-mycHis protein disrupts toxin-receptor interaction as measured by ELISA (Fig. 1B). As with the D50A mutant form of ATR-mycHis, the ATR(T118A)-mycHis protein displayed a tryptic digest pattern similar to wild type ATR-mycHis, indicating that this mutation does not cause gross misfolding (Fig. 1C).To test the ability of MIDAS-mutant forms of ATR to serve as a functional PA-binding receptors on cells, the D50A and T118A mutations were engineered into an ATR-enhanced green fluorescent protein (ATR-EGFP) gene fusion, and the resulting proteins were expressed in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-R1.1) that lack anthrax toxin receptors (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The resulting cell lines were tested for their ability to support toxin binding in a flow cytometry based assay. Wild type ATREGFP-expressing cells bound PA and displayed a linear relationship between the amount of receptor expressed and the amount of PA bound (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ATR(D50A)-EGFP-expressing cells were unable to support detectable PA binding, whereas ATR(T118A)-EGFP-expressing cells displayed an impaired ability to support PA binding in this assay (Fig 2A), indicating that an intact MIDAS is necessary for efficient toxin binding. Cell surface biotinylation demonstrated that all forms of ATR-EGFP were expressed at similar levels on the cell surface (Fig. 2B), excluding the possibility that gross misfolding or improper subcellular localization account for the decreased toxin binding to ATR(D50A)-EGFP or ATR(T118A)EGFP-expressing cells (20.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 21.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin.

Cells were then incubated with PA followed by anti-PA serum and an allophycocyanin-conjugated secondary antibody. The level of fusion protein expression was assessed by EGFP-associated fluorescence and the amount of PA binding was determined by measuring allophycocyanin-associated fluorescence. B, the cell lines described above were treated with a membrane impermeable biotinylation reagent then lysed. Biotinylated proteins were isolated using avidin-agarose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody. C, CHO-R1.1 cells (circles) and CHO-R1.1 cells expressing wild type (triangles), D50A (diamonds), or T118A (squares) forms of ATR-EGFP were treated with 2 × 10-9m LFN-DTA and an increasing amount of PA in growth media. Cell viability was determined 24 h later using the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science) and compared with the viability of cells that received LFN-DTA only (100% viable).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, we tested whether the D50A and T118A mutations disrupt the ability of ATR to support intoxication. CHO-R1.1 cells expressing wild type or MIDAS mutant forms of ATREGFP were tested for their ability to internalize a potent anthrax toxin-based fusion toxin comprising PA and the amino terminus of LF fused to the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin (LFN-DTA) (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 22.Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Whereas CHO-R1.1 cells expressing wild type ATR were effectively killed by this toxin, cells expressing ATR(D50A) were completely resistant to toxin killing, and cells expressing ATR(T118A) were 100-1000 times less sensitive to toxin than those expressing wild type ATR (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that disruption of the MIDAS motif diminishes toxin receptor function. Interestingly, ATR(T118A) retains a low level of receptor activity as seen with cell binding and intoxication assays (Fig. 2, A and C), consistent with this mutation inducing a closed conformation with reduced affinity for PA.An Aspartate Residue in PA Is Critical for Receptor Binding—Having shown a requirement for divalent cations and for the ATR MIDAS motif in toxin binding, we next addressed how PA contributes to the interaction with its receptor. Proteins that bind preferentially to the open conformation of MIDAS-containing I domains have conserved glutamate or aspartate residues that contribute to binding by completing the coordination of the MIDAS metal by virtue of their carboxylate side chains (9.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 17.Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R.

Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To explore whether PA mimics a natural I domain ligand, we searched the crystal structure of PA for solvent-exposed aspartate and glutamate residues that could contribute to binding (25.Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Four such amino acids were identified in the receptor-binding domain, domain 4 (D4) (Fig. 3), and each was mutated individually to the corresponding amine-containing residue (Asp to Asn and Glu to Gln). Each PA mutant was expressed in E. coli, purified, and tested for its ability to function in a cell killing assay when combined with LFN-DTA. Although three mutants behaved as wild type, a single mutant, D683N, was unable to participate in cell killing (Fig. 4A). Limited tryptic digestion profiles of the wild type and the D683N PA proteins were identical (data not shown), indicating that this PA mutant is properly folded. These results identify Asp-683 as a residue critical for PA function.Fig. 3The crystal structure of PA domain 4 reveals four solvent-exposed carboxylate side chains. Amino acids shown in red contain carboxylate groups on the same surface as Asn-682, which was shown previously to be involved in binding ATR (7.Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J.

Cell survival was quantitated (±S.E.) using crystal violet. B, GST-D4 or GST-D4(D683N) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with ATR-mycHis. Resulting protein complexes or 0.1 μg ATR-mycHis were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase antibody.

Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and tested the ability of this protein (GST-D4(D683N)) to interact with ATR-mycHis in a GST pull-down assay. GST-D4(D683N) was not able to bind to ATR-mycHis (Fig. 4B), consistent with a role for Asp-683 in receptor binding.DISCUSSIONSuccessful vaccination against anthrax in animal models is correlated with an antibody response to PA, and the most effective neutralizing antibody responses are those directed against the receptor binding domain of PA (domain 4) (26.Flick-Smith H.C.

Williamson E.D. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfer of anti-PA antibodies provides passive immunity to anthrax infection (27.Beedham R.J. Turnbull P.C. Williamson E.D. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28.Kobiler D. Gozes Y. Rosenberg H. Marcus D. Reuveny S. Altboum Z. Infect.

Therefore, strategies to prevent binding of PA to its cellular receptors may lead to development of new anthrax antitoxins. Development of such antitoxins will be aided by a thorough understanding of how PA interacts with its cellular receptors. The goal of this work was to extend our understanding of anthrax intoxication by defining the molecular determinants of the PA-ATR interaction.PA binds directly to the extracellular region of ATR, which contains an integrin-like inserted or I domain, also known as a von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA). VWA/I domains are conserved, structurally related protein-folding domains that consist of ∼200 amino acids and function as protein-protein interaction modules (30.Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These domains are found in intracellular proteins expressed in eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaea, but an evolutionary divergence in metazoans gave rise to extracellular proteins with VWA/I domains (30.Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Proteins with extracellular I domain include integrins, matrilins, collagens, and complement components, and the I domains in these proteins bind directly to cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins (30.Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 31.Dickeson S.K. Santoro S.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the natural function of ATR/TEM8 is still unknown, it is likely that the ATR I domain serves as a protein-protein interaction domain, the function of which is predicted to rely on an intact MIDAS. The requirement for an intact ATR MIDAS for toxin binding suggests that PA may compete with natural ligands for binding to ATR.That PA binding may compete with natural ATR ligands is further supported by the absolute requirement for an aspartate residue at position 683 in PA. Such a requirement for carboxylate-containing residues is a common feature of α-integrin I domain ligands. Interestingly, Asp-683 is positioned in an exposed loop in PA, which was previously implicated in receptor binding (25.Petosa C. Collier"

We have explored the nuclear effectors downstream of this pathway that are responsible for CD13/APN induction. The response to serum/angiogenic growth factors mapped to a 38-bp region of the CD13/APN promoter containing an Ets-core motif that specifically binds a protein complex from nuclear lysates from activated endothelial cells. This motif and the proteins that target it are functionally relevant because mutation of this sequence abrogates CD13/APN transcription. Analysis of endothelial Ets family members showed that Ets-2, and to a lesser extent Ets-1, transactivate CD13/APN promoter activity via the Ets-core motif, whereas Fli, Erg, and NERF are ineffective. We investigated the possibility that the induction of CD13/APN is mediated by phosphorylation of Ets-2 via RAS/MAPK. A phosphorylation-defective Ets-2 mutant, T72A, failed to transactivate CD13/APN, suggesting that Ets-2 phosphorylation is obligatory for CD13/APN induction. To confirm a role for endogenous Ets-2 in CD13/APN expression, we specifically abrogated Ets-2 mRNA and protein by siRNA knockdown that significantly inhibited CD13/APN transcription. Finally, to assess the relevance of Ets-2 in endothelial cell function, we induced endothelial cells containing Ets-2 siRNA oligonucleotides to form capillary networks. Cells containing the Ets-2 inhibitory small interfering RNAs were completely incapable of forming the organized networks characteristic of endothelial morphogenesis. Thus, the phosphorylation of Ets-2 by RAS/MAPK is a prerequisite for CD13/APN endothelial induction and Ets-2 and its targets play essential roles in endothelial cell function.

Horton M.J. McMichael A.J. Leukocyte Typing III; Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1987Google Scholar). In this regard, the appearance of CD13/APN coincides with commitment to the myeloid lineage and within the hematopoietic compartment it is primarily expressed on the normal and leukemic progeny of myeloid cells (2.Shipp M.A. Look A.T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1052-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also detected on a proportion of acute lymphoid leukemias and activated T cells, and on T and B cells after cell-cell adhesion (3.Riemann D. Kehlen A. Langner J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that CD13/APN participates in antigen processing and presentation (4.Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), scavenging of amino acids and catabolism of regulatory peptides (5.Turner A.J.

Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The subsequent molecular cloning of the gene encoding this cell surface glycoprotein allowed comprehensive tissue-specific detection that extended its known range of expression beyond the hematopoietic system to include fibroblasts and epithelial cells in the liver, intestine, brain, and lung (9.Look A.T. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Peiper S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Analysis of CD13/APN transcriptional regulation revealed that it is regulated by two mutually exclusive promoters, one distal (8 kb upstream of the initiation codon) that is active in myeloid cells and fibroblasts, and a second proximal promoter (adjacent to the initiation codon) that controls expression in epithelial and endothelial cells (10.Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel role for CD13/APN as a potent angiogenic regulator where functional CD13/APN is required for tumor growth in vivo (11.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Kain R. Lahdenranta J. Sakamoto M. Stryhn A. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Arap W. Ruoslahti E.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the exclusive expression of CD13/APN on activated endothelial cells is precisely controlled by angiogenic signals present in the tumor microenvironment and it is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (11.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Kain R. Lahdenranta J. Sakamoto M. Stryhn A. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Arap W. Ruoslahti E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 722-727PubMed Google Scholar).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of CD13/APN induction in response to angiogenic stimulation in endothelial cells. Angiogenesis is functionally defined as the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existing vasculature and consists of several distinct stages including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, differentiation into capillaries, and eventual maturation into blood vessels (14.Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). Because CD13/APN belongs to the group of genes strongly induced by angiogenic stimuli, it is of interest to define those regulatory mechanisms that control its expression. Numerous transcription factors have been identified that regulate genes relevant to angiogenesis such as angiogenic growth factors (bFGF and VEGF), their receptors, and other mediators of the cellular responses to these growth factors (for review, see Ref. 15.Sato Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For example, regulation of expression of the VEGF-R2 gene is mediated by members of the Ets, GATA, and basic helix loop helix transcription factor families (16.Kappel A. Schlaeger T.M. Flamme I. Orkin S.H. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the expression of VEGF in response to hypoxia is primarily regulated by the PAS domain family of transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (17.Kotch L.E. Iyer N.V. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), EPAS (18.Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), and ARNT (19.Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Proliferation and migration of the endothelial cells and their formation into primitive tubes is regulated at least in part by transcription factors HESR1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (20.Henderson A.M. Wang S.J. Taylor A.C. Aitkenhead M. Hughes C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6169-6176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21.Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9116-9121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Therefore, these transcription factors play key roles in the regulation of angiogenesis via activation of their target genes. In this report, we provide evidence that transcriptional up-regulation of CD13/APN in endothelial cells in response to conditions characteristic of the angiogenic microenvironment is primarily mediated by the phosphorylation of Ets-2 by signals transmitted via the RAS/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of Ets-2 (and its target genes) is strictly required for endothelial morphogenesis. Whereas the precise role of CD13/APN in neovascularization is under active investigation, comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating the expression of this important angiogenic regulator is fundamental to the identification of potential therapies targeting angiogenic processes.

After stripping, the same membrane was subsequently hybridized with human 28 S rRNA gene-specific oligonucleotide probe or a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to control for loading and RNA integrity.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) upstream of the luciferase reporter in the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2 basic (Promega). 5′-Deleted promoter plasmids were constructed by subcloning restriction fragments or PCR generated fragments of the 1004-bp BstXI promoter region upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL2 basic. RAS expression plasmids were purchased from Clontech). In the dominant-negative expression construct RAS-17, Asn has been substituted for Ser17 that inhibits RAS activation (24.Miyamoto T. Fox J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2825-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the constitutively activated RAS expression construct RAS-61, Leu was substituted for Phe61 forming the constitutively active GTP-bound form of the protein (25.Srivastava S.K. Yuasa Y. Reynolds S.H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NERF expression plasmids were the kind gift of Dr. Peter Oettgen. Plasmids expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the CD13/APN promoter were constructed by subcloning the 1004-bp BstXI fragment of the wild-type CD13/APN proximal promoter into the promoterless pEGFP vector (Null-GFP) (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce CD13wt-GFP. The GFP reporter containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, referred to as CMV-GFP, was purchased from Clontech. Reporter constructs containing mutant versions of the CD13/APN proximal promoter were constructed by PCR amplification of sequences upstream and downstream of the 38-bp region (-1004 to -153 and -115 to -1) in separate fragments that incorporated a novel restriction site at their junction. Ligation of these two fragments into pGL2basic formed the Δ38bp mutant lacking the 38-bp region. Subsequent mutant reporter plasmids were constructed by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing specific mutations (see text) at the novel restriction site and confirmed by sequence analysis. Transient Transfection of Recombinant Plasmids and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Plasmids were transfected into KS1767 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In conditions treated with PD098059, cells were transfected, incubated with the inhibitor in 10% serum overnight, and harvested the next day (24 h post-transfection). Luciferase values in cells co-transfected with various expression plasmids and treated with PD098059 or growth factors were expressed relative to the values obtained with cells co-transfected with matching control plasmids or untreated control conditions, respectively. The maximum effects of co-transfection of Ets family expression plasmids on CD13/APN transcription were extrapolated from experimentally generated luciferase values by a nonlinear regression analysis using Graph-Pad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Stable Expression of GFP Reporter Plasmids in Mouse Hemangioendothelioma Cells—GFP-expressing plasmid constructs were stably transfected into murine hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA) using LipofectAMINE 2000 and neomycin-resistant pools containing each of the constructs were harvested after 4 weeks of selection. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts of KS1767 cells were prepared as described using a high-salt extraction procedure (26.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (27.Inoue K. Sherr C.J. Shapiro L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides containing the region surrounding the wild type CD13/APN Ets binding site (GTTGGAGCCCTGGTTATT) as a probe. For competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild type or mutant oligonucleotide (GTTAAAACCCTGGTTATT) was added to the reaction mixtures before the addition of the labeled probe. Western Blot Analysis—KS1767 nuclear extracts were prepared as described for EMSA. Lysates (25-30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was carried out as previously described (28.Hegde S.P. Zhao J. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 1999; 94: 1578-1589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Endothelial Morphogenesis Assay—Endothelial cells (1 × 106) were plated in 2 ml of medium in 6-well tissue culture plates coated with 0.5 ml of basement membrane matrix per well (Matrigel, BD Biosciences). Cellular morphology and fluorescence levels resulting from GFP expression were monitored by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Xenograft Studies—107 EOMA cells harboring the GFP reporter driven by various promoters were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of age-matched female SCID mice and tumors were harvested when they reached 1 cm in diameter. Tumors were mechanically disrupted and analyzed for the percentage of GFP-expressing cells by flow cytometric analysis. Two independent rounds of xenograft tumor production produced identical results. Construction and Transfection of SiRNA—Construction of siRNA molecules was performed using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: siRNA11, AATCAAGAATATGGACCAGGTCCTGTCTC; siRNA18, AATATGGACCAGGTAGCCCCTCCTGTCTC; and siRNA45, AACAGTTACAGAGGGACACTCCCTGTCTC. In vitro synthesized siRNA was transfected into KS1767 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000. Cells were incubated in 10% FBS 24 h post-transfection and then plated on Matrigel for an additional 24 h as described above. CD13/APN Expression in Endothelial Cells Is Induced by Serum and Growth Factor Stimulation—During the angiogenic process, oxygen deprivation in tissues induces the expression of a heterogeneous group of genes important for tissue vascularization known as angiogenic growth factors that are essential for the progression of angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 29.Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of these factors leads to a subsequent increase in the expression of numerous proteins that further mediate angiogenesis, including matrix metalloproteases, serine proteases, peptidases, integrins, and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 14.Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). We have shown that CD13/APN is a member of this group of angiogenic regulatory proteins and is induced on primary endothelial cells in response to hypoxia and angiogenic growth factors (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To dissect the molecular mechanisms of this regulation in more detail, we have utilized the Kaposi's sarcoma-derived KS1767 endothelial cell line as our model system. We have extensively characterized this cell line and found that it faithfully reflects the induction of CD13/APN seen in primary vascular endothelial cells in response to angiogenic signals (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13.Bhagwat S.V. Petrovic N. Okamoto Y. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2003; 101: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, serum-starved KS1767 cells cultured in low or high serum concentrations (which contains functional concentrations of many angiogenic factors, Fig. 1A) or with either the bFGF or VEGF angiogenic growth factors (Fig. 1B) markedly induces endogenous CD13/APN expression levels as determined by Northern blot analysis. Similarly, transient transfection of reporter plasmids containing ∼1 kb of the CD13/APN proximal promoter fragment fused upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13.Bhagwat S.V. Petrovic N. Okamoto Y. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2003; 101: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) into KS1767 cells showed dose-dependent reporter gene activity in response to serum stimulation (3.1-fold increase, Fig. 1C), indicating that the information required for the regulation of CD13/APN transcription is contained within this region of the proximal CD13/APN promoter. CD13/APN Transcription in Response to Serum Is Regulated by a Functional Ets-like Recognition Sequence within the Proximal Promoter—To identify sequence(s) within the CD13/APN proximal promoter controlling transcriptional activation in response to serum, KS1767 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing progressive deletions of the proximal promoter sequences (from -1004 to -115 bp) fused 5′ of the luciferase reporter gene and cultured in low (1%) or high (10%) serum concentrations (Fig. 2). Constructs containing promoter sequences upstream of -115 bp consistently showed significant increases in promoter activity (3.92 ± 0.36-fold) in serum-stimulated cells as compared with low serum conditions (Fig. 2). However, this serum responsiveness disappeared with the removal of an additional 38 bp (between -153 and -115 bp), indicating that the sequences involved in the regulation of CD13/APN transcription in response to serum are located in this region of the promoter. Inspection of the -115 to -153-bp region sequence (Fig. 3A) revealed the presence of a GGAG motif (located at approximately -130 bp) that is similar to the core consensus binding site recognized by members of the ETS family of transcription factors (GGAA/T (30.Lelievre E. Lionneton F. Soncin F. Vandenbunder B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). The Ets family contains nearly 35 members, some of which participate in the expression of variety of protein involved in vascular development and angiogenesis, such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator, matrix metalloproteinases, and the integrin β3 subunit (reviewed in Ref. 30.Lelievre E. Lionneton F. Soncin F. Vandenbunder B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with oligonucleotides derived from the CD13/APN promoter region.A, nucleotide sequence of the -115 to -154 region of the CD13/APN proximal promoter with the GGAG motif underlined. B, EMSA with nuclear extracts isolated from KS1767 cells treated with 10% FBS. Competitions were performed with oligonucleotides (100-fold excess) containing either the wild-type (lane 3) or mutant (GGAG to AAAA, lane 4) Ets-2 recognition sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether nuclear proteins expressed at endogenous levels in mammalian cells interact with the CD13/APN promoter at this site, we incubated nuclear extracts of KS1767 cells with an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe that spans the putative Ets recognition sequence. Nuclear extracts from serum-stimulated KS1767 cells specifically retarded the migration of the probe essentially as a single complex in an EMSA (Fig. 3B). Binding of this complex to the probe was inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, lane 3). In contrast, competition with a matching oligomer containing point mutations of the GGAG element to AAAA was not observed (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Identical EMSA results were obtained with nuclear extracts from primary endothelial cells (data not shown). Thus, the Ets-like recognition sequence appears to specifically bind nuclear protein(s) from endothelial cells, consistent with the notion that the protein(s) that constitute this complex are responsible for the induction of CD13/APN in response to angiogenic signals in endothelial cells. If the protein complex that binds to the GGAG element regulates CD13/APN expression, mutation of this site should profoundly alter CD13/APN promoter activity. To address this question, we created reporter plasmids containing either a deletion of the functionally determined 38-bp serum responsive region (-115 to -153, Δ38bp mutant) or altered the nucleotides of the GGAG site (GGAG to AAAA, indicated as GGAG mutant) in the context of the 1-kb CD13/APN wild type promoter plasmid. Transient transfection of either the deletion plasmid or the GGAG-site mutant plasmid showed substantially lower reporter gene activity when compared with the wild type control (Fig. 4A), indicating that binding of nuclear proteins to this site is critical for CD13/APN transcription in endothelial cells. Expression of CD13/APN increases dramatically in the angiogenic endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature in response to a combination of growth factor and cell matrix signals present in the tumor microenvironment (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the functional GGAG element also regulates CD13/APN transcription in the more complex stimulatory setting of angiogenesis-induced endothelial morphogenesis. In this model, plating endothelial cells on a basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) induces their differentiation and they form structures resembling capillary networks characteristic of the angiogenic phenotype (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13.Bhagwat S.V. Petrovic N. Okamoto Y. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2003; 101: 1818-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As we have previously shown (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), treatment of primary endothelial cells in this Matrigel model with the peptidase inhibitors, bestatin and amastatin, or with more specific CD13/APN neutralizing antibodies potently prevents the formation of organized networks, reiterating the requirement for functional CD13/APN in this process. To investigate the role of the GGAG element in CD13/APN induction in response to these signals, and to ensure that the observed response is not limited to KS1767 cells, we used a murine endothelioma cell line (EOMA) that expresses relatively low levels of CD13/APN in culture but markedly induces CD13/APN expression upon stimulation with serum and complex angiogenic signals such as Matrigel (12.Bhagwat S.V. Lahdenranta J. Giordano R. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Shapiro L.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). EOMA cells were stably transfected with reporter plasmids containing either the wild type CD13/APN proximal promoter upstream of the GFP reporter gene (CD13wt-GFP), a plasmid containing point mutations replacing the GGAG motif with AAAA in the context of the 1-kb promoter fragment (CD13-GGAG-mut-GFP), the promoterless negative control (null-GFP), or a positive control containing the cytomegalov"
https://openalex.org/W1967217463,"The transcription factor Cdx1 regulates intestine-specific gene expression and enterocyte differentiation. It has been hypothesized to play a role in regulating intestinal cell proliferation; however, the mechanism for this effect remains elusive. In a prior study, we demonstrated that Cdx1 expression reduced the proliferation of a nontransformed intestinal cell line. This study tests the hypothesis that Cdx1 expression inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation by reducing cyclin D1 gene expression. Cdx1 expression markedly reduced cancer cell proliferation and DNA synthesis and induced an accumulation of cells in G0/G1. A transcriptionally inactive Cdx1 mutant could not elicit this effect, suggesting that it required Cdx1 transcriptional activity. Cdx1 expression increased the hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (pRb) and p130 proteins. Reductions in G1 cyclin-dependant kinase (cdk) activity accompanied this effect. Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels were diminished by Cdx1 expression. Restoration of cyclin D1 expression reversed the G0/G1 block and induced pRb hyperphosphorylation. Lastly, Cdx1 expression did not alter cyclin D1 mRNA stability but did reduce cyclin D1 promoter activity, suggesting that Cdx1 acts to diminish cyclin D1 gene transcription. We conclude that Cdx1 reduces the proliferation of human colon cancer cells by reducing cyclin D1 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2049834824,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) specifically bind and phosphorylate the agonist-occupied form of G protein-coupled receptors. To further characterize the mechanism of GRK/receptor interaction, we developed a yeast-based bioassay using strains engineered to functionally express the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and exhibit agonist-dependent growth. Here, we demonstrate that agonist-promoted growth was effectively inhibited by co-expression with either wild type GRK2 or GRK5, whereas catalytically inactive forms of these kinases were without effect. In an effort to identify residues involved in receptor interaction, we generated a pool of GRK5 mutants and then utilized the bioassay to identify mutants selectively deficient in inhibiting agonist-promoted growth. This resulted in the identification of a large number of mutants, several of which were expressed, purified, and characterized in more detail. Two of the mutants, GRK5-L3Q/K113R and GRK5-T10P, were defective in receptor phosphorylation and also exhibited a partial defect in phospholipid binding and phospholipid-stimulated autophosphorylation of the kinase. In contrast, these mutants had wild type activity in phosphorylating the non-receptor substrate tubulin. To further characterize the function of the NH2-terminal region of GRK5, we generated a deletion mutant lacking residues 2–14 and found that this mutant was also severely impaired in receptor phosphorylation and phospholipid-promoted autophosphorylation. In addition, an NH2-terminal 14-amino acid peptide from GRK5 selectively inhibited receptor phosphorylation by GRK5 but had minimal effect on GRK2 activity. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby the extreme NH2 terminus of GRK5 mediates phospholipid binding and is required for optimal receptor phosphorylation.

A diverse array of extracellular stimuli transduce their signals through interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseRGSregulator of G protein signalingSST-14somatostatin-14SSTR2somatostatin receptor subtype 2β2ARβ2-adrenergic receptor.1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseRGSregulator of G protein signalingSST-14somatostatin-14SSTR2somatostatin receptor subtype 2β2ARβ2-adrenergic receptor. A critical process that occurs in most cells is the regulation of hormonal responsiveness, a phenomenon often termed desensitization. Whereas multiple mechanisms contribute to the regulation of GPCR function, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins play an important role in many cells (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). GRKs comprise a family of serine/threonine kinases that are uniquely able to associate with the agonist-occupied form of receptors (3Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Stoffel R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr.

Signaling is terminated upon receptor phosphorylation and the subsequent binding of arrestins, effectively uncoupling receptor from G protein. Mammalian GRKs are classified into three subgroups according to their sequence homology: GRK1 and -7; GRK2 and -3; and GRK4, -5, and -6 (4Stoffel R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

GRKs share a common structural organization that includes a moderately conserved (∼20% identity) NH2-terminal domain of ∼185 residues, a conserved (∼50% identity) central catalytic domain of ∼330 residues, and a poorly conserved COOH-terminal domain of ∼80–180 residues (4Stoffel R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar).An important feature of GRKs is their ability to specifically interact with activated receptors. Although the specific determinants required for this recognition are not well defined, a few studies have suggested a role for the GRK NH2-terminal region in receptor interaction. For example, site-specific antibodies directed against regions of the NH2-terminal region of GRK1 blocked phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin but had no effect on phosphorylation of a peptide substrate (7Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Lebioda L. Crabb J.W. Polans A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6004-6013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NH2-terminal truncation mutants of GRK1 and GRK2 as well as point mutants targeting a conserved acidic residue in the NH2 terminus resulted in a greatly decreased ability of these GRKs to phosphorylate rhodopsin, whereas activity toward a peptide substrate was unaffected (8Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Gan X.Q. Bao G.B. Li L. Pei G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to interaction with the receptor, previous studies implicating negatively charged phospholipids in GRK activation also have suggested a role for the NH2 terminus in phospholipid association (9Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone C.W. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).In the present study we attempted to further elucidate the role of the NH2 terminus of GRKs with respect to receptor interaction. We make use of an expression system whereby analysis of receptor-GRK association was facilitated through functional co-expression of these proteins in yeast cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes GPCRs as well as heterotrimeric G proteins to regulate mating between two haploid yeast cells (10Kurjan J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1097-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Banuett F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 249-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mating pheromones bind to pheromone-specific GPCRs encoded by the STE2 and STE3 genes. Upon activation, these pheromone receptors promote the activation of the G protein, GPA1, which then activates a downstream signal transduction pathway. As a result, transcriptional activation of additional components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade occurs, leading to cell cycle arrest. Previously, it has been demonstrated that mutations of certain components of the yeast pheromone response pathway eliminates the characteristic growth arrest response (13Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This in turn led to the development of a yeast-based bioassay using strains that were constructed to functionally express the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) and consequently induce growth upon activation by somatostatin peptide. In our investigation, we coexpressed mammalian GRKs with the SSTR2 in yeast to determine any possible phenotypic effects of these kinases. Interestingly, our results revealed that co-expression of GRK2 or GRK5 resulted in loss of the agonist-dependent growth response observed with receptor alone. This bioassay was then used to select NH2-terminal mutants of GRK5 that are selectively deficient in inhibiting agonist-promoted growth. We demonstrate that several residues within the NH2-terminal region of GRK5 are important for phosphorylation of receptor substrates. In addition, we also demonstrate that this region plays a role in mediating the association of GRK5 with phospholipids. Thus, our studies have identified an NH2-terminal domain of GRK5 important for receptor phosphorylation and phospholipid interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs and Roche Applied Science.

The fragments were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The fragments were excised and assembled into pBKS (Stratagene) forming pSst2-G418r.The plasmid pFUS2-CAN1 was constructed from fragments amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA. Synthetic oligonucleotides (MPO128, AAAGGATCCGGTTTTCTTGTCTTTTTCTTAAG; MPO129, AAAGAGCTCGTTTCTAATAAACTAATCTTCAAG) were used to amplify a 5′ fragment of FUS2 while adding 5′ SacI and 3′ BamHI sites. A 3′ FUS2 fragment was amplified with oligonucleotides (MPO130, AAACTCGAGATGACTCTATAGCTACCGG; MPO131, AAAGGTACCCTCTTCATGTTTCACAATTTCAT) that added 5′ XhoI and 3′ KpnI sites. The coding sequence of the CAN1 gene was amplified using oligonucleotides (MPO110, AAAGGATCCAAAATGACAAATTCAAAAGAAGACGCC; MPO111, AAAGTCGACCTATGCTACAACATTCCAAAATTTGTC) that added 5′ BamHI and 3′ SalI sites. The fragments were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The fragments were excised and assembled into pRS306 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) forming pFUS2-CAN1. pFUS2-CAN1 was linearized with XbaI prior to transformation.PCR Mutagenesis—Full-length human GRK5 in pcDNA3 was used as template for PCR amplification using T7 (sense) and 5′-CCAAGCGCTTGCAGGCA-3′ (antisense, encoding residues 213–218 of GRK5). To increase the frequency of random mutations, a mutagenic mixture of dNTPs containing 8 mm dCTP was used in conjunction with a final concentration of 5 mm MnCl2 in PCR. Amplification involved denaturing template DNA at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing for 45 s at 55 °C, and extension for 1.5 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. The resulting PCR products from 10 separate reactions were then pooled and purified.Construction of GRK5 Yeast Expression Vectors—Wild type human GRK5 in pcDNA3 was digested with BamHI and XbaI and subcloned into the yeast expression vector Ycplac111, which includes a GAL1/10 promoter. Ycplac111-GRK5 was digested at 2 internal restriction sites, BamHI and Bsu36I, to excise a 462-base pair open reading frame fragment (encoding residues 1–154) of GRK5. Randomly mutagenized GRK5 PCR products were digested with BamHI and Bsu36I and ligated into previously digested Ycplac111-GRK5 to reconstruct full-length GRK5 cDNAs.Construction of MPY576fc—Haploid S. cerevisiae strains YPH499 (MATaura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1Δ63, Stratagene) and MMOY11 (MATα ade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100 Ole+) (17McCammon M.T. Veenhuis M. Trapp S.B. Goodman J.M. Bacteriology. 1990; 172: 5816-5827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were crossed, the resulting zygotes were identified microscopically and cultured on YPD plates. The diploid cells were induced to sporulate on appropriate media and the tetrads were dissected on YPD plates. Four spore tetrads were assessed for the presence of required nutrient markers. MPY566 (MATaura3 leu2 his3 lys2-801 ade2 trp1 can1-100) was used for further strain construction. Standard yeast media and culture conditions were employed (18Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar).MPY566 was modified by sequential deletion of several genes in the mating signal transduction pathway leading to yeast strains that produce a sensitive growth-based readout of GPCR activation. DNA mediated transformation of S. cerevisiae was carried out using the lithium acetate method (19St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 1425Google Scholar). The far1 gene was deleted using the far1ΔLYS2 construct in pLP80 (14Kang Y.S. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SST2 gene was inactivated by replacement with the SacI-XhoI fragment in pSST2-G418r, a construct that permits expression of a Sst2-G418r fusion protein, by selecting for G418 resistance on plates containing α-mating factor. The FUS1 gene was replaced with the FUS1-HIS3 allele in pSL1497 (20Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Finally, the FUS2 gene was modified with pFUS2-CAN1 using the pop-in/pop-out replacement procedure (21Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). FUS2 coding sequences were replaced with those of CAN1, thus placing CAN1 expression under control of the pheromone inducible FUS2 promoter. The structures of the modified loci in MPY576fc were confirmed by PCR analysis. As a result of the modifications described above, MPY576fc is capable of agonist-induced vegetative growth on selective media lacking histidine, G418 resistance, and sensitivity to the toxic arginine analog, canavanine.Bioassay—Cultures of the yeast strain containing the SSTR2 alone (MPY576fc(pMP222)), or SSTR2 plus GRK5 (MPY576fc(pMP222, Ycplac111-GRK5)) were grown overnight in synthetic complete media containing glucose (2%) and lacking uracil (to select for receptor alone), or containing galactose (2%) and lacking uracil and leucine (to select for receptor and GRK), then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water and subsequently diluted 1000-fold. Diluted cells (0.3 ml) were then spread on agar plates lacking uracil and histidine or lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine. Plates also contained 4 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to inhibit background growth. Sixty pmol of somatostatin-14 peptide (SST-14) in a total volume of 5 μl was then spotted in the center of the plate and allowed to dry. Plates were incubated for ∼48 h until growth appeared on and around the point of agonist application. Analogous experiments using α-factor peptide (5 μl of 2 mg/ml) were performed using similar methods. Overnight cultures were grown in selective media containing either glucose or galactose, and cells were then pelleted, washed, and plated on agar media lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.Selection Assays to Identify Mutants—Log phase cultures of strain MPY576fc(pMP222) containing the SSTR2 were grown in raffinose (1%) selection media lacking uracil and subsequently made competent by incubating cells with 0.1 m lithium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA. 10 μl of ligation reactions generated from mutagenic PCR plus carrier DNA were added to the competent cells and then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h followed by heat shock treatment for 5 min at 42 °C in the presence of Me2SO. Cell suspensions were then plated on agar containing galactose and lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine (+4 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole). 180 nmol of SST-14 peptide were added to the plates and incubated for 7 days. Colonies were then patched onto plates containing galactose and lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine and incubated in the presence or absence of SST-14 for 3–5 days.Expression of GRK5 in Yeast—GRK5 expression was confirmed by extraction of protein from yeast cells followed by Western blotting. Briefly, cultures of yeast strain MPY576fc(pMP222, Ycplac111-GRK5) containing SSTR2 and GRK5 expression vectors were grown to stationary phase in selective raffinose (1%) media, then washed and diluted 1:10 into selective galactose media. Cultures (10 ml) were grown to log phase to an A600 of ∼1.0, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed twice in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A and 50 μl of this suspension was then diluted with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 30 min in 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), then incubated for 1 h with GRK5 monoclonal antibody diluted 1:5000 in TBST + 5% dry milk. Membranes were washed 3 times in TBST, incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:2000) in TBST + 5% dry milk, washed, and developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagent.Recovery of GRK5 Plasmids and Retransformation—Total DNA from individual isolates was extracted from yeast cells. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in selection media containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g and resuspended in a final volume of 1 ml of 1 m sorbitol, pH 7.5, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase 60,000. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by centrifugation and resuspension in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS. Cell suspensions were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of potassium acetate, incubation on ice for 1 h, and addition of 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. Samples were then incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged, and the pellets washed in 70% ethanol, airdried, and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Genomic DNA was transformed into the competent bacterial strain MC1066 that specifically selects for the Leu marker of the GRK5-containing plasmid. DNA was prepared from individual colonies and digested with BamHI/Bsu36I to verify the presence of plasmids containing GRK5. Yeast strain MPY576fc(pMp222) was then re-transformed with GRK5 cDNA-containing plasmids amplified in bacteria and colonies were re-tested in patch test assays for growth in the presence or absence of agonist. Plasmids were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method to identify mutations.Patch Tests—Re-transformed candidate clones were patched onto galactose-agar plates lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine in the presence and absence of SST-14. After ∼5 days, patches were qualitatively evaluated for growth compared with positive and negative controls (strains containing wild type GRK5 or SSTR2 alone, respectively).Transfection of COS-1 Cells—Expression plasmids for GRK5 were constructed as previously described (22Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 100-mm dishes in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA/dish using FuGENE™ as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and GRKs were partially purified by chromatography on SP-Sepharose as previously described (24Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Partially purified GRK samples typically contained 10–30 μg of GRK5/mg of protein.Purification of the β2-Adrenergic Receptor—The β2AR used in these experiments was modified with a cleavable signal sequence and FLAG epitope at the amino terminus, and a six histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus as previously described (25Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Receptor was expressed in Sf9 cells, solubilized in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% dodecylmaltoside, and 1 μm alprenolol, and purified by FLAG antibody chromatography (25Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Purification of GRK5 and Substrate Phosphorylation—Wild type and mutant GRK5 were overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described (26Kunapuli P. Onorato J.J. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1099-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the purity was determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration was determined by the dye binding assay (BioRad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Purified GRK5 was assayed by incubating 20–100 nm kinase with various concentrations of rod outer segment membranes (1–10 μm rhodopsin), β2AR (50 nm), or tubulin (0.1–5 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 20 μl. The β2AR incubations also contained 0.85 mg/ml soybean phosphatidylcholine and were in the presence or absence of 50 μm isoproterenol. Samples were incubated for 1–60 min at 30 °C in room light, quenched with SDS buffer, and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. 32P-Labeled proteins were excised and counted to determine picomole of phosphate transferred.Autophosphorylation of Purified GRK5—Autophosphorylation reactions contained 4 pmol of purified wild type or mutant GRK5 in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol). Reactions were incubated for 1–30 min at 30 °C and quenched with SDS sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed and the 32P-labeled proteins were excised and counted. Autophosphorylation reactions performed in the presence of phospholipids contained 0.85 mg/ml soybean phosphatidylcholine vesicles.GRK5 Binding to Phospholipids—Phospholipid vesicles were prepared by sonicating 85 mg of crude soybean phosphatidylcholine in 5 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) on ice 4 times for 20 s. Phospholipid association with GRK5 was analyzed by incubating 80 ng (20 nm) of purified or partially purified GRK5 in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of phospholipid in 60 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.015% Triton X-100) for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were pelleted at 200,000 × g for 15 min and pellet and supernatant fractions were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Equal aliquots of each fraction were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-GRK5 antibodies. Optical density of developed bands was assessed by densitometry and the amount of GRK5 bound to lipid was expressed as a percentage of the total.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDevelopment of a Yeast Bioassay to Analyze GRK Interaction with GPCRs—The mating pheromone pathway in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae utilizes a GPCR-heterotrimeric G protein complex to regulate mating between haploid cells. During the mating process, pheromone peptide binds to GPCRs encoded by the STE2 and STE3 genes that correspond to the MATa and MATα mating types, respectively. Subsequently, a signal transduction cascade is initiated that activates mitogen-activated protein kinase homologues encoded by the FUS1 and KSS1 genes, as well as regulatory protein kinases encoded by the STE7 and STE11 genes. Under normal conditions, the activation of this pathway results in cell cycle arrest mediated by the protein product of the FAR1 gene (10Kurjan J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1097-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Banuett F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 249-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, by introducing specific genetic mutations into a given strain, this response can be eliminated. When FAR1 is deleted, cell growth is permitted to continue in the presence of the activated pheromone pathway. Based on this concept, a novel expression system was developed that allows yeast cells expressing the mammalian somatostatin receptor subtype 2 to couple to the pheromone pathway in the presence of the peptide agonist SST-14 (13Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway can then be used in a growth selection by placing a HIS3 reporter into transcriptional elements of the FUS1 gene. Expression of the His3 protein is thus placed under control of the pheromone response cascade such that binding of SST-14 and subsequent activation of the pathway induces the FUS1 promoter. His3 protein expression then permits auxotrophic growth of yeast cells on media lacking histidine. In accordance with this observation, an appropriate strain was constructed (MPY576fc) that functionally expresses the SSTR2 and exhibits agonist-dependent growth upon exposure to somatostatin (13Price L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2156975736,"Disrupting mechanisms that control cell proliferation, cell size and apoptosis can cause changes in animal and tissue size and contribute to diseases such as cancer. The LATS family of serine/threonine kinases control tissue size by regulating cell proliferation and function as tumor suppressor genes in both Drosophila and mammals. In order to understand the role of lats in size regulation, we performed a genetic modifier screen in Drosophila to identify components of the lats signaling pathway. Mutations in the Drosophila homolog of C-terminal Src kinase (dcsk) were identified as dominant modifiers of both lats gain-of-function and loss-of-function phenotypes. Homozygous dcsk mutants have enlarged tissue phenotypes similar to lats and FACS and immunohistochemistry analysis of these tissues revealed that dcsk also regulates cell proliferation during development. Animals having mutations in both dcsk and lats display cell overproliferation phenotypes more severe than either mutant alone, demonstrating these genes function together in vivo to regulate cell numbers. Furthermore, homozygous dcsk phenotypes can be partially suppressed by overexpression of lats, indicating that lats is a downstream mediator of dcsk function in vivo. Finally, we show that dCSK phosphorylates LATS in vitro at a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue, which is critical for normal LATS function in vivo. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for dCSK in regulating cell numbers during development by inhibiting cell proliferation and suggest that lats is one of the mediators of the dcsk phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2030816695,"Chronic irradiation of human or murine epidermis with ultraviolet B (UVB) induces clones of p53-mutant keratinocytes. Clones precede and parallel the induction of carcinomas, suggesting that they are an early stage of UVB carcinogenesis. In the absence of UVB, these clones rapidly regress. For UVB-induced murine skin tumors and papillomas, regression is known to involve antigen-specific immunity. To determine whether antigen-specific immunity influences the creation, expansion, or regression of p53-mutant clones, we studied Rag1 knockout mice deficient in the recombination activating gene 1 required for development of B, alphabetaT, gammadeltaT, and natural killer T cells. Since tissue homeostasis could affect proliferation or persistence of clones, we also examined the effect of Rag1 on UVB-induced hyperplasia and apoptosis. Mice were irradiated with UVB daily for 7-11 weeks to create p53-mutant clones, and then retained in the absence of UV. After UV ended, epidermal thickness decreased and p53-mutant clones observed in the epidermal sheets regressed, with no significant differences between Rag1(-/-) and wild type. During the initial chronic UVB irradiation, increasing irradiation time increased both the number and size of p53-mutant clones, with no significant difference between genotypes. We conclude that antigen-specific immunity is not involved in the initiation, expansion, or acute regression of p53-mutant clones."
https://openalex.org/W2069956102,"Coding mutations of the CDKN2A gene on chromosome 9p21 cosegregate with 25–60% of familial melanoma cases, but there remains a number of 9p21-linked kindreds that lack germline coding mutations of CDKN2A. We sequenced CDKN2A exons 1α, 2, 3, and the adjacent intronic regions in 167 melanoma-prone families (at least two affected first-degree relatives), and detected four splice site variations, three of which cosegregate with the disease. RT–PCR experiments verified that these three variants, including an AGgt to ATgt mutation that demonstrates a founder effect, do affect splicing. While an exon 1α splice donor site mutation incompletely abolishes splicing, the correctly spliced mRNA yields a protein (Q50P) that cannot effectively interact with CDK4. We also performed RT–PCR on mRNA from 16 melanoma-prone kindreds to search for cryptic splice sites deep within introns, but identified no splice variants. Meanwhile, we screened 139 affected families using allele-specific PCR for the recently discovered IVS2−105A>G mutation, but found only one family that possesses this alteration. We conclude that splice site mutations do predispose to disease in a subset of melanoma-prone kindreds. Characterization of additional splice site variants and other noncoding alterations of CDKN2A should allow us to detect a wider range of mutations in at-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W2018915400,"Presynaptic Ca2+ channels are inhibited by metabotropic receptors. A possible mechanism for this inhibition is that G protein βγ subunits modulate the binding of the Ca2+ channel β subunit on the Ca2+ channel complex and induce a conformational state from which channel opening is more reluctant. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the binding of Ca2+ channel β and G protein β subunits on the two separate binding sites, i.e. the loopI–II and the C terminus, and on the full-length P/Q-type α12.1 subunit by using a modified mammalian two-hybrid system and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Analysis of the interactions on the isolated bindings sites revealed that the Ca2+ channel β1b subunit induces a strong fluorescent signal when interacting with the loopI–II but not with the C terminus. In contrast, the G protein β subunit induces FRET signals on both the C terminus and loopI–II. Analysis of the interactions on the full-length channel indicates that Ca2+ channel β1b and G protein β subunits bind to the α1 subunit at the same time. Coexpression of the G protein increases the FRET signal between α1/β1b FRET pairs but not for α1/β1b FRET pairs where the C terminus was deleted from the α1 subunit. The results suggest that the G protein alters the orientation and/or association between the Ca2+ channel β and α12.1 subunits, which involves the C terminus of the α1 subunit and may corresponds to a new conformational state of the channel.

Ca2+ channels consist of at least three subunits: the pore-forming α1 and several auxiliary subunits such as the intracellulary located β subunit and the transmembrane subunit α2δ.

In addition to the overlapping binding sites, G protein βγ and Ca2+ channel β subunits induce antagonistic effects on defined biophysical properties of the channel. For example, Ca2+ channel β subunits (with the exception of β2 subunits) shift the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized potentials, whereas Gβγ subunits have the opposite effects, i.e. a depolarizing shift (e.g. Refs. 13.Bourinet E.

The overlapping binding sites on the channel as well as their antagonistic effects on the voltage dependence of channel activation suggest that Ca2+ channel β and G protein βγ subunits may compete for binding sites on the α1 subunits during G protein modulation. Early biophysical analysis of the Ca2+ channel G protein modulation suggested that Ca2+ channels are stabilized in a certain conformational state during G protein modulation from which channel opening is more difficult to achieve (19.Bean B.P. Nature. 1989; 340: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). According to this model, G protein βγ subunits may induce and stabilize this reluctant state of the channel (20.Elmslie K.S.

In addition, one splice variant of the N-type channel mimics a G protein-modulated channel in the absence of activated G proteins, supporting the idea that the G protein binding to the channel induces and stabilizes an intrinsic state of the Ca2+ channel (25.Herlitze S.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). Visualization of GFP does not require any cofactor or enzymatic reaction and is therefore suitable as a reporter gene for an immediate read out in a two-hybrid interaction assay, for example. Because of the existence of several spectrally distinguishable variants of GFP, two reporter genes can be used to record and compare the expression and interaction of two independent proteins. Dual-color imaging and fluorescence resonance energy transfers (FRET) were performed in various studies with promising results by using CFP and YFP as fluorescent pairs (27.Miyawaki A. Llopis J.

By using a modified mammalian two-hybrid system (MTH) and FRET, we asked how Ca2+ channel β and G protein β subunits interact at the binding sites on the α1 subunit and whether the G protein induces a new conformational state of the channel. Our results suggest that Ca2+ channel β1b and G protein β subunits differentially interact with the two isolated binding sites of the α1 subunit (i.e. loopI–II and C terminus). On the functional full-length channel the Ca2+ channel β1b subunits may interact more strongly than G protein β subunits, because the FRET signals were larger for α1/β1b FRET pairs. Interestingly, when G protein β subunits were coexpressed with Ca2+ channel α1 and β subunits, there was an increase in the fluorescence signal between the Ca2+ channel subunits. This increase in FRET was abolished when the C terminus was deleted from the α1 subunit or overexpressed in the untagged form. The results suggest that the G protein induces an altered conformational state of the P/Q-type channel, which probably involves the binding of the G protein to the C terminus of the α1 subunit. Construction of DNA-BD and AD Fusion Proteins and pHASH-3—The following cloning and reporter vectors of the mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit (Clontech) were used: pM as cloning vector to construct the GAL4 DNA-BD fusion constructs; pVP16 as cloning vector for AD fusion constructs; pM3-VP16, pM-53, and pVP16-T as positive control vectors; pVP16 and pM without insert as negative control vectors. Gβ2, Gγ3, and the Ca2+ channel constructs β1b, α12.1-loop I–II, and α11.2-loop I–II were amplified by a single PCR, and constructs were subcloned in-frame into pM and pVP16. All amplified products were verified by sequencing. For construction of pHASH-3, five consensus GAL4-binding sites (UASG17-mer (x5)) and an adenovirus E1b minimal promoter were amplified by a single PCR and were subcloned into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). This vector was called pHASH-1. Then two nuclear localization signals were added 3′ in-frame into the YFP gene. This vector was called pHASH-2. For creating pHASH-3, two nuclear localization signals were also added 3′ to the CFP gene in pECFP (pECFP-NLS). The inducible YFP gene was cut out from pHASH2 using BspTI and subsequently subcloned into the BspTI site of pECFP-NLS. The 5′ BspTI site was introduced into pHASH-2 with the inducible promoter via PCR. Cell Culture and Immunohistochemistry—Opossum kidney (OK), Chinese hamster ovary, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with the indicated DNAs in each set of experiments with Effectene™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). 0.25 μg of each DNA in combination with 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmids (pHASH-3) were used for transfection. Equal amounts of total DNA within one set of experiments were used by adding unrelated DNA (plasmid pBF-1) to the transfection mixture when necessary. For example in Fig. 1 a maximum of 5 different DNAs were transfected in a 2:1:1:1:1 (with pHASH-3 added at twice the molar ratio than the other DNAs). When only 3 or 4 different DNAs were transfected, the missing DNA was replaced by pBF-1 DNA at the same ratio. Western blot analysis of transfected OK cells were performed with a polyclonal anti-Gal4 binding domain antibody and a monoclonal anti-VP-16 activation domain antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to standard procedures as described by Mark et al. (31.Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Quantification of YFP and CFP Signals—Cells were embedded in Fluoromount (133 mm Tris/HCl, 30% glycerol; 11% Mowiol, 2% diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). Fluorescence was detected with a conventional fluorescence microscope (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For CFP and YFP detection, the following filter sets were used: CFP, excitation, short-pass D436/10; beamsplitter 460DCLP and emission, bandpass filter 480/30; YFP, excitation, short-pass HQ 500/20; beamsplitter Q515LP and emission, bandpass filter 535/30. All filters were obtained from AHF Analysentechnik AG, Germany. Intensity ratios between nuclear YFP and CFP fluorescence were calculated by dividing the mean intensity values for YFP by the mean intensity values for CFP. Mean intensity values of YFP and CFP fluorescence were calculated by subtracting the intensity values measured from the extracellular background from the intensity values measured from the fluorescence in the nucleus of the individual cells. Intensity values are defined as the sum of the gray scale values for all pixels contained in a defined object area. For every fluorophore in each set of experiments the optimal exposure time for the YFP and the CFP fluorescence signals was determined for the strongest signal of the positive control (i.e. pM53/pVP16-T/pHASH-1–3). Fluorescence intensities were compared with the fluorescence signal at the defined exposition time. In addition, CFP fluorescence background after YFP excitation was measured by expressing pHASH-3 alone, and values were subtracted from all experiments performed for the same transfection. Images were captured with a CCD camera (RTE/CCD-1300-Y/HS Princeton Instruments; Tucson, AZ), and pictures were analyzed with MetaMorph 4.01 (Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany). All experiments described were performed at least in triplicate, and data were presented as means ± S.E. Colors used for YFP, CFP, and DAPI in Fig. 1 are computer-generated colors (Adobe Photoshop 5.5). Constructs—Constructs α12.1-loopI–II (residues 369–418), α12.1-loopI–II-Y/S, α11.2-loopI–II (residues 406–520), α12.1-C terminus (residues 1766–2212), α12.1 full-length, α12.1 full-length-ΔC terminus (residues 1–1857), β1b, β4, Gβ2, Gγ3 were either PCR-amplified or if restriction sites were suitable cloned into either pECFP-C1, pEYFP-C1 (Clontech), pECFP-C2, and pEYFP-C2 (derived from pEGFP-C2) or as non-tagged versions into pcDNA1, -3, or pcDNA3.1. All PCR-amplified products were verified by sequencing. FRET Measurements—For the calculation of FRET values and FRET-derived values, a two-step approach was used, which is based on the formalism and procedures of Erickson et al. (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In the first step, the constants RD1 and RA1 were determined by a multilinear regression (MLR) of the type FRETfl = α × CFPfl + β × YFPfl + γ [MLR] (where fl indicates fluorescence). A simple manipulation of (FRET = (FRETfl - RD1 × CFPfl)/(RA1 × (YFPfl - RD2 × CFPfl))) yields the relations RD1 = α + FRET × RA1 × RD2 and RA1 = β/FRET. Because the term FRET × RA1 × RD2 turns out to be exceedingly small in comparison to RD1 (see Table in the Supplemental Material), the constant RD1 was estimated by α to a good degree of approximation. This regression method has the advantage of producing the results completely independent of any additive adjustments of the basic input data usually necessary because of background variation. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient r of [MLR] can be calculated. In case r is close to 1or -1, it indicates the appropriateness of a linear relation between the variables, as predicted by the theory given in Erickson et al. (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Considering the data of cells expressing donor (X-CFP) only, the constant RD1 was set to be α in [MLR]. By using the data of the cells expressing acceptor protein (X-YFP) only, RA1 was determined as β of the [MLR], because in this case the FRET ratio (FRET) is equal to 1 by definition (FRET = (FRETfl (from FRET pair) + FRETfl (from YFP))/FRETfl (from YFP)) (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In the second step the constants ΔFRmax and FRETmax were calculated by an ordinary linear fit of the data of cells expressing both donor (X-CFP) and acceptor protein (X-YFP). As suggested by equation FRET = ΔFRmax × Ab + 1 (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the data were linearly fitted according to the free type FRET = m × Ab + c (y = mx + q). The predicted value FRET of the FRET ratio was given according to FRET = (FRETfl - RD1 × CFPfl)/(RA1 × (YFPfl - RD2 × CFPfl)) (see above) (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) using the original data and the R constants calculated in the first step. The percentage Ab of bound acceptors was calculated according to Ab = (CFPest + YFPest + Kd(Eff) - ((CFPest + YFPest + Kd(EFF))2 - 4 × CFPest × YFPest)1/2]/(2 × YFPest) [A34] (with CFPest = CFPfl/M_D; YFPest = YFPfl/M_A; M_A and M_D set as in Erickson et al. (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), KD(EFF) set 0), where Eff indicates efficiency and est indicates estimate. The quality of the linear fit was measured by the correlation coefficient r shown in the figures. Throughout the experiments statistical significance (p) was determined with a two-tailed Student's t test with p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**). Standard errors are the mean ± S.E. Electrophysiology—CFP- and YFP-tagged Ca2+ channel subunits (α12.1, β1b) and the G protein subunit (Gβ2) were coexpressed in tsA201 cells, and Ca2+ channel-mediated Ba2+ currents were measured and analyzed as described previously (1.Herlitze S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37807-37814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A Modified Mammalian Two-hybrid System to Detect Protein-Protein Interactions—The yeast two-hybrid system is based on the finding by Fields and Song (35.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) that eukaryotic trans-acting transcription factors like GAL4 can be divided into two physically separated but still functional independent domains. Both domains are normally part of a nuclear protein, which binds to a specific activation sequence of the target genes and regulates their transcription. Therefore, the DNA binding domain (DNA-BD) binds to certain upstream activating sequences (UAS) in close proximity to the promoter of the gene. One or several activation domains (AD) increase the transcription rate by directing the RNA polymerase II complex for downstream action. The AD and DNA-BD have to be in close physical proximity for efficient gene transcription. Separating AD from DNA-BD results in loss of gene transcription, whereas tethering AD to the DNA-BD by fusion of interacting proteins restores the function of the transcription factor. The possibility to separate the two domains and fuse them to putative interacting proteins allows one to monitor the interaction via expression of a certain reporter gene (36.Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) (Clontech and Stratagene). Recently, GFP has been used for monitoring protein interactions in an MTH system, which is based on the same principles as the yeast system (37.Shioda T. Andriole S. Yahata T. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5220-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One problem concerning the detection of especially weak protein interactions in the MTH system is the identification of positively transfected cells and the detection of a signal relative to background. In addition, the induced fluorescence intensity among several cells within a single assay may vary because of unequal numbers of reporter plasmids within the cell, different expression times after transfection, or because of the cell type. To overcome these problems, we introduced a second constitutively expressed reporter, the cyan fluorescence protein (CFP), into a vector where YFP is under the control of the GAL4-inducible promoter. The CFP is under CMV promoter control and is also transported to the nucleus. CFP-mediated fluorescence therefore indicates a positively transfected cell. The induction of YFP fluorescence can now be compared with the fluorescence signals of CFP, which are both expressed in the same restricted area, i.e. the nucleus (Fig. 1a). Thus, induced YFP signals can be detected and monitored relative to the CFP signals within single cells. As shown in Fig. 1, b–d, we first determined the optimal expression time for detection of protein-protein interactions in the MTH system. This was necessary because the YFP reporter plasmid gene reveals low expression over time in the absence of interacting proteins. We therefore analyzed the signal ratio between YFP-induced fluorescence and the constitutive CFP fluorescence for positive and negative controls at various expression times after transfection. As shown in Fig. 1, b–d, the signal ratio between YFP and CFP fluorescence depends on the incubation time after transfection. YFP fluorescence was first detected 12 h after transfection in 20–50% of constitutively CFP-expressing cells for the positive control constructs, i.e. pM3-VP16 (fused GAL-4-DNA-BD and VP16-AD), interacting p53 protein/SV40 large T-antigen (pM53/pVP16-T), and Gβ2/Gγ3 interaction (Fig. 1, b–e). The relative cell number in which YFP fluorescence was detected in CFP-positive cells increased to 75–100% 24 h after transfection (Fig. 1b). In contrast, for the negative controls (non-interacting pairs pM/pVP16, pM53/pVP16, and pHASH-3 alone), YFP fluorescence was only detected after 18 h in 15% of the CFP-positive cells, and the cell number with YFP fluorescence further increased to a saturating level after 36–48 h of expression (Fig. 1c). Forty-eight h after transfection 60–70% of the CFP-positive cells revealed YFP fluorescence due to the leakage of the GAL4/E1b promoter (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1d, the optimal signal to noise ratio for the detection of YFP fluorescence and quantification of protein interactions occurred after 18–24 h of expression for OK cells. To demonstrate further that the signal to noise ratio decreased for incubation times longer than 24 h, we compared the YFP/CFP fluorescence ratios from cells incubated for 18 and 36 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 1, e and f, the YFP/CFP fluorescence intensity ratios decline significantly for Gβ2/Gγ3 interaction from 0.52 ± 0.08 (n = 21) to 0.29 ± 0.05 (n = 54) (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Thus, optimal YFP/CFP fluorescence ratios are obtained between 18 and 24 h following transfection, which is the time where background fluorescence is minimized. Interaction of the Ca2+Channel β Subunit and the G Protein β Subunit with the Intracellular Loop I–II of the Ca2+Channel α1Subunits—The binding sites of the Ca2+ channel β and G protein βγ subunits are localized at the intracellular domain connecting domain I and II and the C terminus of the Ca2+ channel α1 subunit (6.Zhang J.F.

We first analyzed the interaction of both proteins (Ca2+ channel β and G protein β subunit) on the α1-loopI–II of the P/Q-type channel with the MTH system (Fig. 1h). P/Q-type channel loopI–II and Gβ2 (0.24 ± 0.04 (n = 35)) induced a YFP fluorescent signal, which was significantly weaker than the signal induced with β1b (0.45 ± 0.03 (n = 53)). In contrast, no YFP fluorescent signal was detected for coexpression of L-type channel α11.2-loopI–II and G protein β2 subunits. This result was expected, because G protein βγ subunits do not interact with the L-type channel α1 subunits. To verify the results observed with the MTH system, we compared and analyzed the direct interaction of the α1-loop-I–II with the Ca2+ channel β and G protein β subunits using the three cube FRET method between CFP-tagged donor proteins (loopI–II) and YFP-tagged acceptor proteins (β1b/Gβ2) (Fig. 2). We calculated independently two FRET-based values according to a modified version of Erickson et al. (32.Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). First, we determined the average FRET value (Fig. 2b); second, we determined the maximal FRET (FRETmax) value for the interacting protein pairs (Fig. 2, c + d) to qualitatively compare the protein interaction with other interactions examined. Differences in the FRETmax values correspond to a difference in the affinity of the interaction or the distance and/or orientation between the donor relative to the acceptor protein. As shown in Fig. 2b, the interaction between P/Q-type channel α12.1-loopI–II with β1b subunits (FRET 3.45 ± 0.11 (n = 328)) induced a significantly stronger FRET signal than the interaction between α12.1-loopI–II with the Gβ2 subunit (FRET 2.49 ± 0.08 (n = 335)). In contrast, cotransfection of L-type channel α11.2-loopI–II-CFP and Gβ2-YFP did not result in an average FRET signal larger than 1, indicating that these two fusion proteins do not interact (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, cotransfection of CFP and YFP and cotransfection of the donor constructs with YFP or the acceptor constructs with CFP also did not result in a FRET signal larger than 1 (see the Supplemental Material), indicating that the FRET signals measured for the interacting proteins are due to the interaction between donor and a"
https://openalex.org/W2009929782,"The activation of caspases is a critical event for the execution phase of programmed cell death. Caspases are highly specific in their ability to activate or inhibit many crucial proteins in the cell via cleavage. In this study, we report the identification of several caspase-3-like cleavage sites in the cell-cycle checkpoint protein Rad9. We demonstrate that human Rad9 can be specifically cleaved in cells induced to enter apoptosis by both DNA damage and staurosporine treatment. Indeed, we show that human Rad9 can be effectively cleaved both in vitro and in vivo, which can be inhibited by either a pan-caspase inhibitor or a caspase-3-specific inhibitor. Additionally, no cleavage of Rad9 can be seen in the caspase-3-deficient cell line MCF-7. Site-directed mutagenesis of three of the most conserved cleavage sites dramatically abrogates cleavage of Rad9 by caspase-3 in vitro, and in intact cells after DNA damage. Expression of the cleavage-resistant mutant Rad9 DDD/AAA appears to protect the cell from DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Immunofluorescence studies of Rad9 localization before and after induction of apoptosis show a translocation of Rad9 from the nucleus to the cytosol, concomitant to the appearance of apoptotic morphology. Furthermore, analysis of a truncated Rad9 mutant that corresponds to a putative N-terminal cleavage fragment shows that the N-terminal portion of Rad9 localizes in the cytosol, binds to Bcl-XL, and induces apoptosis. These results support a dual role for cleavage of Rad9: (1) the liberation and translocation of the BH3 domain-containing N-terminus of Rad9 to the cytosol, as a means of promoting apoptosis via antagonism of Bcl-XL, and (2) the disruption of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 DNA damage checkpoint complex."
https://openalex.org/W1964839574,"p53 can be regulated through post-translational modifications and through interactions with positive and negative regulatory factors. MDM2 binding inhibits p53 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome, whereas promyelocytic leukemia (PML) activates p53 by recruiting it to multiprotein complexes termed PML-nuclear bodies. We reported previously an in vivo and in vitro interaction between PML and MDM2 that is independent of p53. In the current study, we investigated whether interaction between MDM2 and PML can indirectly affect p53 activity. Increasing amounts of MDM2 inhibited p53 activation by PML but could not inhibit PML-mediated activation of a p53 fusion protein that lacked the MDM2-binding domain. Conversely, increasing amounts of PML could overcome p53 inhibition by MDM2 but could not overcome MDM2-mediated inhibition of a p53 fusion protein that lacked the PML-binding domain. These results demonstrate that MDM2 and PML can antagonize each other through their direct interaction with p53 and suggest the combined effects of MDM2 and PML on p53 function are determined by the relative level of each protein. Furthermore, these results imply that interactions between MDM2 and PML by themselves have little or no effect on p53 activity. p53 can be regulated through post-translational modifications and through interactions with positive and negative regulatory factors. MDM2 binding inhibits p53 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome, whereas promyelocytic leukemia (PML) activates p53 by recruiting it to multiprotein complexes termed PML-nuclear bodies.

In the current study, we investigated whether interaction between MDM2 and PML can indirectly affect p53 activity. Increasing amounts of MDM2 inhibited p53 activation by PML but could not inhibit PML-mediated activation of a p53 fusion protein that lacked the MDM2-binding domain. Conversely, increasing amounts of PML could overcome p53 inhibition by MDM2 but could not overcome MDM2-mediated inhibition of a p53 fusion protein that lacked the PML-binding domain. These results demonstrate that MDM2 and PML can antagonize each other through their direct interaction with p53 and suggest the combined effects of MDM2 and PML on p53 function are determined by the relative level of each protein. Furthermore, these results imply that interactions between MDM2 and PML by themselves have little or no effect on p53 activity. MDM2 is an oncogene that is frequently overexpressed in various human cancers, including sarcomas, gliomas, melanomas, and breast cancers (1.Landers J.E. Cassel S.L. George D.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3562-3568PubMed Google Scholar). The primary function of MDM2 is to inhibit the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. p53 inhibits cell proliferation in response to DNA damage and other stresses by activating the transcription of genes that mediate either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 2.Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). MDM2 can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and inhibit its ability to activate transcription, and at least three different mechanisms have been described by which this can occur. First, MDM2 binding can block the interaction between p53 and the basal transcription machinery (3.Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 4.Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Second, MDM2 can promote the ubiquitination of p53 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome, and there is some evidence that MDM2 functions as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that can transfer ubiquitin moieties directly to p53 (5.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar, 6.Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 7.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Third, MDM2 binding can promote the export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (8.Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9.Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this case, it has been suggested that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination activates or exposes a nuclear export signal in the p53 C terminus, leading to the export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.In addition to inhibiting p53, there is increasing evidence that MDM2 has p53-independent activities that may contribute to its oncogenic properties. This evidence includes the following. First, rare tumors harboring both p53 mutations and MDM2 gene amplifications have been described and are more aggressive than those with alterations in either gene alone (10.Cordon-Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D. Woodruff J.M. Marechal V. Chen J. Brennan M.F. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that MDM2 overexpression may accelerate tumor growth even in the absence of functional p53. Second, MDM2 overexpression has been reported to transform cells in culture in the absence of a functioning p53 (11.Dubs-Poterszman M.C. Tocque B. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2445-2449PubMed Google Scholar). Third, targeted MDM2 overexpression in the mammary glands of mice leads to abnormal cell proliferation and mammary hypertrophy to a similar extent in both a p53+/+ and p53-/-background (12.Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeil Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Accordingly, considerable effort has been aimed at identifying targets other than p53 with which MDM2 can interact.The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) 1The abbreviations used are: PMLpromyelocytic leukemiaPML-NBsPML-nuclear bodiesGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: PMLpromyelocytic leukemiaPML-NBsPML-nuclear bodiesGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutinin. protein is a tumor suppressor and the major component of multiprotein nuclear complexes that have been variably termed Kremer bodies, ND10, PODs (for PML oncogenic domains), and PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). These PML-NBs appear as foci within the nucleus when visualized with antibodies against PML or other NB-associated factors (13.Maul G.G. Negorev D. Bell P. Ishov A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14.Borden K.L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The PML protein has received considerable attention recently due, at least in part, to its ability to activate p53. PML binds directly with p53 and recruits it to PML-NBs (15.Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that recruitment to PML-NBs activate p53 by bringing it in close proximity with CBP/p300 (16.Pearson M. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2001; 49: 7250-7256Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Acetylation of p53 by CBP/p300 then increases p53 DNA binding affinity, leading to an activation of p53-responsive genes. This activation of p53 likely contributes to the tumor suppressor function of PML. We observed previously (17.Wei X. Yu Z.K. Ramalingam A. Grossman S.R. Yu J.H. Bloch D.B. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29288-29297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) an interaction between PML and MDM2 that is independent of p53. In those studies, MDM2 could be immunoprecipitated with PML in cells transiently overexpressing both proteins, and recombinant MDM2 produced in insect cells formed a strong complex with a bacterially expressed GST-PML fusion protein. Moreover, confocal microscopy revealed a low level association between the endogenous PML and MDM2 proteins in cells. These results demonstrated that MDM2 and PML can interact with each other in a manner independent of p53 and suggested that this may be a direct interaction. The purpose of the current study was to investigate further the interaction between PML and MDM2, and to assess whether this interaction can indirectly influence p53 activity. The interaction between MDM2 and PML is complex and mediated by multiple regions of each protein. p53, MDM2, and PML can colocalize in PML-NBs with one another, and this can occur in the absence of p53:MDM2 binding. Finally, MDM2 and PML can antagonize each other through their direct interaction with p53.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid DNAs—Expression DNA encoding FLAG-tagged, full-length PML IVa (588 amino acids long) was obtained from Zhi-Min Yuan (Harvard School of Public Health). HA-tagged PML IVa was generated from the FLAG-tagged form by PCR. The 3′ primer for PCR was the SP6 primer (Promega), and the 5′ primer was 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGAGCCTGCACCCGCCCG-3′. DNA encoding GFP-tagged p53 has been described previously (8.Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and was obtained from Tyler Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). DNA encoding wild-type MDM2 and MDM2 Δp53BD was obtained from Steve Grossmann (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). MDM2 Δp53BD lacks the MDM2-binding domain between residues 52 and 96. FLAG-tagged MDM2-(2–202), -(100–304), and -(300–488) were generated by PCR using wild-type MDM2 DNA as a template. For MDM2-(300–488) the 5′ primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCCCAAAGAAGAAGAGGAAGGACTATTGGAAATGCACTTCATGC-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-CCGTCTAGATCAAGTTAGCACAATCATTTGAATTGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI, and cloned downstream and in-frame with the FLAG epitope that had been cloned previously into pCDNA3.1. MDM2-(300–488) contains the SV40 large T-antigen nuclear localization signal encoded within the 5′ primer. For MDM2-(2–202) the 5′ primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCTGCAATACCAACATGTCTGTACC-3′ and the 3′ primer was 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATATTACACACAGAGCCAGGC-3′. For MDM2-(100–304) the 5′ primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCTATACCATGATCTACAGGAACTTGG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATTTCCAATAGTCAGCTAAGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned downstream and in-frame with the FLAG epitope in pCDNA3.1. p53DN:VP16 TAD was generously provided by Jennifer Pietenpol (Vanderbilt University) and encodes the VP16 transactivation domain fused to p53 amino acids 80–393. GAL4 DBD-p53-(1–45) was generated by PCR using wild-type p53 as a template. The 5′ primer was 5′-ACGGGATCCCGTATGGAGGAGCCGCAG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-CGCTCTAGAGCCTCACAGCATCAAATCATC-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites downstream of GAL4 in pCDNA3. The GAL4-luc reporter was generously provided by Donald Bloch (Massachusetts General Hospital) and contains GAL4 DNA-binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. The p53-responsive luciferase reporter pG13-luc was a gift from Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University).Tissue Culture, Immunoblots, and Immunoprecipitation—35-2 cells (p53 and MDM2 double knock-out) were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. U2OS cells (p53 wild-type) were similarly grown. Transfections were done using the FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sixteen to 20 h after starting the transfection, cells were either fixed for immunofluorescence staining or harvested for collection of whole cell lysates. To harvest whole cell extracts, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The scraped cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with occasional light vortexing, followed by 15 min of centrifugation to remove cellular debris. For coimmunoprecipitations from transfected cells, 300 μg of transfected cell extract was immunoprecipitated with 0.6 μg of polyclonal anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma catalog number F7425). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membrane was probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11 from Babco).Immunofluorescence Staining—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on glass coverslips and subsequently transfected. The cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Paraformaldehyde was then replaced with 50 mm NH4Cl for 5 min, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin. HA-PML staining was carried out using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco) as the primary antibody, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) as the secondary antibody. MDM2 staining was carried out using the anti-MDM2 polyclonal antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody, and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) as the secondary antibody. GFP fluorescence was visualized without immunostaining. Specimens were examined under a fluorescence microscope.GST Fusion Protein Production—GST-tagged PML wild-type DNA was generated by PCR using HA-PML (wild-type) as a template. The 3′ primer for PCR was 5′-GGCGCGGCCGCCTCACCAGGAGAACCCACTTTCATTG-3′, and the 5′ primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCGAGCCTGCACCCGCCCGATCTCCG-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T-3. DNAs encoding the GST-tagged proteins were used to transform BL-21 bacterial cells and transformed cells grown at 37 °C until reaching log phase. GST protein expression was induced by incubation in 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 3 h. To purify the GST fusion proteins, cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), and the resulting lysate was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer. For MDM2 binding, the GST-tagged proteins bound to beads were incubated with 500 μl of whole cell lysate from transfected 35-2 cells for 5–6 h. Unbound MDM2 protein was removed by 5 washes (1 ml each) with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in 1× loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and examined by immunoblot analysis with anti-MDM2 or anti-FLAG antibodies.Luciferase Assays—Luciferase activity was monitored by using either the p53-responsive luciferase reporter gene pG13-luc or the GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter GAL4-luc. 35-2 cells were transfected with either of these two reporter genes and various combinations of p53, MDM2, and PML, as indicated in the text and figure legends. pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter DNA (5 ng) was included in all transfections and used to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cell lysates were prepared 20–24 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was assessed using the dual luciferase assay reporter kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSThe activity most associated with PML is its ability to bind multiple different proteins and recruit them to PML-NBs (18.Negorev D. Maul G.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7234-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We reported recently (17.Wei X. Yu Z.K. Ramalingam A. Grossman S.R. Yu J.H. Bloch D.B. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29288-29297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) an in vivo and in vitro interaction between PML and MDM2 that is independent of p53. In that study, recombinant and partially purified human MDM2 protein formed a strong complex with a bacterially expressed GST-PML fusion protein. We wished to characterize the binding between MDM2 and GST-PML further. To this end, 35-2 cells (MDM2 and p53 double-null) were transfected with DNAs encoding either full-length wild-type MDM2 or FLAG-tagged forms of MDM2 that encompassed the N terminus (residues 2–202), central region (residues 100–304), or C terminus (residues 300–488). Transfected cell lysates were then mixed with either GST alone or the GST-PML fusion protein, and MDM2 binding was assessed in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, wild-type MDM2 was bound by the GST-PML fusion protein but not by GST alone. This is consistent with our previous results and indicates that MDM2 can form a complex with PML. The FLAG-tagged N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions of MDM2 were also bound by GST-PML but not with GST alone (Fig. 1B). This indicates that multiple regions of MDM2 are capable of interacting with PML, at least in these GST pull-down studies.Given that the function of PML, at least in part, is to interact with and recruit different proteins, it is perhaps not surprising that various regions of MDM2 may associate with one or more regions of PML. We used coimmunoprecipitation experiments to try to map the PML domains that interact with different regions of MDM2 (Fig. 2). Cells were again transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG-tagged MDM2s that encompassed the N terminus (residues 2–202), central region (residues 100–304), or C terminus (residues 300–488). However, in this case, the cells were cotransfected with DNAs encoding HA-tagged fragments of PML that encompassed portions of the N terminus, central region, and C terminus. Our previous results demonstrated that conversion of the lysine at position 160 in PML to arginine (K160R), which inhibits sumoylation at this site, allows a much stronger interaction between PML and wild-type MDM2 (17.Wei X. Yu Z.K. Ramalingam A. Grossman S.R. Yu J.H. Bloch D.B. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29288-29297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also included a form of PML that harbored the K160R mutation. Association between the MDM2 and PML fragments was assessed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, the N-terminal portion of MDM2 (residues 2–202) displayed relatively weak binding to PML fragments encoding the N terminus (residues 1–200) and C terminus (residues 200–585 and 300–585) but not did not bind with the PML central region (residues 200–453). In these studies, binding of MDM2-(2–202) to the C-terminal fragments of PML was weaker than its binding to PML residues 1–200. Strikingly, much stronger binding was observed between MDM2-(2–202) and PML residues 1–200 that harbored the K160R mutation. Given that the K160R mutation inhibits sumoylation at this site, this suggests that sumoylation at Lys-160 may inhibit interaction between the MDM2 and PML N-terminal regions. Taken together, these results suggest that the MDM2 N terminus (residues 2–202) interacts primarily with residues 1–200 in non-sumoylated PML but may also interact to a low extent with the C-terminal portion of PML. The C terminus of MDM2 (residues 300–488) also displayed weak binding to PML fragments encoding the N terminus (residues 1–200) and C terminus (residues 200–585 and 300–585) and weaker binding with the PML central region (residues 200–453). However, MDM2-(300–488) displayed much stronger binding to PML residues 1–200 that harbored the K160R mutation, similar to MDM2-(2–202). This suggests that MDM2-(300–488) interacts primarily with residues 1–200 in non-sumoylated PML and to a lesser extent with the C-terminal and central PML regions. The central region of MDM2 (residues 100–304) coimmunoprecipitated with the C-terminal fragments of PML (residues 200–585 and 300–585) but not with PML fragments encoding either the N terminus (residues 1–200) or central (residues 200–453) regions. In these studies, interaction between the PML C terminus and MDM2-(100–304) was somewhat stronger than interaction between the PML C terminus and either the MDM2 N-terminal or C-terminal fragments. This suggests that interactions between MDM2 and the PML C terminus may occur mostly through the MDM2 central region. The fact that the MDM2 central region does not interact with PML residues 1–200 indicates that interaction with this region of PML is specific to the MDM2 N and C terminus. In total, these results indicate that the interactions between PML and MDM2 are complex and can occur through multiple regions of each protein.Fig. 2Coimmunoprecipitation of MDM2 and PML fragments. Cells were transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG-tagged MDM2 N terminus (residues 2–202), the central region (residues 100–304), and the C terminus (residues 301–488). In each case, the cells were cotransfected with DNAs encoding HA-tagged forms of PML that encoded the N terminus (residues 1–200 of wild-type PML or 1–200 the PML K160R mutant), central region (residue 200–453), or C terminus (residues 200–585 and 300–585). Transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitates examined by immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. In the upper panels, the arrows indicate the positions of the HA-PML fragments that coimmunoprecipitate with each FLAG-tagged MDM2, and the asterisk marks the antibody heavy chain used in the immunoprecipitation. In the lower panels, transfected cell lysates were examined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies without prior immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PML and MDM2 have opposing effects on p53. MDM2 binding inhibits p53 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome (5.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar, 6.Honda R.

Oncogene. 2001; 49: 7250-7256Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine whether MDM2 can prevent p53 recruitment to PML-NBS, cells were transfected with DNAs encoding GFP-tagged p53, HA-tagged PML, and MDM2, and localization of the transfected proteins was monitored by immunofluorescence. p53 and MDM2 displayed a diffuse nuclear localization when expressed alone (Fig. 3A). In contrast, both p53 and MDM2 were recruited to PML-NBs in cells coexpressing p53, MDM2, and PML (Fig. 3B). This indicated that MDM2 did not prevent the recruitment of p53 to PML-NBs. To determine whether recruitment of MDM2 to PML-NBs required its interaction with p53, a similar experiment was performed with an MDM2 mutant that lacks the N-terminal p53-binding domain (MDM2 Δp53BD). As shown in Fig. 3B, MDM2 Δp53BD could also be recruited to PML-NBs with PML and wild-type p53, perhaps through interaction with one or more regions of PML. Together, these results indicate that p53, MDM2, and PML can associate in cells in the same PML-NBs and that this can occur in the absence of p53:MDM2 binding.Fig. 3Colocalization of PML, p53, and MDM2 in transfected cells.A, cells were transfected with DNAs encoding GFP-p53 or wild-type MDM2. Localization of MDM2 was monitored by immunofluorescence staining, and GFP-p53 localization was monitored by direct visualization with an immunofluorescence microscope. B, cells were transfected with DNAs encoding HA-PML, GFP-p53, and MDM2 that was either wild type (wt) or lacked the p53-binding domain (MDM2 Δp53BD). Localization of each protein was then examined by immunofluorescence staining. Representative pictures are shown. Both MDM2 wild type and MDM2 Δp53BD could colocalize HA-PML and GFP-p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given these results, we wished to test whether PML and MDM2 can antagonize each other in their regulation of p53. First, cells were transfected with a p53-responsive luciferase gene alone, or with increasing amounts of DNA encoding MDM2 or PML. As shown in Fig. 4A, MDM2 inhibited p53 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. In these experiments, 40 ng of input MDM2 DNA was the minimal amount that caused a marked inhibition of p53 activity, whereas 80 and 200 ng of input MDM2 DNA caused a more robust inhibition of p53. In contrast, PML activated p53 in a dose-dependent manner, with 1000 ng of input PML DNA causing the most pronounced activation of p53 (Fig. 4B). To examine the combined effect of MDM2 and PML, p53 activity was monitored in cells transfected with increasing amounts of MDM2 DNA (40, 80, or 200 ng) and high amounts of PML (500 and 1000 ng). As shown in Fig. 4C, PML blocked p53 inhibition by MDM2 and activated p53 when 40 ng of MDM2 DNA was used in the transfection. PML also blocked p53 inhibition by MDM2 when 80 ng of MDM2 DNA was used, although under these conditions only slight activation of p53 was observed. In contrast, PML could not block p53 inhibition by MDM2 when 200 ng of MDM2 DNA was used in the transfection. These results indicate that the effects of MDM2 and PML on p53 activity are likely to depend on the relative levels of each protein. Namely, PML can overcome p53 inhibition by relatively low amounts of MDM2 but not high MDM2 amounts. In contrast, high amounts of MDM2 can inhibit the PML-mediated activation of p53.Fig. 4MDM2 and PML antagonize each other to regulate p53.A and B, 35-2 cells were transfected with a p53-responsive luciferase promoter DNA (pG13-luc, 200 ng), wild type p53 DNA (5 ng), and the indicated amounts of wild-type MDM2 (A) and HA PML (B). Luciferase activity was monitored in the transfected cell lysates 24 h post-transfection as a measure of p53 activity.

To this end, a fusion protein was generated (designated GAL4 DBD-p53-(1–45)) in which the p53 transactivation domain (residues 1–45) is fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. This fusion protein maintains the MDM2-binding function of p53 but lacks the region of p53 (residues 120–290; see Ref. 19.Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) that binds PML. Cells were transfected with GAL4 DBD-p53-(1–45) and a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter alone or with MDM2 and PML. As shown in Fig. 5, GAL4 DBD-p53-(1–45) activated the GAL4-responsive reporter, and this activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by MDM2. Importantly, a high amount of PML (500 ng) had little to no effect on the ability of MDM2 to inhibit GAL4 DBD-p53-(1–45) under all conditions tested. These results demonstrate that p53-independent interactions between PML and MDM2 alone do not prevent MDM2 from inhibiting the p53 transactivation domain. Thus, PML must bind p53 directly to efficiently overcome the inhibition of p53 activity by MDM2.Fig. 5PML does not block MDM2-mediated inhibition of a GAL4-p53 fusion protein. 35-2 cells were transfected with a GAL4-responsive luciferase promoter DNA (GAL4-luc, 100 ng), GAL4 DBD-p53-(1–45) (200 ng), and the indicated amounts of wild-type MDM2 and HA PML.

First, p53-dependent luciferase activity was monitored in cells transfected with the p53-responsive luciferase gene alone or with various combinations of p53, wild-type MDM2, MDM2 Δp53BD, and PML (Fig. 6A). As expected, high amounts of wild-type MDM2 DNA (200 and 500 ng) strongly inhibited p53 activity, whereas MDM2 Δp53BD failed to inhibit p53. These results indicate that MDM2 must bind p53 in order to inhibit its activity. Coexpression with PML stimulated the transcriptional activity of p53 by ∼3-fold when the proteins were expressed together in the absence of MDM2 (6B). Importantly, wild-type MDM2 efficiently"
https://openalex.org/W2057375139,"Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of multiple sites in the eIF4E-binding protein, PHAS-I, leading to dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex and to an increase in cap-dependent translation. The Ser-64 and Ser-111 sites have been proposed to have key roles in controlling the association of PHAS-I and eIF4E. To determine whether the effects of insulin require these sites, we assessed the control of PHAS-I proteins having Ala-64 or Ala-111 mutations. The results indicate that phosphorylation of neither site is required for insulin to promote release of PHAS-I from eIF4E. Also, the mutation of Ser-111, which has been proposed to serve as a necessary priming site for the phosphorylation of other sites in PHAS-I, did not affect the phosphorylation of Thr-36/45, Ser-64, or Thr-69. Insulin promoted the release of eIF4E from PHAS-II, a PHAS isoform that lacks the Ser-111 site, but it was without effect on the amount of eIF4E bound to the third isoform, PHAS-III. The results demonstrate that contrary to widely accepted models, Ser-64 and Ser-111 are not required for the control of PHAS-I binding to eIF4E in cells, implicating phosphorylation of the Thr sites in dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex. The findings also indicate that PHAS-II, but not PHAS-III, contributes to the control of protein synthesis by insulin.

Brunn G.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ser-111 site is found in mammalian PHAS-I proteins, but not in the PHAS-I proteins from other vertebrates such as chicken or fish, or in mammalian PHAS-II or PHAS-III (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Brunn G.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ser-82 is less conserved than the other (Ser/Thr)-Pro sites, and phosphorylation of Ser-82 in vitro does not inhibit binding to eIF4E (11Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, in cells, this site appears to contain relatively little phosphate and it is insensitive to insulin (7Fadden P.

There is a great deal of interest in the phosphorylation of the other two Ser phosphorylation sites, Ser-64 and Ser-111. Ser-64 undergoes the most dramatic increase in phosphorylation in response to insulin (12Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of Ser-111 has been suggested to serve as a priming event, which is necessary for both the phosphorylation of other sites in PHAS-I and the dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex (8Heesom K.J.

A construct (pKH3PHAS-III) for expressing HA-tagged PHAS-III in cells was generated by excising PHAS-III cDNA from pGEX-2T with BamHI and EcoRI and inserting it between these sites in pKH3 (20Mattingly R.R.

To prepare an expression vector for FLAG-tagged eIF4E (pCMV-Tag 2BeIF4E), EcoRI sites were added to the ends of human eIF4E cDNA by using the polymerase chain reaction with 5′-GGAATTCATGGCGACTGTCGAACCGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTAAACAACAAACCTATTTTTAG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The product was digested with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of pCMV-Tag 2B (Stratagene). PHAS and eIF4E clones having the proper orientation were selected by restriction mapping.

Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells (2.5 × 106) were seeded into 150-mm dishes and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. A modified CaPO4 procedure was used to introduce DNA (34 μg each of the PHAS-I and eIF4E expression constructs or the pCMV-Tag 2B or pCMV-Tag 3A vectors) into the cells (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the precipitated DNA for 4 h. The medium was then replaced, and the cells were cultured in growth medium. After 15 h, cells from each 150-mm dish were removed using 0.02% trypsin, seeded into six 60-mm-diameter culture dishes, and cultured for 36 h. This procedure provided equal expression of proteins among treatment groups. The cells were serum-starved prior to incubations with insulin and/or rapamycin. For serum starvation, the growth medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Intergen) and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 h. The Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced with buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and the cells were incubated for 1.5 h. Cells were incubated with or without rapamycin (20 nm) for 1 h and then incubated for an additional 30 min after adding insulin (100 milliunits/ml) and/or amino acids (2.5× minimum essential medium amino acid mixture). To terminate the incubations, the cells were placed on ice, rinsed with chilled lysis buffer minus Nonidet P-40, and then immediately scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm microcystin, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The samples were mixed at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min before the supernatants were retained for analyses. Extract protein concentrations were adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml by adding lysis buffer. Protein was measured by using bicinchoninic acid (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Immunoprecipitation of PHAS-I·eIF4E Complexes—eIF4E proteins bound to epitope-tagged PHAS proteins were isolated by incubating extracts (0.5 ml) for 18 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) (10 μl of packed beads), 0.2% IgG-free bovine serum albumin, and 5 μg of the 9E10 monoclonal antibody for Myc-tagged PHAS-I and PHAS-II proteins or with 5 μg of 12CA5 for HA-tagged PHAS-III. Immune complexes bound to the beads were recovered by centrifugation. The beads were washed twice (1 ml/wash) with lysis buffer and twice with lysis buffer minus Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from the beads by using SDS sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of eIF4E Complexes—eIF4E was partially purified by using m7GTP-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Extract samples (250–300 μg protein) were mixed with 20 μl of m7GTP-Sepharose 4B before the beads were washed essentially as described previously (3Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar).

Electrophoretic Analyses—Samples were subjected to electrophoresis using the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to membranes (Immobilon) and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies as described previously (19Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and CDP-Star (Tropix). Signal intensities were determined by scanning laser densitometry of films (Kodak X-Omat AR-5). Influence of Ser-64 on the Control of PHAS-I by Insulin—To determine whether Ser-64 phosphorylation was required for the control of PHAS-I by insulin, a Ser to Ala mutation was introduced in the site to prevent its phosphorylation in cells. Myc epitope-tagged forms of this mutant protein and wild type PHAS-I were transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Overexpressing the translational repressor, PHAS-I, may dramatically decrease cap-dependent translation by decreasing eIF4E availability (4Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of protein synthesis may alter PHAS-I phosphorylation (24Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which would complicate the analyses, we attempted to maintain eIF4E levels by coexpressing FLAG epitope-tagged eIF4E. The transfected cells were treated with insulin, amino acids, and rapamycin before the PHAS-I proteins were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibodies. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were prepared with antibodies to either PHAS-I (Fig. 1A) or eIF4E (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Failure of Ser-64 to Ala mutation to reduce insulin-stimulated dissociation of PHAS-I·eIF4E complexes. HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors and incubated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Myc-tagged PHAS-I proteins were immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody. A, immunoblots were prepared with eIF4E antibody. The arrows point to endogenous eIF4E and FLAG-tagged eIF4E, which migrates more slowly than the endogenous protein when subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), Myctagged wild type PHAS-I appeared in immunoblots as three bands designated α, β, and γ (Fig. 1A). No PHAS-I was detected in immunoprecipitates from the vector control cells, indicating that the signals detected were because of the overexpressed protein. Insulin decreased the α form and increased the γ form (Fig. 1B). Rapamycin opposed these actions of insulin and promoted an increase in the α form. Supplementing the medium with amino acids had little effect on the electrophoretic mobility of PHAS-I in either the absence or presence of insulin. The mobility shifts promoted by insulin and rapamycin result from increases and decreases, respectively, in the phosphorylation of PHAS-I. The shift from β to γ occurs with the phosphorylation of Ser-64 (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Brunn G.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which in the hierarchy of PHAS-I phosphorylation is the last site phosphorylated (10Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P.

As expected, mutating Ser-64 to Ala blocked formation of γ, even in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Although no γ form was present, insulin and rapamycin clearly affected the distribution of PHAS-I between the α and β forms. Indeed, when the α form was expressed as a percentage of the respective PHAS-I protein immunoprecipitated, the mutant protein was indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 1B). Insulin decreased by ∼50% the amounts of both FLAG-eIF4E and endogenous eIF4E that coimmunoprecipitated with wild type PHAS-I (Fig. 2, A and B). This result is consistent with the well established action of the hormone to promote dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Ann. Rev.

Mutating Ser-64 to Ala did not attenuate the response to insulin, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser-64 is not required for dissociation of the complex. Indeed, the amount of eIF4E complexed with Ala-64 PHAS-I was indistinguishable from that bound to wild type PHAS-I after all of the treatments tested (Fig. 2B). Rapamycin attenuated the effects of insulin on increasing the dissociation of eIF4E from both the wild type and mutant PHAS-I proteins. Without insulin, amino acids slightly decreased the amount of eIF4E that coimmunoprecipitated with wild type PHAS-I protein but did not affect the amount of eIF4E that coimmunoprecipitated with Ala-64 PHAS-I. Amino acids did not significantly enhance the effect of insulin on promoting dissociation of eIF4E from either PHAS-I protein (Fig. 2B). Thus, as we have demonstrated previously (9Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the effect of insulin on PHAS-I does not require the addition of amino acids to the medium. Influence of Ser-111 on Control of PHAS-I—An approach similar to that described above for investigating the role of Ser-64 was used to determine whether the phosphorylation of Ser-111 was needed for the control of PHAS-I by insulin. Mutating Ser-111 to Ala was without effect on the electrophoretic mobility of PHAS-I in either the absence or presence of insulin, rapamycin, or amino acids (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the mobility shift assay provided no indication that Ser-111 phosphorylation was required for the phosphorylation of other sites in PHAS-I. However, because phosphorylation of some sites (Thr-36 and Thr-45, for example) has relatively little effect on the electrophoretic mobility of PHAS-I in SDS-PAGE (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Brunn G.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we investigated phosphorylation of different sites by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. In the experiments presented in Fig. 4, wild type PHAS-I and Ala-111 PHAS-I were immunoprecipitated and probed with phosphospecific antibodies to the Thr-36/45, Thr-69, and Ser-64 sites (10Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Insulin increased the reactivity of PHAS-I with all three phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 4, A–D). As noted previously (9Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the effect of insulin on Thr-36/45 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) was less than the effects of the hormone on the phosphorylation of either Ser-64 (Fig. 4C) or Thr-69 (Fig. 4D). The phosphorylation of Ser-64 and Thr-69 was more sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin than the phosphorylation of Thr-36/45. When corrected for protein expression, the reactivities of the three phosphospecific antibodies for wild type and Ala-111 PHAS-I were indistinguishable (Fig. 4, B–D), confirming that Ser-111 phosphorylation is not required for the phosphorylation of Thr-36/45, Ser-64, and Thr-69. Consistent with the lack of effect of the Ala-111 mutation on phosphorylation, eIF4E binding to Ala-111 PHAS-I assessed by coimmunoprecipitation was almost identical to binding of the initiation factor to wild type PHAS-I (Fig. 5, A and B). Effect of Insulin and Rapamycin on PHAS-II and PHAS-III Binding to eIF4E—The five (Ser/Thr)-Pro sites found in PHAS-I are also present in PHAS-II; however, PHAS-II lacks the equivalent of the Ser-111 site (25Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the effects of insulin and rapamycin on the association of PHAS-II and eIF4E. Neither insulin nor rapamycin changed the electrophoretic mobility of PHAS-II (Fig. 6A). This was not unexpected because PHAS-II does not undergo the same shifts in electrophoretic mobility that PHAS-I does when it is phosphorylated (19Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Treating cells with insulin decreased by ∼40% the amount of both FLAG-eIF4E and endogenous eIF4E that coimmunoprecipitated with PHAS-II (Fig. 6B), indicative of dissociation of the PHAS-II·eIF4E complex. To confirm that insulin stimulated the dissociation of PHAS-II and eIF4E, we partially purified eIF4E by using m7GTP-Sepharose to estimate the amount of PHAS-II present in a cap-binding complex with eIF4E (Fig. 6C). Insulin decreased by ∼40% the amount of PHAS-II that copurified with eIF4E. Amino acids did not affect the amount of eIF4E that coimmunoprecipitated with PHAS-II (Fig. 6B) or the amount of PHAS-II that copurified with eIF4E (Fig. 6C) in either the absence or presence of insulin. Rapamycin attenuated but did not abolish the effects of insulin on promoting dissociation of the PHAS-II·eIF4E complex (Fig. 6, B and C). Thus, the association of PHAS-II and eIF4E appears to be controlled by insulin in a manner similar to PHAS-I and eIF4E. We next investigated the effects of insulin, amino acids, and rapamycin on PHAS-III. Similar to PHAS-II, this isoform binds eIF4E, lacks the Ser-111 site (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Brunn G.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and does not undergo a shift in electrophoretic mobility in response to insulin or rapamycin (Fig. 7A). In contrast to both PHAS-I and PHAS-II, PHAS-III did not undergo appreciable dissociation from eIF4E when cells were incubated with insulin (Fig. 7B). Insulin-stimulated dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex in cells has been extensively documented, but relatively little information exists on the control of the other two PHAS isoforms. Results of this study provide the first demonstration that insulin promotes the dissociation of the PHAS-II·eIF4E complex in cells (Fig. 6). The decrease in PHAS-II bound to eIF4E produced by insulin was comparable to the decrease in PHAS-I bound to eIF4E. In contrast, insulin did not decrease the amount of PHAS-III bound to the initiation factor (Fig. 7) (26Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that PHAS-I and PHAS-II, but not PHAS-III, are mediators of insulin action on protein synthesis. Phosphospecific antibodies are not available for the sites in PHAS-II. For this reason, we did not investigate the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of individual sites in this PHAS isoform. However, previous results in 32P-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicate that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of PHAS-II in a rapamycin-sensitive manner (19Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This implies that the control of PHAS-II phosphorylation by insulin is similar to that of PHAS-I, although there must be some difference in the phosphorylation of the two proteins since PHAS-II contains Ala in the position equivalent to Ser-111 in PHAS-I. In view of the well established effect of phosphorylation on binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E, it seems reasonable to conclude that dissociation of the PHAS-II·eIF4E complex resulted from phosphorylation of PHAS-II. Two motifs required for the efficient phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells have been described previously (27Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 28Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The RAIP motif (named for the sequence Arg-Ala-Ile-Pro) is found in the NH2-terminal regions of PHAS-I and PHAS-II, but it is absent in PHAS-III (28Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The TOS (for mTOR signaling) motif is formed by the last five amino acids (Phe-Glu-Met-Asp-Ile) in all three PHAS isoforms (27Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Mutations in either the TOS or RAIP motifs reduced the phosphorylation of overexpressed PHAS-I proteins (27Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 28Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PHAS-I was recently shown to bind to the mTOR-associated protein, raptor (29Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat T. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 30Kim D.-H. Sarbasso D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M.

Oshiro N. Hidayat T. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Mutating either domain also abolished tight binding of PHAS-I to raptor and markedly decreased phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR in vitro (29Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat T. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 31Choi K.M. McMahon L.P. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

The fact that PHAS-I and PHAS-II each contain both motifs may account for similarities in their regulation by insulin. As previously proposed by Wang et al. (26Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a lack of the RAIP motif may explain the relative insensitivity of PHAS-III to insulin. The present finding that Ser-64 phosphorylation is dispensable for insulin-dependent control of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex was surprising in view of previous observations. Ser-64 was identified as the site undergoing the largest increase in phosphorylation in response to insulin even before PHAS-I was identified as an eIF4E-binding protein (12Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies demonstrated that selectively phosphorylating Ser-64 abolished high affinity binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E (3Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More recent measurements of binding affinity of purified proteins by surface plasmon resonance indicate that phosphorylation of this site decreases the affinity for eIF4E by ∼100-fold (14Karim M.M.

Changes in affinity due to phosphorylation of other sites individually were relatively small (11Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. Warwicker J. Scheper G.C. Proud C.G. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20750-20757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, there is the phosphorylation hierarchy in which the three Thr-Pro sites in PHAS-I must be phosphorylated before Ser-64 can be phosphorylated (9Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Gingras A.C. Raught B. Gygi S.P. Niedzwiecka A. Miron M. Burley S.K. Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). These observations contributed to an attractive model in which progressive phosphorylation of the three Thr-Pro sites culminates in the phosphorylation of Ser-64 and dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex (1Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The present findings indicate that this model is incorrect in the sense that Ser-64 is dispensable for insulin-stimulated dissociation of the complex (Fig. 2). Although phosphorylating the Thr-Pro sites in PHAS-I individually had small effects on the affinity of PHAS-I for eIF4E relative to that of phosphorylating Ser-64 (11Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. Warwicker J. Scheper G.C. Proud C.G. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20750-20757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is possible that phosphorylating a combination of the Thr-Pro sites in PHAS-I would produce more pronounced effects. Consequently, the present conclusion that phosphorylation of the Thr-Pro sites is sufficient for insulin-stimulated dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex is not inconsistent with previous studies (11Yang D. Brunn G.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Karim M.M. Hughes J.M.X. Warwicker J. Scheper G.C. Proud C.G. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20750-20757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which did not address the effect of phosphorylating multiple Thr-Pro sites. We cannot exclude the possibility that Ser-64 phosphorylation contributes to the control of the association state of PHAS-I and eIF4E in response to stimuli other than insulin or in manner too subtle to allow detection with the current assays. However, Ser-64 phosphorylation might control other functions of PHAS-I such as PHAS-I binding to raptor. Mutating the five (Ser/Thr)-Pro sites markedly increased the binding of PHAS-I to raptor, suggesting that phosphorylation of PHAS-I promotes dissociation of the PHAS-I raptor complex (33Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Diggle et al. (34Diggle T.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Borthwick A.C. Welsh G.I. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were the first to show that PHAS-I was phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (34Diggle T.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Borthwick A.C. Welsh G.I. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fadden et al. (15Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) identified Ser-111 as the major site of phosphorylation by this kinase in vitro but questioned the role of this site because its phosphorylation was not detected when PHAS-I was immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled rat adipocytes. A possible explanation for the failure to detect Ser-111 phosphorylation in cells was provided by Denton's group, who observed significant phosphorylation of the site only in the PHAS-I that was bound to eIF4E (8Heesom K.J. Avison M.B. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This finding led to the proposal that Ser-111 serves as a priming site whose phosphorylation is necessary for the phosphorylation of other sites in PHAS-I and for dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex. Such a role gained acceptance as a result of a report that mutation of Ser-111 to Ala decreased the phosphorylation of the other sites in PHAS-I overexpressed 293T cells (18Yang D. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The present findings clearly do not support this model. We observe no difference in the electrophoretic mobilities of wild type PHAS-I and Ala-111 PHAS-I, indicating that mutation of Ser-111 does not affect the phosphorylation of sites involved in the mobility shift (Fig. 3). Results of multiple experiments with phosphospecific antibodies demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr-36/45, Thr-69, and Ser-64 were not influenced by mutating Ser-111 to Ala (Fig. 4). Similar results were very recently reported by Wang et al. (26Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings support the conclusion that Ser-111 phosphorylation is not required for the phosphorylation of other sites in PHAS-I. Yang and Kastan (18Yang D. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) proposed that phosphorylation of Ser-111 by ATM mediates insulin-stimulated dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex. This hypothesis was both provocative and exciting, not only because it linked ATM-mediated checkpoint control, insulin action, and cap-dependent protein synthesis, but also because it appeared to identify ATM as an important kinase in insulin action. Although our studies have not directly addressed the role of ATM, it is clear that phosphorylation of Ser-111 is not essential in the control of PHAS-I because mutating Ser-111 to Ala did not prevent the dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex in response to insulin (Fig. 5). The finding that insulin stimulated the dissociation of eIF4E from PHAS-II (Fig. 6), which lacks the Ser-111 site (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Brunn G.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), provides confirmation that phosphorylation of the Ser-111 site is not essential for dissociation of PHAS·eIF4E complexes."

Progesterone triggers oocyte meiosis resumption through a Ras-independent pathway that involves a p39Mos-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases.

Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were used to prevent p39Mos accumulation and Erk-like Xp42Mpk1 activation during insulin-induced Xenopus oocytes maturation. In contrast to previous works, prevention of p39Mos-induced activation of Xp42Mpk1 in insulin-treated oocytes did not inhibit but delayed meiotic resumption, like in progesterone-stimulated oocytes.

Similarly, oocytes treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126, stimulated by insulin exhibited delayed germinal vesicle breakdown, absence of Xp42Mpk1 activation, and partial phosphorylation of Raf. To summarize, whereas p39Mos-induced activation of MEK/MAPK pathway is dispensable for insulin-induced germinal vesicle breakdown, Xp42Mpk1 activation induced by insulin is dependent upon p39Mos synthesis.

Development. 1999; 126: 4537-4546PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Insulin and insulin growth factor can also trigger meiotic resumption (14.El-Etr M. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Baulieu E.E. Science. 1979; 205: 1397-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15.Grigorescu F. Baccara M.T. Rouard M. Renard E. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), through a tyrosine kinase receptor (16.Zhu L. Ohan N. Agazie Y. Cummings C. Farah S. Liu X.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), inducing the activation of the MEK/MAPK pathway via the GTP-binding protein Ras (17.Deshpande A.K. Kung H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18.Korn L.J. Siebel C.W. McCormick F. Roth R.A. Science. 1987; 236: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Xp42Mpk1 activation induced by Ras can be impaired by dominant-negative forms of Raf in Xenopus oocytes and in oocytes extracts (19.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Kosako H. Hattori S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33097-33101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Chie L. Amar S. Kung H.F. Lin M.C. Chen H. Chung D.L. Adler V. Ronai Z. Friedman F.K. Robinson R.C. Kovac C. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Yamaizumi Z. Michl J. Pincus M.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2000; 45: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that activation of MEK in these cases occurs through Raf activity, like in somatic cells (21.Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). However, p39Mos synthesis and accumulation has also been reported after fibroblast growth factor 1 stimulation in Xenopus oocytes expressing fibroblast growth factor receptors (22.Cailliau K. Browaeys-Poly E. Vilain J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and in oocytes treated with insulin (23.Chesnel F. Bonnec G. Tardivel A. Boujard D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ras activation is also known to stimulate Raf-independent pathways (for a review in somatic cells, see Ref. 24.Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway (25.Liu X.J. Sorisky A. Zhu L. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26.Deuter-Reinhard M. Apell G. Pot D. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Kavanaugh W.M. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which leads to activation of protein kinase B/Akt, has been well described because recent data demonstrate a crucial role for protein kinase B/Akt in the insulin-but not progesterone-stimulated resumption of meiosis (28.Andersen C.B. Roth R.A. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18705-18708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29.Andersen C.B. Sakaue H. Nedachi T. Kovacina K.S. Clayberger C. Conti M. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Injections in Xenopus oocytes of V12 H-Ras (30.Dupre A. Suziedelis K. Valuckaite R. de Gunzburg J. Ozon R. Jessus C. Haccard O. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6425-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Raf (31.Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) can trigger meiotic resumption without progesterone stimulation, independently of p39Mos. Moreover, dominant-negative forms of Raf can prevent Mos injection-induced GVBD (31.Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other results showed that dominant-negative forms of Raf do not block Mos-induced MAPK activation in oocyte extracts (32.Shibuya E.K. Morris J. Rapp U.R. Ruderman J.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Raf activation subsequently to Mos injection would be under the control of the MAPK pathway itself (32.Shibuya E.K. Morris J. Rapp U.R. Ruderman J.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). Despite all of these results, the hypothesis that p39Mos might be dispensable to GVBD and MAP kinase activation induced by insulin has not yet been tested in Xenopus oocytes. Therefore, we assessed the role of p39Mos and activation of the Erk-Rsk pathway in maturation induced by insulin stimulation of immature Xenopus oocytes using phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (PS-AS) to prevent p39Mos synthesis and accumulation. Here, we show that activation of Xp42Mpk1 induced by p39Mos is not essential for MPF activation and GVBD induced by insulin. These observations also highlight that the active MEK1/2-Xp42Mpk1 pathway is necessary for full activation of Raf, independently of p39Mos accumulation. Handling of Oocytes—Adult Xenopus females were purchased from the University of Rennes I, France. After anesthesia with 1 g/liter MS222 (tricaine methanesulfonate, Sandoz), ovarian lobes were surgically removed and placed in ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (NaOH)). Full-grown stage VI oocytes (33.Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) were isolated and follicles were removed by collagenase treatment for 30 min (1 mg/ml collagenase A, Roche Applied Science), followed by manual microdissection. Oocytes were stored at 14 °C in ND96 medium until experiments. Experimental Conditions—Phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides were purchased by Eurogentec. The sequence of the antisense against p39Mos mRNA (PS-AS) was AAGGCATTGCTGTGTGACTCGCTGAAAC. As a control we used the inverted sequence GTTTCAGCGAGTCACACAGCAATGCCTT designed as sense oligonucleotides (PS-S) or 20 nl of RNase-free water. 10 ng (20 nl) were microinjected into each oocyte by the use of a positive displacement digital micropipette (Nichiryo). Oocytes were then incubated in OR2 medium (82 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) overnight at 20 °C before insulin (1 μm) or progesterone (4 μg/ml; Sigma) treatment. Purified murine Mos protein (mu-Mos) was kindly provided by Dr. Vande Woude and Dr. Ahn. 37.5 ng (50 nl) were injected into PS-AS-injected oocytes just before hormonal treatment. Control oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water. U0126 (Promega) was made soluble in Me2SO to obtain a stock solution at 50 mm and was used at a final concentration of 50 μm. Treatment began 1 h before insulin or progesterone addition. Control oocytes were treated with Me2SO, 1/1000. Batches were constituted from 30 to 60 oocytes that were observed every half-hour and scored for the appearance of white spot. GVBD50 (time at which 50% of the oocytes showed a white spot) were estimated. The value in hours of GVBD50 can be variable from one female to another. Each experiment was performed on at least 3 females. 3 oocytes were taken off at each time point for kinetic biochemical analysis or at the end of the maturation, respecting the ratio of the white spot, and conserved at –20 °C until homogenization (see below). Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Oocytes were taken off and homogenized in homogenization buffer (34.Azzi L. Meijer L. Ostvold A.C. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13279-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g (4 °C) to eliminate yolk platelets. Proteins were then separated by 10% mini-SDS-PAGE for p39Mos immunodetection, by 12.5% mini-SDS-PAGE for Raf and cyclin B2 immunodetection, or by 17.5% modified mini-SDS-PAGE (23.Chesnel F. Bonnec G. Tardivel A. Boujard D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk immunodetection. Such gels allowed good discrimination between active and inactive proteins (35.Bodart J.F. Bechard D. Bertout M. Gannon J. Rousseau A. Vilain J.P. Flament S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted at 1/1000 in Tris-buffered saline. Xp42Mpk1 was detected using the monoclonal antibody D-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cyclin B2 detection was performed using the rabbit polyclonal antibody JG103 (a gift of Dr. J. Gannon, ICRF, South Mimms, United Kingdom). p39Mos was detected using the polyclonal antibody C238 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p90Rsk detection was performed using the polyclonal antibody C21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Raf was detected using the polyclonal antibody C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were revealed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). p39Mos Inhibition by Antisense Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides during Progesterone-induced Maturation—We have first investigated the effects of PS-AS oligodeoxynucleotides against p39Mos mRNA on progesterone-induced GVBD. Compared with classical phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides (PO), phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (PS) have a sulfur atom instead of an oxygen in the phosphate group, resulting in better nuclease resistance. This extends in vivo longevity of PS and allows better specificity. 10 ng of PS-AS were injected in each oocyte. Control oocytes were injected either with water or 10 ng of PS-S. Oocytes were then incubated overnight at 20 °C in OR2 medium before stimulation by progesterone. In our hands, inhibition of p39Mos synthesis by PS-AS injection did not block GVBD but strongly delayed it (Fig. 1A). To verify if MPF was activated despite of inhibition of p39Mos synthesis, cyclin B2 phosphorylation was assessed, because the latter is relevant for MPF activity (36.Hochegger H. Klotzbucher A. Kirk J. Howell M. le Guellec K. Fletcher K. Duncan T. Sohail M. Hunt T. Development. 2001; 128: 3795-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Bodart J.F. Gutierrez D.V. Nebreda A.R. Buckner B.D. Resau J.R. Duesbery N.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In prophase-arrested oocytes, cyclin B2 is detected as a doublet of two isoforms, corresponding to the non-phosphorylated form of the protein whereas, upon hormonal stimulation, cyclin B2 is only detected under its sole phosphorylated form. Inhibition of translation of p39Mos did not affect phosphorylation of cyclin B2. However, detected amounts of cyclin B2 were drastically lower in anti-sense-injected oocytes than in control injected either with water or with sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B). We verified on Western blot the activation of the MAP kinase pathway by detecting p39Mos synthesis, the phosphorylation of Xp42Mpk1, and the hyperphosphorylation of p90Rsk. Phosphorylation of Xp42Mpk1 is a marker for its activation, which is confirmed by the hyperphosphorylation of p90Rsk. In PS-AS-injected oocytes, p39Mos was minimally detectable and Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk remained unactivated as demonstrated by the absence of an electrophoretic shift, whereas water or sense injection had no or little effect (Fig. 1B). In parallel, shifting up of Raf was also partially inhibited following PS-AS treatment (Fig. 1B). Indeed, on Western blot, Raf was detected in immature oocytes under its non-phosphorylated form. In mature oocytes injected with water or with PS-S, Raf was detected under a shifted up phosphorylated form. But in PS-AS-treated oocytes, progesterone stimulation resulted in detection of Raf as an intermediary shift between non-phosphorylated and completely phosphorylated forms (Fig. 1B). To control for eventual nonspecific effects of PS-AS, purified mu-Mos protein was injected before progesterone stimulation into PS-AS-injected oocytes. We observed that mu-Mos was able to revert all the effects of PS-AS on progesterone treatment (Fig. 1B). Although PS-AS injection appeared to strongly prevent p39Mos accumulation, a small amount of Mos may still accumulate in PS-AS-injected oocytes either stimulated by insulin or progesterone (Figs. 1 and 2). However, it failed to activate Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk because we were unable to detect activated isoforms of Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk. Our results show that phosphorylation of Xp42Mpk1 and of its downstream target p90Rsk induced by progesterone are dependent upon p39Mos synthesis. Moreover, progesterone-induced GVBD occurs even when activation of these pathways are almost completely suppressed. p39Mos Inhibition by Antisense Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides during Insulin-induced Maturation—To test the effects of the inhibition of p39Mos accumulation on GVBD and Raf phosphorylation induced by insulin, oocytes were injected with 10 ng of PS-AS and incubated overnight before stimulation by insulin. Minimal accumulation of p39Mos but no activation of Xp42Mpk1 nor p90Rsk, even transitory, was observed (Figs. 2B and 3). Injection of PS-S had little or no effect on the rate or extent of GVBD in comparison to control oocytes injected with deionized water. In contrast, injection of PS-AS significantly delayed GVBD (Fig. 2A). GVBD50 of PS-S-injected oocytes was 1.12 ± 0.02-fold of GVBD50 of control oocytes, whereas GVBD50 of PS-AS-injected oocytes happened almost two times later than in control water-injected oocytes (1.92 ± 0.09 GVBD50). Inhibition of p39Mos synthesis by PS-AS did not prevent phosphorylation of cyclin B2 (Fig. 2B) but delayed it (not shown). Nevertheless, amounts of cyclin B2 detected in matured oocytes injected with PS-AS were dramatically lower than in control and immature oocytes (Fig. 2B). To control for eventual nonspecific effects of PS-AS, we injected purified mu-Mos protein just before insulin stimulation into oocytes that had been treated with PS-AS. We observed that mu-Mos was able to revert the effects of PS-AS on insulin treatment. GVBD delay was abolished (data not shown), electrophoretic shifts of Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk were observed demonstrating their phosphorylation and normal amounts of cyclin B2 were detected as in control oocytes (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, phosphorylation of Raf was partially inhibited by p39Mos synthesis inhibition in insulin-stimulated oocytes injected with PS-AS (Fig. 2B). Complete phosphorylation was restored by injection of purified mu-Mos protein that also restored Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk activation (Figs. 1B and 2B). To determine whether complete phosphorylation of Raf is dependent upon MAP kinase activity, oocytes were treated with MEK inhibitor U0126 and stimulated by insulin. Whereas U0126 prevented insulin-induced activation of both Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk (Fig. 4B), it did not prevent insulin-induced GVBD. Rather, GVBD was delayed (1.82 GVBD50 of control oocytes; Fig. 4A). In accordance with the previous results, U0126 also reduced cyclin B2 amounts but did not prevent cyclin B2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Partial inhibition of Raf phosphorylation in PS-AS-injected oocytes appeared to result from the absence of Xp42Mpk1 activity rather than the consequence of p39Mos absence itself. Indeed, when U0126-treated oocytes were stimulated with insulin, it triggered p39Mos synthesis even if Xp42Mpk1 activation was prevented. In such conditions, Raf phosphorylation was partial, even in the presence of p39Mos, suggesting that complete phosphorylation of Raf is dependent upon Xp42Mpk1 activity or its downstream effectors (Fig. 4B). These results suggest first that p39Mos is required for insulin-induced activation of MAPK and that insulin can induce GVBD independently of MEK/MAPK activation. Second, activity of the MAP kinases pathway, following p39Mos activation, is required for complete phosphorylation of the MAPKK kinase Raf. Two contradictory approaches have been used before ours to prevent p39Mos synthesis and accumulation during progesterone-induced maturation of Xenopus oocytes: first, PO-AS against p39Mos mRNA were used, which completely inhibited GVBD (9.Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 10.Barrett C.B. Schroetke R.M. Van der Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, morpholino strategy revealed that the p39Mos-Xp42Mpk1 pathway was not required for progesterone-induced GVBD and that PO-AS inhibition of maturation resulted from a nonspecific effect (11.Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In our hands, injection of PS-AS against p39Mos mRNA, followed by progesterone stimulation, greatly diminished p39Mos accumulation and Xp42Mpk1 activation as shown by the absence of phosphorylation of both Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk. However, PS-AS were unable to block GVBD, according to results obtained with morpholinos (Ref. 11.Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and data not shown) and suggesting that, like morpholino oligonucleotides, PS-AS do not have nonspecific effects. We cannot exclude the possibility that the minimal amount of p39Mos may influence GVBD as has been shown to occur previously (38.Peter M. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Mandart E. Development. 2002; 129: 2129-2139PubMed Google Scholar). Results obtained with PO-AS strategy that were used to prevent p39Mos accumulation in insulin-stimulated oocytes have to be reconsidered. Injection of such PO-AS resulted in complete inhibition of GVBD (9.Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 10.Barrett C.B. Schroetke R.M. Van der Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We assessed the effects of the more specific PS-AS on insulin-induced maturation. In contrast to PO-AS (9.Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 10.Barrett C.B. Schroetke R.M. Van der Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), PS-AS injection did not block insulin-induced GVBD. However, insulin failed to activate Xp42Mpk1 independently of p39Mos. This observation was surprising because p39Mos and Raf have been shown in cell-free extracts to independently act to stimulate the Xp42Mpk1 pathway (32.Shibuya E.K. Morris J. Rapp U.R. Ruderman J.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, dominant-negative forms of Raf inhibit Xp42Mpk1 activation induced by oncogenic Ras protein both in Xenopus oocytes and in oocyte extracts (19.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Kosako H. Hattori S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33097-33101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Shibuya E.K. Morris J. Rapp U.R. Ruderman J.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40.Radziwill G. Steinhusen U. Aitken A. Moelling K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All these observations led to the conclusion that, during Ras-induced meiotic resumption, Xp42Mpk1 is under control of Raf. In opposite, following progesterone stimulation, which is independent of Ras, Xp42Mpk1 is under the control of p39Mos (11.Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast to these views, our results indicate that p39Mos is required for Xp42Mpk1 activation following stimulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor by insulin (Fig. 5). Results obtained by inhibition of Raf with dominant-negative forms might be explained by the fact that dominant-negative forms were truncated from their catalytic domains but still contained the Ras-binding domain. Also, these dominant-negative forms may have an inhibitory effect directly on Ras (32.Shibuya E.K. Morris J. Rapp U.R. Ruderman J.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). Most strikingly, Xp42Mpk1 activation by p39Mos but not p39Mos itself appeared to be necessary for complete phosphorylation of Raf because PS-AS partially prevented Raf phosphorylation. Total phosphorylation of Raf was rescued by injection of exogenous mu-Mos protein. Raf has been shown to be activated in response to Ras activity after growth factor stimulation in somatic cells (for a review, see Ref. 21.Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) and it has been proposed that the human oncogenic pathway involved Raf/MEK1/Xp42Mpk1 cascade (10.Barrett C.B. Schroetke R.M. Van der Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Kosako H. Hattori S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33097-33101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Pomerance M. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Pierre M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Insulin-induced activation of Ras might account for partial phosphorylation of Raf observed in PS-AS-injected oocytes. However, interaction between Ras and Raf have been demonstrated to be insufficient to stimulate Raf activity in vitro (43.Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H. Marshall C. Rapp U. Grand R.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3175-3181PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Our results in Xenopus oocytes suggest that Raf activation is a multistep process involving activation of Xp42Mpk1 activity (Fig. 5). In PS-AS-treated oocytes, MPF activation as assessed by cyclin B2 phosphorylation, and GVBD were both delayed but not prevented in contrast to results obtained with PO-AS (9.Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 10.Barrett C.B. Schroetke R.M. Van der Hoorn F.A. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As well, U0126 treatment resulted in such a delay in GVBD and did not prevent MPF activation. p90Rsk and its upstream activator Xp42Mpk1 have been suggested to indirectly activate pre-MPF by inhibiting Myt1 activity (4.Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and their activities, if not necessary for GVBD, are required for timely maturation to occur. In addition, Xp42Mpk1 and p90Rsk have been demonstrated to be responsible for suppression of replication between meiosis I and II and in cyclin B2 stabilization at metaphase II (11.Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 45.Bodart J.F. Flament S. Vilain J.P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, absence of activity of these proteins could explain the decrease of the cyclin B2 level in the cells. As observed in U0126-treated oocytes, p39Mos synthesis induced by insulin is mainly controlled, if not totally, by a Xp42Mpk1-independent mechanism. In contrast to reported involvement of MAPK in a feedback loop that controls p39Mos synthesis (46.Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), our results strengthen the observations that MPF-dependent mechanisms might positively regulate p39Mos synthesis (47.Ballantyne S. Daniel Jr., D.L. Wickens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1633-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 48.Frank-Vaillant M. Jessus C. Ozon R. Maller J.L. Haccard O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Indeed, p39Mos accumulation can be observed in U0126-treated oocytes stimulated to resume meiosis either with progesterone (13.Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Taieb F.E. Lewellyn A.L. Qian Y.W. Maller J.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or by egg cytoplasm injection. 2C. Sellier and J.-F. Bodart, unpublished observations. MPF could exert its positive control on p39Mos accumulation by phosphorylating and stabilizing the p39Mos oncoprotein (49.Castro A. Peter M. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Vigneron S. Galas S. Lorca T. Labbe J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or by phosphorylating directly or indirectly the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein whose activation is necessary for p39Mos mRNA polyadenylation. Indeed, p39Mos mRNA polyadenylation has been shown to be a crucial step in p39Mos synthesis (3.Barkoff A. Ballantyne S. Wickens M.

Then, insulin is able to induce p39Mos accumulation in U0126-treated oocytes through activation of MPF independently of Xp42Mpk1.

Nevertheless, involvement of MAPK family members in insulin-induced G2/M transition other than Xp42Mpk1 should not be discarded because p38MAPK have been involved in proliferation in many cell types (53.Nebreda A.R.

Then, both might be able to indirectly activate pre-MPF stored in prophase-arrested oocytes by the above mentioned mechanisms. To conclude, our results showed that Xenopus oocyte provides us the first known model of the tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway implying the proto-oncogene p39Mos in the MAP kinases pathway activation. It gives us unique opportunities for analyzing linear pathways and interdependences of complex signal transduction of Ras-dependent and independent pathways. We gratefully thank Dr. N.

https://openalex.org/W1973119106,"Transformation of fibroblasts by V-SEA involves activation of the ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Effector proteins that are key mediators of the ERK and PI3K pathways, namely Grb2, the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2 and PI3K, interact with the two phosphotyrosines found in the bidentate motif in the carboxy-terminal region of V-SEA. Genetic analysis demonstrated that while Y557 was a primary binding site and thus activator of the PI3K-Akt pathway, Y564 also contributed to the activation of this pathway. Y564 was located within a Grb2-binding motif, this raised the possibility that a protein that associated with Grb2 might be important for this PI3K activation. The scaffolding proteins Gab1 and/or Gab2 were candidates for this role. In this report, we demonstrate that V-SEA preferentially interacts with Gab2. Furthermore by using Gab2 null fibroblasts, we demonstrate that Gab2 is essential for fibroblast transformation by V-SEA. Using mutant forms of Gab2, we show that activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway via Gab2 is required for V-SEA-induced transformation. However, efficient fibroblast transformation also requires the SHP2 interaction site on Gab2."
https://openalex.org/W2142048171,"In models of type 1 diabetes, cytokines induce pancreatic β-cell death by apoptosis. This process seems to be facilitated by a reduction in the amount of the islet-brain 1/JNK interacting protein 1 (IB1/JIP1), a JNK-scaffold with an anti-apoptotic effect. A point mutation S59N at the N terminus of the scaffold, which segregates in diabetic patients, has the functional consequence of sensitizing cells to apoptotic stimuli. Neither the mechanisms leading to IB1/JIP1 down-regulation by cytokines nor the mechanisms leading to the decreased capacity of the S59N mutation to protect cells from apoptosis are understood. Here, we show that IB1/JIP1 stability is modulated by intracellular calcium. The effect of calcium depends upon JNK activation, which primes the scaffold for ubiquitination-mediated degradation via the proteasome machinery. Furthermore, we observe that the S59N mutation decreases IB1/JIP1 stability by sensitizing IB1/JIP1 to calcium- and proteasome-dependent degradation. These data indicate that calcium influx initiated by cytokines mediates ubiquitination and degradation of IB1/JIP1 and may, therefore, provide a link between calcium influx and JNK-mediated apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells.

Recently it was shown that glucose-induced human β-cell apoptosis is blocked by IL-1 receptor antagonist and that the source of IL-1β is the β-cell itself, indicating that immunological and metabolic stimuli converge on common effector pathways leading to β-cell failure in both main types of diabetes (12.Maedler K.

In β-cells, JNK is responsive to cytokines probably through a transduction complex including the upstream mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase elements (13.Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The scaffold protein IB1/JIP1 ensures the formation, compartmentalization, and specificity of this physically ordered signaling module, so that a defined pool of JNK might be recruited by specific physiological stimuli (such as cytokines) but protected from activation by irrelevant ones (14.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). At the same time, IB1/JIP1 exerts an anti-apoptotic function probably by controlling the access of the activated JNKs to their downstream targets (13.Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This might be achieved by retaining JNK in specific subcellular localizations (mainly cytoplasmic) and preventing its access to some of its substrates, e.g. the nuclear transcription factor c-Jun or activating transcription factor-2. Indeed, the binding of IB1/JIP1 to JNK through the JNK-binding domain, a domain shared by many other substrates such as IRS-1 or c-Jun (15.Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), is 100 times stronger than the interaction of JNK to its other substrates (16.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This strong affinity of IB1/JIP1 for JNK effectively anchors JNK in the cytoplasm and prevents its interaction through the JNK-binding domain with most of its downstream substrates (including cytoplasmic ones) and their subsequent activation. In this model, degradation of IB1/JIP1 would free JNK and allow it both to enter the nucleus and to access its substrates, including c-Jun, activating transcription factor-2, and others. This event would seem to be a prerequisite for JNK-induced apoptosis. The rapid JNK activation induced by treatment with cytokines is associated with a delayed reduction in the IB1/JIP1 content of β-cells, followed by apoptosis (13.Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of β-cells to apoptosis is even increased if IB1/JIP1 is mutated (S59N). This mutation was previously linked to a familial type 2 diabetes (17.Waeber G. Delplanque J. Bonny C. Mooser V. Steinmann M. Widmann C. Maillard A. Miklossy J. Dina C. Hani E.H. Vionnet N. Nicod P. Boutin P. Froguel P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the regulation of the IB1/JIP1 level might be important in deciding the cell-death or survival response. The mechanism leading to a reduction of IB1/JIP1 content in response to cytokines is unclear, but could be linked to calciumentry, as cytokines (IL-1β + IFNγ) were also shown to mediate a low voltage-activated Ca2+ current (18.Wang L. Bhattacharjee A. Zuo Z. Hu F. Honkanen R.E. Berggren P.O. Li M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1200-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to characterize and identify the protease(s) responsible for the cytokine-induced down-regulation of IB1/JIP1 in β-cells. Two major proteolytic pathways are known to operate in mammalian cells, the proteasome and the cysteine proteases, including the caspases, the calpains, and the lysosomal acidic cathepsins. Among them, calpains and some caspases are calcium-dependent. Here we show that calcium influx initiates ubiquitination and degradation of IB1/JIP1, and that this process seems to control the sensitivity of pancreatic β-cells to apoptotic stimuli. We also observed that the S59N point mutation in IB1/JIP1, linked to type 2 diabetes, sensitizes IB1/JIP1 to the calcium- and proteasome-dependent degradation. Plasmids, Peptides, and Antibodies—The rat IB1 sequence was cloned into the expression vector pBK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the mutated form (S59N), and the N-terminal isoform (M101) of the protein. Anti-IB1 antibody raised against amino acid 1–280 of the protein has been described (8.Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG agarose resin and anti-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. The JNKI1, mutated JNKI1, and SH3 peptides were designed by us and synthesized by Auspep (Parkville, Australia). Cell Lines—The HeLa cell line and the insulin-secreting βTC-3 cell line were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, and 2 mmol/liter glutamine. The calcium chelator BAPTA/AM was added at a concentration of 10 μm 60 min before the addition of 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Apoptotic cells were counted 20 h after the addition of 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 by propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 staining (13.Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A minimum of 1000 cells were counted in duplicate for each experiment. The calpain inhibitor calpastatin was added at a concentration of 5 μm 60 min before the addition of the cytokines (10 ng/ml of IL-1β, 10 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor-α, and 100 units/ml of IFN-γ) and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was added at a concentration of 20 μm 60 min before the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187. Transfections and Whole Cell Lysate—3 × 105 cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmids in 10-cm dishes using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) following instructions from the manufacturer. After 48 h of transfection, cellular extracts were prepared by scraping cells in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and anti-proteases). Debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm and 4 °C. In Vitro Calcium Assay and Western Blotting—Increasing concentrations of CaCl2 were added to 20 μg of cellular extracts supplemented with 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 5 mm cystein, and 1 mm ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubating the membrane with a blocking solution (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dried milk powder) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunochemical detection of IB1 protein was performed using purified antiserum at 1:2000 dilution. After rinsing with washing buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20), the immune complex was detected by using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Pull-down Experiments—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-IB1 expression vector. After 48 h, cells were lysed, and 500 μg of crude extracts were incubated 60 min with 3 mm CaCl2. Anti-FLAG agarose affinity resin was added, and incubation was performed 3 h at 4 °C. After five washes, FLAG-IB1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-IB1 or anti-ubiquitin antibodies. PCR Amplification and Coupled Transcription/translation Reaction (TNT)—Amplifications were performed in 100-μl reaction mixtures containing 200 μm dNTP, 1 μm primers, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 units AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 2% formamide. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, ×30 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. Specific primers were used to amplify rat IB1 (GenBank™ accession number AF108959): PBKF: TTACGCCAAGCTCGAAATT; IB1 934R: CTCGAGCCGCACAT; IB1 1068R: CCTGCAGTTACAGAGTAAGC; IB1 1402R: GGCCTCCTCATATTCCTCAC; IB1 1570R: ATGCTCCTCCCCATTGA; and IB1 1769R: GCCATGTGCTCAGGC. 35S-radiolabeled full-length or truncated IB1 protein was produced by the TNT system from plasmid DNA (pBK/IB1) or PCR products as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Kinase Assay—Activated recombinant JNK2 was added to a radiolabeled TNT product with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP. The alkaline (0.2 units/μl) and acidic phosphatases (0.5 μg/μl) and the peptides JNKI1 (40 μm), mutated JNKI1 (40 μm), and SH3 (40 μm) were added 15 min before the addition of JNK2. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to check for equal loading of the samples, dried, and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Calcium Ionophore-induced IB1/JIP1 Degradation and βTC-3 Cell Apoptosis—Cytokines induce pancreatic β-cell apoptotic signaling. Chronic exposure to cytokines reduces the level of IB1/JIP1 in the βTC-3 cell line and increases the apoptotic rate (13.Bonny C. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Schorderet D.F. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Exposure to cytokines was shown recently to induce an increase in the basal cytoplasmic free calcium concentration through the low voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, which was associated with apoptosis (18.Wang L. Bhattacharjee A. Zuo Z. Hu F. Honkanen R.E. Berggren P.O. Li M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1200-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether increased intracellular calcium concentration and IB1/JIP1 degradation were correlated, we exposed the βTC-3 cell line to 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 for 20 h, after which the IB1/JIP1 content was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). The upper band is the full-length protein and the lower one is most likely the product of a translation beginning at Met-101 (20.Kim I.J. Lee K.W. Park B.Y. Lee J.K. Park J. Choi I.Y. Eom S.J. Chang T.S. Kim M.J. Yeom Y.I. Chang S.K. Lee Y.D. Choi E.J. Han P.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1335-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Compared with control βTC-3 cells, A23187 led to a 10-fold decrease in IB1/JIP1 content (both full-length and Met-101 forms), which is equivalent to the down-regulation induced by a 48-h exposure to cytokines (Fig. 1A). We also evaluated the number of apoptotic β-cells with a combination of propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining (19.Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Culture in the presence of A23187 (24 h) or cytokines (48 h) induced in βTC-3 cells a 10-fold and an 8-fold increase in apoptotic rate, respectively (Fig. 1B). When exposure to ionophore was extended to 48 h, a massive cell death was observed (>50%), which led us to perform the following experiments over a period of 20 h. BAPTA-AM was used to chelate intracellular calcium to confirm that the ionophore-induced degradation of IB1/JIP1 was calcium-dependent. BAPTA-AM is a selective cell-permeable calcium chelator which is a structural analogue of EGTA. When BAPTA-AM enters cells, the four acetoxymethyl ester (-AM) groups are cleaved off by endogenous intracellular esterases, making the BAPTA molecule negatively charged and trapping it intracellularly in the cytosol. Because BAPTA was toxic for βTC-3 cells and induced a rapid and massive cell death, we transfected HeLa cells with an expression vector encoding IB1/JIP1. After 24–36 h of transfection, cells were pre-treated for 1 h with BAPTA-AM (10 μm) prior to 20 h of ionophore treatment (1 μm). The 6-fold IB1/JIP1 degradation initiated by ionophore was totally prevented by BAPTA. BAPTA alone even stabilized IB1/JIP1 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the degradation mediated by the ionophore depends upon intracellular calcium concentration. Calpains Are Not Involved in Calcium-dependent IB1 Degradation—Several protease families such as calpains and some caspases are calcium-dependent. Calpains are non-lysosomal cystein proteases that catalyze the endoproteolytic cleavage of specific substrates by a calcium-dependent process. As IB1/JIP1 degradation requires calcium, we first investigated whether calpains are the calcium-activated proteases responsible for IB1/JIP1 degradation. We pre-treated βTC-3 cells with a specific calpain inhibitor, the calpastatin peptide, before exposure to cytokines. Western blotting showed that a 24-h exposure to cytokines induced the preferential proteolysis of the M101 form of IB1/JIP1, which was not prevented by calpastatin (Fig. 3A), suggesting that calpains are not required for IB1/JIP1 degradation. We also performed in vitro IB1/JIP1 digestion with recombinant calpain II. As predicted by the inhibition experiments with the calpastatin peptide, IB1/JIP1 was not cleaved by calpain II (data not shown). However, these in vitro digestions revealed a mobility shift in IB1/JIP1 migration in the presence of high calcium concentration. High Calcium Concentration-induced IB1/JIP1 Degradation in βTC-3 Cellular Extracts—To confirm the correlation between IB1/JIP1 modification and high calcium concentrations, we performed in vitro dose-response experiments with cell extracts (called “in vitro calcium assay” in the following). Aliquots of βTC-3 cells extracts were incubated in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of calcium for 30 min at 30 °C. Increasing calcium concentration (0–6 mm) induced IB1/JIP1 modification: the IB1/JIP1 band detected by Western blot was shifted at 3 mm calcium (Fig. 4A) and at very high calcium concentration (6 mm), the shifted IB1/JIP1 disappeared, i.e. the amount of IB1/JIP1 in cell extracts was reduced by >95% (Fig. 4A). In the presence of EGTA, high calcium concentration had no effect on IB1/JIP1 (Fig. 4B). Calcium did not modulate β-tubulin stability (Fig. 4A), and the migration pattern of βTC-3 proteins remained unchanged after a high dose calcium treatment compared with untreated cell extracts (data not shown). To verify the cation specificity in the IB1/JIP1 degradation, we tested the in vitro effect of high monovalent and divalent ion concentration on IB1/JIP1 stability. We did not observe any specific modification or degradation of IB1/JIP1 with any ions (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Zn2+) other than calcium (data not shown). The Proteasome Is Involved in IB1/JIP1 Degradation Mediated by Calcium—The ubiquitin-proteolytic pathway is a major system for selective protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. One of the first steps in the process includes selective modification of lysine residues in the target protein by ubiquitination, which will cause a shift in the migration of the modified protein as observed with IB1/JIP1 (Fig. 4A). The ubiquitin residues target the protein for further degradation by the proteasome complex. We suspected that ubiquitination was the first calcium-dependent step in IB1/JIP1 modification. Because there is no ubiquitin ligase inhibitor available, we used lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, to block protein degradation. To determine whether ionophore-induced IB1/JIP1 degradation is mediated by the proteasome pathway, HeLa cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding IB1/JIP1. The HeLa cell line was used in this experiment, as lactacystin induced a high apoptotic rate in βTC-3 cells. After 24–36 h of transfection, cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 20 μm lactacystin, prior to 20 h of exposure to ionophore. To normalize the transfection rate, HeLa cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the FLAG-tagged EGFP protein. The IB1/JIP1 content, determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-IB1 antibody, was decreased after 20 h of ionophore treatment, and lactacystin partially blocked IB1/JIP1 degradation induced by the ionophore (Fig. 5A). The FLAG-tagged EGFP protein level, examined by immunoblot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody, remained unchanged (Fig. 5A). Pull-down experiments provided further evidence for IB1/JIP1 ubiquitination. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged IB1. Cell lysates were subjected to in vitro calcium assay, and the FLAG-IB1 was pulled down using an anti-FLAG resin. The immunoprecipitated FLAG-IB1 was subjected to anti-IB1 and anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting. Polyubiquitinated IB1 products were detected only in cells transfected with FLAG-IB1 but not in untransfected cells (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that IB1/JIP1 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. JNK Targets IB1/JIP1 for Ubiquitination—Because ubiquitination targets IB1/JIP1 to efficient degradation by means of the proteasome pathway, we next investigated which mechanisms marked IB1/JIP1 for a calcium-dependent ubiquitination. IB1/JIP1, which tightly associates with JNK via JNK-binding domain, is phosphorylated at Thr-103 by JNK (21.Nihalani D. Wong H.N. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28694-28702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was previously demonstrated that the JNK substrates c-Jun as well as activating transcription factor-2, JunB, and p53 are targeted for ubiquitination by their association with JNK (22.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Fuchs S.Y. Xie B. Adler V. Fried V.A. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

IB1/JIP1 phosphorylation induced a mobility shift (Fig. 6A) that was inhibited by alkaline phosphatase and JNKI1, a peptide previously described to prevent the interaction of JNK with certain of its targets through JNK-binding domain (11.Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and, therefore, to inhibit IB1/JIP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). In contrast, mutated JNKI1 and nonspecific inhibitory (SH3) peptides, which do not alter the interaction of JNK with IB1/JIP1, had no effect on IB1/JIP1 degradation. To assess whether phosphorylation affected IB1/JIP1 stability at high calcium concentration in vitro, we performed an in vitro calcium assay with non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated IB1/JIP1. As shown in Fig. 6B, IB1/JIP1 stability was impaired when IB1/JIP1 was phosphorylated before the addition of a high calcium concentration. In the presence of the JNKI1, IB1/JIP1 stability was increased at high calcium concentration (Fig. 6B). To test the kinase specificity of IB1/JIP1 phosphorylation in vitro and modification of stability, we replaced JNK2 with ERK2 or cdc2/p34 kinases in in vitro calcium assays. The IB1/JIP1 mobility shift caused by phosphorylation by JNK2 was not observed after treatment with ERK2 or cdc2/p34 (Fig. 6C). In addition, no ubiquitination was found at high calcium concentration when IB1/JIP1 was incubated previously with ERK2 or cdc3/p34 (Fig. 6C). An Element from Amino Acid 328 to Amino Acid 437 Is Involved in the Ubiquitination Process of IB1/JIP1—We observed that phosphorylation by JNK affected IB1/JIP1 stability at high calcium concentration in vitro. To localize a domain responsible for JNK phosphorylation and/or for calcium-dependent ubiquitination, we produced IB1/JIP1 deletion mutants. IB1/JIP1 mutants truncated at the C terminus to encode residues 1–281, 1–327, 1–438, 1–493, and 1–559 were generated by PCR coupled to a transcription/translation reaction. The truncated proteins were then phosphorylated by JNK2, which induced a mobility shift (Fig. 7) that is in agreement with the recent work of Nihalani et al. (21.Nihalani D. Wong H.N. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28694-28702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showing IB1/JIP1 phosphorylation at Thr-103. The phosphorylated form of the proteins was exposed to increasing calcium concentrations. We observed that amino acid 1–327 was insensitive to calcium-dependent modifications (Fig. 7). In contrast, amino acid 1–438 was normally subjected to ubiquitination. These data strongly suggested that a domain localized between amino acid 328 and amino acid 438 destabilizes IB1/JIP1 at high calcium concentrations and is necessary for IB1/JIP1 ubiquitination. The S59N IB1 Mutation Destabilized the Protein—The S59N point mutation in IB1/JIP1, linked to type 2 diabetes, was shown previously to increase the sensitivity of cells to IL-1β pro-apoptotic stimuli (17.Waeber G. Delplanque J. Bonny C. Mooser V. Steinmann M. Widmann C. Maillard A. Miklossy J. Dina C. Hani E.H. Vionnet N. Nicod P. Boutin P. Froguel P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To compare the stability of the wild-type IB1/JIP1 to the mutated S59N form and to the truncated N-terminal isoform (M101), HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vectors encoding the three proteins. Whole cell extracts were obtained, and aliquots were subjected to in vitro calcium assays. We observed that a calcium-mediated shift of the full-length wild-type IB1/JIP1 first occurred at 2 mm calcium concentration (Fig. 8). Both the mutated and truncated forms of IB1/JIP1 were already modified at 1.6 mm calcium concentration, which suggested that the N-terminal part of IB1/JIP1 stabilized the protein. Tubulin stability was not changed. The higher sensitivity of the M101 form to calcium-dependent ubiquitination correlates with the higher sensitivity of M101 to cytokines. Indeed, after a 24-h exposure to cytokines, only the lower band of IB1 was degraded (Fig. 3). 24 additional hours of exposure were necessary to observe the degradation of the upper band (Fig. 1A). β-cell loss in type 1 diabetes mellitus seems to be essentially an apoptotic process initiated by the coordinate cytokine secretions of the immune cells surrounding the inflamed islets (26.Eizirik D.L. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2115-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The regulatory intracellular signaling network engaged by the binding of IL-1β, potentiating tumor necrosis factor-α and IFNγ to their receptors (which leads to apoptosis), represents a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. IB1/JIP1 is a promising tool for the prevention of β-cell loss. IB1/JIP1, which is highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells, plays an anti-apopt"

https://openalex.org/W1986908696,"We have investigated the effects of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) fusion gene NPM-RARalpha on the function of PPARgamma using the monoblastic cell line U937. U937 cells were transduced using a retrovirus carrying NPM-RARalpha. While treatment with the synthetic PPARgamma ligand troglitazone (TG) had no effect on the viability of U937 cells, TG treatment of U937/NPM-RARalpha cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability, dependent upon both the concentration of TG and the level of expression of NPM-RARalpha. Analysis of the cell cycle profile and flow cytometry with annexin V confirmed that these effects of TG were due to induction of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation, and could be blocked by treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Cotreatment of U937/NPM-RARalpha cells with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) abrogated the induction of apoptosis by TG. Induction of apoptosis was seen also in the PML-RARalpha-expressing APL cell line NB4, and in several other atRA-sensitive leukemia cell lines, demonstrating that this effect is limited neither to the monocyte lineage nor to the rare NPM-RARalpha fusion variant. RXRalpha/NPM-RARalpha heterodimers were found to interact directly with a PPARgamma-responsive element in vitro. We conclude that in the presence of X-RARalpha, TG induces cell death due to apoptosis via the caspase pathway. These observations suggest the investigation of PPARgamma ligands as therapeutic agents in acute leukemia."
