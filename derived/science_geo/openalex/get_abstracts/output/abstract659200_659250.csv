Using a peptide array to map the antibody response of plasma from healing patients (12) and heathy patients (6), we identified three immunodominant linear epitopes, two of which correspond to key proteolytic sites on the spike protein (S1/S2 and S2’) known to be critical for cellular entry. We show biochemical evidence that plasma positive for the epitope adjacent to the S1/S2 cleavage site inhibits furin-mediated proteolysis of spike."

https://openalex.org/W3084123356,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mental fatigue on physical activity, technical and decision-making performance during small-sided games. Nine sub-elite soccer players were enrolled in the study. The players performed two small-sided games on two occasions within a crossover experimental design. Before each game, they underwent a mental fatiguing task (Stroop task) and a control task (documentary watching) in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Players’ physical activity, technical, and decision-making performance were obtained during small-sided games by GPS and video scouting. Results showed that distance in acceleration covered per min, negative passes, passing accuracy, and shot accuracy were likely impaired than control task after a mental fatiguing protocol. Decision-making performance of negative passes, passes accuracy, and dribbling accuracy resulted also likely decreased compared with control task. These findings demonstrated that mental fatigue impacted on technical, GPS-derived, and soccer-specific decision-making performance during SSG. In conclusion, avoiding cognitively demanding tasks before playing soccer-specific activities may be advisable to preserve players’ physical activity, technical, and decision-making skills."

Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Methods This was a single-center retrospective cohort study, from 16th March, 2020 to 30th April, 2020; final follow-up on 10th May, 2020. 265 patients consecutively admitted to the non-ICU wards with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were screened for inclusion. 205 patients who developed AHRF (SpO2/FiO2 ≤ 440 or PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300) were only included in the final study. Direct admission to the Intensive care unit (ICU), patients developing composite primary outcome within 24 hours of admission, and patients who never became hypoxic during their stay in the hospital were excluded. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on corticosteroid. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU transfer, intubation, in-hospital mortality, discharge, length of stay, and daily trend of SpO2/FiO2 (SF) ratio from the index date. Cox-proportional hazard regression was implemented to analyze the time to event outcomes. Result Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P = 0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07–0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P– 0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P– 0.172), composite of death or intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; P– 0.002) and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2/FiO2 over time. Conclusion Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital death, composite of intubation or death and individual components of the primary outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3084137412,"The intestinal mucus layer is a physical barrier separating the tremendous number of gut bacteria from the host epithelium. Defects in the mucus layer have been linked to metabolic diseases, but previous studies predominantly investigated mucus function during high-caloric/low-fiber dietary interventions, thus making it difficult to separate effects mediated directly through diet quality from potential obesity-dependent effects. As such, we decided to examine mucus function in mouse models with metabolic disease to distinguish these factors. Here we show that, in contrast to their lean littermates, genetically obese (ob/ob) mice have a defective inner colonic mucus layer that is characterized by increased penetrability and a reduced mucus growth rate. Exploiting the coprophagic behavior of mice, we next co-housed ob/ob and lean mice to investigate if the gut microbiota contributed to these phenotypes. Co-housing rescued the defect of the mucus growth rate, whereas mucus penetrability displayed an intermediate phenotype in both mouse groups. Of note, non-obese diabetic mice with high blood glucose levels displayed a healthy colonic mucus barrier, indicating that the mucus defect is obesity- rather than glucose-mediated. Thus, our data suggest that the gut microbiota community of obesity-prone mice may regulate obesity-associated defects in the colonic mucosal barrier, even in the presence of dietary fiber."
https://openalex.org/W3084329067,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators of plants, including those that produce nut, fruit, and vegetable crops. Therefore, high annual losses of managed honey bee colonies in the United States and many other countries threaten global agriculture. Honey bee colony deaths have been associated with multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including pathogens, but the impact of virus infections on honey bee colony population size and survival are not well understood. To further investigate seasonal patterns of pathogen presence and abundance and the impact of viruses on honey bee colony health, commercially managed colonies involved in the 2016 California almond pollination event were monitored for one year. At each sample date, colony health and pathogen burden were assessed. Data from this 50-colony cohort study illustrate the dynamic nature of honey bee colony health and the temporal patterns of virus infection. Black queen cell virus, deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus, and the Lake Sinai viruses were the most readily detected viruses in honey bee samples obtained throughout the year. Analyses of virus prevalence and abundance revealed pathogen-specific trends including the overall increase in deformed wing virus abundance from summer to fall, while the levels of Lake Sinai virus 2 (LSV2) decreased over the same time period. Though virus prevalence and abundance varied in individual colonies, analyses of the overall trends reveal correlation with sample date. Total virus abundance increased from November 2015 (post-honey harvest) to the end of the almond pollination event in March 2016, which coincides with spring increase in colony population size. Peak total virus abundance occurred in late fall (August and October 2016), which correlated with the time period when the majority of colonies died. Honey bee colonies with larger populations harbored less LSV2 than weaker colonies with smaller populations, suggesting an inverse relationship between colony health and LSV2 abundance. Together, data from this and other longitudinal studies at the colony level are forming a better understanding of the impact of viruses on honey bee colony losses."
https://openalex.org/W3084130734,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in private practices and hospitals in Germany. Design In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted from April 2th to April 16th 2020. Setting The survey was conducted among 15.0000 of 18.000 orthopedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, both in private practices and hospitals. Participants All members of the German Society of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (DGOU) and the Professional Association for Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (BVOU). were invited by e-mail to participate in the survey. Main outcome measures Out of 50 questions 42 were designed to enquire a certain dimension of the pandemic impact and contribute to one of six indices, namely “Preparedness”, “Resources”, “Reduction”, “Informedness”, “Concern”, and “Depletion”. Data was analyzed in multiple stepwise regression, aiming to identify those factors that independently influenced the indices. Results 858 orthopedic and trauma surgeons participated in the survey throughout Germany. In the multiple regression analysis, being employed at a hospital was identified as an independent positive predictor in the indices for “Preparedness”, “Resources”, and “Informedness” and an independent negative predictor regarding “Depletion”. Self-employment was found to be an independent positive predictor of the financial index “Depletion”. Female surgeons were identified as an independent variable for a higher level of “Concern”. Conclusions The study confirms a distinct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in Germany. The containment measures are largely considered appropriate despite severe financial constraints. A substantial lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is reported. The multiple regression analysis shows that self-employed surgeons are more affected by this shortage as well as by the financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals. What are the new findings The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on orthopedic and trauma surgery as an unrelated specialty. Self-employed surgeons are affected especially by a shortage of PPE and financial consequences. How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future Political and financial support can now be applied more focused to subgroups in the field of orthopedics and trauma surgery with an increased demand for support. A special emphasis should be set on the support of self-employed surgeons which are a more affected by the shortage of PPE and financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals."

https://openalex.org/W3083908231,"India, a persistently significant contributor to the global malaria burden, rolled out several anti-malaria interventions at the national and state level to control and recently, to eliminate the disease. Odisha, the eastern Indian state with the highest malaria burden experienced substantial gains shown by various anti-malaria initiatives implemented under the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). However, recalcitrant high-transmission “pockets” of malaria persist in hard-to-reach stretches of the state, characterised by limited access to routine malaria surveillance and the forested hilly topography favouring unbridled vector breeding. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in such pockets serves as perpetual malaria reservoir, thus hindering its elimination. Therefore, a project with the acronym DAMaN was initiated since 2017 by state NVBDCP, targeting locally identified high endemic ‘pockets’ in 23 districts. DAMaN comprised biennial mass screening and treatment, provisioning of long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) and behavioural change communication. Subsequently, to inform policy, assessment of DAMaN was conceived that aims to estimate the coverage of the various components of the project; the prevalence of malaria, even at sub-patent level especially among pregnant/lactating women and children; and its impact on malaria incidence. A survey of DAMaN beneficiaries will measure coverage; and knowledge and practices related to LLIN; along with collection of blood specimens from a probability sample. A multi-stage stratified clustered sample of 2228 households (~33% having pregnant/lactating women) will be selected from 6 DAMaN districts. Routine DAMaN project data (2017–2018) and NVBDCP data (2013–2018) will be extracted. Rapid Diagnostic Test, Polymerase Chain Reaction and blood smear microscopy will be conducted to detect malarial parasitemia. In addition to measuring DAMaN’s coverage and malarial prevalence in DAMaN pockets, its impact will be estimated using pre-post differences and Interrupted Time Series analysis using 2017 as the “inflection” point. The assessment may help to validate the unique strategies employed by DAMaN."
https://openalex.org/W3084043695,"Laboratory mice are the most frequently used animals in biomedical research. In accordance with guidelines for humane handling, several blood sampling techniques have been established. While the effects of these procedures on blood quality and histological alterations at the sampling site are well studied, their impact on the animals' welfare has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, our study aimed to compare three commonly used blood sampling techniques regarding their effects on different indicators of animal welfare, including physiological and behavioural response stress parameters, including pain measures, home-cage behaviour and nest-building as well as exploratory activity and neophobia. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a single blood collection from either the vena facialis, the retrobulbar sinus or the tail vessel, or were allocated to the respective control treatment. While all blood sampling techniques led to an acute increase in plasma corticosterone levels, the response was strongest in animals that underwent sampling from the vena facialis and the retrobulbar sinus. Similar results were observed when the time-course of adrenocortical activity was monitored via corticosterone metabolites from faecal samples. Blood collection from the vena facialis and the retrobulbar sinus also decreased exploration of novel stimuli, resulted in decreased nest-building activity and induced higher scores in the Mouse Grimace Scale. Moreover, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviour were strongly affected after facial vein bleeding. Interestingly, tail vessel bleeding only induced little alterations in the assessed physiological and behavioural parameters. Importantly, the observed effects in all treatment groups were no longer detectable after 24 hours, indicating only short-term impacts. Thus, by also taking the animal's perspective and comprehensively assessing the severity of the particular sampling procedures, the results of our study contribute to Refinement within the 3R concept and allow researchers to objectively select the most appropriate and welfare-friendly blood sampling technique for a given experiment."
https://openalex.org/W3080226101,"Introduction The participants’ experience of low-energy total diet replacement (TDR) programmes delivered by lay counsellors in the community for the routine treatment of obesity is currently unclear. We interviewed a sample of twelve participants who took part in the Doctor Referral of Overweight People to Low-Energy total diet replacement Treatment (DROPLET) trial and were randomised to the TDR programme. Methods We purposively sampled twelve patients who took part in the DROPLET trial, and conducted in-depth telephone interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview questions focused on participants’ experiences and perceptions of the TDR programme. We conducted a thematic analysis, actively developing themes from the data, and used the one sheet of paper (OSOP) technique to develop higher-level concepts. Results Nine key themes were identified; Reasons for taking part, Expectations, Support and guidance from the counsellor, Time to build a personal relationship, Following the TDR Programme, Adverse events, Outcomes from the TDR, Weight Loss Maintenance, Recommending TDR to others. The relationship between participants and the counsellor was central to many of the themes. Close relationships with counsellors facilitated TDR adherence through providing one-to-one support (including during difficult times), sharing expert knowledge, and building a close relationship. Adherence was also supported by the rapid weight loss that patients reported experiencing. Overall participants reported positive experiences of the TDR, and emphasised the positive impact on their wellbeing. Discussion Patients reported that a TDR programme delivered by lay counsellors in the community was a positive experience and effective in helping them to lose weight. Future trials should consider the central role of the person providing support and advice as a key component in the programme."
https://openalex.org/W3083785313,"We reported that maternal PFBS, an emerging pollutant, exposure is positively associated with preeclampsia which can result from aberrant trophoblasts invasion and subsequent placental ischemia. In this study, we investigated the effects of PFBS on trophoblasts proliferation/invasion and signaling pathways. We exposed a human trophoblast line, HTR8/SVneo, to PFBS. Cell viability, proliferation, and cell cycle were evaluated by the MTS assay, Ki-67 staining, and flow cytometry, respectively. We assessed cell migration and invasion with live-cell imaging-based migration assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Signaling pathways were examined by Western blot, RNA-seq, and qPCR. PFBS exposure interrupted cell proliferation and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. PFBS (100 μM) did not cause cell death but instead significant cell proliferation without cell cycle disruption. PFBS (10 and 100 μM) decreased cell migration and invasion, while PFBS (0.1 μM) significantly increased cell invasion but not migration. Further, RNA-seq analysis identified dysregulated HIF-1α target genes that are relevant to cell proliferation/invasion and preeclampsia, while Western Blot data showed the activation of HIF-1α, but not Notch, ERK1/2, (PI3K)AKT, and P38 pathways. PBFS exposure altered trophoblast cell proliferation/invasion which might be mediated by preeclampsia-related genes, suggesting a possible association between prenatal PFBS exposure and adverse placentation."
https://openalex.org/W3083919077,"Objective Define the prevalence of OSA in a population of obese pregnant women. Secondary objectives were to assess its obstetric consequences and define its risk factors in this population. Methods This single-center prospective study took place at the Lille University Hospital from 2010 to 2016 and included pregnant women with a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2. They underwent polysomnography (type 1 sleep testing) between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation to diagnose OSA. Clinical, obstetric, and fetal data were collected monthly and at delivery. We compared the groups with and without OSA and calculated its prevalence. Results This study included 67 women with a mean BMI of 42.4 ± 6.2 kg/m2. Among them, 29 had OSA, for a prevalence of 43.3% (95% confidence interval, 31.4–55.2); it was mild or moderate in 25 women and severe in 4. Comparison of the two groups showed that women in the OSA group were older (31.9 ± 4.7 years vs 29.5 ± 4.8 years, P = .045), had chronic hypertension more frequently (37.9% vs 7.9%, P = .0027), and had a higher mean BMI (43.8 ± 6.2 kg/m2 vs 41.2 ± 6 kg/m2, P = .045). During pregnancy, they developed gestational diabetes more often (48.3% vs 23.7%, P = .04). No significant differences were observed for any of the other criteria studied. Conclusions The prevalence of OSA was high in our study, and women with it developed gestational diabetes during pregnancy more often. No other obstetric complications were observed."
https://openalex.org/W3084151512,"Progress in the study of circulating, cell-free nuclear DNA (ccf-nDNA) in cancer detection has led to the development of noninvasive clinical diagnostic tests and has accelerated the evaluation of ccf-nDNA abundance as a disease biomarker. Likewise, circulating, cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) is under similar investigation. However, optimal ccf-mtDNA isolation parameters have not been established, and inconsistent protocols for ccf-nDNA collection, storage, and analysis have hindered its clinical utility. Until now, no studies have established a method for high-throughput isolation that considers both ccf-nDNA and ccf-mtDNA. We initially optimized human plasma digestion and extraction conditions for maximal recovery of these DNAs using a magnetic bead–based isolation method. However, when we incorporated this method onto a high-throughput platform, initial experiments found that DNA isolated from identical human plasma samples displayed plate edge effects resulting in low ccf-mtDNA reproducibility, whereas ccf-nDNA was less affected. Therefore, we developed a detailed protocol optimized for both ccf-mtDNA and ccf-nDNA recovery that uses a magnetic bead–based isolation process on an automated 96-well platform. Overall, we calculate an improved efficiency of recovery of ∼95-fold for ccf-mtDNA and 20-fold for ccf-nDNA when compared with the initial procedure. Digestion conditions, liquid-handling characteristics, and magnetic particle processor programming all contributed to increased recovery without detectable positional effects. To our knowledge, this is the first high-throughput approach optimized for ccf-mtDNA and ccf-nDNA recovery and serves as an important starting point for clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W3083851392,"The development of a robust microbiome is critical to the health of dairy calves, but relatively little is known about the progression of the microbiome through the weaning transition. In this study, fecal samples were obtained from ten female Holstein calves at 6 timepoints between 2–13 weeks of age. Calves were fed acidified milk until weaning at 8 weeks old and had access to starter grain throughout the study. Fecal samples were extracted for genomic DNA, PCR-amplified for the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and analyzed using the QIIME2 pipeline. Bacterial richness, estimated by number of observed species, and bacterial diversity, estimated by Shannon diversity index, both differed significantly between timepoints and both increased over time (P <0.05), with the largest increases occurring during weaning. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis showed significant differences (P <0.05) between bacterial communities across timepoints; betadisper analysis revealed that the microbiomes of individual calves became more similar with time. Throughout the study, Firmicutes was the dominant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes. Thirteen bacterial genera were found to be significantly influenced by time, including Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, unclassified S24-7, Collinsella, Sharpea, and Treponema. Unclassified Ruminococcaceae was the most prevalent genus at timepoints 1, 3, 5, and 6, but different amplicon sequence variants were detected at each timepoint suggesting the presence of different species of Ruminococcaceae at different times. Bacteroides was the most prevalent genus at timepoint 2, and Prevotella was most prevalent at timepoint 4. Our results indicate that there is considerable variation in the calf microbiome pre-weaning, but the microbial community stabilizes and becomes similar to the adult microbiome at weaning. Further studies to describe the phylogeny and functionality of core microbiota through the weaning transition are needed to improve health and reduce diarrhea in the neonatal period."
https://openalex.org/W3084307740,"Smartphone addiction is a growing social problem with adverse health outcomes. There are few comparative studies in Asia that examine factors associated with smartphone addiction. The current study aimed to address this research gap by presenting a comparative analysis of factors associated with smartphone addiction in Japan and Thailand, two countries heterogeneous in both their level of economic development and culture.Participant data were collected using two population-based surveys. Participants were high school students in grade 11, aged 16-17 years old, and were selected using quota sampling in Japan in 2014 and random sampling in Thailand in 2016. The outcome of interest was smartphone addiction, measured using a modified version of the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with smartphone addiction (gender; nationality; family connectedness; and average time spent on smartphone per day).This study included a total of 7694 students, 6585 students from Japan and 1109 students from Thailand. The prevalence of smartphone addiction was 35.9% among Thai students and 12% among Japanese students. Thai students were more likely to have smartphone addiction than Japanese students (AOR 2.76; 95% CI: 2.37-3.30). Being female was associated with increased odds of smartphone addiction in both Japanese (AOR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.32-1.78) and Thai students (AOR 1.34; 95% CI: 1.01-1.78). The parental connectedness variables ""my parents noticed when I was unhappy"" (AOR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62-0.96) and ""my parents noticed when I did something good"" (AOR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.61-0.99) were associated with lower odds of smartphone addiction among Japanese students.Smartphone addiction was more prevalent among Thai adolescents than Japanese adolescents, and more prevalent among females than males in both countries. Interventions for reducing smartphone addiction should take into account both context and gender, and should leverage the protective effect of parental connectedness."
https://openalex.org/W3084219221,"Nowadays, citizen science has become increasingly popular, especially in Western countries. In Hong Kong, citizen science projects are mostly used for public education, while utilizing citizen scientists in published scientific research is very rare. On the other hand, with the increasing threats to global water security, Hong Kong requires new adaptation and strategy in facing the impairment of local freshwater systems. However, unfortunately, the number of full-scale urban river research appears to be declining. In this regard, citizen science can offer an alternative option as one of the new integrated water management strategies in Hong Kong. In this study, the water quality of seven rivers and streams in Hong Kong was studied monthly for two years by a group of citizen scientists. The main goal is to examine the reliability of data collected by citizen scientists by comparing it with the official data from the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong (EPD). Results show that the water temperature and conductivity data acquired by the citizen scientists were highly comparable to the official data. Also, moderate to strong correlations in water pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen levels were found between citizen scientists and official data. Since the citizen science data remained as high as 70% of relevance to the official data, we believe that this may serve as a supplement to the lacking official or professional water quality monitoring data in Hong Kong. Even though the use of volunteer data in water quality monitoring unavoidably exists with errors and bias, this study demonstrates a successful outcome of utilizing citizen science programme in urban river monitoring in Hong Kong."
https://openalex.org/W3084387056,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) frequently progress to chronicity in infected individuals but the mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying chronic UTI are not well understood. We examined the role of interleukin (IL)-17A in UTI because this cytokine promotes innate defense against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Analysis of UPEC persistence and pyelonephritis in mice deficient in IL-17A revealed that UPEC CFT073 caused infection at a rate higher than the multidrug resistant strain EC958. Il17a−/− mice exhibited pyelonephritis with kidney bacterial burdens higher than those of wild-type (WT) mice. Synthesis of IL-17A in the bladder reflected a combination of γδ-T and TH17 cell responses. Analysis of circulating inflammatory mediators at 24h postinoculation identified predictors of progression to chronicity, including IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Histological analysis identified infiltrating populations of neutrophils, NK cells, and γδ T cells in the bladder, whereas neutrophils predominated in the kidney. Analysis of the contribution of flagella to chronicity using hyper-flagellated and fliC-deficient UPEC in WT and Il17a−/− mice revealed that, in a host that is deficient for the production of IL-17A, flagella contribute to bacterial persistence. These findings show a role for IL-17A in defense against chronic UTI and a contribution of flagella to the pathogenesis of infection."
https://openalex.org/W3084009769,"Objective To evaluate the effect of an oral stimulation program in preterm on the performance in the first oral feeding, oral feeding skills and transition time from tube to total oral intake. Study designer Double-blind randomized clinical trial including very preterm newborns. Congenital malformations, intracranial hemorrhage grade III or IV, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis were excluded. Intervention group (GI) received an oral stimulation program of tactile extra-, peri-, and intraoral tactile manipulation once a day for 15 minutes, during a 10-day period. Control group (GII) received sham procedure with same duration of time. Feeding ability was assessed by a speech-language pathologist blinded to group assignment. The classification of infants’ oral performance was determined by Oral Feeding Skills (OFS). Neonates were monitored until hospital discharge. Results Seventy-four (37 in each group) were randomized. Mean gestational ages and birth weights were 30±1.4 and 30±1.5 weeks, and 1,452±330g and 1,457±353g for intervention and control groups, respectively. Infants in the intervention group had significantly better rates than infants in the control group on: mean proficiency (PRO) (41.5%±18.3 vs. 19.9%±11.6 (p<0.001)), transfer rate (RT) (2.3 mL/min and 1.1 mL/min (p<0.001)) and overall transfer (OT) (57.2%±19.7 and 35.0%±15.7 (p<0.001)). Median transition time from tube to oral feeding was 4 (3–11) and 8 (7–13) days in intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.003). Intake of breast milk was found to reduce transition time from tube feeds to exclusive oral feeding (p<0.001, HR 1.01, 95%CI 1.005–1.019), but the impact of the study intervention remained significant (p = 0.007, HR 1.97, 95%CI 1.2–3.2). Conclusion Infants who were breast-fed and an oral stimulation program proved beneficial in reducing transition time from tube feeding to oral feeding. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03025815."
https://openalex.org/W3083771152,"Measuring the performance of information security is an essential part of the information security management system within organisations. Studies in the past mainly focused on establishing qualitative measurement approaches. Since these can lead to ambiguous conclusions, quantitative metrics are being increasingly proposed as a useful alternative. Nevertheless, the literature on quantitative approaches remains scarce. Thus, studies on the evaluation of information security performance are challenging, especially since many approaches are not tested in organisational settings. The paper aims to validate the model used for evaluating the performance of information security management system through a multidimensional socio-technical approach, in a real-world settings among medium-sized enterprises in Slovenia. The results indicate that information security is strategically defined and compliant, however, measures are primarily implemented at technical and operational levels, while its strategic management remains underdeveloped. We found that the biggest issues are related to information resources and risk management, where information security measurement-related activities proved to be particularly problematic. Even though enterprises do possess certain information security capabilities and are aware of the importance of information security, their current practices make it difficult for them to keep up with the fast-paced technological and security trends."
https://openalex.org/W3083821434,"Background Postnatally, small-for-gestational-age (SGA; birthweight <10th centile) infants who are growth restricted due to uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) demonstrate ‘catch-up growth’ to meet their genetically-predetermined size. Infants who demonstrate slowing growth during pregnancy are those that cross estimated fetal weight centiles at serial ultrasound examinations. These infants that slow in growth but are born appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA; ≥10th centile), exhibit antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal indicators of UPI. Here, we examine if and when these infants (labelled as AGA-FGR) also demonstrate catch-up growth like SGA infants, when compared with AGA infants with normal antenatal growth velocity (AGA-NG). Methods We followed-up the infants of women who had previously undergone ultrasound assessment of fetal size at 28- and 36-weeks’ gestation, enabling calculation of antenatal growth velocity. To assess postnatal growth, we asked parents to send their infant’s growth measurements, up to two years post-birth, which are routinely collected through the state-wide Maternal-Child Health service. Infants with medical conditions affecting postnatal growth were excluded from the analysis. From the measurements obtained we calculated age-adjusted z-scores for postnatal weight, length and body mass index (BMI; weight(kg)/height(m2)) at birth and 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months. We used linear spline regression modelling to predict mean weight, length and BMI z-scores at intervals post birth. Predicted mean age-adjusted z-scores were then compared between three groups; SGA, AGA with low antenatal growth (AGA-FGR; loss of >20 customised estimated fetal weight centiles), and AGA-NG to determine if catch-up growth occurred. In addition, we compared the rates of catch-up growth (defined as an increase in weight age-adjusted z-score of ≥0.67 over 1 year) between the groups with Fisher’s exact tests. Results Of 158 (46%) infant growth records received, 146 were AGA, with low antenatal growth velocity occurring in 34/146 (23.2%). Rates of gestational diabetes and SGA birthweight were higher in those lost to follow-up. Compared to AGA-NG infants, AGA-FGR infants had significantly lower predicted mean weight (p<0.001), length (p = 0.04) and BMI (p = 0.001) z-scores at birth. These significant differences were no longer evident at 4 months, suggesting that catch-up growth had occurred. As expected, the catch-up growth that occurred among the AGA-FGR was not as great in magnitude as that demonstrated by the SGA. When assessed categorically, there was no significant difference between the rate of catch-up growth among the AGA-FGR and the SGA. Catch-up growth was significantly more frequent among both the AGA-FGR and the SGA groups compared to the AGA-NG. Conclusions AGA infants that have exhibited reduced antenatal fetal growth velocity also exhibit significant catch-up growth in the first 12 months of life. This finding represents further evidence that AGA fetuses that slow in growth during pregnancy do so due to UPI."
https://openalex.org/W3084115020,"Many campaigns promote the preservation and consumption of leftover food items as a critical household strategy to accomplish national consumer food waste reduction goals. We fill a gap in knowledge about the consumption and creation of leftovers in the United States by analyzing data from a pilot study in which 18 subjects tracked food selection, intake, and plate waste across all eating occasions for about one week. Subjects noted which items selected for consumption were leftovers, i.e., previously prepared but uneaten items that were stored for future consumption, and which unfinished items were saved to become leftovers. We found that 12% of items selected for consumption were leftovers while 24% of selected items that were not fully consumed were kept to become a leftover. Leftovers were most frequently vegetables, cheeses, and meats, and most frequently selected on Mondays and for lunch. Regression analyses isolate significant dining patterns with respect to leftovers, including evidence that leftovers were less likely to be fully consumed than non-leftover items, and that larger meals led to more uneaten food. This suggests that strategies to reduce meal size may be most effective in reducing food waste by limiting the creation of leftovers in the first place. Strategies to make leftovers more attractive and appealing may also reduce food waste."
https://openalex.org/W3084255067,"A model that recapitulates development of acquired therapeutic resistance is needed to improve oncology drug development and patient outcomes. To achieve this end, we established methods for the preparation and growth of spheroids from primary human lung adenocarcinomas, including methods to culture, passage, monitor growth, and evaluate changes in mutational profile over time. Primary lung tumor spheroids were cultured in Matrigel® with varying concentrations of erlotinib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is ineffective against KRAS mutant cells. Subtle changes in spheroid size and number were observed within the first two weeks of culture. Spheroids were cultured for up to 24 weeks, during which time interactions between different cell types, movement, and assembly into heterogeneous organoid structures were documented. Allele-specific competitive blocker PCR (ACB-PCR) was used to quantify low frequency BRAF V600E, KRAS G12D, KRAS G12V, and PIK3CA H1047R mutant subpopulations in tumor tissue residue (TR) samples and cultured spheroids. Mutant subpopulations, including multiple mutant subpopulations, were quite prevalent. Twelve examples of mutant enrichment were found in eight of the 14 tumors analyzed, based on the criteria that a statistically-significant increase in mutant fraction was observed relative to both the TR and the no-erlotinib control. Of the mutants quantified in erlotinib-treated cultures, PIK3CA H1047 mutant subpopulations increased most often (5/14 tumors), which is consistent with clinical observations. Thus, this ex vivo lung tumor spheroid model replicates the cellular and mutational tumor heterogeneity of human lung adenocarcinomas and can be used to assess the outgrowth of mutant subpopulations. Spheroid cultures with characterized mutant subpopulations could be used to investigate the efficacy of lung cancer combination therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3084350071,"Aim Exotic species’ introductions together with extinction of native species represent the main mechanisms driving biotic homogenization of freshwater fish assemblages around the world. While generally ichtyofaunistic realms transit towards biotic homogenization, for conservation purposes it is essential to understand what specific mechanisms are promoting it on particular areas or regions. Here, we report the occurrence of biotic homogenization in 29 Chilean watersheds, analyzing its β-diversity (including turnover and nestedness) and predicting future trends. Location Continental Chile (18o–56o S). Methods We determined fish composition per basin for historical and current assemblages; extant native, exotic, and extinct species were recorded as 1 (presence) or 0 (absence) in two matrices basins × species. For each matrix, we calculated the turnover (βsim), nestedness (βnes), and β-diversity (βsor); then, we obtained Δβsim, Δβnes, and Δβsor, as the arithmetical difference between basin pairs over time. In addition, we search for explanatory variables correlating Δβsim, Δβnes, and Δβsor with geographical and land use variables. Finally, simulating events of species introduction (i.e., invasion) and extinction, we generated 15 hypothetical assemblages, looking to establish future trends towards biotic change in Chilean basins. Results Species turnover and β-diversity significantly decreased from historical to current assemblages (Δβsim = -0.084; Δβsor = -0.061, respectively), while the species nestedness did not show significant changes (Δβnes = 0.08). Biotic changes have been driven mainly by the introduction of 28 exotic species, with a minor role of extinctions (one species) and translocations (0 species) of native species. Changes in β-diversity were negatively correlated with area, elevation, and geographical distance between basins but not with land-use nor human population. Finally, the analysis of 15 future assemblages predicts a significant decrease of β-diversity and turnover, and an increase for species nestedness, this time promoted by an increase in the extinction of native species. Main conclusion Chilean basins show a significant decrease of the distributional β-diversity and species turnover of the freshwater fish fauna, evidencing a trend towards biotic homogenization. This trend is shared with other Neotropical basins; however, specific mechanisms driving it show different magnitude. Changes in the β-diversity components do not show correlation with variables associated to land use, thus suggesting that casual introductions of freshwater fishes in Chile follow an opportunistic mode related to commercial use. According to future scenarios simulated, biotic homogenization should increase further, mainly as consequence of increased native extinctions."
https://openalex.org/W3083781869,"Current research examined the differential effects of pills' shape (angular vs. curvy) on the perceived efficacy of the medicine, evoked bodily sensations and emotions. We investigated these effects by using different types of angular vs. curved stimuli: abstract drawn shapes (Study 1), 3D-printed mockup pills (Study 2) and photographs of the existing pills (Study 3). Participants were asked to imagine 'taking' angular and curved pills. They had to focus on the bodily sensations and report the evoked activations/deactivations in different body parts. Across three studies, we found that the angular pills evoke overall more activations in the body compared to curvy pills. We further reported differences in the topography of angular vs. curved pills'-triggered sensations in different body parts. Our results also revealed that angularity is linked with an energizing effect while roundness is associated with a calming effect. The shape effects were demonstrated not only in self-reported energized vs. calm subjective feelings but also in performance on a timed cognitive test. Compared to incongruent designs, pill designs (angular vs. curved) congruent with proposed drug benefits (energizing vs. calming) were perceived as more effective. Moreover, we found differences in emotions triggered by pills of different shapes. The present research provided new findings on angularity vs. curvature perception that may be valuable for cognitive psychology, marketing, pharmaceutical and supplements industry, and other applied fields."
https://openalex.org/W3083938373,"Grassland environments face a number of threats including land use change, changing climate and encroachment of woody plants. In the Southern Plains of the United States, woody plant encroachment threatens traditional agricultural grazing economies in addition to grassland dependent wildlife species. Numerous studies have examined the physical drivers of conversion from grassland to woodland but social drivers may be equally important to understanding the causes of and prescriptions for environmental degradation. In this paper, we report the results of a survey of landowners in the Southern Plains of Texas and Oklahoma in which we asked participants to estimate the current amount of woody plant cover on their land, their preferred amount of woody plant cover and about their perspectives regarding the use of prescribed fire for managing woody plants. Prescribed fire is ecologically and economically one of the most effective tools for maintaining grasslands but many landowners do not use this tool due to lack of knowledge, lack of resources and concerns over safety and legal liability. We found that while most of our respondents did express a desire for less woody plant cover on their land, woody plant preference did not affect landowner’s use of prescribed fire. However, belonging to a prescribed burn association and owning larger properties were correlated with increased use of prescribed fire. Woody plant cover preference was significantly influenced by landownership motivations, with hunters and other recreational motivated landowners preferring more trees and ranchers preferring fewer. This is important because throughout most of our study area, there has been a steady shift from agricultural production to amenity or recreational landownership, a trend that may undermine efforts to restore or maintain open grasslands. Future outreach efforts to promote prescribed fire to maintain grasslands should more actively support prescribed burn associations, which is an effective vehicle for increasing prescribed fire use by private landowners."
https://openalex.org/W3084048003,"Anemia is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it remains unclear whether anemia is associated with the development of IBD. We assessed the risk of developing IBD in anemic patients, and stratified the results with respect to their hemoglobin concentrations. A population-based study was conducted using the National Healthcare Insurance Service database in South Korea. We included individuals over 20 years’ old who participated in the national health screening program in 2009 (n = 9,962,064). Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in women. We compared the rate of newly diagnosed IBD in anemic patients and non-anemic individuals. Newly diagnosed IBD was identified using both the ICD-10 medical code and specialized V codes for rare intractable diseases in South Korea. During the mean follow-up period of 7.3 years, the incidences of CD and UC in anemic patients were 2.89 and 6.88 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The risk of CD was significantly higher in anemic patients than in non-anemic individuals [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 2.084; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.769–2.455]. The risk of CD development was inversely proportional to the hemoglobin concentration. A J-curve relationship was observed between age and the risk of CD in anemic patients. The risk of CD in male anemic patients was significantly higher than that in female anemic patients (aHR, 1.432 vs. 1.240, respectively). By contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of developing UC in anemic and non-anemic individuals (aHR, 0.972; 95% CI, 0.880–1.073). This work indicates that anemia is related to the development of CD, and this risk was inversely proportional to the hemoglobin concentration."
https://openalex.org/W3084297672,"Background The insertion of filiform needles intramuscularly (a.k.a. intramuscular stimulation/dry needling) has been suggested as a possible treatment for various painful musculoskeletal conditions. Our aim was to answer the question, is intramuscular stimulation more effective than sham intramuscular stimulation/dry needling for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy? Methods 52 participants with persistent midportion Achilles tendinopathy began and 46 completed one of three treatment protocols which were randomly assigned: (G3) a 12-week rehabilitation program of progressive tendon loading plus intramuscular stimulation (n = 25), (G2) the same rehabilitation program but with sham intramuscular stimulation (n = 19), or (G1) a reference group of rehabilitation program alone (as an additional control) (n = 8). The a priori primary outcome measure was change in VISA-A score at 12 weeks–VISA-A was also measured at 6 weeks, and at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include the proportion of patients who rated themselves as much or very much improved (%), dorsiflexion range of motion (degrees), and tendon thickness (mm). Results The study retention was 94% at 12 weeks and 88% at 1 year. VISA-A score improved in all three groups over time (p<0.0001), with no significant difference among the three groups in VISA-A score at the start of the study (mean ± SD: G3 59 ± 13, G2 57 ± 17, G1 56 ± 22), at 12 weeks (G3 76 ± 14, G2 76 ± 15, G1 82 ± 11) or at any other timepoint. The percentage of patients who rated themselves as much or very much improved (i.e. treatment success) was not different after 12 weeks (G3 70%, G2 89%, G1 86% p = 0.94), or at 26 (p = 0.62) or 52 weeks (p = 0.71). No clinically significant effects of intervention group were observed in any of the secondary outcome measures. Conclusion The addition of intramuscular stimulation to standard rehabilitation for Achilles tendinopathy did not result in any improvement over the expected clinical benefit achieved with exercise-based rehabilitation alone."
https://openalex.org/W3084319091,"In a cross-sectional study of youth ages 8-15, we examined implicit and explicit gender stereotypes regarding math and language abilities. We investigated how implicit and explicit stereotypes differ across age and gender groups and whether they are consistent with cultural stereotypes. Participants (N = 270) completed the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) and a survey of explicit beliefs. Across all ages, boys showed neither math nor language implicit gender biases, whereas girls implicitly favored girls in both domains. These findings are counter to cultural stereotypes, which favor boys in math. On the explicit measure, both boys' and girls' primary tendency was to favor girls in math and language ability, with the exception of elementary school boys, who rated genders equally. We conclude that objective gender differences in academic success guide differences in children's explicit reports and implicit biases."
https://openalex.org/W3084011134,"Hypoxia-induced oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms of myocardial injury, which frequently results in cardiomyocyte death and precipitates life-threatening heart failure. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol), which is used to sedate patients during surgery, was shown to strongly affect the regulation of physiological processes, including hypoxia-induced oxidative stress. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear.Expression of LRPPRC, SLIRP, and Bcl-2 after propofol treatment was measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. The effects of propofol under hypoxia were determine by assessing mitochondrial homeostasis and mitochondrial function, including the ATP level and mitochondrial mass. Autophagy/mitophagy was measured by detecting the presence of LC3B, and autophagosomes were observed by transmission microscopy.Propofol treatment inhibited cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3, indicating its inhibitory roles in mitochondrial-related apoptosis. Propofol treatment also transcriptionally activated LRPPRC, a mitochondrial-associated protein that exerts multiple functions by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, in a manner dependent on the presence of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-1α transcriptional activity in H9C2 and primary rat cardiomyocytes. LRPPRC induced by propofol maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and promoted mitochondrial function, including ATP synthesis and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, LRPPRC induced by propofol contributes, at least partially, to the inhibition of apoptotic cell death induced by hypoxia.Taken together, our results indicate that LRPPRC may have a protective antioxidant effect by maintaining mitochondrial homoeostasis induced by propofol and provide new insight into the protective mechanism of propofol against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3084113019,"Background Sepsis-3 definition uses SOFA score to discriminate sepsis from uncomplicated infection, replacing SIRS criteria that were criticized for being inaccurate. Eligibility of sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis diagnosis and the applied validation methodology using mortality as endpoint are topic of ongoing debate. We assessed the impact of different criteria on sepsis diagnosis in our ICU and devised a mathematical approach for mortality-based validation of sepsis criteria. As infectious status is often unclear at clinical deterioration, we integrated non-infected patients into analysis. Methods Suspected infection, SOFA and SIRS were captured for an ICU cohort of a university center over one year. For raw scores (SIRS/SOFA) and sepsis criteria (SIRS≥2/SOFA≥2/SOFA_change≥2) frequencies and associations with in-hospital mortality were assessed. Using a mathematical approach, we estimated the correlation between sepsis and in-hospital mortality serving as reference for evaluation of observed mortality correlations of sepsis criteria. Results Of 791 patients, 369 (47%) were infected and 422 (53%) non-infected, with an in-hospital mortality of 39% and 15%. SIRS≥2 indicated sepsis in 90% of infected patients, SOFA≥2 in 99% and SOFA_change≥2 in 77%. In non-infected patients, SIRS, SOFA and SOFA_change were ≥2 in 78%, 88% and 58%. In AUROC analyses neither SOFA nor SIRS displayed superior mortality discrimination in infected compared to non-infected patients. The mathematically estimated correlation of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was 0.10 in infected and 0 in non-infected patients. Among sepsis criteria, solely SIRS≥2 agreed with expected correlations in both subgroups (infected: r = 0.19; non-infected: r = 0.02). Conclusions SOFA≥2 yielded a more liberal sepsis diagnosis than SIRS≥2. None of the criteria showed an infection specific occurrence that would be essential for reliable sepsis detection. However, SIRS≥2 matched the mortality association pattern of a valid sepsis criterion, whereas SOFA-based criteria did not. With this study, we establish a mathematical approach to mortality-based evaluation of sepsis criteria."
https://openalex.org/W3084057425,"High sodium consumption is one of the four major risk factors contributing to non-communicable diseases around the world. Thailand has one of the highest rates of sodium consumption, with fish sauce being one of the main sources. The aim of this study was to examine whether changes in the micro-environment factors can affect fish sauce consumption behavior in a university setting in Thailand. We implemented four interventions (with one control) in five canteens across a Thai university. The study design was a Latin square, where the five canteens were randomized over five weeks to implement four interventions plus a control. Our interventions included behavior-oriented, cognitive-oriented, and affective-oriented nudges aimed to reduce the amount of fish sauce people add to their noodles during lunchtime at the university canteens. Results indicate that a simple change in how fish sauce was served can reduce fish sauce consumption. Serving fish sauce in a bowl with a spoon reduced the amount of fish sauce used per noodle bowl by 0.25 grams, compared to the normal condition where fish sauce is served in a bottle. Using a specially-designed spoon with a hole induced a larger reduction of 0.58 grams of fish sauce used per bowl. The other two interventions, cognitive- and affective- oriented nudges, also showed reductions of fish sauce usage, but the differences were not statistically significant. The findings can be used for policy implementation to advocate the use of a smaller sized spoon and a bowl to serve fish sauce instead of a bottle to reduce sodium consumption among Thai people."

Exercise providers play a vital role in promoting and facilitating exercise in these groups by recognizing and being responsive to the needs of persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in exercise programming. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences, perceptions, and needs of community exercise providers regarding dementia.Five focus groups were held with community exercise providers (n = 30) who deliver exercise to older adults (≥55 years) in municipal, non-profit, for profit, or academic settings.Three themes were developed: (1) Unique experiences and diverse perceptions: suggests unique personal experiences with MCI and dementia inform distinct perceptions of dementia; (2) Dementia-Inclusive Practices: learning as you go and adapting for the individual: reflects exercise providers' approaches to recognizing and accommodating individuals' unique abilities and preferences; (3) Training and Best Practices, with Flexibility: identifies exercise providers' desires for MCI- and dementia-specific knowledge and training strategies, which need to recognize dementia heterogeneity between and within persons over time.These findings highlight a willingness of exercise providers to support dementia-inclusive exercise, but recognize they have minimal training and lack educational resources to do so. Formal training resources may enhance exercise accessibility and participation for persons with MCI or dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3083914781,"The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), is a destructive pest that poses a significant threat to rice plants worldwide. To explore how BPHs adapt to the resistant rice variety, we analyzed proteomics profiles of two virulent N. lugens populations. We focused on Biotype Y, which can survive on the moderately resistant rice variety YHY15, and Biotype I, which can survive on the susceptible rice variety TN1. We performed protein quantitation using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and then compared the expression patterns between two virulent N. lugens populations and found 258 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). We found that 151 of the DEPs were up-regulated, while 107 were down-regulated. We evaluated transcript levels of 8 expressed genes from the iTRAQ results by qRT-PCR, which revealed transcriptional changes that were consistent with the changes at the protein level. The determination of the protein changes in two virulent N. lugens populations would help to better understanding BPH adaptation to resistant rice varieties and facilitate the better design of new control strategies for host defense against BPH."
https://openalex.org/W3084412875,"Population control of invasive mammal pests is an ongoing process in many conservation projects. In New Zealand, introduced wild domestic cats and mustelids have a severe impact on biodiversity, and methods to reduce and maintain predator populations to low levels have been developed involving poisoning and trapping. Such conservation efforts often run on limited funds, so ways to minimize costs while not compromising their effectiveness are constantly being sought. Here we report on a case example in a 150 km2 area in the North Island, New Zealand, where high predator numbers were reduced by 70-80% in an initial 'knockdown' trapping program, using the full set of traps available in the fixed network and frequent checks, and then maintained at low density using maintenance trapping with less frequent checking. We developed and applied a simulation model of predator captures, based on trapping data, to investigate the effect on control efficacy of varying numbers of trap sites and numbers of traps per site. Included in the simulations were captures of other, non-target, introduced mammals. Simulations indicated that there are potentially significant savings to be made, at least in the maintenance phase of a long-term predator control programme, by first reducing the number of traps in large-scale networks without dramatically reducing efficacy, and then, possibly, re-locating traps according to spatial heterogeneity in observed captures of the target species."
https://openalex.org/W3083877232,"Toll like receptors (TLRs) are critical receptors to respond to danger signals, and their functions are relevant in the perioperative period. We previously reported that volatile anesthetics directly bound to TLR2 and TLR4 and attenuated their functions. Given that TLR9 can respond to mitochondrial DNA, a danger signal that is released upon tissue injury, we examined the role of anesthetics on TLR9 function. Our reporter assay showed that volatile anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane increased the activation of TLR9, while propofol attenuated it. TLR9 activation occurs via its dimerization. The dimerization is facilitated by unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) DNA as well as DNA containing cytosine at the second position from 5'-end (5'-xCx DNA). Our structural analysis using photoactivable anesthetics and rigid docking simulation showed that isoflurane and sevoflurane bound to both TLR9 dimer interface and 5'-xCx DNA binding site. Propofol bound to the TLR9 antagonist binding site. This is the first illustration that anesthetics can affect the binding of nucleic acids to their receptor. This study sets the foundation for the effect of anesthetics on TLR9 and will pave the way for future studies to determine the significance of such interactions in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3084117063,"Investigation into the genetic diversity of certain endangered native breeds of domestic animals has been in common practice for several decades. The primary objective of these investigations has been to reveal the exceptional genetic value of such breeds, both for their conservation and also to gain insight into their current genetic status, as they have been undergoing a progressive decrease in population size and general diversity; this has been compounded by the general lack of an optimal breeding scheme. In this study, we have investigated changes in the genetic diversity of six Hungarian local chicken breeds based on 29 microsatellite loci over a period of 15 years. In terms of the basic diversity measures, populations sampled in 2017 generally exhibited a lower heterozygosity and mean number of alleles and thus, experienced a higher degree of inbreeding. Although the effective population size increased, the estimates of populations sampled over different periods indicated comparatively low values, suggesting overall lower genetic variance. Pairwise FST estimates were higher in the populations sampled in 2017, showing a larger genetic distance between them. Considerable differences exist between the populations of the same breeds, which can most likely be attributed to genetic drift. STRUCTURE results have shown a clear separation between the Hungarian populations, which is in agreement with the principal coordinate analysis. The most likely clustering was found at K = 6, classifying the populations of the same breed as one group. No considerable allele loss was found in the Hungarian indigenous chicken breeds after 15 years of conservation. In general terms, after 15 years, the level of inbreeding within the populations was, in fact, higher, although this could be effectively reduced through the use of an improved mating system. Consequently, the breed management applied in the case of Hungarian local chicken breeds was found to be effective at adequately conserving their genetic variability."

Both products (test and reference) were given to 12 healthy non-smokers male subjects with overnight fasting of >10hr. The study was a randomized, single-dose, open-label, two sequence, and two treatment crossover design, with a washout period of 2 weeks. Blood samples (5 mL) from the human subjects were collected before (0 hr) and after drug administration at 13different time points (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 18 hrs). The drug plasma concentration was analyzed by a validated RP-HPLC method using a solvent system containing acetonitrile and deionized water (60:40% v/v). Linearity was found to be 0.999 over the drug concentration range of 50μg/mL to 0.05μg/mL with LLOQ and LOD of 0.05μg/mL and 0.025μg/mL respectively. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Kinetica® (ver. 5.1) software. Using the log-transformed data Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUMCtot, and MRT were calculated. The Cmax of the test and brand was found to be 8.629±1.251μg/mL and 8.478±0.913μg/mL. The AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of the test and the reference were computed to be 20.890 ±2.2021μg/mL.h, 23.272 ±1.914 μg/mL.h and 19.850 ±2.911 μg/mL.h, 22.890 ± 2.110 μg/mL.h correspondingly. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and two one-sided t-test (p>0.05; non-significant) were applied to assess the variation in the period, sequence, subjects, and treatment. Geometric mean ratios for above mentioned pharmacokinetic parameters of reference/test were found within the acceptable FDA limits of 80–125% using 90% CI. There was no inter and intrasubject variation (p> 0.05) that was observed.

https://openalex.org/W3083783394,"Mapping brain functions is crucial for neurosurgical planning in patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, presurgical language mapping using either functional or structural networks can be challenging, especially in children. In fact, most of the evidence on this topic derives from cross-sectional or retrospective studies in adults submitted to anterior temporal lobectomy. In this prospective study, we used fMRI and DTI to explore patterns of language representation, their predictors and impact on cognitive performances in 29 children and young adults (mean age at surgery: 14.6 ± 4.5 years) with focal lesional epilepsy. In 20 of them, we also assessed the influence of epilepsy surgery on language lateralization. All patients were consecutively enrolled at a single epilepsy surgery center between 2009 and 2015 and assessed with preoperative structural and functional 3T brain MRI during three language tasks: Word Generation (WG), Rhyme Generation (RG) and a comprehension task. We also acquired DTI data on arcuate fasciculus in 24 patients. We first assessed patterns of language representation (relationship of activations with the epileptogenic lesion and Laterality Index (LI)) and then hypothesized a causal model to test whether selected clinical variables would influence the patterns of language representation and the ensuing impact of the latter on cognitive performances. Twenty out of 29 patients also underwent postoperative language fMRI. We analyzed possible changes of fMRI and DTI LIs and their clinical predictors. Preoperatively, we found atypical language lateralization in four patients during WG task, in one patient during RG task and in seven patients during the comprehension task. Diffuse interictal EEG abnormalities predicted a more atypical language representation on fMRI (p = 0.012), which in turn correlated with lower attention (p = 0.036) and IQ/GDQ scores (p = 0.014). Postoperative language reorganization implied shifting towards atypical language representation. Abnormal postoperative EEG (p = 0.003) and surgical failures (p = 0.015) were associated with more atypical language lateralization, in turn correlating with worsened fluency. Neither preoperative asymmetry nor postoperative DTI LI changes in the arcuate fasciculus were observed. Focal lesional epilepsy associated with diffuse EEG abnormalities may favor atypical language lateralization and worse cognitive performances, which are potentially reversible after successful surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3083828836,"Background Previous research indicates that income inequality is associated with risk for mortality, self-rated health status, chronic conditions, and health behavior, such as physical activity. However, little is known about the relationship between income inequality and dietary intake, which is a major risk factor for common chronic diseases including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancers. The objective of this study is to determine the association between US state income inequality and fruit and vegetable consumption among adults. Methods Cross-sectional data on 270,612 U.S. adults from the U.S. 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was used. Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed from the six-item fruit and vegetable frequency questionnaire, which is part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Multilevel modeling was used to determine whether US state-level income inequality (measured by the z-transformation of the Gini coefficient) was associated with fruit and vegetable consumption adjusting for individual-level and state-level covariates. Results In comparison to men, women were more likely to consume fruits and vegetables ≥5 times daily, fruits ≥2 times daily, vegetables ≥3 times of daily, and less likely to consume fruit juice daily. Among both men and women, a standard deviation increase in Gini coefficient was associated with an increase in consuming fruit juice daily (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.11). However, among women, a standard deviation increase in Gini coefficient was associated with a decreased likelihood in meeting daily recommended levels of both fruits and vegetables (OR = 0.93; 0.87–0.99), fruits only (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92–0.99) and vegetables only (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.96). Conclusions This study is one of the first to show the relationship between income inequality and fruit and vegetable consumption among U.S. adults empirically. Women’s health is more likely to be detrimentally affected when living in a state with higher income inequality."

This will allow clinicians to propose better treatment modalities according to the severity of the injury.The present study is a retrospective cohort study performed with the clinical data from 772 patients stored at Fisi-(ON) Health Group. All the patients treated for cervical spine injuries are evaluated using the EBI-5® system, which is based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology. The normalized range of motion of each patient was incorporated into a single index, the Neck Functional Holistic Analysis Score (NFHAS).Clustering analysis of the patients according to their NFHAS resulted in five groups. The Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that there were statistically relevant differences in the ROM values and NFHAS of the patients depending on the cluster they were assigned to: FE X2(4) = 551.59, p = 0.0005; LB ROM X2(4) = 484.58, p = 0.0005; RT ROM X2(4) = 557.14, p = 0.0005; NFHAS X2(4) = 737.41, p = 0.0005. Effect size with ηp2 for the comparison of groups were: FE = 0.76, LB = 0.68, RT = 0.76 and NFHAS = 0.96.The NFHAS is directly correlated to the available ROM of the patient. The NFHAS serves as a good tool for the classification of cervical injury patients. The degree of impairment shown by the cervical injury can now be staged correctly using this new classification."
https://openalex.org/W3084140615,"A critical barrier to the development of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cure is the lack of a scalable animal model that enables robust evaluation of eradication approaches prior to testing in humans. We established a humanized mouse model of latent HIV infection by transplanting ""J-Lat"" cells, Jurkat cells harboring a latent HIV provirus encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter, into irradiated adult NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice. J-Lat cells exhibited successful engraftment in several tissues including spleen, bone barrow, peripheral blood, and lung, in line with the diverse natural tissue tropism of HIV. Administration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, an established HIV latency reversal agent, significantly induced GFP expression in engrafted cells across tissues, reflecting viral reactivation. These data suggest that our murine latency (""μ-Lat"") model enables efficient determination of how effectively viral eradication agents, including latency reversal agents, penetrate, and function in diverse anatomical sites harboring HIV in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3084214028,"To investigate long-term treatment response after intravitreal bevacizumab injections (IVBIs) for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC).This retrospective, interventional study investigated the medical records of 45 eyes of 44 patients with CSC who underwent IBVIs and completed at least 2-year follow-up period. Complete resolution (CR) was defined as complete resolution of subretinal fluid at least 3 months after the last IVBI. Thick-choroid CSC was defined as mean subfoveal choroidal thickness more than 300.0 μm. The main outcome measure was long-term treatment outcome after IVBIs in patients with CSC.Thirty-five patients (79.5%) were male, and their mean age was 45.5 ± 9.6 years. The mean follow-up period was 35.1 ± 11.5 months. Twenty-two eyes (48.9%) had acute CSC, and 40 eyes (88.9%) achieved CR. Twenty eyes (50.0%) developed recurrence, the mean number of IVBIs to achieve the first CR was not significantly different between eyes with and without recurrences (2.6 ± 1.6 vs. 2.9 ± 1.9; P = 0.658). Thick-choroid CSC was significantly difference between the eyes with and without recurrence (17 eyes, 85.0% vs. eyes, 50.0%; P = 0.020). Among the baseline characteristics, serous pigment epithelial detachment (B = - 2.580, P = 0.032) and thick-choroid (B = 1.980, P = 0.019) were significantly associated with recurrence.Eyes with CSC treated with IVBI and achieving complete resolution of subretinal fluid have 50% chance of recurrence in the long term. Thinner choroid and serous pigment epithelial detachment appear protective for recurrences."
https://openalex.org/W3084375277,"There are no studies on time to test since notification among identified sexual contacts of HIV-positive index clients using program data in Siaya County and Kenya. We sought to understand time to HIV testing by contact characteristics after identification to inform targeted testing interventions. We retrospectively analyzed data from adult (aged ≥18 years) sexual contacts identified by HIV-positive index clients from 117 health facilities in Siaya County (June 2017-August 2018). We used Chi-square tests to assess for differences in characteristics of contacts by HIV testing. We performed Cox proportional hazards analysis and time to HIV testing of contacts analysis including time-varying covariates (cluster-adjusted by facility) to assess characteristics (age, sex, and relationship to index client) associated with time to HIV-testing since notification. Sexual contacts not tested were right censored at last follow-up date. We calculated hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals to evaluate characteristics associated with time to testing. Of the 6,845 contacts included in this analysis, 3,858 (56.4%) were men. Most were aged 25-34 years (3,209 [46.9%]). Median time to contact testing was 14.5 days (interquartile range, 2.5-62). On multivariable analysis, contacts aged 18-24 years (aHR, 1.32 [95% CI: 1.01-1.73], p = 0.040) and 25-34 years (aHR, 1.18 [95% CI: 1.01-1.39], p = 0.038) had shorter time to HIV testing than those aged 35-44 years. Married polygamous (aHR, 1.12 [95% CI: 1.01-1.25], p = 0.039) and single contacts (aHR, 1.17 [95% CI: 1.08-1.27], p <0.001) had shorter time to HIV testing than married monogamous contacts. Non-spouse sexual contacts had shorter time to HIV testing than spouses, (aHR, 1.23 [95% CI: 1.15-1.32], p <0.001). We recommend enhanced differentiated partner services targeting older adults, married monogamous, and spouse sexual contacts to facilitate early diagnosis, same day treatment, and prevention in Western Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa at large."
https://openalex.org/W3083970369,"Vertebrate striated muscle thin filaments are thought to be thermodynamically activated in response to an increase in Ca2+ concentration. We tested this hypothesis by measuring time intervals for gliding runs and pauses of individual skeletal muscle thin filaments in cycling myosin motility assays. A classic thermodynamic mechanism predicts that if chemical potential is constant, transitions between runs and pauses of gliding thin filaments will occur at constant rate as given by a Poisson distribution. In this scenario, rate is given by the odds of a pause, and hence, run times between pauses fit an exponential distribution that slopes negatively for all observable run times. However, we determined that relative density of observed run times fits an exponential only at low Ca2+ levels that activate filament gliding. Further titration with Ca2+, or adding excess regulatory proteins tropomyosin and troponin, shifted the relative density of short run times to fit the positive slope of a gamma distribution, which derives from waiting times between Poisson events. Events that arise during a run and prevent the chance of ending a run for a random interval of time account for the observed run time distributions, suggesting that the events originate with cycling myosin. We propose that regulatory proteins of the thin filament require the mechanical force of cycling myosin to achieve the transition state for activation. During activation, combinations of cycling myosin that contribute insufficient activation energy delay deactivation."
https://openalex.org/W3084074682,"There is limited evidence on the relationships of preference for end-of-life life-sustaining treatments [LSTs] and diagnostic contexts like heart failure [HF] or cancer, and patient attitudes toward and perceived susceptibility to use advance directives [ADs]. Thus, this study aimed to compare attitudes and perceived susceptibility between HF patients and community-dwelling patients with cancer, and examine the associations of these variables with their preference for each LST (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], ventilation support, hemodialysis, and hospice care). Secondary data were obtained from 36 outpatients with HF (mean age, 65.44 years; male, 69.4%) and 107 cancer patients (mean age, 67.39 years; male, 32.7%). More patients with HF preferred CPR than cancer patients (41.7% and 15.9%, χ2 = 8.88, P = 0.003). Attitudes and perceived susceptibility were similar between the two diagnostic cohorts. HF patients and those with more positive attitudes had greater odds of preferring CPR (odds ratio [OR] = 3.02, confidence interval [CI] = 1.19, 7.70) and hospice care (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.06, 1.23), respectively. HF diagnosis and AD attitudes increased the preference for CPR and hospice care, respectively. This suggests that it is important to gain positive attitudes toward ADs and consider diagnostic context to facilitate informed decision-making for LSTs."
