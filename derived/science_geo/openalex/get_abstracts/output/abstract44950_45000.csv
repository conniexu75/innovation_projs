https://openalex.org/W2078539443,"Combining high resolution in situ hybridization with quantitative solid state imaging, we show that human metaphase chromosome Giemsa/Quinacrine and Reverse bands are each characterized by distinct families of interspersed repeated sequences: the SINES, Alu family dominates in Reverse bands, and the LINES, L1 family dominates in Giemsa/Quinacrine positive bands. Alu is 56% guanine plus cytosine, and L1 is 58% adenine plus thymine, and each may comprise 13%-18% of the total DNA in a chromosome band. Therefore, the distribution of these sequences alone may account for a large part of human chromosome banding seen with fluorescent dyes. With the exception of some telomeric regions, and the chromosomal regions of simple sequence DNA, Alu and L1 are precisely inversely distributed, suggesting an inverse functional relationship. This finding links genome organization with chromosome structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1968921161,"Femtosecond optical measurement techniques have been used to study the primary photoprocesses in the light-driven transmembrane proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. Light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin was excited with a 60-femtosecond pump pulse at 618 nanometers, and the transient absorption spectra from 560 to 710 nanometers were recorded from -50 to 1000 femtoseconds by means of 6-femtosecond probe pulses. By 60 femtoseconds, a broad transient hole appeared in the absorption spectrum whose amplitude remained constant for about 200 femtoseconds. Stimulated emission in the 660- to 710-nanometer region and excited-state absorption in the 560- to 580-nanometer region appeared promptly and then shifted and decayed from 0 to approximately 150 femtoseconds. These spectral features provide a direct observation of the 13-trans to 13-cis torsional isomerization of the retinal chromophore on the excited-state potential surface. Absorption due to the primary ground-state photoproduct J appears with a time constant of approximately 500 femtoseconds."
https://openalex.org/W1493485729,"A method allowing initial sequencing yields of 60-85% to be consistently obtained from samples prepared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer is described in detail. Conducting electrophoresis at a pH near neutrality is the single most important of the modifications made to earlier procedures, but pre-electrophoresis in the presence of glutathione or sodium thioglycolate and use of Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes all contribute to the success of the technique. When tryptophan was the NH2 terminus of a protein, the phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivative recovered appeared to be an irreversible oxidation product if pre-electrophoresis was not performed. Following pre-electrophoresis, the PTH-derivative recovered co-migrated with that of unmodified tryptophan, and the recovery was higher. Recovery of methionine as its PTH-derivative was not affected by pre-electrophoresis suggesting that thioglycolate in the electrophoresis buffer during sample separation prevented or reversed oxidation of methionine sulfur but did not protect tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1529259401,"The stability and structure of human apolipoprotein (apo) E3 in aqueous solution were investigated by guanidine HCl denaturation and limited proteolysis. The guanidine HCl denaturation curve, as monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy, was biphasic; the two transition midpoints occurred at 0.7 and 2.5 M guanidine HCl, indicating that there are stable intermediate structures in the unfolding of apoE. Limited proteolysis of apoE with five enzymes demonstrated two proteolytically resistant regions, an amino-terminal domain (residues 20-165) and a carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 225-299). The region between them was highly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. Because of their similarity to the proteolytically resistant regions, the amino-terminal (residues 1-191) and carboxyl-terminal (residues 216-299) thrombolytic fragments of apoE were used as models for the two domains. Guanidine HCl denaturation of the carboxyl- and amino-terminal fragments gave transition midpoints of 0.7 and 2.4 M guanidine HCl, respectively. The results establish that the two domains identified by limited proteolysis correspond to the two domains detected by protein denaturation experiments. Therefore, the thrombolytic fragments are useful models for the two domains. The free energies of denaturation calculated from the denaturation curves of intact apoE or the model domains were approximately 4 and 8-12 kcal/mol for the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, respectively. The value for the carboxyl-terminal domain is similar to those of previously characterized apolipoproteins, whereas the value for the amino-terminal domain is considerably higher and resembles those of soluble globular proteins. These studies suggest that, in aqueous solution, apoE is unlike other apolipoproteins in that it contains two independently folded structural domains of markedly different stabilities: an amino-terminal domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain, separated by residues that may act as a hinge region."
https://openalex.org/W1507801782,"Certain lysophospholipids, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) in particular, stimulated protein kinase C at low concentrations (less than 20 microM) but, conversely, inhibited it at high concentrations (greater than 30 microM). Protein kinase C stimulation by lyso-PC required the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) and Ca2+ and was associated with a decreased Ka for PS and increased Ka for Ca2+ of the enzyme. Cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid could partially substitute for PS in supporting the stimulatory effect of lyso-PC. Lyso-PC also biphasically regulated protein kinase C activated by diolein. Of several synthetic lyso-PC preparations tested, the oleoyl, myristoyl and palmitoyl derivatives were most active. Data from the Triton X-100 mixed micellar assay indicated that 1.4 and 14.0 mol of lyso-PC/micelle produced a maximal stimulation and a complete abolishment of the stimulation of protein kinase C, respectively. Protein kinase C stimulation by lyso-PC, with a pH optimum of about 7.5, was observed for phosphorylation of histone H1, myelin basic protein, and the 35- and 47-kDa proteins from the rat brain, but not for that of other histone subfractions and protamine. Lyso-PC acted synergistically with diacylglycerol in stimulating protein kinase C, whereas the stimulation by lyso-PC was additive to that by oleic acid. Protein kinase C inhibitors (alkyllysophospholipid, sphingosine, tamoxifen, and polymyxin B) inhibited more potently the protein kinase C activity stimulated by PS/Ca2+/lyso-PC than that stimulated by PS/Ca2+. The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of lyso-PC were not observed for myosin light chain kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, indicating a specificity of its actions. The present findings suggested that lyso-PC, likely derived from membrane PC by the action of phospholipase A2, might play a role in signal transduction via a dual regulation of protein kinase C, and that it could further modulate the enzyme and hence the cellular activity by interplaying with diacylglycerol and unsaturated fatty acid, the two other classes of cellular mediators also shown to be activators of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1525574052,"Previously we identified an acid protease activity which was located in the endosomes of rabbit alveolar macrophages (Diment, S., and Stahl, P.D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15311-15317). In this study, the endosomal protease is identified as cathepsin D by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies raised against rabbit cathepsin D and by NH2-terminal sequence. In order to elucidate the mechanism for targeting of cathepsin D to endosomes, we first examined the membrane association of cathepsin D with light (rho = 1.05 g/ml) and heavy density (rho = 1.1 g/ml) vesicles from Percoll density gradients. After sequential washes, 8.4 and 21.9% of cathepsin D activity remained associated with heavy and light density vesicles, respectively. This membrane-associated cathepsin D could not be solubilized in either buffer at pH 5.0 containing mannose 6-phosphate and EDTA or in buffer at pH 10.6. Solubilization required the detergent Triton X-100. To determine whether membrane-associated cathepsin D was found in endosomes, the enzyme was radioiodinated within endosomes and lysosomes with internalized lactoperoxidase. The membrane-associated form was detected in endosomes, but much less in lysosomes. Biosynthetic studies combined with the same extraction procedure revealed that macrophage cathepsin D is first synthesized as an inactive membrane-associated precursor. The precursor is processed to an active, membrane-associated form and then to the active soluble form found in lysosomes. Our studies provide evidence that 1) cathepsin D is in endosomes of macrophages; 2) cathepsin D is transported to endosomes as a membrane-associated form; and 3) the membrane-associated form is a biosynthetic precursor for the soluble form found in endosomes and lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2032345713,"We find that cells infected with wild-type group C human adenoviruses are not killed by exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but cells infected with adenoviruses that delete the E3 transcription unit are highly sensitive to TNF lysis. Mock-infected cells are resistant to TNF. Thus, adenovirus infection induces cellular susceptibility to lysis by TNF, and a product of E3 protects against lysis by TNF. The E3-dependent resistance to TNF was investigated using virus mutants that delete different segments of E3. Resistance was found to depend on the presence of a 14,700 MW protein, which has only recently been identified and for which there was no known function. Our results support the hypothesis that one of the functions of TNF in vivo is to combat virus infections, and that the 14,700 MW protein evolved in adenovirus to counteract the antiviral effects of TNF."
https://openalex.org/W2024428036,"A numerical study of the motion of a long-chain macromolecule in a gel has shown unexpected features. The application of a field appears to induce the chain to contract on itself. This is followed by its ""unwinding"" into an extended configuration. For long chains, the mobility tends toward a constant, in accord with experiments. For the parameter range used, the observed molecular motion differs strongly from assumptions made in the present theory of electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1542947565,"Fibroblasts increase the catabolism of certain intracellular proteins in response to serum withdrawal, and these proteins contain specific peptide regions that may be required for their increased degradation. We show that the increased degradation of microinjected ribonuclease A during serum withdrawal can be blocked by co-injection of a pentapeptide corresponding to residues 7-11 of ribonuclease A, Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln. Furthermore, similar peptide sequences appear to play a widespread role in targeting proteins for enhanced degradation. Affinity-purified antibodies raised against the pentapeptide are able to precipitate 20-35% of radiolabeled cytosolic proteins from fibroblasts. Such proteins are preferentially degraded when cells are deprived of serum while nonimmunoprecipitable proteins are degraded at the same rate in the presence and absence of serum. Immunoreactive cytosolic proteins also exist in rat liver and kidney, and these proteins are depleted when protein degradation rates are enhanced due to starvation. Several types of evidence suggest that the peptides recognized in cellular proteins are similar to Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln but are not this exact sequence. Analyses of amino acid sequences for four proteins whose degradative rates are enhanced in response to serum withdrawal and for four proteins that are degraded in a serum-independent manner indicate two possible peptide motifs related to Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln that may target cellular proteins for enhanced degradation. These results, combined with previous studies (McElligott, M. A., Miao, P., and Dice, J. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11986-11993), suggest that these peptide regions target specific proteins to a lysosomal pathway of degradation during serum withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W1490077018,"Hydrodynamic, chromatographic, and spectroscopic techniques were used to study the aqueous solution properties of the two structural domains of human apolipoprotein (apo) E3. An amino-terminal thrombolytic fragment of apoE (22 kDa, residues 1-191) and a carboxyl-terminal thrombolytic fragment of apoE (10 kDa, residues 216-299) were used as models for the two domains. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation showed that apoE and the 10-kDa model domain self-associated predominantly as tetramers. The 22-kDa model domain was primarily monomeric. Molecular weights calculated from the weight average sedimentation and diffusion coefficients or from the sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii were in agreement with the sedimentation equilibrium results. Derived frictional coefficients suggest larger axial ratios and/or more extensive hydration for the apoE and the 10-kDa domain tetramers as compared with the 22-kDa domain. Proteolysis of apoE followed by high performance liquid chromatography showed rapid production of free 22-kDa domain, whereas the free 10-kDa domain appeared as a tetramer late in the course of the hydrolysis. Assessment by circular dichroism demonstrated that both model domains and apoE had over 54% alpha-helical content, which changed little in a detergent (octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside) or lipid (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) environment. In contrast to the circular dichroism results, apoE and the 10-kDa domain showed a marked blue shift in the fluorescence maximum in a lipid environment. The results suggest that the self-association of apoE in solution as a tetramer is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain and that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains do not associate with one another. The amino-terminal domain is most likely compact and globular, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain is probably elongated. The isolated model domains appear to have structures that are similar to those of the domains in the intact protein."
https://openalex.org/W1969943683,"Treatment of chick embryos in ovo with crude and partially purified extracts from embryonic hindlimbs (days 8 to 9) during the normal cell death period (days 5 to 10) rescues a significant number of motoneurons from degeneration. The survival activity of partially purified extract was dose-dependent and developmentally regulated. The survival of sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, and a population of cholinergic sympathetic preganglionic neurons was unaffected by treatment with hindlimb extract. The massive motoneuron death that occurs after early target (hindlimb) removal was partially ameliorated by daily treatment with the hindlimb extract. These results indicate that a target-derived neurotrophic factor is involved in the regulation of motoneuron survival in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974170286,"When we see motion, our perception of how one image feature moves depends on the behaviour of other features nearby. In particular, the Gestaltists proposed the law of shared common fate, in which features tend to be perceived as moving together, that is, coherently. Recent psychophysical findings, such as the cooperativity of the motion system and motion capture, support this law. Computationally, coherence is a sensible assumption, because if two features are close then they probably belong to the same object and thus tend to move together. Moreover, the measurement of local motion may be inaccurate and so the integration of motion information over large areas may help to improve the performance. Present theories of visual motion, however, do not account fully for these coherent motion percepts. We propose here a theory that does account for these phenomena and also provides a solution to the aperture problem, where the local information in the image flow is insufficient to specify the motion uniquely."
https://openalex.org/W1529146425,"When 32P-labeled human neutrophils were activated by exposure to phorbol myristate acetate, three 48-kDa proteins (designated pp48/6.8, pp48/7.3, and pp48/7.8, from their isoelectric points) were found to have become labeled. With maximal stimulation, labeling was complete by 30 s. With lesser degrees of stimulation, the extent of labeling at 2 min correlated with rates of production by the phorbol-treated cells. Increased labeling of these 48-kDa proteins was also seen in cells exposed to f-Met-Leu-Phe. In phorbol-treated neutrophils from patients with X-linked cytochrome b558-negative chronic granulomatous disease, pp48/7.8 was labeled in a normal fashion, but pp48/6.8 and pp48/7.3 failed to take up 32P. In cells from patients with autosomal recessive cytochrome b558-positive chronic granulomatous disease, however, none of the three proteins took up 32P in response to phorbol. The three proteins appear to be very closely related, as indicated by the findings that phosphoserine was the only phosphoamino acid found in any of the three, and all three yielded identical one-dimensional phosphopeptide maps after digestion with either chymotrypsin or staphylococcal proteinase V8. These results reconcile earlier observations on protein phosphorylation in chronic granulomatous disease and provide further evidence for a relationship between the phosphorylation of this group of 48-kDa proteins and the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1554741489,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis and receptor recycling involve a series of intracellular membrane fusion events that appear to play an important role in the regulation of the overall rate and efficiency of the process. An endosome-endosome fusion assay is described using two ligands that (i) rapidly and efficiently enter the endosomal compartment via the macrophage mannose receptor and (ii) that mutually recognize each other. Dinitrophenol-derivatized beta-glucuronidase (DNP-beta-glucuronidase), a ligand for the mannose receptor, was endocytosed by one population of J774 E clone cells, and mannose-derivatized monoclonal anti-DNP IgG (Man-IgG) was internalized by a second set of cells. Both ligands were localized in endosomes as determined by fractionation on Percoll gradients. Incubation of vesicles prepared from the two set of cells resulted in vesicle fusion as indicated by the formation of DNP-beta-glucuronidase-Man-IgG complexes. Under standard conditions, fusion was time-, ATP-, and temperature-dependent. KCl was required for fusion. Fusion required both cytosolic- and membrane-associated proteins. N-Ethylmaleimide treatment of cytosol inhibited fusion. Proton ionophores and amines had no effect on the fusion reaction. ATP-dependent fusion was only observed between early endocytic compartments. While in the presence of a Ca2+ chelator fusion was ATP-dependent, in its absence fusion was also observed in an ATP-independent fashion."

https://openalex.org/W1985776773,"Mixed sequence oligonucleotides were used to isolate a series of acute-phase human liver cDNA clones corresponding to the serum alpha 2-globulin ceruloplasmin. These clones were characterized, sequenced, and used to analyze changes in hepatic ceruloplasmin mRNA content during inflammation. In all species examined, hepatic ceruloplasmin mRNA content increased approximately 6-10-fold over control values within 24 h following the induction of inflammation. The mechanisms leading to this increase in hepatic ceruloplasmin mRNA content were studied following turpentine-induced inflammation in Syrian hamsters. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated an increase in the relative rate of transcription of the ceruloplasmin gene within 3 h following induction, reaching maximum values by 18 h. Hepatic ceruloplasmin mRNA content increased 2-fold within 12 h following induction, reached maximum values by 24 h, and returned to control within 72 h. In contrast, serum ceruloplasmin concentration did not increase until 36 h, reached maximal levels by 120 h, and remained elevated for the course of the study. These data indicate that inflammation leads to a rapid increase in hepatic ceruloplasmin mRNA content. This increase is largely the result of increased ceruloplasmin gene transcription, but comparison of the relative rate of transcription and mRNA accumulation suggests that changes in ceruloplasmin mRNA turnover are also involved. In addition, translational and/or post-translational mechanisms must account for the observed changes in serum ceruloplasmin concentration seen during inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W1597094163,"The complete amino acid sequence of the human laminin B2 chain has been determined by sequencing of cDNA clones. The six overlapping clones studied cover approximately 7.5 kilobases of which 5312 nucleotides were sequenced from the 5' end. The open reading frame codes for a 33-residue signal peptide and a 1576-residue B2 chain proper, which is 189 residues less than in the highly homologous B1 chain (Pikkarainen, T., Eddy, R., Fukushima, Y., Byers, M., Shows, T., Pihlajaniemi, T., Saraste, M., and Tryggvason, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10454-10462). Computer analysis revealed that the B2 chain consists of distinct domains that contain helical structures, cysteine-rich repeats, and globular regions, as does the B1 chain. However, domain alpha and domain beta of the B1 chain have no counterpart in B2, and the number of cysteine-rich repeats is 12, or 1 less than in the B1 chain. The degree of homology between the two chains is highest in the cysteine repeat-containing domains III and V where 40% of the residues match. However, results demonstrate that the B1 and B2 chains of laminin are highly homologous proteins that are probably the products of related genes."

We demonstrate that the beta-NGF precursor produced in mammalian cells via a recombinant vaccinia virus can be cleaved by stoichiometric quantities of the gamma-subunit to produce beta-NGF. Trypsin in catalytic quantities also produces native beta-NGF. Proper cleavage depends critically on the conformation of the precursor. beta-NGF has at least 10-fold more biological activity than its precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1593225234,"Two different forms of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have been purified 2810- and 4010-fold, respectively, from a crude extract of rat brain. The purification procedures consisted of chromatography of both enzymes on Affi-Gel blue and cellulose phosphate, followed by three sequential high performance liquid chromatography steps, which were different for the two enzymes. The resultant preparations each contained homogeneous enzyme with a Mr of 85,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of these enzymes (PLC-II) was found to hydrolyze phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at a rate of 15.3 mumol/min/mg of protein and also phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol (PI) at slower rates. For hydrolysis of PI, this enzyme was activated by an acidic pH and a high concentration of Ca2+ and showed a Vmax value of 19.2 mumol/min/mg of protein. The other enzyme (PLC-III) catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 preferentially at a Vmax rate of 12.9 mumol/min/mg of protein and catalyzed that of phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate slightly. The rate of PIP2 hydrolysis by this enzyme exceeded that of PI under all conditions tested. Neither of these enzymes had any activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidic acid. These two enzymes showed not only biochemical but also structural differences. Western blotting showed that antibodies directed against PLC-II did not react with PLC-III. Furthermore, the two enzymes gave different peptide maps after digestion with alpha-chymotrypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. These results suggest that these two forms of PLC belong to different families of PLC."
https://openalex.org/W1539661677,"We have observed that the approximately 90-kDa non-steroid-binding component of nonactivated glucocorticoid receptors purified from WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells (which has been identified as the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein) consistently migrates as a doublet during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions. It has recently been reported that murine Meth A cells contain a tumor-specific transplantation antigen (TSTA) which is related or identical to the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein (Ullrich, S.J., Robinson, E.A., Law, L.W., Willingham, M., and Appella, E. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 3121-3125). The observation that TSTA and the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein isolated from these cells exists as two isoforms of similar molecular mass and charge has suggested to us that the doublet we observed is also due to the existence of two isoforms. However, unlike TSTA, which appears to contain the two isoforms in similar relative abundance, nonactivated glucocorticoid-receptor complexes seem to contain predominantly the lower molecular mass isoform. We have therefore conducted this study to determine whether TSTA and the approximately 90-kDa component of glucocorticoid receptors are indeed related, to establish whether the receptor preferentially binds one isoform of the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein, and to investigate the stoichiometry of the nonactivated receptor complex. By comparing Meth A TSTA and the approximately 90-kDa component of the receptor in their reactions with the AC88 monoclonal antibody (specific for the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein) and a polyclonal antibody directed against Meth A TSTA, we found that these two proteins are indistinguishable and probably identical. We then used the BuGR1 (directed against the steroid-binding subunit of glucocorticoid receptors) and AC88 monoclonal antibodies to purify, respectively, receptor-associated and free approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein from WEHI-7 cells grown for 48 h with [35S]methionine to metabolically label proteins to steady state. Following analysis of the proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions, the relative amounts of the two isoforms in each sample were determined from the 35S counts and the known methionine content of each isoform. We found that approximately three-quarters of both the receptor-associated and the free approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein is present as the lower molecular weight isoform, indicating no preferential binding of either isoform in the receptor. The long-term metabolic labeling approach has also enabled us to direc"
https://openalex.org/W1597049622,"Stimulation of platelets with thrombin or parotid acinar cells with carbachol results in an increase in [Ca2+]i which is due to both release from internal stores and influx across the plasma membrane. In platelets, thrombin also stimulates Mn2+ entry into the cytosol; this is seen as a stimulated quench of fura-2 fluorescence. In the parotid, however, carbachol does not stimulate Mn2+ entry. This result suggests different mechanisms of stimulated divalent cation entry in the two cell types and could have important implications in the study of receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1555064888,"Purified rat liver glucocorticoid receptor was covalently charged with [3H]glucocorticoid by photoaffinity labeling (UV irradiation of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-glucocorticoid receptor) or affinity labeling (incubation with [3H]dexamethasone mesylate). After labeling, separate samples of the denatured receptor were cleaved with trypsin (directly or after prior succinylation), chymotrypsin, and cyanogen bromide. Labeled residues in the peptides obtained were identified by radiosequence analysis. The peaks of radioactivity corresponded to Met-622 and Cys-754 after photoaffinity labeling with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide and Cys-656 after affinity labeling with [3H]dexamethasone mesylate. The labeled residues are all positioned within hydrophobic segments of the steroid-binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W1513987832,"The extracellular hemoglobin of Lumbricus terrestris comprises four major heme-containing chains, a, b, c, and d in equal proportions. We have determined the amino acid sequences of chains a, b, and c which form a disulfide-linked trimer. Chains a, b, and c have 151, 145, and 153 residues and calculated molecular weights of 17,525, 16,254, and 17,289, respectively. The sequence of chain b, reported previously (Garlick, R. L., and Riggs, A. F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 9005-9015) has been completely redetermined and found to contain 12 fewer residues than originally reported. Chains a and c both contain unusual, highly polar NH2-terminal extensions of 7 residues before the A helix. These segments must be close together because they are joined by a disulfide bond. We suggest that this structure, with seven negatively charged groups, may be part of a functionally important Ca2+-binding site in the trimer. Comparison of the sequences of chains a, b, and c with those of chain d (Shishikura, F., Snow, J. W., Gotoh, T., Vinogradov, S. N., and Walz, D. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3123-3131) and the four chains of the hemoglobin of Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus (Suzuki, T., and Gotoh, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9257-9267) shows that the number and positions of the cysteinyl residues are all conserved. This suggests that the extracellular hemoglobins from both the Oligochaeta and Polychaeta have the same number and configuration of disulfide bonds within the molecule. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that gene duplication first generated an intracellular hemoglobin branch and an extracellular hemoglobin branch. DNA coding for a signal peptide would have been acquired by the extracellular globin gene after this event. At least two further gene duplications are required to account for the present four polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1514204573,"We have studied the substrate specificities of a non-specific activator protein on the enzymatic hydrolyses of the following compounds: GM1 and GM2, as well as several of their derivatives including oligosaccharides, GgOse3Cer-II3-sulfate and LacCer-II3-sulfate, Gb-Ose3Cer and GbOse4Cer, three neolacto-series glycosphingolipids, and two non-ceramide glycolipids. Our results show that this activator protein has a broad spectrum of activity and exhibits the properties of a nonspecific natural detergent. The evidence of non-specificity was the ability of this activator protein to stimulate the hydrolyses of glycolipids, regardless of glycosphingolipids or non-ceramide glycolipids, carried out by glycosidases from animals, plants, and microorganisms. Its activity was, however, limited to substrates that had a lipid moiety. The oligosaccharide of GM1 and deacetyl-fatty acid free GM1 (II3-NeuGg-Ose4-sphingosine) were hydrolyzed by beta-galactosidase in the absence of this activator protein."

https://openalex.org/W2135882341,"The enterotoxin B gene of Staphylococcus aureus encodes a single mRNA of about 900 nucleotides. To identify the DNA sequences involved in transcription of the enterotoxin B gene, the transcription initiation and termination sites were determined by nuclease S1 protection experiments. Determination of the enterotoxin B mRNA and protein levels from a number of toxin-producing strains showed that strains that contained relatively low levels of mRNA synthesized low levels of enterotoxin B, whereas strains that carried high levels of enterotoxin B mRNA produced relatively high levels of the toxin protein. Strains carrying the cloned enterotoxin B gene secreted greatly reduced amounts of other extracellular proteins, indicating that the synthesis of several exoproteins in S. aureus is coordinately regulated. An accessory element called agr has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of several exoprotein genes in S. aureus. When the cloned enterotoxin B gene was introduced into strain ISP546 in which the agr element has been inactivated, reduced levels of both enterotoxin B and enterotoxin B mRNA were found. Our results suggest that the enterotoxin B gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and that the agr element plays a role in this regulation."

Cadmium induces the accumulation of two size classes of mRNA: a 1-kilobase (kb) RNA class, which is the same size as the RNA class induced by auxin, silver, and copper, and a 1.4-kb RNA class. DNA sequence analysis of cDNA clones and a soybean genomic fragment has shown the presence of an intron in this gene. A restriction fragment probe isolated from the intron segment hybridizes specifically to the 1.4-kb mRNA. The transcription rate of this sequence is rapidly increased following exposure of soybean primary leaves to cadmium, as assayed by nuclear run-off transcription experiments. These results suggest that cadmium not only induces the transcription of a specific soybean sequence, but interferes with the processing of the precursor mRNA, resulting in the accumulation of the 1.4-kb mRNA precursor species."
https://openalex.org/W1648357419,"A variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria possess crystalline surface layers, although little is known of their function. We previously have shown that the high molecular weight surface-array proteins of Campylobacter fetus are important in both the pathogenicity and antigenicity of this organism. For biochemical and immunological characterization, we purified high molecular weight (100,000, 127,000, 149,000) surface-array proteins from three C. fetus strains using sequential gel filtration and ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. These proteins are acidic with pI values between 4.12 and 4.25 and contain large proportions of acidic amino acids (19.7%-22.0%) in addition to hydrophobic amino acids (37.3%-38.5%). They share a novel amino-terminal sequence through at least 19 residues. Carbohydrate analysis using periodic acid-Schiff staining and treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid shows no evidence of glycosylation. Antiserum to a purified Mr = 100,000 protein from C. fetus 82-40 LP cross-reacts with three other purified C. fetus surface-array proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with titers greater than 12,800. We conclude that: 1) there is a family of surface-array proteins of C. fetus with common structural and antigenic characteristics; 2) that these molecules have similar biochemical characteristics to surface-array proteins described for other bacteria; but however, 3) by amino-terminal sequence analysis these are unique."
https://openalex.org/W1482586823,"Fibroblast cultures were established from six patients with cutis laxa, and elastin gene expression was analyzed by RNA hybridizations with a 2.5-kilobase human elastin cDNA or an exon 1-specific 35-base oligomer. Northern analyses using either probe detected mRNA transcripts of approximately 3.5 kilobases, and no qualitative difference between the control and cutis laxa mRNAs was detected. However, quantitation of the elastin mRNA abundance by slot blot hybridizations revealed markedly reduced levels in all cutis laxa cell strains. Assuming equal translational activity of the control and cutis laxa mRNAs, the reduced mRNA levels could result in diminished elastin production, providing an explanation for the paucity of elastic fibers in the skin and other tissues in cutis laxa."
https://openalex.org/W1487996877,"DNA repair is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genetic material, and a number of DNA repair mechanisms have been fairly well characterized for the nuclear DNA of eukaryotic cells as well as prokaryotes. However, little is known about DNA repair in mitochondria. Using highly sensitive immunoanalytical methods to detect specific DNA alkylation products, we found active removal of O6-ethyl-2‘-deoxyguanosine (O6-EtdGuo) from rat liver mitochondrial DNA after pulse-exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in vivo. In the kidney, O6-EtdGuo was removed from mitochondrial DNA with moderate efficiency, but nearly no removal was observed from the DNA of brain mitochondria. Among the rat tissues examined, the kinetics of O6-EtdGuo elimination from mitochondrial DNA was very similar to the kinetics of removal from nuclear DNA. O4-Ethyl-2‘-deoxythymidine, another premutagenic DNA ethylation product, was stable in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W2168259822,"A number of potential substrates for the microsomal glutathione transferase have been investigated. Out of 11 epoxides tested, only two, i.e. androstenoxide and benzo(a)pyrene-4,5-oxide, were found to be substrates. Upon treatment of the enzyme with N-ethylmaleimide, its activity toward only certain substrates is increased. It appeared upon inspection of the bimolecular rate constants from the corresponding nonenzymatic reactions that the substrates for which the activity is increased are the more reactive ones. This hypothesis was investigated further using a series of para-substituted 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene derivatives as substrates. Activation was seen only with the more reactive nitro-, aldehyde-, and acetaldehyde-substituted compounds and not with the amide and chloroanalogues, thus demonstrating the predicted effect with a related series of compounds. Interestingly, kcat values are increased 7-20-fold by N-ethylmaleimide treatment, whereas the corresponding kcat/Km value is increased only for the p-nitro derivative. Effective molarity and rate enhancement values were found to increase with decreasing reactivity of the substrate, attaining maximal values of 10(5) M and 10(8), respectively. It is concluded that the glutathione transferases are quite effective catalysts with their less reactive substrates. Hammett rho values for the kcat values of unactivated and activated enzyme were 0.49 and 2.0, respectively. The latter value is close to those found for cytosolic glutathione transferases, indicating that activation changes the catalytic mechanism so that it more closely resembles that of the soluble enzymes. The rho values for kcat/Km values were 3 and 3.5 for the unactivated and activated enzyme, respectively, values close to those observed for the nonenzymatic bimolecular rate constants and thereby demonstrating that these reactions have similar properties. The high coefficients of correlation between resonance sigma- values and all of these parameters demonstrate a strong dependence on substrate electrophilicity, as expected for nucleophilic aromatic substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1914697351,"The PS120 variant of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts which lacks Na+/H+ exchange activity was used to investigate bicarbonate transport systems and their role in intracellular pH (pHi) regulation. When pHi was decreased by acid load, bicarbonate caused pHi increase and stimulated 36Cl- efflux from the cells, both in a Na+-dependent manner. These results together with previous findings that bicarbonate stimulates 22Na+ uptake in PS120 cells (L'Allemain, G., Paris, S., and Pouyssegur, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4877-4883) demonstrate the presence of a Na+-linked Cl-/HCO3- exchange system. In cells with normal initial pHi, bicarbonate caused Na+-independent pHi increase in Cl(-)-free solutions and stimulated Na+-independent 36Cl- efflux, indicating that a Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger is also present in the cell. Na+-linked and Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange is apparently mediated by two distinct systems, since a [(tetrahydrofluorene-7-yl)oxy]acetic acid derivative selectively inhibits the Na+-independent exchanger. An additional distinctive feature is a 10-fold lower affinity for chloride of the Na+-linked exchanger. The Na+-linked and Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange systems are likely to protect the cell from acid and alkaline load, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1548319638,"Studies on the regulation of the enterocytic differentiation of the human colon cancer cell line HT-29, which is differentiated in the absence (Glc-) but not in the presence of glucose (Glc+), have recently shown that the post-translational processing of sucrase-isomaltase and particularly its glycosylation vary as a function of cell differentiation (Trugnan G., Rousset, M., Chantret, I., Barbat, A., and Zweibaum, A. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 104, 1199-1205). Other studies indicate that in undifferentiated HT-29 Glc+ cells there is an accumulation of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine, which is involved in the glycosylation process (Wice, B. M., Trugnan, G., Pinto, M., Rousset, M., Chevalier, G., Dussaulx, E., Lacroix, B., and Zweibaum, A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 139-146). The purpose of the present work is to investigate whether an overall alteration of protein glycosylation is associated with the inability of HT-29 cells to differentiate. At least three alterations are detected: (i) after a 10-min pulse, the incorporation of D-[2-3H]mannose in undifferentiated cells is severely reduced, compared to differentiated cells. (ii) After a 24-h period of labeling with D-[2-3H]mannose, undifferentiated cells accumulate more than 60% of the radioactivity in the high mannose glycopeptides, whereas differentiated HT-29 Glc- cells accumulate only 38%. (iii) The analysis of the high mannose oligosaccharides transferred en bloc from the lipid precursor shows that Man9,8-GlcNAc2 species accumulate in undifferentiated cells, whereas no such accumulation can be detected in differentiated cells. This glycosylation pattern is consistent with an impairment of the trimming of high mannose into complex glycans. It is concluded that N-glycan processing is correlated with the state of enterocytic differentiation of HT-29 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1518901000,"Preparations of plasma membrane vesicles were used as a tool to study the properties of the serotonin transporter in the central nervous system. The vesicles were obtained after hypotonic shock of synaptosomes purified from mouse cerebral cortex. Uptake of [3H]serotonin had a Na+-dependent and Na+-independent component. The Na+-dependent uptake was inhibited by classical blockers of serotonin uptake and had a Km of 63-180 nM, and a Vmax of 0.1-0.3 pmol mg-1 s-1 at 77 mM Na+. The uptake required the presence of external Na+ and internal K+. It required a Na+ gradient ([Na+]out greater than [Na+]in) and was stimulated by a gradient of K+ ([K+]in greater than [K+]out). Replacement of Cl- by other anions (NO2-, S2O3-(2-)) reduced uptake appreciably. Gramicidin prevented uptake. Although valinomycin increased uptake somewhat, the membrane potential per se could not drive uptake because no uptake was observed when a membrane potential was generated by the SCN- ion in the absence of internal K+ and with equal [Na+] inside and outside. The increase of uptake as a function of [Na+] indicated a Km for Na+ of 118 mM and a Hill number of 2.0, suggesting a requirement of two sodium ions for serotonin transport. The present results are accommodated very well by the model developed for porcine platelet serotonin transport (Nelson, P. J., and Rudnick, G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10084-10089), except for the number of sodium ions that are required for transport."
https://openalex.org/W1499077167,"Rabbit liver Zn metallothionein-(MT) will bind cadmium readily between -26 degrees C and 70 degrees C. The binding reaction was monitored by recording the circular dichroism and magnetic circular dichroism spectra, in the region of the RS(-)----Cd2+ charge transfer transition at 250 nm, at intervals as aliquots of cadmium were added. For all temperatures, these data can be analyzed in terms of a distributed mechanism for cadmium binding when Zn-MT is used, and a domain-specific mechanism when apo-MT is used. The CD spectrum measured at -26 degrees C for Cd,Zn-MT, which was made by adding excess cadmium directly to Zn7-MT at -26 degrees C, is not the same as the CD spectrum of Cd-MT prepared at room temperature from the same Zn7-MT. Measurements of the stoichiometry of the cadmium and zinc bound to MT in the presence of excess cadmium at different temperatures indicates that below 5 degrees C at least one zinc atom remains bound to the protein. The mixed metal metallothionein, Cd/Zn-MT, that always forms below 5 degrees C, is characterized by a single maximum near 250 nm in the CD spectrum, rather than the derivative-shaped CD envelope that is diagnostic of the (Cd4-S11)alpha cluster, which indicates that the zinc occupies a site in the alpha domain. Rearrangement of the bound metals to the domain-specific distribution takes place if Cd,Zn-MT, prepared at subzero temperatures, is warmed above 30 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1524061533,"Heme formation in reticulocytes from rabbits and rodents is subject to end product negative feedback regulation: intracellular heme has been shown to control acquisition of transferrin iron for heme synthesis. To identify the site of control of heme biosynthesis in the human erythron, immature erythroid cells were obtained from peripheral blood and aspirated bone marrow. After incubation with human 59Fe transferrin, 2-[14C]glycine, or 4-[14C]delta-aminolevulinate, isotopic incorporation into extracted heme was determined. Addition of cycloheximide to increase endogenous free heme, reduced incorporation of labeled glycine and iron but not delta-aminolevulinate into cell heme. Incorporation of glycine and iron was also sensitive to inhibition by exogenous hematin (Ki, 30 and 45 microM, respectively) i.e. at concentrations in the range which affect cell-free protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates. Hematin treatment rapidly diminished incorporation of intracellular 59Fe into heme by human erythroid cells but assimilation of 4-[14C]delta-aminolevulinate into heme was insensitive to inhibition by hematin (Ki greater than 100 microM). In human reticulocytes (unlike those from rabbits), addition of ferric salicylaldehyde isonicotinoylhydrazone, to increase the pre-heme iron pool independently of the transferrin cycle, failed to promote heme synthesis or modify feedback inhibition induced by hematin. In human erythroid cells (but not rabbit reticulocytes) pre-incubation with unlabeled delta-aminolevulinate or protoporphyrin IX greatly stimulated utilization of cell 59Fe for heme synthesis and also attenuated end product inhibition. In human erythroid cells heme biosynthesis is thus primarily regulated by feedback inhibition at one or more steps which lead to delta-aminolevulinate formation. Hence in man the regulatory process affects generation of the first committed precursor of porphyrin biosynthesis by delta-aminolevulinate synthetase, whereas in the rabbit separate regulatory mechanisms exist which control the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX."
https://openalex.org/W1562045310,"Calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C activity and substrates were characterized in cell lysates of preneoplastic JB6 cells, a model system of genetic variants for sensitivity to tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation. Protein kinase C activity was similar for sensitive and resistant variants, as measured by calcium- and phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate (histone HIII). Of 13 endogenous protein kinase C substrates, identified by labeling proteins with [gamma-32P] ATP, at least two (80 and 23 kDa) are potential candidates for mediating events on the pathway for promotion of transformation. 32P incorporation into the 80-kDa protein kinase C substrate was stimulated by tetradecanoylphorbol acetate and correlated with phenotype: the highest incorporation was found in promotion-insensitive cells, an intermediate level in promotion-sensitive cells and the lowest in the transformed cells. The phosphorylation of an 80-kDa protein, found by labeling intact cells in monolayer growth with [32P]orthophosphate, was also stimulated by tetradecanoylphorbol acetate and correlated inversely with phenotype. The 80 kDa protein kinase C substrate from cell lysates and the 80-kDa phosphoprotein from intact cells appear to be identical, as indicated by peptide mapping with protease V8 from Staphylococcus aureus. This finding suggests that the 80-kDa substrate is relevant to promoter-induced signal transduction in the intact cell. The 23-kDa protein kinase C substrate exhibited a band shift in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels in response to another transformation promoter in JB6 cells, the calcium analog, lanthanum (Smith, B. M., Gindhart, T. D., and Colburn, N. H. (1986) Carcinogenesis 7, 1949-1956). In summary, there are no unique substrates that distinguish the variants. Quantitative differences in certain substrates or their phosphorylation may, however, account for the difference in promotion sensitivity among the variants."
https://openalex.org/W1526644429,"Uridine phosphorylase is the only pyrimidine nucleoside cleaving activity that can be detected in extracts of Schistosoma mansoni. The enzyme is distinct from the two purine nucleoside phosphorylases contained in this parasite. Although Urd is the preferred substrate, uridine phosphorylase can also catalyze the reversible phosphorolysis of dUrd and dThd, but not Cyd, dCyd, or orotidine. The enzyme was purified 170-fold to a specific activity of 2.76 nmol/min/mg of protein with a 16% yield. It has a Mr of 56,000 as determined by molecular sieving on Sephadex G-100. The mechanism of uridine phosphorylase is sequential. When Urd was the substrate, the KUrd = 13 microM and the KPi = 533 +/- 78 microM. When dThd was used as a substrate, the KdThd = 54 microM and the KPi = 762 +/- 297 microM. The Vmax with dThd was 53 +/- 9.8% that of Urd. dThd was a competitive inhibitor when Urd was used as a substrate. The enzyme showed substrate inhibition by Urd, dThd (greater than 0.125 mM) and phosphate (greater than 10 mM). 5-(Benzyloxybenzyloxybenzyl)acyclouridine was identified as a potent and specific inhibitor of parasite (Ki = 0.98 microM) but not host uridine phosphorylase. Structure-activity relationship studies suggest that uridine phosphorylase from S. mansoni has a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring and indicate differences between the binding sites of the mammalian and parasite enzymes. These differences may be useful in designing specific inhibitors for schistosomal uridine phosphorylase which will interfere selectively with nucleic acids synthesis in this parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1493252203,"A new type of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, which releases basic aminoacyl dipeptides from the NH2-terminal end of oligopeptides, was purified about 2100-fold with 6.8% recovery from rat brain membranes by column chromatography on Cellex D, Arg-Tyr-AH-Sepharose 4B, hydroxylapatite, and Sephadex G-75, after the membranes were solubilized with Nonidet P-40. Activity was assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using Arg0-Met5-enkephalin (Arg0-enk)* as substrate in the presence of bestatin, thiorphan, and captopril. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme is apparently homogeneous with a mass of 64,000 daltons. This thiol enzyme is optimally active at pH 7 and is selectively activated by Mn(II). It loses 94% of its activity after EDTA treatment and can be reactivated by Mn(II), Co(II), and Zn(II). It splits Arg0-enk into equimolar amounts of Arg-Tyr and Gly-Gly-Phe-Met with a Km of 100 microM, and Vmax of 3.8 mumol/mg of protein/min. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase does not hydrolyze model substrates for dipeptidyl aminopeptidases I, II, III, and IV, aminoacyl beta-naphthylamides, actin, desmin, tubulin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and cytoskeletal neurofilament proteins. The enzyme is insensitive to puromycin, but is inhibited by several neuropeptides. Angiotensin III is the most potent with a Ki of 0.3 microM. Substrate specificity, pH optimum, molecular weight, activators, and catalytic site demonstrate that this enzyme is distinct from dipeptidyl aminopeptidases previously described."
https://openalex.org/W1546121621,"Covalently linked fatty acids are increasingly recognized as an important type of post-translational protein modification. Many of such acylated proteins are found associated with cellular membranes. The membrane skeleton of the parasitic hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei consists of a regular array of microtubules which are tightly bound to the overlying cell membrane. A microtubule-binding protein (p41) has been identified within this structure which carries covalently bound fatty acid. The fatty acid linkage is sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment. After chemical transesterification, the released radioactivity co-migrates with fatty acid methyl esters in thin-layer chromatograms, establishing that the fatty acid was covalently bound to p41 via an ester (thioester) linkage. Upon detergent extraction of trypanosomes, p41 remains tightly bound to the cytoskeleton as long as Ca2+ ions are present. It can selectively be released from this structure by the addition of excess EGTA. Conversely, p41 binds to isolated cytoskeletons and to purified microtubules in vitro, the reaction again being entirely Ca2+-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1604764018,"In LLC-PK1 pig kidney cells, treatment with a cAMP-elevating peptide hormone, calcitonin, induces the accumulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) mRNA. When we used the method of differential hybridization to isolate uPA cDNA clones, we also obtained several calcitonin-inducible clones that were unrelated to uPA. Sequence analysis revealed 60% sequence homology between one of these clones and that of a Drosophila hsp70 gene. The uPA and the hsp70 cDNA clones were used as probes to compare the effects of various treatments on the accumulation of uPA mRNA and hsp70 mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells. Calcitonin or 8-bromo-cAMP treatment induced uPA mRNA accumulation, which was negligible in untreated cells. Heat treatment (42 degrees C) was ineffective. Calcitonin or heat treatment increased hsp70 mRNA accumulation, which was already high in untreated cells, but 8-bromo-cAMP was ineffective. Nuclear transcription of the hsp70 gene was increased by calcitonin but not by 8-bromo-cAMP treatment. These results suggest that calcitonin induces hsp70 mRNA accumulation in LLC-PK1 cells by a pathway apart from the activation of adenylate cyclase and through, at least partly, the activation of the gene transcription. Furthermore, induction of uPA mRNA accumulation by calcitonin or 8-bromo-cAMP treatment did not require protein synthesis. In contrast, induction of hsp70 mRNA accumulation by calcitonin or heat treatment did require protein synthesis. Other reports showed that protein synthesis is not required for heat induction of hsp70 mRNA in different cells, suggesting that the mechanism of induction of hsp70 mRNA accumulation in LLC-PK1 cells is not the same as in other cells."
https://openalex.org/W81448960,"Human complement protein C9 is shown to be a metalloprotein that binds 1 mol of Ca2+/mol of C9 with a dissociation constant of 3 micron as measured by equilibrium dialysis. Incubation with EDTA removes the bound calcium, resulting in a apoprotein with decreased thermal stability. This loss in stability leads to aggregation and, therefore, to loss of hemolytic activity upon heating to a few degrees above the physiological temperature. Heat-induced aggregation of apoC9 can be prevented by salts that stabilize proteins according to the Hofmeister series of lyotropic ions, suggesting that the ion in native C9 may ligand with more than one structural element or domain of the protein. Ligand blotting indicates that the calcium binding site is located in the amino-terminal half of the protein. Removal of calcium by inclusion of EDTA in assay mixtures has no effect on the hemolytic activity of C9, and its capacity to bind to C8 in solution, or to small unilamellar lipid vesicles at temperatures at or below the physiological range. Although we do not know yet the precise structural and functional role of the bound calcium, it is clear that it provides thermal stability to C9 and it may have a function in regulation of membrane insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1597733851,"The regulation of growth hormone gene expression by thyroid hormone in cultured GH1 cells is mediated by a chromatin-associated receptor. We have previously described a photoaffinity label derivative of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3) in which the alanine side chain was modified to form N-2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyl-L-T3 (L-[125I]T3-PAL). On exposure to 254 nm UV light, L-[125I]T3-PAL generates a carbene which covalently modifies two thyroid hormone receptor forms in intact GH1 cells; an abundant 47,000 Mr species and a less abundant 57,000 Mr form. We have now synthesized similar photoaffinity label derivatives of 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (L-T4) and 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-rT3). Both compounds identify the same receptor forms in intact cells and in nuclear extracts in vitro as L-[125I]T3-PAL. Labeling by L-[125I]rT3-PAL was low and consistent with the very low occupancy of receptor by L-rT3. Underivatized L-[125I]T3 and L-[125I]T4 labeled the same receptor forms at 254 nm but at a markedly lower efficiency than their PAL derivatives. In contrast, N-bromoacetyl-L-[125I]T3, a chemical affinity labeling agent, did not derivatize either receptor form in vitro. The relative efficiency of coupling to receptor at 254 nm was L-[125I]T4-PAL greater than L-[125I]T3-PAL greater than L-[125I]T4 greater than L-[125I]T3. Although L-[125I]T4-PAL has a lower affinity for receptor than L-[125I]T3-PAL, its coupling efficiency was 5-10-fold higher. This suggests that the alanine side chain of L-[125I]T4-PAL is positioned in the ligand binding region near a residue which is efficiently modified by photoactivation. With L-[125I]T4-PAL we were able to identify three different molecular weight receptor species in human fibroblast nuclei."

PZP binds proteinases which cause the cleavage of internal thiol esters in the molecule. Both the binding of proteinases, i.e. chymotrypsin, (CT) to PZP, forming PZP.CT complexes, or reaction with methylamine (MA) forming PZP.MA complexes, cause transition to a new similar conformational state. Reactivity of selected monoclonal antibodies against PZP towards the three PZP derivatives demonstrated differences in the reactivity pattern. PZP and PZP.MA share one determinant, which is missing on the PZP.CT complex. PZP after transition to PZP.CT, but not to PZP.MA, presents a neodeterminant detected by one of six monoclonal antibodies. The findings demonstrate that at least three different conformational states exist for PZP and its derivatives. Access to discriminating immunochemical tools makes possible an evaluation of the relative abundance of the different complexes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1599231527,"A study on the interaction between bee venom phospholipase A2 and Cerebratulus lacteus cytolysin A-III, a major hemolysin secreted by this organism has been carried out. The hemolytic activity of A-III in phosphate-buffered saline is increased 5-fold in the presence of phospholipase A2 from bee venom. Dansylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPE) labeled, phosphatidylcholine-containing liposomes and human erythrocyte membranes were employed to study the interaction between these two proteins. In DPE-liposomes, A-III alone had no effect on DPE fluorescence nor did it enhance either the phospholipase A2-dependent fluorescence increase or blue shift in emission maximum, indicating that the cytolysin is not a major phospholipase A2-activator. However, when DPE was incorporated into erythrocyte membranes, A-III alone induced a 40% fluorescence increase and a 5 nm blue shift, implying a transient activation of an endogenous phospholipase A2. Further studies using synthetic lysophosphatidylcholine and free fatty acids demonstrated that the hemolytic activity of A-III is potentiated by free fatty acids, a product of phospholipid degradation catalyzed by phospholipase A2. Together, sublytic concentrations of A-III and nonlytic concentrations of oleic acid cause extensive cell lysis. Subsequent analysis of this phenomenon by gel filtration chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, chemical cross-linking, and measurement of [14C]oleic acid binding by the cytolysin demonstrated that binding of oleic acid to A-III causes aggregation of the toxin molecules to a tetrameric form which has a higher alpha-helix content and a greater activity than the monomer."
https://openalex.org/W2116570591,"5-Oxo-L-prolinase from Pseudomonas putida is composed of two reversibly dissociable proteins: Component A catalyzes 5-oxoproline-dependent cleavage of ATP, but does not catalyze the decyclization of 5-oxoproline; Component B is required for the coupling of ATP cleavage to ring-opening of 5-oxoproline to form glutamate (Seddon, A. P., Li, L., and Meister, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8091-8094). We describe here the purifications of Components A and B to apparent homogeneity and the interactions between these two proteins. The cellular content of Component B activity is significantly greater than that of Component A. By gel filtration, Component A is a hexamer; but in the presence of substrates, it is a dimer. Component B can exist as an aggregate, an octamer, or a tetramer, depending upon the conditions used. Gel filtration of a mixture of Components A and B in the presence of substrates gives a unique protein species that exhibits 5-oxoprolinase activity. The Mr of this Component A-Component B complex indicates that it probably has an A2-B2 structure. The molar ratio of Component A to Component B in the complex was determined to be 1:1 by the continuous variation method (Job). Titrations of each component by the other suggest that phosphorylated 5-oxoproline-bound Component A is the entity that interacts with Component B. These studies indicate that the binding of phosphorylated 5-oxoproline-bound Component A to Component B to form a complex proceeds by a cooperative type mechanism. This is supported by the observed shifts of the intersection points of the Job curves (see Appendix)."
