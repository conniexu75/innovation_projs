https://openalex.org/W2024206845,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a DNA-binding protein that activates erythropoietin (Epo) gene transcription in Hep3B cells subjected to hypoxia or cobalt chloride treatment. HIF-1 DNA binding activity is also induced by hypoxia or cobalt in non-Epo-producing cells, suggesting a general role for HIF-1 in hypoxia signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Here we report the biochemical purification of HIF-1 from Epo-producing Hep3B cells and non-Epo-producing HeLa S3 cells. HIF-1 protein was purified 11,250-fold by DEAE ion-exchange and DNA affinity chromatography. Analysis of HIF-1 isolated from a preparative gel shift assay revealed four polypeptides. Peptide mapping of these HIF-1 components demonstrated that 91-, 93-, and 94-kDa polypeptides had similar tryptic maps, whereas the 120-kDa polypeptide had a distinct profile. Glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis suggested that HIF-1 exists predominantly in a heterodimeric form and to a lesser extent as a heterotetramer. Partially purified HIF-1 bound specifically to the wild-type HIF-1 binding site from the EPO enhancer but not to a mutant sequence that lacks hypoxia-inducible enhancer activity. UV cross-linking analysis with purified HIF-1 indicated that both subunits of HIF-1 contact DNA directly. We conclude that in both cobalt chloride-treated HeLa cells and hypoxic Hep3B cells HIF-1 is composed of two different subunits: 120-kDa HIF-1α and 91-94-kDa HIF-1β.

https://openalex.org/W2035616122,"NF-kappa B, a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of p50 and p65 subunits, can be activated in many cell types and is thought to regulate a wide variety of genes involved in immune function and development. Mice lacking the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B show no developmental abnormalities, but exhibit multifocal defects in immune responses involving B lymphocytes and nonspecific responses to infection. B cells do not proliferate in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and are defective in basal and specific antibody production. Mice lacking p50 are unable effectively to clear L. monocytogenes and are more susceptible to infection with S. pneumoniae, but are more resistant to infection with murine encephalomyocarditis virus. These data support the role of NF-kappa B as a vital transcription factor for both specific and nonspecific immune responses, but do not indicate a developmental role for the factor."
https://openalex.org/W1988937009,"Several types of calcium channels found in the central nervous system are possible participants in triggering neurotransmitter release. Synaptic transmission between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neurons was mediated by N-type calcium channels, together with calcium channels whose pharmacology differs from that of L- and P-type channels but resembles that of the Q-type channel encoded by the alpha 1A subunit gene. Blockade of either population of channels strongly increased enhancement of synaptic transmission with repetitive stimuli. Even after complete blockade of N-type channels, transmission was strongly modulated by stimulation of neurotransmitter receptors or protein kinase C. These findings suggest a role for alpha 1A subunits in synaptic transmission and support the idea that neurotransmitter release may depend on multiple types of calcium channels under physiological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2080889643,"Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1."
https://openalex.org/W2033810895,"RelB, a member of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors, has been implicated in the constitutive expression of kappa B-regulated genes in lymphoid tissues. We have generated mice carrying a germline mutation of the relB gene, resulting in the absence of RelB protein and a dramatic reduction of constitutive kappa B-binding activity in thymus and spleen. Mice homozygous for the disrupted relB locus had phenotypic abnormalities including multifocal, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in several organs, myeloid hyperplasia, splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and a reduced population of thymic dendritic cells. RelB-deficient animals also had an impaired cellular immunity, as observed in contact sensitivity experiments. Thus, RelB plays a decisive role in the hematopoietic system, and its absence cannot be functionally compensated by any other member of the NF-kappa B/Rel family."

In addition, CRM197, a non-toxic mutant of DT, inhibited strongly the mitogenic activity of the secreted form of human HB-EGF, but not of mouse HB-EGF and other EGF receptor-binding growth factors.

https://openalex.org/W2048272531,"Regulation of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor promoter by cholesterol requires a well defined sterol regulatory site and an adjacent binding site for the universal transcription factor Sp1. These elements are located in repeats 2 and 3 of the wild type promoter, respectively. The experiments reported here demonstrate that Sp1 participates in sterol regulation of the LDL receptor in an orientation-specific fashion. We present data which suggest that sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) increases the binding of Sp1 to the adjacent repeat 3 sequence. We also demonstrate that SREBP and Sp1 synergistically activate expression from the LDL receptor promoter inside the cell by co-transfecting expression vectors encoding each protein into Drosophila tissue culture cells that are devoid of endogenous Sp1. In addition, other transcription factor sites were unable to substitute for Sp1 in sterol regulation when placed next to the SREBP-binding site. These studies together with recent data from others provide the basis of a working model for sterol regulation of the LDL receptor promoter. The presence of Sp1 sites in several other regulated promoters suggests that this universal transcription factor has been recruited to participate in many regulatory responses possibly by a similar mechanism.

Cellular sterol balance is efficiently maintained by a feedback mechanism. When cellular sterol levels are low genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake are activated(1Brown M.S.

When sufficient cholesterol is amassed they are efficiently shut off. The protein involved in cholesterol uptake is a cell surface receptor that rapidly internalizes cholesterol-rich low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinHMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme Abpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)SRE-1sterol regulatory element-1SREBPsterol regulatory element binding protein. particles from outside the cell. Transcription from the LDL receptor gene is efficiently regulated by cholesterol, and its simple promoter is composed of three related sequence elements referred to as repeats 1-3 located upstream of a TATA box-like element(3Sudhof T.

Repeats 1 and 3 bind the universal transcription factor Sp1. However, repeat 2 harbors a special element that is directly responsible for regulation by sterols, and it does not bind Sp1. The sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) within repeat 2 was identified by mutational studies as a 10-base pair contiguous sequence that binds a family of basic helix-loop-helix zipper proteins called the sterol regulatory element binding proteins or SREBPs(5Smith J.R.

It cannot function efficiently by itself even when present in multiple copies ((8) and this study). In the native LDL receptor promoter the adjacent binding site for transcription factor Sp1 located in repeat 3 is also required(4Sudhof T. Van der Westhuyzen D. Goldstein J. Brown M. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factor Sp1 was first identified as a trans-acting sequence-specific DNA-binding protein required for expression of the SV40 virus early promoter(9Dynan W.S. Tjian R.T. Cell. 1993; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Soon thereafter, Sp1 sites were identified in several other viral and cellular promoters. Because of its widespread occurrence Sp1 is probably involved in activation of transcription from a wide variety of promoters(10Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This basic function of Sp1 underscores its fundamental importance in gene transcription. Many of the promoters with Sp1 sites contain other elements that specify regulated expression of the encoded gene. These specific regulatory elements may function by influencing the activity of Sp1 bound at a neighboring site. Since normal sterol regulation requires both a special sterol regulatory element (SRE-1) and an adjacent Sp1-binding site, the LDL receptor promoter provides a system to study how Sp1 is involved in regulated transcription. The experiments reported here were designed to address the role of the Sp1 site of repeat 3 in sterol regulation. We show that sterol regulation is lost when the sequence of repeat 3 is inverted relative to repeat 2. We also present data which suggest that SREBP binding at repeat 2 stimulates Sp1 binding at repeat 3. Furthermore, when sites for other known transcription factors were substituted in place of repeat 3 normal sterol regulation was not observed. These data provide the basis for a working model of how SREBP and Sp1 function together to modulate cellular sterol levels through regulation of the LDL receptor. CV-1 cells were obtained from Dr. K. Cho at the University of California, Irvine. All cell culture materials were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was prepared by ultra centrifugation as described(11Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and 25-OH cholesterol were purchased from Steraloids Inc., and stock solutions were dissolved in absolute ethanol. pGL2 basic was purchased from Promega Inc. and was used as the source of the luciferase gene in all constructions. Standard techniques were used in all cloning procedures(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To make the “TATA only” plasmid, the SalI to HindIII fragment from the hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase mutant plasmid P of Smith et al.(13Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18480-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing sequence from −28 to +39 relative to the mRNA start site was inserted between the XhoI and HindIII sites in pGL2 basic. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing three copies of the human LDL receptor repeat 2 (5′-CTAG-[AAAATCACCCCACTGC]3-G-3′ with a CTAG sticky end) were annealed and cloned into the NheI site just upstream of the TATA insert in the TATA only plasmid. This process regenerated a NheI site only on the 3′ side of the insert. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing a single copy of the human LDL receptor repeat 3 sequence (CTAGCAAACTCCTCCCCCTGC with the same sticky end) was then inserted at the 3′ side of the repeat 2 insertion. Two plasmids were identified by DNA sequencing to contain the insertion in both possible orientations.

The identity of all of the plasmids used in this study was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. pCMV2 β-Gal was obtained from K. Normington from the Department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and contains the cytomegalovirus early promoter linked to the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene. Some of the oligonucleotides used here were purchased from Operon Technologies, and others were synthesized by Andy Craddock in the core facility of the Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Department at the University of California, Irvine. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on day 0 in 60-mm dishes at 125,000 cells/dish. On day 1 the cells were refed the same media and transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Precipitates contained 20 μg each of test plasmid and CMV2 β-Gal plus 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA in 2 ml of solution. 0.5 ml were added to each of four dishes which were incubated for 12-16 h at 37°C and 7% CO2. The dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and duplicate dishes were refed either induced (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum) or suppressed (same but containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-OH cholesterol) media. Following a 24-h incubation, the cells were harvested by scraping, cells from duplicate dishes were pooled, and extracts were prepared by three freeze thaw cycles. Drosophila SL2 cells were obtained from Dr. Al Courey (UCLA) and cultured at 25°C in Shields and Sang Drosophila media (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. They were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and transfected by a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method(18Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Plasmid pPACSp1 containing the Sp1 coding sequence under the control of the Drosophila Actin 5C promoter was also obtained from Dr. A. Courey. The SREBP-1 protein used in this study represents amino acids 1-490 of the full-length protein. The corresponding region of the mRNA was cloned from HepG2 cell cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides designed from the published sequence(6Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). We inserted the corresponding DNA fragment into the pPAC expression vector. Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer with a luciferin reagent from Promega Biotec. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by a standard colorimetric procedure with 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity in relative light units was divided by the β-galactosidase activity (activity/h) for each extract. The data presented here represent the average values derived from at least five independent transfections for each plasmid in Fig. 1 and at least two independent transfections for the plasmids shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3:DNase I footprint analyses with both Sp1 and SREBP. Purified Sp1 or SREBP was used in a footprint reaction essentially as described in the legend to Fig. 2A and under “Materials and Methods.” The indicated amount of each protein was added alone or together with the DNA probe as indicated, and reactions were processed by the standard footprinting procedure.

Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1 protein used in these experiments also represents amino acids 1-490 of the full-length protein (see above). The amplified partial cDNA was cloned into the pRSET plasmid (Invitrogen) and expressed as a fusion protein with the His tag sequence at the amino terminus. The protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography. The purity and concentrations of the purified proteins were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis performed with marker proteins followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. [ 32P]DNA probes were prepared from the indicated plasmids, incubated with Sp1, SREBP-1, or both proteins together and digested with DNase I as described(9Dynan W.S. Tjian R.T. Cell. 1993; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 20Osborne T.F. Gil G. Brown M.S. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purified proteins alone or together were incubated on ice with a 32P-labeled probe consisting of a single copy each of repeats 2 and 3 of the wild type LDL receptor promoter. For the experiment of Fig. 4A, the binding conditions and electrophoresis were performed by standard methods as described previously (21Osborne T. Bennett M. Rhee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18973-18982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 5 μg of nonfat milk protein were included in all binding reactions. The region of the dried gel corresponding to the Sp1 complex was excised and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. For the experiment of Fig. 4C, the gel was run at 4°C instead of room temperature, and the buffer was changed from 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (44 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 44 mM borate, 0.5 mM EDTA) to 0.5 × Tris glycine (12.5 mM Trizma base, 94.5 mM glycine). To study the role of the LDL receptor repeat 3 in sterol regulation, we prepared a series of luciferase fusion plasmids based on the diagram at the bottom of Fig. 1. A TATA box fragment containing sequence from −28 to +39 from the promoter for HMG-CoA synthase was fused to the luciferase coding sequence as described under “Materials and Methods.” We inserted three copies of the repeat 2 sequence from the human LDL receptor promoter into this TATA only construct. All three copies were directed in the same orientation that is present in the wild type promoter. Next, we inserted a single copy of repeat 3 in both possible orientations. Each of these plasmids was transfected into CV-1 cells that were subsequently cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of regulatory sterols, and aliquots of total cell lysates were used to measure luciferase activity. We included an internal control plasmid, pCMV2 β-Gal, which encodes β-galactosidase driven by the powerful and non-cholesterol-regulated human cytomegalovirus early promoter. All of the values presented here represent a ratio of luciferase to β-Gal to correct for nonspecific variations in the transfection and assay procedures. The TATA only containing plasmid displayed very low levels of activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8) and insertion of the three copies of repeat 2 activated expression only slightly and it was not induced upon sterol deprivation (lanes 5 and 6). This is consistent with previous experiments and clearly demonstrates that repeat 2 cannot activate high levels of sterol-regulated expression on its own even when present in multiple copies(8Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When one copy of repeat 3 from the LDL receptor was placed immediately adjacent to the repeat 2 insertion in the same relative orientation as is found in the wild type promoter, expression was enhanced significantly, and it was 4-fold higher in cells cultured in serum depleted of lipoproteins (lanes 1 and 2). This 4-fold induction by sterol deprivation is similar to the magnitude observed with the entire wild type promoter(4Sudhof T. Van der Westhuyzen D. Goldstein J. Brown M. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2306-2310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the orientation of repeat 3 was reversed the level of activity in the presence of regulatory sterols was similar to the wild type orientation indicating that basal activation afforded by Sp1 at repeat 3 is independent of orientation (compare lanes 2 and 4). However, activation upon removal of serum lipoproteins is abolished (compare lanes 1 and 3). Therefore, only the activation of the promoter upon sterol depletion is affected by the inversion of repeat 3. The above observations indicate that Sp1 has a dual role in transcription of the LDL receptor promoter. First, it provides a basal level of activation that is independent of orientation. Second, it has a role in sterol regulation which is critically dependent on the orientation of the recognition site. This suggests that Sp1 binds to repeat 3 in an asymmetric fashion. To evaluate this more directly, we analyzed the binding of purified Sp1 to the plasmids discussed above. We prepared footprinting probes labeled with 32P on the bottom DNA strand from the plasmid with repeat 3 in the native (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-5) or inverted orientation (lanes 6-10). An aliquot of each probe was incubated with purified Sp1 followed by a standard DNase I footprinting experiment. Fig. 2A shows that Sp1 bound to repeat 3 in both plasmids; however, there was an important distinction. The footprint with repeat 3 in the inverted orientation resulted in a DNase I hyper-cleavage site between repeats 2 and 3 (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 8 and 9 and note the horizontal arrow). This is outside of the inverted repeat 3 sequence and is, therefore, not due to a DNA strand-specific difference. The reason for this distinction is the directional manner in which Sp1 binds to its site and could be due either to a specific alteration in the DNA structure or to a more favorable microenvironment for cleavage by DNase I that is induced by Sp1. If this hypersensitive cleavage site truly was a consequence of the asymmetric interaction of Sp1 with its recognition site then an identical hyper-cleavage site should be induced on the complementary DNA strand in the other plasmid on the opposite side of the repeat 3 insertion. Therefore, we prepared probes 32P labeled on the opposite DNA strand and repeated the DNase I footprinting reactions. The results displayed in Fig. 2B clearly show that an identical hyper-cleavage site is generated (note the horizontal arrow in Fig. 2B and compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 6 and 7). To study potential SREBP-Sp1 interactions at the LDL receptor promoter, DNA probes from plasmids containing repeat 3 in both orientations were used for DNase I footprinting analyses with both proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). SREBP-1 bound to all three copies of the repeat 2 sequence as expected when added alone, and a strong hyper-cleavage site was induced at the 5′ boundary of each binding site (lane 8 of both A and B). Titrations of Sp1 were performed alone (lanes 2-4) and in the presence of a saturating amount of recombinant SREBP (lanes 5-7). The footprint regions for each separate protein directly abut each other and may partially overlap (compare lane 4 with lane 8). When both proteins are added together, Sp1 bound to repeat 3 made the adjacent site protected by SREBP more accessible to DNase I. SREBP is partially displaced to allow access to the DNase I, but it is still bound since the hyper-cleavage site at the 5′ side is still visible. This effect of Sp1 on SREBP was independent of the orientation of repeat 3 (compare lanes 5 and 8 of both A and B). Since the two binding sites are immediately adjacent to one another and their footprint regions may slightly overlap, this result is probably due to steric interference by Sp1. The close proximity suggests that direct communication by the DNA-bound proteins may be essential to the synergistic activation of transcription observed when cellular sterol levels fall. From the experiments presented above there appeared to be an interaction between the DNA bound Sp1 and SREBP. Additionally, in some of our footprint experiments SREBP seemed to increase the binding of Sp1 to repeat 3. 2H. B. Sanchez, unpublished results. To study this further, we performed gel shift experiments with a DNA probe containing one copy each of repeats 2 and 3 (Fig. 4A). When either SREBP (lane 1) or Sp1 (lanes 7-10) were added alone each bound to the probe and produced a stable gel-shifted complex. The SREBP complex migrated slightly slower than the Sp1 complex through the gel. When a constant level of SREBP was incubated with Sp1 in increasing amounts, the Sp1 binding activity was significantly enhanced (lanes 2-5). This effect was quantified by cutting the complexes from the gel and determining the amount of radioactive DNA present by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Fig. 4B). From the picture of the gel (Fig. 4A) and the graph (Fig. 4B), it is clear that Sp1 binding is significantly enhanced by SREBP. This effect requires that the SREBP-binding site and repeat 3 are on the same DNA molecule.2 The enhanced binding of Sp1 resulted in a dramatic increase in the Sp1 only protein•DNA complex, and little of the complex containing both proteins was observed. The dual complex does appear at higher levels of Sp1, but the amount of the complex varied slightly between experiments and it was not significantly increased when the concentration of Sp1 was increased over a range where the amount of the Sp1 only complex was greatly stimulated (lanes 3-5). This suggests that the SREBP-DNA interaction was destabilized by Sp1, and the association is unstable to the gel electrophoresis conditions. The data of Fig. 3 which shows that Sp1 partially displaced the adjacently bound SREBP in the footprint reaction supports this notion. This would be similar to an observation concerning the HTLV Tax protein. Tax has been reported to stimulate DNA binding of a co-regulatory protein without the formation of a stable ternary complex under standard gel-shift conditions. However, alteration of the conditions for native gel electrophoresis made it possible to detect substantial amounts of the stable ternary complex (22Wagner S. Green M. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to validate our interpretation of the experiment of Fig. 4A by altering conditions of the gel-shift experiments to stabilize the ternary complex between Sp1, SREBP, and the DNA. By increasing the concentration of SREBP 5-fold and altering the gel-shift conditions (see “Materials and Methods”), we were able to detect substantial amounts of the stimulated ternary complex (Fig. 4C). Once again, the SREBP significantly enhanced Sp1 binding (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 6-10). All of the experiments to date (including those reported here) document that repeat 3 is essential to sterol regulation. Since Sp1 binds to this site in vitro it was assumed that Sp1 was the regulatory protein inside the cell. However, repeat 3 is not a classic GC box containing Sp1 site and considering that several other proteins have been shown to bind to Sp1-like sites in vitro(23Mitchell P. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 24Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), it was not clear if Sp1 was the protein involved in synergistic activation of the LDL receptor promoter along with SREBP inside the cell. To evaluate this we performed co-transfection studies in Drosophila SL2 cells. This line has been used previously to analyze Sp1 function since the cells are devoid of endogenous Sp1 yet retain the necessary accessory proteins required to support an Sp1 activation response(18Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1 coding sequence from amino acid 1-490, which contains all the information required for transcriptional activation(6Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 26Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), was inserted into the Drosophila pPAC expression vector (18Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and transfected into SL2 cells in the presence and absence of pPAC Sp1 and various luciferase reporter plasmids (Fig. 5). We used the plasmid from Fig. 1 containing three copies of repeat 2 linked to repeat 3 in the native orientation (lanes 1-4), the wild type LDL receptor promoter (lanes 5-8), and as a control we used a plasmid containing the SV40 early promoter which contains six Sp1 sites and no high affinity binding sites for SREBP (lanes 9-12). The SV40 promoter did not respond to SREBP co-transfection alone (lane 11) but was dramatically activated by Sp1 (lane 10). The addition of SREBP along with Sp1 resulted in less than a 2-fold further increase from the SV40 promoter (compare lanes 10 and 12). The wild type LDL receptor and the synthetic repeat 2-repeat 3 promoters are weakly activated by SREBP or Sp1 alone (lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7), and co-transfection with both Sp1 and SREBP resulted in synergistic activation (lanes 4 and 8). These results strongly support the model that SREBP and Sp1 work in concert to activate the LDL receptor promoter. The data presented so far indicate that the orientation of the Sp1 site in the repeat 3 element is crucial for normal regulation of the LDL receptor promoter and that SREBP increases the binding of Sp1 to the repeat 3 site. Since Sp1 is a universal transcription factor that activates expression of several other promoters, we next asked whether other transcription factor-binding sites could substitute for Sp1. A series of reporter plasmids containing binding sites for other ubiquitous transcription factors in place of the repeat 3 Sp1 site were made and analyzed as described above (Fig. 6). When a low affinity Sp1 site from the herpes virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene (TK) was inserted in place of repeat 3 a low level of expression was observed in the presence of regulatory sterols that was induced upon sterol depletion (compare lanes 3 and 4). This would be expected if the resulting transcriptional activity is dependent on the affinity of Sp1 for its site. Binding sites for either nuclear factor 1 or the octamer family of regulators did not functionally replace repeat 3 (lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10); however, insertion of a binding site for AP-1 did partially restore regulation (lanes 7 and 8). This is potentially significant since there is an AP-1-binding site adjacent to an SREBP-binding site in the sterol-regulated HMG-CoA synthase promoter (see “Discussion”). Since none of these other sites fully substitute for repea"

The radioactive material was further digested with exochitinase to remove the bulk of the chitin, and the liberated oligosaccharides were fractionated on a sizing column. A single peak (compound I) was found to consist of N-acetylglucosamine, glucose, and glucitol residues in the ratio 1:2:1. By digestion with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and by NMR spectroscopy, N-acetylglucosamine was identified as the nonreducing terminus, linked to laminaritriitol by a β(1 →4) bond. Five additional oligosaccharides were recovered, two being analogs of compound I, with 1 or 3 glucose units, respectively; the remaining three were shown to be the reduced analogs of laminaribiose, laminaritriose, and laminaritetraose. The presence of N-acetylglucosamine-containing oligosaccharides arises from the activity of chitinase in cleaving 2 sugar units sequentially in those chains containing an odd number of N-acetylglucosamine residues; correspondingly, oligosaccharides containing only glucose and sorbitol derive from even-numbered chitin chains, a result implying that chitinase can hydrolyze the linkage between N-acetylglucosamine and glucose. It is concluded that the terminal reducing residue of a chitin chain is attached to the nonreducing end of a β(1 →3)-glucan chain by a β(1 →4) linkage. Experiments with appropriate mutants showed that synthesis of the chitin combined with glucan is catalyzed by chitin synthetase 3.

The timing and possible mechanism of formation of the chitin-glucan linkage is discussed. Cell walls determine the shape of fungal cells and are essential for their integrity(1Cabib E. Bowers B. Sburlati A. Silverman S.J. Microbiol. Sci. 1988; 5: 370-375PubMed Google Scholar). They consist mainly of carbohydrates, some free, some linked to protein. The main components of the yeast cell wall are a β(1 →3)-D-glucan that also contains some β(1 →6)-linked branches and a mannoprotein, most of which is carbohydrate(2Cabib E. Roberts R. Bowers B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A β(1 →6)-D-glucan, also containing some β(1 →3)-linked branches(2Cabib E. Roberts R. Bowers B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), is a relatively minor constituent; an even scarcer component is chitin. The latter is mostly concentrated at the septal region(2Cabib E. Roberts R. Bowers B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 3Roberts R.L. Bowers B. Slater M.L. Cabib E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but some of it is dispersed throughout the cell wall(4Horisberger M. Vonlanthen M. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 115: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Molano J. Bowers B. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 8: 199-212Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The composition of a cell wall, however, is only a partial description of its architecture. To understand both the structure and morphogenesis of the wall, it is necessary to know how its constituents are organized in layers and cross-linked to each other to yield a fabric strong enough to resist turgor pressure. Evidence that different cell wall polysaccharides are covalently linked has been accumulating. We have argued that such a linkage must exist in the yeast cell wall between β(1 →3)-glucan and the mannoprotein, to explain why the latter is solubilized after treatment of the wall with β-glucanase(6Zlotnik H. Fernandez M.P. Bowers B. Cabib E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment isolated after cell wall digestion by Van Rinsum et al.(7Van Rinsum J. Klis F.M. Van den Ende H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), containing both mannose and glucose may represent a connecting bridge. There is also good evidence that in Schizophyllum commune(8Sietsma J.H. Wessels J.G.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 114: 99-108Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and in Candida albicans(9Surarit R. Gopal P.K. Shepherd M.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1723-1730PubMed Google Scholar) chitin and β-glucan are covalently bound. In the former, amino acids have been implied as participants in the bridge region(8Sietsma J.H. Wessels J.G.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 114: 99-108Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas a direct glycosidic linkage was reported in Candida(9Surarit R. Gopal P.K. Shepherd M.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1723-1730PubMed Google Scholar); in both cases the chemical evidence is far from compelling. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a covalent linkage between chitin and β-glucan is strongly suggested by the experiments of Mol and Wessels(10Mol P.C. Wessels J.G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 41: 95-99Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These authors found that, after extraction of alkali-soluble glucan, treatment of the cell wall residue with chitinase rendered the remainder of the glucan alkali-soluble. We decided to look for the linkage region between chitin and glucan in S. cerevisiae by following an approach similar to that of Sietsma and Wessels (8Sietsma J.H. Wessels J.G.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 114: 99-108Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and of Surarit et al.(9Surarit R. Gopal P.K. Shepherd M.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 1723-1730PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. by digesting cell walls with both β(1 →3)-glucanase and chitinase. Labeling of the enzyme-resistant core by reduction with sodium borotritide facilitated detection and purification of the mixed oligosaccharides wherein the sought after linkage was found. β-N-Acetylglucosaminidases from jack beans or from Diplococcus pneumoniae were from Oxford Glycosystems. β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase from beef kidney and β-glucosidase from sweet almonds were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Zymolyase 100 T from Seikagaku, and Glusulase from DuPont. Sodium [3H]borohydride was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (100-500 mCi/mmol) or ICN (100 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]glucose (50-60 mCi/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Chitinase from Serratia marcescens was prepared as described(11Roberts R. Cabib E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The strains used were D3C (MATα ura3) as wild type, ECY36-3C (MATachs1-23 chs2::LEU2 trp1-1 ura3-52 leu2-2) as Chs1- and Chs2-deficient, ECY36-3D (MATachs1-23 cal1/csd2 ura3-52 leu2-2 trp1-1) as Chs1- and Chs3-deficient, and ECY36-3D pHV9A (plasmid pHV9A carries the CAL1/CSD2 gene that restores Chs3 activity). Strains D3C and ECY36-3D were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) and strains ECY36-3C and ECY36-3D pHV9A in minimal medium (2% glucose, 0.7% Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) plus nutritional requirements. In all cases growth was at 30°C. For standard preparations, strain D3C was used, except for a large-scale experiment, in which ECY36-3C was employed because of its higher chitin content(12Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Durán A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In a typical preparation, 16.3 g of cells, wet weight, harvested in exponential phase of growth, were suspended in about 45 ml of 50 mM Tris chloride, pH 7.5, and added to 75 g of glass beads (0.5-mm diameter, Braun-Melsungen, Germany) in the intermediate-size vessel of a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, Ohio). After cooling the suspension to 5°C, the Bead-Beater was operated for two 3-min periods, with a 10-min cooling period in between. The extract was aspirated from the glass beads, and the latter were washed several times with small portions of Tris buffer. Cell walls were sedimented by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min and washed five times with Tris buffer, followed by suspension in the same buffer to a final volume of 495 ml. Zymolyase 100 T (4.3 ml of a 7.5 mg/ml solution in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.3) was added, the suspension was incubated at 37°C with shaking and the absorbance at 660 nm was monitored. After about 1 h the absorbance had decreased to about 5% of the original value. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was washed twice with Tris buffer and twice with 1% SDS. In the second washing with SDS the suspension was placed for 5 min in a boiling water bath. The pellet was then washed three more times with water and suspended in water to a concentration of 10 mg of chitin/ml (about 1 ml in the preparation described). The ratio of total N-acetylglucosamine to total glucose at this step was 1:0.7. 600 μl of the suspension was treated with 600 μl of NaB3H4 (6 mCi) in dimethyl formamide at room temperature for 5 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 M acetic acid (300 μl) and the insoluble material was washed by repeated centrifugations followed by suspension in 50 mM potassium phosphate at pH 6.3. The washed reduced chitin was digested overnight at 30°C with 600 μl (184 milliunits) of S. marcescens chitinase. Any insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant fluid was used directly for Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography (see “Results”). The compounds isolated from the eluate of the Bio-Gel column were again reduced with an excess of unlabeled sodium borohydride and repurified by Bio-Gel chromatography prior to further analysis. Samples were analyzed on a Dionex HPAEC 1The abbreviations used are: HPAEChigh performance anion exchange chromatographysilver triflatesilver trifluoromethanesulfonateChs1Chs2, and Chs3, chitin synthetase 1, 2, and 3, respectivelyHETCORheterocorrelated spectroscopy. instrument equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector model PAD2, and pellicular anion-exchange columns (PA-1 or MA-1, 4 × 250 mm). The Dionex eluent degas module was used to sparge and pressurize the eluents with the helium set at 100 p.s.i. The flow rate was maintained at 0.8 ml/min. The applied pulse potential was 0.05 V and detector sensitivity was set at 300 nA. The system was used at ambient temperature. Samples were applied via a Dionex microinjection valve with a 50-μl loop. Areas under the curve were recorded and integrated with a Spectra-Physics integrator.

The solvent used for paper chromatography was butanol/pyridine/water, 6:4:3, and the paper was Whatman No. 1 or No. 3MM. Total carbohydrate was measured with the anthrone reagent (13Trevelyan W.E. Harrison J.S. Biochem. J. 1952; 50: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and glucose by glucose oxidase (Glucose Trinder Kit from Sigma). Free GlcNAc was quantified by the method of Reissig et al.(14Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and combined GlcNAc by the same method after digestion of 60 μl of sample (0.3-0.5 μmol of combined GlcNAc) with 60 μl of Glusulase, 60 μl of chitinase, and 5 μl of 1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, for 45 min at 30°C. Chemical ionization mass spectra were obtained with a Finigan 1015 D spectrometer, with the use of ammonia as the reactive gas. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured at ambient temperature with a Varian FX 300 or a Varian Gemini spectrometer, operating at 300 MHz for protons and 75 MHz for 13C. Chemical shifts found in the spectra recorded for solutions in CDCl3 and D2O are reported, respectively, with Me4Si and methanol ( δ MeOH versus δ Me4Si 49.0) as internal standards. Proton-signal assignments were done by COSY or homonuclear decoupling experiments. The nonequivalent geminal proton resonating at lower field is denoted Ha and the one at higher field Hb. Carbon signal assignments were based on heteronuclear shift-correlated two-dimensional experiments (HETCOR). Optical rotations were measured at 25°C with a Perkin Elmer automatic polarimeter, model 241 MC. All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on pre-coated slides of Silica Gel G F254 (Analtech). Detection was effected by charring with 5% sulfuric acid in ethanol or, when applicable, with UV light. Preparative chromatography was performed by gradient elution from columns of Silica Gel 60 (Merck, no. 9385). Reactions requiring anhydrous conditions were performed under dry nitrogen using common laboratory glassware and reagents and solvents were handled with gas-tight syringes. Solutions in organic solvents were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under a vacuum at 40°C. 1,2,3,4-Tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranose (Sigma) and bromo-2-deoxy-2-N-phtalimido-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-α,β-D-glucopyranose (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.) were used as supplied. 1,2,3,4-Tetra-O-acetylβ-D-glucopyranose (1) (0.7 g, 2 mmol) was dissolved in dry nitromethane (30 ml) and 4-Å molecular sieve (1 g) was added. After cooling to −30°C, the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min and sym-collidine (0.28 ml, 2 mmol) and silver triflate (0.54 g, 2.1 mmol) were added. Finally, bromo-2-deoxy-2-N-phtalimido-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-α,β-D-glucopyranose (2) (1 g, 2 mmol) dissolved in nitromethane (5 ml) was added dropwise. After 1 h, additional portions of sym-collidine (0.056 ml, 0.4 mmol), silver triflate (0.1 g, 0.4 mmol), and compound 2 (0.2 g, 0.4 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at −30°C. At this point, compound 1 was no longer detected (TLC, toluene/acetone, 6:1). After filtration through Celite, the filtrate was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate and water, dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated, and purified on a silica gel column (toluene/acetone, 10:1) to yield 3.

Disaccharide 3 (0.055 g, 0.072 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (10 ml) and sodium methoxide in methanol (1 M, 0.1 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. At this time compound 3 was no longer detected (TLC, propanol/ethyl acetate/water, 4:2:1). After neutralization with Amberlite 120 (H +) and filtration, the filtrate was concentrated and dried under a vacuum. Crude product was dissolved in methanol (5 ml) and anhydrous hydrazine (14 μl, 0.45 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was kept under reflux (65°C) for 2 h, at which point starting material was consumed (TLC, ethyl acetate/ethanol/water, 8:4:2). After cooling to room temperature, acetic anhydride (0.5 g, 0.46 ml, 4.9 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 20 min. When starting material was no longer detected (TLC, propanol/ethyl acetate/water, 2:1:1) the reaction mixture was concentrated and purified on a Bio-Gel P-2 extra-fine, 2 × 90-cm column to yield 4.

To isolate the linkage region between chitin and β-glucan, yeast cell walls were digested with a β(1 →3)-endoglucanase (zymolyase), with the expectation of forming short glucose oligosaccharide stubs attached to the chitin. After removal of all the solubilized material, the insoluble fraction was reduced with sodium borotritide, to label the reducing ends of the stubs. This treatment also reduces and labels GlcNAc residues at the reducing end of chitin chains not bound to glucan. The labeled material was then digested with S. marcescens exo-chitinase, an enzyme that sequentially cleaves diacetylchitobiose residues from chitin, starting from the nonreducing end(11Roberts R. Cabib E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The material solubilized by this treatment was applied to a Bio-Gel P-2 column (Fig. 1). Two of the major radioactive peaks correspond to diacetylchitobiitol (Fig. 1, Peak 4) and triacetylchitotriitol (Fig. 1, Peak 2), which originate from free chitin chains containing an even and an odd number of GlcNAc residues, respectively(15Kang, M. S., Elango, N., Mattia, E., Au-Young, J., Robbins, P. W., Cabib, E., (1984) J. Biol. Chem., 259, 14966–14972.Google Scholar). In addition to the above, a large peak in the void volume and some additional minor peaks were detected (Fig. 1). The latter appeared to be candidates for the linkage region and were named Peaks A, B, and C. It may be mentioned that essentially the same technique was previously used for determination of chitin chain length(15Kang, M. S., Elango, N., Mattia, E., Au-Young, J., Robbins, P. W., Cabib, E., (1984) J. Biol. Chem., 259, 14966–14972.Google Scholar). It is in those experiments that some of the minor peaks were first detected. For an understanding of the chromatographic procedures involving Bio-Gel P-2 columns, it is important to realize that each GlcNAc residue, whether free or combined, counts as 2 hexose residues in determining relative elution positions(16Yamashita K. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Thus, diacetychitobiose elutes in the same volume as a glucose tetrasaccharide. This is not true of paper chromatography, where the mobility of each monosaccharide depends on the solvent used and, within the same series, is inversely proportional to molecular weight. Early in this study, it was realized that Peak A contained both N-acetylglucosamine and glucose, whereas Peaks B and C contained only glucose. For that reason, the initial effort was devoted to elucidate the structure of the substance contained in Peak A (compound I). Upon acid hydrolysis, I gave rise to glucosamine, glucose, and glucitol, in the ratio 1.1:2:0.9 (Fig. 2). The molecular weight of the acetylated compound, as measured by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3a), was 1316, compared to a value of 1315 for an acetylated tetrasaccharide consisting of a residue each of GlcNAc and glucitol and 2 glucose residues (includes the weight of ammonium ion). This composition is also reflected in the elution volume of Peak A which corresponds to a reduced glucose pentasaccharide standard.Figure 3:Determination of the molecular weight of I, II, and III by mass spectrometry. 100 nmol each of I, II, or III were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in 200 μl of pyridine and 200 μl of acetic anhydride were added. After overnight incubation at room temperature, a few drops of toluene and methanol were added and the solution was evaporated to dryness. The dissolution-evaporation was repeated several times, first with toluene, then with methanol. Finally, the samples were dissolved in 20 μl of dichloromethane and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Because ammonia was used as the reactive gas, the ammonium ion weight must be added to the calculated molecular weight. a, I; b, II; c, III.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore in which manner and position the GlcNAc was attached, I was treated with N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase and β-glucosidase (Fig. 4). Whereas β-glucosidase treatment had no effect on the elution of I (Fig. 4c), incubation with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase moved it to the position of laminaritriitol (Fig. 4b). This result showed the GlcNAc in I to be at the nonreducing end and to be attached to a trisaccharide by a β-linkage. This structure was consistent with the results of partial hydrolysis by either acid or enzymes (Fig. 5). After partial acid hydrolysis three additional peaks were detected, which migrated as Glc(β1-3)Glc(β1-3)Glc-ol (or Glc(β1-6)Glc-ol), Glcβ(1-3)Glc-ol, and Glc-ol (Fig. 5a). All these compounds would be expected if GlcNAc were attached to a reduced laminaritriose. It should be kept in mind that only those products that still retain the labeled sorbitol can be detected by the radiometric assay. Partial hydrolysis with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase gave rise to a peak in the position of the original material and another one moving as Glc(β1-3)Glc(β1-3)Glc-ol or Glc(β1-6)Glc-ol (Fig. 5b). This result already indicates that the glucose trisaccharide cannot be gentiotriitol since the latter (standard 6 in Fig. 5b) moves much more slowly than the product of the reaction. When both β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and β-glucosidase were allowed to act on I, the product comigrated with Glc(β1-3)Glc-ol and was clearly different from the 1-2, 1-4, and 1-6 isomers (Fig. 5b). In separate experiments it was found that laminaribiitol is resistant to β-glucosidase. Taken together, the above results are consistent with a structure in which GlcNAc is β-linked to reduced laminaritriose. To confirm the linkage between the 2 glucose residues as 1-3, the reduced trisaccharide obtained by N-acetylglucosaminidase digestion of I was oxidized with periodate and hydrolyzed with acid. Any configuration of the glucose to glucose linkage other than 1-3 would have resulted in the destruction of both Glc residues. However, glucose was recovered after oxidation, indicating that the terminal and penultimate glucose residues are bound in a 1-3 linkage (Fig. 6).Figure 5:Products of partial acid or enzymatic digestion of I. a, a sample of I ( ∼25 pmol, 25,000 cpm) was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and hydrolyzed with 50 μl of 0.05 M trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100°C. The hydrolysate was subjected to paper chromatography. Segments (1-cm) of the paper were counted. Standards: 1, glucose ([14C]glucose internal standard); 2, glucitol; 3, laminaribiitol; 4, laminaritriitol or gentiobiitol; 5, laminaritetraitol; 6, gentiotriitol; 7, laminaripentaitol. b, aliquots of I (10 pmol, 10,000 cpm each) were evaporated to dryness and dissolved into 30 μl of 100 mM citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. Both aliquots were incubated 16 h at 37°C, one with 7.5 milliunits of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from D. pneumoniae and the other with the same enzyme plus 0.02 mg of β-glucosidase from sweet almonds. Both samples were subjected to paper chromatography as in a. •, incubated with N-acetylglucosaminidase; ○, incubated with both enzymes. Standards: 1, glucose; 2, laminaribiitol; 3, sophoritol; 4 cellobiitol; 5, laminaritriitol or gentiobiitol; 6, gentiotriitol.

A portion of I (60 nmol) was digested with jack bean β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and subjected to Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography essentially as described in the legend of Fig. 4. The recovered trisaccharide, in a total volume of 50 μl, was oxidized with 700 nmol of sodium metaperiodate for 70 h at 4°C in the dark. Ethylene glycol (1%, 23 μl) was added. After 2 h at room temperature, 40 μl of 0.1 M NaOH and 50 μl of sodium borohydride in 0.01 M NaOH were added, and incubation was continued for 3 h. The sample was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, dissolved in 100 μl of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, and heated at 100°C for 2 h. After evaporation to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 350 μl of water and a 50-μl portion was subjected to HPAEC on a PA-1 column with 0.2 M NaOH as solvent. Laminaribiitol and laminaritriitol (50 nmol of each) were subjected to the same treatment and chromatographed. a, oxidized laminaribiitol; b, oxidized laminaritriitol; c, trisaccharide from I, not treated with periodate but hydrolyzed with trifluoroacetic acid; d, oxidized trisaccharide from I. The large peak at 2.34-2.36 min in a, b, and d is ethylene glycol. Glucose (retention time 5.15-5.25 min in b and d and 4.93 min in c) was present in the samples resulting from oxidation of laminaritriitol (b) or of the trisaccharide from I (d), but not in the one from laminaribiitol (a). The non-oxidized control of the trisaccharide from I (c) shows both glucose and sorbitol (retention time 3.49 min). The small peaks emerging after ethylene glycol in a and b have not been identified and may be due to impurities in the commercial samples of laminaribiose and laminaritriose used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the basis of the tentative structure of I it was possible to interpret the proton NMR spectrum of this compound in a way that reinforces the conclusion that GlcNAc is linked to the remainder of the molecule by a β-linkage. In that spectrum, we expected to find signals for three protons in the region of the anomeric protons (4.00-6.00 ppm). Actually, only two doublets were found, with chemical shifts of 4.58 and 4.48 ppm (data not shown). From 1H NMR studies of reduced laminaritriose, it was concluded that the anomeric proton of the internal residues (H′-1 from ring C′, see Fig. 7, top) resonates at ≈4.65 ppm. From this it may be inferred that the 4.58 ppm doublet corresponds to the anomeric protons H′-1 and H″-1 of I. Because the doublet is partially overlapped by the HOD signal, the signal cannot be quantified by integration to confirm that is originated in two protons. The corresponding coupling constant J 1',2' = J 1"",2"" is 7.9 Hz, as expected for a β-linkage. Given this attribution of the 4.58 ppm signal, the doublet at 4.48 ppm must represent the anomeric proton (H‴-1) of the GlcNAc unit. This chemical shift is in good agreement with those published (17Khan S.H. Compton C.A. Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 262: 283-295Crossref PubMed Sc"

INTRODUCTIONSaccharomyces cerevisiae have (at least) two distinct transport systems that mediate the uptake of elemental iron, a high affinity and a low affinity system(1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both systems recognize Fe(II), generated by surface reductases(2Lesuise E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar), which are the products of the FRE1 and FRE2 genes(3Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 4Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The high affinity transport system is specific for iron(1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity Fe(II) transport is regulated inversely by cellular iron content(1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and iron transport is reduced upon copper depletion(5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile K. Askwith A. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).Analysis of mutants unable to grow in low iron media revealed a gene that was required for high affinity iron transport. Mutations in FET3 abrogate high affinity iron transport, and transcription of the gene is inversely regulated by cellular iron content(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The translated sequence indicates that the protein has only one potential membrane-spanning domain and is therefore probably not the transmembrane iron transporter. Further sequence analysis indicated that the gene had signature motifs and homology to the multi-copper oxidase family(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Members of this family are defined by their mechanism of action; 4 moles of substrate are oxidized with the concomitant reduction of 1 mole of molecular oxygen(7Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 3:37-3100Google Scholar, 8Messerchmidt A. Huber T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).Ceruloplasmin is a member of the multi-copper oxidase family(7Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 3:37-3100Google Scholar). Copper-deficient animals have extremely low levels of ceruloplasmin and are unable to transport iron from intestinal mucosal cells and macrophages into plasma(9Lee R.L. Nacht S. Lukens J.H. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47 (2069): 2958Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Injection of ceruloplasmin into copper-deficient animals resulted in the immediate appearance of plasma iron. These and other studies suggested that ceruloplasmin functioned as an Fe(II)-Fe(III) ferroxidase and that the ferroxidase activity was essential to remove iron from cell surface transport elements(9Lee R.L. Nacht S. Lukens J.H. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47 (2069): 2958Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3018-3023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the homology between Fet3 and ceruloplasmin, we suggested that Fet3 functioned as a ferroxidase. We present data here that indicate that Fet3 is a ferroxidase and that the ferroxidase activity is required for high affinity iron transport. We also demonstrate that Fet3 is a type 1 membrane protein in which the ferroxidase-containing domain is located on the extracellular surface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Culture ConditionsThe stains employed in this study were derived from W303, DY150, and DY1457 as previously described (6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and the BJ5460-derived strain DY1632 (MAT A, pep4::HIS3, prb1Δ1.6R, His3Δ200, Leu2Δ1, Lys2-801, Trp1, Ura3-52, Can1). The cells were grown in YPD (1.0% yeast extract, 0.2% peptone, 2.0% glucose) or CM (2.0% glucose, 0.69% yeast nitrogen base, and 0.13% amino acid supplement). Either media was supplemented with 80 or 20 μM bathophenanthroline sulfonate, respectively, to make the media iron deficient(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Protease deficient cells were converted to spheroplasts by a 10-min incubation in 1.0 M Tris, pH 9.3, 10 mM dithiothreitol followed by the addition of oxalyticase (10 μg/ml, Enzogenetics, Corvallis, OR) in 1.2 M sorbitol, 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 30°C for 20 min. Spheroplasts were washed three times in 1.2 M sorbitol prior to use.Crude membrane fractions were obtained from spheroplasts disrupted at 4°C by Dounce homogenization in 0.6 M mannitol, 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min to remove debris. Membrane fractions were obtained by centrifuging the supernatant at 72,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0% Nonidet P-40.Wild type cells were made rho - by treatment with ethidium bromide according to standard procedures(11Fox T.D. Folley L.S. Mulero J.J. McMullin T.W. Thorsness P.E. Hedin L.O. Costanzo M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 194: 149-165Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.Oxygen MeasurementsMeasurements of O2 consumption were carried out in a 3.0-ml final volume at room temperature using a Clark-type electrode connected to a YSL oxygen monitor. Reaction mixtures contained 5 × 108 cells in LIM assay buffer containing 1.0 mM ascorbate but without phosphate or EDTA(12Eide D. Guarante L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 34-54Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When spheroplasts were assayed, the buffer contained 1.2 M sorbitol to maintain osmolarity. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μM FeCl3 through the capillary bore of the vessel, and the O2 consumed was continuously monitored. To measure iron oxidation rate, 20 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate was added to media in the presence and absence of cells. The disappearance of Fe(II) was monitored by removing samples at 1-min intervals and quenching the reaction by the addition of 1.0 mM ferrozine. The cells were centrifuged, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 564 nm ( ∊ 564 = 27.9 mM -1 cm -1) was determined. The rate of Fe(II) oxidation in the absence of cells was subtracted to give the final value.Antibodies and PeptidesPeptides were synthesized based on the deduced amino acid sequence of Fet3 using methods previously described(13Smith J.W. Dey N. Knauer D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8950-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cysteine was added to the carboxyl terminus of each peptide (see Fig. 1 for amino acid sequence). Rabbit antibodies were raised against the peptides using the published methods (13Smith J.W. Dey N. Knauer D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8950-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity purified using peptides coupled to the Sulflo Link system after purification of IgG using immobilized protein G (Pierce). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Cappel Laboratories (West Chester, PA). Dot blots were developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzedine(14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar); protein determinations were performed using the BCA reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.RESULTSOur initial analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of Fet3 suggested that it might be a type 2 membrane protein(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We subsequently determined that a sequencing error resulted in a predicted sequence with a truncation of the amino terminus of the protein. Reevaluation of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the reading frame extended 72 amino acids upstream and contained a putative signal sequence (15Von Heinje G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The presence of this signal sequence suggests that the protein is a type 1 membrane protein with the potential ferroxidase domain located on the exterior cell surface.The hypothesis that Fet3 is a ferroxidase led to the prediction that cells expressing Fet3 would demonstrate an iron dependence in oxygen consumption, with a stoichiometry of iron oxidation to O2 consumption characteristic of the multi-copper oxidases. To test this hypothesis, wild type cells were grown on low iron media to induce the high affinity iron transport system. These cells had an increased rate of O2 consumption upon addition of ascorbate-reduced iron (Fig. 2). The increase in O2 consumption was not observed when iron was added to cell-free media, either fresh media or media conditioned by cell growth. Control experiments indicated that the iron-dependent O2 consumption required the expression and activity of Fet3. Iron-dependent O2 consumption was not observed in either the fet3 disruption mutant (ΔFET3) or the original fet3 mutant. Transfection of these mutants with FET3 plasmids restored both the iron-dependent O2 consumption and high affinity iron transport (data not shown). The rate of iron-dependent O2 consumption was reduced in cells grown in high iron media in which FET3 mRNA concentration was dramatically lowered(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In high iron media, however, there is some residual high affinity iron transport and ferroxidase activity. Incubation of cells in glucose-free or copper-free media resulted in a reduction in iron-induced O2 consumption by 85 and 33%, respectively. This reduction in ferroxidase activity closely parallels the reduction in high affinity iron transport activity(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J.

Figure 2:Iron-dependent O 2 consumption in yeast correlates with Fet3 activity. A, cells were grown to exponential phase in either YPD bathophenanthroline sulfonate (low iron medium) or YPD (high iron medium). The cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 1/10 volume assay buffer. Reaction mixtures contained 5 × 108 cells and 1 mM ascorbate in LIM assay buffer containing 2% glucose and 0.25 μM copper (unless otherwise indicated). For this figure and all subsequent figures, O2 consumption was measured using an oxygen electrode. Reactions were carried out at 25°C. Basal rates of O2 consumption were measured, and iron-dependent O2 consumption was determined by the addition of 100 μM FeCl3. The slope of the line indicates loss of O2 from the medium. Thus, the more negative the slope the higher the rate of O2 consumption by the cells. B, sodium cyanide was added to wild type induced cells to give a final concentration of 300 μM. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The addition of cyanide blocked respiratory O2 consumption with no effect on iron-induced O2 consumption, indicating that the iron-induced increase in O2 consumption cannot be mediated by an iron-regulated mitochondrial signal (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, mitochondrial respiration-deficient rho cells had little basal O2 consumption but still showed an iron-induced increase in O2 consumption.Simultaneous with measurements of O2 consumption, we measured rates of Fe(II) oxidation. The relationship of O2 consumption to the rate of iron oxidation is shown in Table 1. In every instance in which iron uptake activity was expressed, the ratio of Fe(II) oxidation:O2 consumption approached 4:1. Under conditions in which high affinity iron transport activity was decreased by removal of glucose or removal of copper, the stoichiometry of iron oxidation to O2 consumption was reduced to approximately 2:1. This low background rate of O2 consumption was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (data not shown), suggesting the formation of reduced oxygen species in the absence of Fet3 activity.Tabled 1To determine if the ferroxidase domain of Fet3 is on the extracellular or intracellular surface of the membrane, experiments were preformed with spheroplasts. Removal of the yeast cell wall did not affect the iron-induced increase in O2 consumption (Fig. 3), but treatment of spheroplasts with trypsin resulted in a decrease in iron-induced O2 consumption. The effect of trypsin was abolished if trypsin was pre-incubated with soybean trypsin inhibitor prior to addition to spheroplasts. These results suggest an extracellular location of the ferroxidase domain.Figure 3:Trypsin abolishes iron-dependent O 2 consumption in spheroplasts. The protease-deficient strain DY1632 was grown in CM bathophenanthroline sulfonate to exponential phase and harvested, and spheroplasts were generated using oxalyticase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Spheroplasts (5 × 108 cells) were preincubated with trypsin for 15 min at 25°C, and residual trypsin was removed by washing spheroplasts in 1.2 M sorbitol prior to assaying. Concentrations of trypsin used in μg/ml are listed below each trace. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/ml) was incubated with trypsin for 15 min at 25°C before addition to spheroplasts. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further evidence that the ferroxidase domain is extracellular resulted from examination of the effect of anti-peptide antibodies on spheroplast ferroxidase activity. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to three different regions of Fet3. The regions were chosen based on the prediction of α-helical structure, in the expectation that they were on the exterior surface of the protein. Two of the peptides (P16A and P16B) are part of the putative ferroxidase domain, and the third (P16C) is on the cytosolic domain (see Fig. 1). Rabbit antibodies raised against the peptides were affinity purified using the specific peptide immobilized on columns. These antibodies did not detect the Fet3 protein if it was treated with SDS but did detect it after extraction of the native protein by non-ionic detergents. On a qualitative level using dot blots, each of the antisera has comparable reactivity (Fig. 4A). Treatment of spheroplasts with trypsin prior to detergent extraction and dot blot analysis resulted in the disappearance of reactivity to antibodies P16A and P16B but not P16C (Fig. 4B). Incubation of spheroplasts with anti-peptide antibodies A, B, or C had no effect on basal O2 consumption (Fig. 5). Antibodies to peptides A and B but not C resulted in a decrease in iron-induced O2 consumption by 20 and 64%, respectively. This decrease was prevented if the spheroplasts were simultaneously incubated with the antibody and the antigenic peptide. Addition of antibody P16C had no effect on iron-induced O2 consumption.Figure 4:Immunodetection of Fet3 in membrane fractions. 5 μg of a crude membrane fraction obtained from wild type cells grown in low iron medium were applied to nitrocellulose membranes. The individual dots were incubated with each of the indicated antibody. Preimmune serum was used at 1:100 dilution and affinity purified antibody at 1:1,000. For detection, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and developed using diaminobenzedine as a substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:Antibodies to the predicted extracellular region of Fet3 block iron-dependent O2 consumption in spheroplasts.

Reaction conditions were exactly as described in Fig. 3 except that 20 μg/ml antibody was added to spheroplasts where indicated, the mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 15 min, and the spheroplasts were assayed for O2 consumption. The effect of antibody P16B was competed by the addition of 15 μg/ml P16B. For comparison, the rate of iron-dependent O2 consumption is listed below each trace.

We suggested that the gene product was a type 2 membrane protein and was not likely to represent a transmembrane tranporter. A revised sequence analysis and the data presented here indicate that Fet3 is a type 1 membrane protein in which the putative ferroxidase-containing domain is extracellular. This conclusion is consistent with the findings in other members of the multi-copper oxidase family. All members of the family that have been localized are extracellular proteins, and the cDNA of not yet localized members contain leader sequences(16Kojima Y. Tsukuda Y. Kawai Y. Tsukamoto A. Suguira J. Sakaino M. Kita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15224-15230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bao W. O'Malley D.M. Whetten R. Sederoff R.R. Science. 1993; 260: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).The multi-copper oxidases have two substrates, oxygen and a reducing substrate(7Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 3:37-3100Google Scholar, 8Messerchmidt A. Huber T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and are the only enzymes known to reduce both atoms of molecular oxygen to water. This is accomplished by sequential oxidation of four molecules of the reduced substrates and simultaneous transfer of all four electrons to molecular oxygen. We reasoned that a study of iron-dependent oxygen consumption in induced yeast cells would yield information about the enzymatic activity of Fet3. Comparison of the rate of Fe(II) oxidation to O2 consumption in induced cells gave a stoichiometry of approximately 4:1, consistent with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Conditions that reduced the level of high affinity iron transport (mutation (ΔFET3, fet3), regulation (reduction of mRNA by iron regulation or removal of glucose) or depletion of copper) resulted in a decrease in iron-dependent O2 consumption. The efficiency of Fet3 catalyzed Fe(II) oxidation, and the induction of this activity under conditions that induce the high affinity iron transport system lead us to conclude that the ferroxidase activity of Fet3 is directly associated with the high affinity uptake system.The accessibility of proteases and antibodies to domains of Fet3 in the periplasmic space was used to determine the orientation of the protein in the plasma membrane. These agents that did not affect basal O2 consumption strongly reduced iron-dependent O2 consumption. The inability of the P16C antibody to inhibit the ferroxidase activity of spheroplasts indicates that this portion of Fet3 resides on the inaccessible cytoplasmic side of the membrane.Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fet3 is a cell surface ferroxidase required for high affinity iron transport. Previously, we speculated that Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) by the surface ferrireductases and passes through the transmembrane transporter as Fe(II). On the cytoplasmic surface, Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) by the ferroxidase activity of Fet3(5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile K. Askwith A. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Our current data, however, suggest that the Fet3 ferroxidase domain of the molecule is exposed on the cell surface. If Fet3 converts Fe(II) to Fe(III), this must occur either close to or in the transmembrane channel. Our working hypothesis is that Fet3 is part of the transmembrane transporter and that the transporter is a heteromultimer. INTRODUCTIONSaccharomyces cerevisiae have (at least) two distinct transport systems that mediate the uptake of elemental iron, a high affinity and a low affinity system(1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both systems recognize Fe(II), generated by surface reductases(2Lesuise E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar), which are the products of the FRE1 and FRE2 genes(3Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 4Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The high affinity transport system is specific for iron(1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity Fe(II) transport is regulated inversely by cellular iron content(1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and iron transport is reduced upon copper depletion(5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile K. Askwith A. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).Analysis of mutants unable to grow in low iron media revealed a gene that was required for high affinity iron transport. Mutations in FET3 abrogate high affinity iron transport, and transcription of the gene is inversely regulated by cellular iron content(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The translated sequence indicates that the protein has only one potential membrane-spanning domain and is therefore probably not the transmembrane iron transporter. Further sequence analysis indicated that the gene had signature motifs and homology to the multi-copper oxidase family(6Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Members of this family are defined by their mechanism of action; 4 moles of substrate are oxidized with the concomitant reduction of 1 mole of molecular oxygen(7Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 3:37-3100Google Scholar, 8Messerchmidt A. Huber T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).Ceruloplasmin is a member of the multi-copper oxidase family(7Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 3:37-3100Google Scholar). Copper-deficient animals have extremely low levels of ceruloplasmin and are unable to transport iron from intestinal mucosal cells and macrophages into plasma(9Lee R.L. Nacht S. Lukens J.H. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47 (2069): 2958Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Injection of ceruloplasmin into copper-deficient animals resulted in the immediate appearance of plasma iron. These and other studies suggested that ceruloplasmin functioned as an Fe(II)-Fe(III) ferroxidase and that the ferroxidase activity was essential to remove iron from cell surface transport elements(9Lee R.L. Nacht S. Lukens J.H. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47 (2069): 2958Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3018-3023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the homology between Fet3 and ceruloplasmin, we suggested that Fet3 functioned as a ferroxidase. We present data here that indicate that Fet3 is a ferroxidase and that the ferroxidase activity is required for high affinity iron transport. We also demonstrate that Fet3 is a type 1 membrane protein in which the ferroxidase-containing domain is located on the extracellular surface."

In the present study, the effectiveness of intracellular Ca 2+ release evoked by three independent methods (thapsigargin, ionomycin, and UTP) was compared with the capacitative Ca 2+ entry that was triggered by these treatments. In each situation, only Ca 2+ entry could inhibit cAMP accumulation (La 3+ ions blocked the effect); Ca 2+ release, which was substantial in some cases, was without effect. A moderate inhibition, as was elicited by a modest degree of Ca 2+ entry, could be rendered substantial in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Such conditions more closely mimic the physiological situation of normal cells. These results are particularly significant, in demonstrating not only that Ca 2+ entry mediates the inhibitory effects of Ca 2+ on cAMP accumulation, but also that diffuse elevations in [Ca 2+] i are ineffective in modulating cAMP synthesis.

The C6-2B glioma cell line is a useful model system for evaluating the efficacy of Ca 2+ entry and internal release on the inhibition of cAMP synthesis. In these nonexcitable cells, agonist stimulation of [Ca 2+] i elevation involves an initial release of Ca 2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive stores, accompanied by Ca 2+ entry(7DeBernardi M.A. Seki T.

The focus of the present study was to determine whether there was a selective role for either Ca 2+ entry or release in the inhibition of cAMP accumulation in the C6-2B cell line. Three independent tools were utilized to manipulate [Ca 2+] i: the purinergic agonist UTP(25Burnstock G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the Ca 2+ ionophore ionomycin (IM)(26Liu C.-M. Hermann T.E. J. Biol.

These three agents provoke [Ca 2+] i rises and capacitative Ca 2+ entry by different mechanisms(31Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 32Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments with these agents clearly demonstrated that Ca 2+ entry, rather than a simple rise in [Ca 2+] i, exclusively inhibits cAMP accumulation in C6-2B cells. The results suggest that, as with certain Ca 2+-sensitive ion channels(33Robitaille R. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Charlton M.P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 645-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), Ca 2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase is functionally co-localized with sites of Ca 2+ entry. Thapsigargin and ionomycin were from L C Services Corp. and Calbiochem, respectively. [2-3H]Adenine (23-31 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Fura-2/AM and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. HEPES was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Other reagents were from Sigma Early phase C6-2B cells, kindly provided by Dr. G.

Cells were used 4-7 days after passage. [Ca 2+]i was measured by the Fura-2 technique using an H& series 300 spectrofluorimeter, as described previously(34Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline (12.1 mM Na2HPO4, 4 mM KH2PO4, and 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.01% EDTA and loaded with 2 μM fura-2/AM and 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and kept at room temperature until use. [Ca 2+]i measurements were made in either Krebs buffer or a nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer. The Krebs buffer consisted of 120 mM NaCl, 4.75 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1.44 mM MgSO4, 1.1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 11 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 M Tris base. The nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer contained 120 mM NaCl, 4.75 mM KCl, 1.44 mM MgSO4, 11 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 M Tris base. Approximately 4 × 106 cells were diluted with one of the above buffers, centrifuged, resuspended in the same buffer (3 ml), and transferred to a stirred cuvette at 29.5°C. After a 1-min equilibration time, test substances were added from 100-fold concentrated stocks. Fluorescence ratios were converted to [Ca 2+]i values as described previously (34Garritsen A.

Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (34Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with some modifications. C6-2B cells were incubated in Ham's F-10 medium (60 min, 37°C) with ∼1 μCi of [3H]adenine/1.5 × 106 cells to label the ATP pool. The cells were then detached, counted, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 6 min (IEC HN-SII centrifuge) and resuspended in either the Krebs buffer or the nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer, described above. Aliquots (900 μl) of the cell suspension were incubated at 37°C for 10 min with PDE inhibitors, 500 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 100 μM Ro 20-1724. Test agents (100 μl) were added for time periods indicated in the figure legends. The test substance addition also included isoproterenol or forskolin, as indicated, for stimulation of cAMP accumulation. The assay was terminated by addition of 5% (w/v, final) trichloroacetic acid. Unlabeled cAMP (1 mM final) was added to each sample. The samples were centrifuged, and the [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP content of the supernatant was quantified according to the method of Salomon et al.(37Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the percent conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. Compounds that elevate [Ca 2+]i independent of receptor activation and second messenger pathways are essential tools, when attempting to distinguish the role of Ca 2+ entry versus intracellular release on cAMP accumulation. The desire to elevate [Ca 2+]i independently of receptor occupation is particularly germane, given the selective susceptibility of certain adenylyl cyclase species to modulation by protein kinase C and β γ subunits of G-proteins(38Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 39Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), whose activation are likely outcomes of receptor occupancy. TG, by inhibiting microsomal Ca 2+-ATPases(29Thastrup O. Cullen P.J.

Dr⊘bak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), causes a net elevation in [Ca 2+]i independent of receptor activation and IP3-induced release. Resting [Ca 2+]i in C6-2B cell populations was approximately 90 nM. TG evoked a large and sustained elevation in [Ca 2+]i in Ca 2+-containing Krebs buffer (Fig. 1A). The addition of EGTA rapidly reduced the [Ca 2+]i rise to below basal levels, suggesting that the sustained [Ca 2+]i rise was largely due to Ca 2+ entry. Adding Ca 2+ to the cells after EGTA caused a dramatic, concentration-dependent Ca 2+ entry (Fig. 1A). These data are consistent with the premise that the status of intracellular Ca 2+ stores dictates the degree of capacitative Ca 2+ entry, as initially proposed by Putney (31Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 32Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The consequences of the foregoing TG-induced [Ca 2+]i rises on cAMP accumulation are explored in the experiments represented in Fig. 1B. In Ca 2+-containing Krebs buffer, TG pretreatment decreased cAMP production by 20% (Fig. 1B).)2 The inhibitory effect of TG was eliminated by EGTA in excess of extracellular Ca 2+ (Fig. 1B). Reintroduction of CaCl2, following a 10-min incubation with TG and EGTA, inhibited cAMP production by 36%. These results implicate a significant role for Ca 2+ entry in the inhibition that is evoked by TG; however, they do not evaluate the potential of the intracellular release that is evoked by TG to cause inhibition. That issue is more effectively addressed in a Ca 2+-free buffer, as outlined in the following series of experiments. The effect of TG on [Ca 2+]i in a nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer is shown in Fig. 2A. TG evokes a transient [Ca 2+]i elevation that slowly declines to basal values, which reflects the emptying and extrusion of intracellular Ca 2+ stores. Prominent Ca 2+ entry can be demonstrated upon introduction of CaCl2 to the extracellular medium (3 mM, trace a; 1 mM, traceb). This Ca 2+ entry is blocked by LaCl3 (tracesc and d, Fig. 2A). In parallel experiments, the consequences of these [Ca 2+]i rises on cAMP accumulation are explored (Fig. 2B). In calcium-free Krebs buffer, acute incubation with TG causes no effect on cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2B, compare with Fig. 1B). However, upon the introduction of 3 mM CaCl2 to the extracellular medium, a prominent inhibition of cAMP production is achieved. This inhibition is blocked by extracellular (200 μM) LaCl3, which suggests that Ca 2+ entry exclusively mediates the inhibition of cAMP synthesis that is achieved by TG. The acute consequences on cAMP synthesis of the various changes in [Ca 2+]i evoked by TG are explored in a time-course experiment, where all of the elements are added simultaneously to cells in a nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer (Fig. 3). The time courses were designed to measure the effects of these compounds prior to the initial [Ca 2+]i rise, during the Ca 2+ spike and during the sustained second phase of the [Ca 2+]i rise. TG, without extracellular Ca 2+, did not affect cAMP accumulation at any time point examined (Fig. 3), even at early times e.g. 1 min, where (from Fig. 2A) a considerable elevation in [Ca 2+]i is achieved. However, a slow onset inhibition is apparent when CaCl2 is added along with TG (Fig. 3). Presumably this reflects the TG-promoted emptying of pools and the entry that is associated with this process. These data strongly suggest that only the Ca 2+ entry promoted by TG, and none of the Ca 2+ release, can inhibit cAMP synthesis. The Ca 2+ ionophore IM(26Liu C.-M. Hermann T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5892-5894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C887-C891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morgan A.J. Jacob R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) also elevates [Ca 2+]i independent of receptor activation and IP3-induced release. At modest concentrations, it is somewhat selective for intracellular membranes (27Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C887-C891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morgan A.J. Jacob R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas at higher doses, it also renders the plasma membrane permeable to Ca 2+(26Liu C.-M. Hermann T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5892-5894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Ca 2+-containing Krebs buffer, IM (400 nM) caused a dramatic Ca 2+ rise, followed by a substantial and sustained second phase (Fig. 4A). This initial spike and second phase corresponded to the release of intracellular Ca 2+ and a Ca 2+ entry phase, respectively. The addition of EGTA eliminated the Ca 2+ entry and decreased [Ca 2+]i to basal levels. A subsequent reintroduction of CaCl2 in excess of the EGTA yielded concentration-dependent Ca 2+ entry (Fig. 4, a-c). The consequences of these IM-induced [Ca 2+]i rises on cAMP synthesis are explored in the following experiments. In Ca 2+-containing Krebs buffer, a 3-min incubation with IM alone led to a modest but significant ( ∼12%) inhibition of cAMP production (Fig. 4B). No such inhibition was observed when EGTA was included with the IM (Fig. 4B). A subsequent addition of excess CaCl2 (1 mM) in the presence of IM and EGTA caused a 25% inhibition of cAMP accumulation. These data again suggest an important role for Ca 2+ entry in cAMP inhibition, but do not exclude possible contributions from intracellular release. In nominally calcium-free Krebs buffer, IM produced only half the [Ca 2+]i rise compared to that observed in normal Krebs buffer (cf. Fig. 5A and 4A). The elevation in [Ca 2+]i returned rather rapidly to base-line values. These responses reflect the preclusion of Ca 2+ entry in nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer. The introduction of extracellular CaCl2 yielded concentration-dependent Ca 2+ entry (Fig. 5A, tracesa and b), which was effectively blocked by LaCl3 (Fig. 5A, tracesc and d). Acute incubation with IM in Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer did not affect cAMP production (Fig. 5B). However, the addition of CaCl2 following incubation with IM resulted in a 27% decrease in cAMP accumulation. This decrease was blocked by LaCl3. These results confirm that Ca 2+ entry mediates all of the IM-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation. In a time-course study, analogous to that performed with TG, IM elicited no inhibition of cAMP synthesis at any time, in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca 2+ (Fig. 6), despite the rather substantial [Ca 2+]i rise that is evoked, particularly in the first minute of its action (cf. Fig. 5A). However, the presence of extracellular Ca 2+ permits substantial and significant inhibition of cAMP accumulation from 30 s onward (Fig. 6). These results are important in demonstrating, not only that Ca 2+ entry mediates the inhibitory effects of IM on cAMP accumulation, but also that the diffuse elevation in [Ca 2+]i caused by IM is ineffective in modulating cAMP synthesis. Earlier it was pointed out that there are additional mechanisms, other than direct effects of Ca 2+ on adenylyl cyclase, whereby agents that act via G-proteins to elevate [Ca 2+]i might also modulate cAMP synthesis. Being mindful of possible ambiguities arising from such effects, the purinergic P 2u agonist, UTP, was investigated to determine whether it would yield results that would support the interpretation derived from studies with TG and IM. UTP acts through the phosphoinositide pathway to release Ca 2+ from intracellular stores via IP3 receptors(25Burnstock G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 40Munshi R. DeBernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of UTP on [Ca 2+]i is shown in Fig. 7A. In calcium-containing Krebs buffer, UTP elicits a rapid [Ca 2+]i rise followed by a sustained second phase. The second phase is associated with Ca 2+ entry, since it can be eliminated with EGTA and reduced to below basal values. Addition of excess CaCl2 (Fig. 7A, tracesa, b, and c) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca 2+]i, which reflects capacitative Ca 2+ entry. The effects of UTP on cAMP accumulation under analogous conditions to those used to manipulate [Ca 2+]i are presented in Fig. 7B. UTP, which causes release of intracellular Ca 2+, along with Ca 2+ entry (see Fig. 7A) resulted in a significant ( ∼16%) inhibition of cAMP synthesis. This inhibition was abolished in the presence of EGTA. Readdition of excess CaCl2 with UTP in the presence of EGTA restored the inhibition of cAMP production. Since EGTA eliminates the Ca 2+ influx contribution to the [Ca 2+]i rise elicited by UTP (Fig. 7A), these observations support a role of Ca 2+ entry in inhibition of cAMP accumulation caused by UTP. In nominally Ca 2+-free medium, stimulation with UTP resulted in an initial spike due to Ca 2+ released from intracellular stores, without a Ca 2+ entry phase (Fig. 8A). The initial spike due to UTP was smaller than in Fig. 7A. Capacitative Ca 2+ entry is evident upon the subsequent introduction of CaCl2 (Fig. 2A, tracesa and b). This entry could be eliminated by LaCl3 (tracesc and d). The effects of UTP and UTP-induced Ca 2+ entry on cAMP accumulation in a nominally Ca 2+-free Krebs buffer are explored in Fig. 8B. UTP in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ did not affect cAMP production. However, the addition of extracellular Ca 2+ (3 mM CaCl2) subsequent to a UTP treatment decreased cAMP accumulation by 25%; this inhibition was fully blocked by LaCl3. The essential contribution of extracellular Ca 2+ to the inhibition of cAMP production elicited by UTP, clearly demonstrates the required role of Ca 2+ entry in regulating adenylyl cyclase in C6-2B cells. 3The present effects of UTP are distinct from those of ATP, which has been reported to directly inhibit adenylyl cyclase in C6-2B cells, via a PTX-sensitive Gi protein, without the involvement of Ca 2+-influx(41Lin W.-W. Chuang D.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 158-165PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pianet I. Merle M. Labouesse J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1150-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas ATP can bind to all purinoceptors, regardless of the signal pathways that they utilize, UTP acts selectively through the P 2u purinoceptor, which is coupled to phospholipase C via a PTX-insensitive Gq protein in C6-2B cells(25Burnstock G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 40Munshi R. DeBernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar). The following experiments address the impact of a Ca 2+ inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in a normal physiological setting, i.e. in the absence of a persistent pharmacological inhibition of PDE. In experiments on Ca 2+-inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in whole cells, (as in the preceding series) PDE is normally inhibited by methylxanthines and Ro 20-1784, for two reasons: (i) to increase the magnitude (and therefore, detectability) of the cAMP signal and (ii) to remove any confusion in interpretation caused by possible effects of Ca 2+ not only directly on adenylyl cyclase, but also directly on Ca 2+/calmodulin-stimulated PDE(1Meeker R.B. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 310-319PubMed Google Scholar, 3Erneux C. Sande J.V. Miot F. Cochaux P. Decoster C. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell.

In a normal cell, however, steady state cAMP levels are the balance between synthetic rates (V1) and degradation rates (V2), as described by. ATP⇀V1cAMP⇀V2AMP REACTION 1 the concentration of cAMP relates to these synthetic and degradation rates and the Km of PDE, as follows: [cAMP]-V1×Km(V2-VL)(Eq. 1) where Km is the affinity of the PDE for cAMP; ATP → cAMP can be considered to be a first order reaction, since the substrate, ATP, is in great excess(43Newsholme E.A.

INTRODUCTIONWith the exception of nitrogenase, the molybdenum atom in all molybdoenzymes from animals, plants, and microorganisms is part of an organometallic structure termed the molybdenum cofactor. The extreme lability of the free cofactor following release from the molybdoenzymes has precluded both its complete purification and its direct chemical characterization. However, from structural analysis of three inactive derivatives of the cofactor (form A, form B, and dicarboxamidomethylmolybdopterin), the dithiolene-containing pterin structure shown in Fig. 1, termed molybdopterin, has been proposed to be the organic moiety of the cofactor from sulfite oxidase(1Johnson J.L.

It is now known that molybdopterin is also the essential component of a family of dinucleotide variants of the cofactor which contain a nucleoside monophosphate linked to the terminal phosphate of the pterin (4Rajagopalan K.V.

In addition, the isomeric state of the dihydro pterin ring of the active cofactor may vary from enzyme to enzyme(5Gardlik S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Since these mutations result in loss of the activities of all molybdoenzymes in an organism, the proteins encoded at the mo loci are presumably involved in the synthesis of functional cofactor.

In the terminal step of molybdopterin synthesis, the desulfo molybdopterin intermediate precursor Z (9Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13440-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is converted to molybdopterin through the action of molybdopterin synthase (previously termed “converting factor”)(11Pitterle D.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, this conversion involves the opening of the cyclic phosphate ring of precursor Z, as well as the addition of two side chain sulfhydryl groups. No other small molecules are required for the reaction, and it appears that the sulfurs are covalently attached to molybdopterin synthase itself prior to their transfer to precursor Z(11Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of GMP to form the molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide form of the pterin present in E. coli is then mediated by the mob gene product(s)(13Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The dihydropterin, precursor Z, is labile and is readily converted to the stable pterin, compound Z, by air or iodine oxidation. As shown in Fig. 1, compound Z differs from precursor Z only in the reduction state of its pterin ring(10Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precursor Z accumulates in the E. coli mutants moeB and moaE(9Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Invest. 1989; 83: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Precursor Z may be assayed either by the appearance of fluorescent compound Z following oxidation of a sample (9Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13440-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by the production of active molybdopterin upon incubation with a source of molybdopterin synthase(11Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

However, the presence of molybdopterin as the essential component of all molybdenum cofactors raised the possibility that the early steps in the biosynthetic pathway of the molybdenum cofactor could be similar or identical to those of other pteridine biosynthetic pathways. Currently, three major routes for the synthesis of pteridines have been identified, leading to the formation of folates and riboflavin in plants and microorganisms and the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) 1The abbreviations used are: H4BtetrahydrobiopterinH2NTP7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphateARAPP2,5-diamino-6-ribitylaminopyrimidine 5′-phosphatept-6-COOHpterin-6-carboxylic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. and other nonconjugated pterins in animals. In all three pathways, GTP serves as the initial precursor for the pterin or pteridine rings of these molecules as shown through extensive studies involving the incorporation of radioactively labeled compounds into pterins and flavins as well as their biosynthetic intermediates by both whole cells and cell-free extracts. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that in the three pathways, all of the carbons and nitrogens of guanine with the exception of the C-8 carbon are retained during the synthesis of the bicyclic ring structures of pteridines(16Levy C.C.

Folates and Pterins. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 115-154Google Scholar). These findings were clarified by the purification and characterization of the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I, which converts GTP to the reduced pterin, H2NTP(23Burg A.W. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2349-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yim J.J. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5087-5094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this reaction, as shown in Fig. 2, the C-8 guanine carbon is eliminated as formate, and the carbons of the ribose ring are utilized to generate the six-membered pyrazine ring of the pterin ring system(22Brown G.M. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 115-154Google Scholar). Carbons 1′ and 2′ of the ribose are incorporated into the pterin ring, while the 3′, 4′, and 5′ carbons become the 1′, 2′, and 3′ carbons, respectively, of the six-alkyl side chain of H2NTP, which then serves as the common biosynthetic intermediate for both the folates and H4B.Figure 2:Initial steps in the known pathways of pteridine biosynthesis. Top, conversion of GTP to H2NTP as catalyzed by the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. During this concerted reaction, all intermediates are protein-bound. Bottom, conversion of GTP to ARAPP by the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In plants and microorganisms, a pteridine is also formed as an intermediate during the synthesis of the isoalloxazine ring system of riboflavin. The purification and characterization of a second, distinct E. coli cyclohydrolase (GTP cyclohydrolase II) which converts GTP to a phosphorylated ribitylaminopyrimidine revealed the nature of the initial reaction in this pathway(25Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the initial step is the loss of the C-8 carbon of a molecule of GTP as formate. However, the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II results in the production of ARAPP as shown at the bottom of Fig. 2(25Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although all of the original guanosine carbons and nitrogens with the exception of C-8 are again incorporated into the final structure, the ribose carbons of GTP are not incorporated into the pteridine ring system, but are retained in toto as the ribityl group of riboflavin.In light of these studies, it was reasonable to investigate whether a guanine derivative also serves as the in vivo precursor of molybdopterin, with compounds such as H2NTP or ARAPP serving as common intermediates in the molybdopterin and folate or riboflavin pathways. Previous attempts at verification of these possibilities by directly labeling molybdopterin or its stable derivatives in a variety of systems had proven unsuccessful. These experiments were hampered by the extreme lability of molybdopterin as well as its relatively low abundance in wild type cells compared to the folates and flavins. However, the discovery and structural characterization of precursor Z and its oxidation product, compound Z, greatly increased the feasibility of in vivo labeling experiments in whole cells. In particular, precursor Z accumulates in the E. coli mutants moeB and moaE in amounts much higher than the molybdopterin content of wild type cells, and compound Z is stable and easily purified. In addition, since both compound Z and precursor Z contain all 10 of the carbon atoms present in molybdopterin, any information derived from in vivo labeling of carbons in compound Z would be immediately relevant to the elucidation of the early steps in molybdopterin biosynthesis.The experiments delineated in this report detail the results obtained from the analysis of compound Z purified from moeB cells cultured on minimal media supplemented with variously radiolabeled forms of guanosine. A method of release and purification of compound Z from these cells as well as from the culture medium is described, and a procedure for the analysis of the presence of label in both the side chain and pterin ring carbons, accomplished by degradation of the compound Z to pt-6-COOH and free pterin, is also delineated. The results obtained from these experiments indicate that while a guanosine derivative is indeed the initial in vivo precursor of molybdopterin biosynthesis in E. coli, the pathway by which the guanosine derivative is converted to molybdopterin is unlike all previously known pterin biosynthetic pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and ReagentsAmmonium chloride, sodium chloride, KH2PO4, Na2HPO4, and glucose were from Mallinckrodt.

All radiolabeled compounds had a radioactive purity ≥98%.Dephosporylation of [8,5′-3H]GDPAfter evaporation to dryness in air, the GDP was resuspended in 250 μl of H2O followed by the addition of 25 μl of 0.5 M MgCl2 and 20 μl of alkaline phosphatase (2 mg/ml of H2O). After overnight incubation, the alkaline phosphatase was inactivated by heating the solution in a boiling H2O bath for 45 s.Growth of moeB CellsLabeling of E. coli moeB cells was performed in 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks shaken vigorously at 37°C. Cells were inoculated into 1 liter of M-9 medium (0.5 g of NaCl, 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.0 g of KH2PO4, and 6.0 g of Na2HPO4/liter) supplemented with 15 ml of 20% glucose, 5 ml of 0.1 M CaCl2, 1 ml of 1.0 M MgSO4, 1 ml of 2 mg/ml thiamine, and 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of Vogel Medium N stock trace element solution(26Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17a: 79-143Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). For growth on ribose as well as glucose, 5 ml of a 20% solution of this sugar was also added. Radioactive guanosine (54 μCi of U-14C, 25 μCi of 8-14C, 60 μCi of 8-3H, or 75 μCi of 8,5′-3H) was added immediately after inoculation, and the cells were cultured for approximately 34 h.Purification of Compound ZThe combined medium and cells from a 1-liter culture were acidified to pH 1.8 with concentrated HCl, followed by oxidation with 6 ml of 1% I2, 2% KI in H2O to convert all precursor Z to compound Z. After 20 min, the pH was adjusted to 8-9 by the addition of solid NaOH, and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a Sorvall RC-3B centrifuge for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a 2.5 × 10.0-cm column of QAE-Sephadex (acetate form) in three batches. After washing with 150 ml of H2O and 350 ml of 0.01 N acetic acid, compound Z was eluted from each column with 0.01 N HCl. The fractions comprising the third, and last, blue fluorescent band from each column were pooled and applied to individual 2.5 × 10.0-cm columns of Florisil resin. After washing the column with 50 ml of 0.01 N HCl and eluting with 22.5% acetone in H2O, the fluorescent fractions from the three batches were combined and rotoevaporated to dryness before final purification by reverse phase HPLC. The remaining fluorescent fractions from QAE-Sephadex chromatography could be used for the isolation of pterin and pt-6-COOH as described later.HPLC purification employed successive chromatography on an Alltech 10-μm C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated in 2% methanol, pH 2, 0.5% methanol, pH 2, 0.01 N HCl, and 1 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5. After concentration to dryness and resuspension in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5, the absorption spectrum of the compound Z was recorded and the concentration determined based on a molar extinction of 16,785 at 310 nm. Aliquots were then removed for quantitation of label using a Beckman LS 1801 scintillation counter. All HPLC analyses were performed at room temperature and utilized a Hewlett-Packard 1090 solvent delivery system. Eluting material was monitored for absorbance with a Hewlett-Packard 1040A diode array detector and for fluorescence with a Hewlett-Packard 1046A programmable fluorescence detector.Formation of pt-6-COOH from Compound ZThe remainder of the compound Z sample was adjusted to pH 12-13 with 1 N NaOH. An excess of 25 mM KMnO4 in H2O was added, and the sample was placed in a boiling water bath. Additional permanganate was added during the oxidation to maintain a bright purple color. After 20 min, the excess KMnO4 was reduced by the addition of 100 μl of 95% ethanol, and the precipitated MnO2 was removed by passing the sample through a 0.22-μm Costar Spin-X filter in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The original sample tube and the filter were then washed with 0.5 ml of 1 N NH4OH which was added to the filtrate. The entire sample was neutralized with 4 N HCl and concentrated to approximately 0.7 ml by rotoevaporation prior to injection onto a C-18 HPLC column equilibrated in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5. The pt-6-COOH peak was collected directly as it emerged from the UV detector (10Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spectrally quantitated based on a molar extinction coefficient at 344 nm of 7410(27Pfleiderer W. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 43-114Google Scholar). Aliquots were then removed for liquid scintillation counting and determination of specific radioactivity.Formation of Pterin from pt-6-COOHThe remaining pt-6-COOH was transferred to a 10-ml Pyrex beaker which was placed under an inverted, long-wavelength UV transilluminator (Ultra-Violet Products) with the sample 4-5 cm from the light source. The beaker was illuminated continuously for 15 h with the addition of aliquots of H2O to maintain a sample volume just sufficient to cover the bottom of the beaker. The entire sample was then injected onto a C-18 HPLC column equilibrated in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5, containing 0.5% methanol. The pterin peak was collected and spectrally quantitated based on a molar extinction coefficient at 339 nm of 6170(27Pfleiderer W. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 43-114Google Scholar).Isolation of Pterin and Bulk pt-6-COOH from Cells and Media Labeled with [8-14C]GuanosinePterin and pt-6-COOH were purified directly from the appropriate QAE-Sephadex fractions. For purification of pterin, the fractions containing the first blue fluorescent band were pooled and applied to a Florisil column similar to those used for compound Z purification. After washing with 0.01 N HCl and 200 ml of 22.5% acetone, pterin was eluted with a mixture of four volumes of 22.5% acetone and one volume of 1 N NH4OH. The pterin-containing Florisil fractions were pooled and concentrated to dryness by rotoevaporation. After resuspension in 1 ml of 0.01 N NaOH, final purification was achieved by two sequential injections of the entire sample onto a C-18 HPLC column equilibrated in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5, with 0.5% methanol. Using this procedure, the total yield of pterin from 1 liter of cells and conditioned medium was approximately 5 μg.To obtain pt-6-COOH, the middle fluorescent QAE-Sephadex band and the 22.5% acetone wash obtained from purification of pterin on Florisil were combined and permanganate oxidized in order to convert all pterins and folates to pt-6-COOH. After ethanol oxidation of excess KMnO4, the entire sample was filtered through two layers of Whatman paper on a Buchner funnel to remove solid MnO2. The sample was concentrated to dryness by rotoevaporation, and the pt-6-COOH purified by chromatography on a C-18 HPLC column equilibrated in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5. The total yield of pt-6-COOH was approximately 25 μg.RESULTSPurification of Compound ZAlthough the E. coli molybdopterin-deficient mutants moeB and moaE produce comparable amounts of precursor Z, the moeB mutant was arbitrarily chosen as the source of compound Z for all labeling experiments described here(9Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13440-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial attempts to purify compound Z from moeB cells cultured on unlabeled, minimal media yielded only 10-15% of the amount of compound Z obtained from moeB cells cultured on rich media(9Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13440-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Le Van et al. (28Le Van Q. Keller P.J. Bown D.H. Floss H.G. Bacher A. J.

In the course of these experiments, the labeled products were purified from the culture media rather than from the bacterial cells. This strategy yielded milligram quantities of labeled products from relatively small volumes of culture media. In view of these results, the possibility of purifying compound Z from the moeB culture media was examined.A preliminary experiment indicated that significant levels of compound Z could be isolated from the culture medium of moeB cells. Accordingly, a method for purification of compound Z from the entire cell culture was developed as described under “Materials and Methods.” This procedure yielded approximately 100 μg of compound Z from a 1-liter culture, a 30-fold increase over the amount purified from the cells alone.Sequential Cleavage of Compound ZIn order to assess the distribution of label between the ring and side chain positions of compound Z, a method involving sequential cleavage of the side chain carbons of compound Z was developed as shown in Fig. 3. Oxidation of compound Z with excess potassium permanganate under alkaline conditions at 100°C resulted in the loss of the three terminal side chain carbons. The product of this reaction, pt-6-COOH (31Forrest H.S. Mitchell H.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 5658-5662Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1783-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is stable, highly fluorescent, and easily separated from compound Z by reverse phase HPLC. Extended illumination of the pt-6-COOH with UV light was then employed for cleavage of the remaining side chain carboxylate carbon as CO2 to yield free pterin (33Lowry O.H. Bessey O.A. Crawford E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 389-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could be purified by HPLC. A comparison of the specific radioactivities of the two resulting pterin derivatives with that of the original compound Z was used to evaluate labeling of the original side chain carbons.Figure 3:Degradation scheme for compound Z resulting in sequential cleavage of the side chain carbons to produce free pterin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Labeling with [U-14C]GuanosineDue to the poor transport of phosphorylated molecules into bacterial cells, labeled guanosine rather than any of the nucleotides was used. [U-14C]Guanosine was the first choice for in vivo labeling since it offered the greatest possibility of transfer of labeled carbons to precursor Z. Table 1 shows the distribution of label in compound Z purified from media supplemented with 54 μCi of [U-14C]guanosine/liter. For each of four separate cultures, the specific radioactivities of the purified compound Z, pt-6-COOH, and pterin, as well as the percentage of label lost after each individual cleavage are listed. The presence of label in compound Z in every case indicated the incorporation of carbon atoms from guanosine into precursor Z during molybdopterin biosynthesis. Alkaline permanganate cleavage of the three terminal side chain carbons from compound Z resulted in an average loss of 13% of the original specific radioactivity, demonstrating that one or more of these three carbons originated from guanosine. A further loss of 14C label upon UV treatment of the pt-6-COOH indicated that the C-1′ carbon of precursor Z had also been labeled by [U-14C]guanosine. These results demonstrate that a guanine or guanosine derivative is the initial precursor for molybdopterin biosynthesis.Tabled 1To determine whether substantial cleavage of the ribose portion of the guanosine was occurring prior to incorporation into precursor Z, labeling of moeB cells with [U-14C]guanosine was performed in minimal media supplemented with ribose as well as glucose. As seen in the last two sets of data in Table 1, although the addition of cold ribose to the growth medium did decrease the specific radioactivity of the compound Z purified from these cultures, it did not affect the overall distribution of label in that compound Z. Hence, cleavage of the guanosine by endogenous nucleosidases prior to incorporation into precursor Z did not appear to be a contributing factor to the observed pattern of carbon transfers.Labeling with [8-14C]GuanosineThe results of in vivo labeling with [U-14C]guanosine suggested that the initial step in molybdopterin biosynthesis in E. coli could be catalyzed by a GTP cyclohydrolase or a similar enzyme. To test this possibility, moeB cells were cultured in minimal media supplemented with [8-14C]guanosine. If molybdopterin biosynthesis does indeed proceed initially through the action of a cyclohydrolase I- or II-type reaction, then little, if any, label would be expected to be transferred from the C-8 position of guanosine to precursor Z. The results are shown in Table 2. Surprisingly, the isolated compound Z was labeled by the"

https://openalex.org/W2061825298,"An emerging subclass of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) exhibits sequence identity to the vaccinia H-1 (VH-1) gene product. These VH-1-like PTPases possess the canonical HCXAGXXR(S/T) sequence common to all PTPases, but unlike other PTPases they exhibit dual catalytic activity toward phosphotyrosine and nearby phosphothreonine residues in substrate proteins. We have isolated a novel VH-1-like PTPase, hVH-3, from the human placenta and compared various aspects of its expression with previously isolated members of this subfamily. The mammalian members of this subfamily including hVH-3 commonly localize to the nucleus and exhibit catalytic activity toward phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase. However, while the expression of some VH-1-like PTPases is extremely transient and independent of protein synthesis, hVH-3 expression is sustained over 3 h after being cell stimulated. Tissue-specific expression of hVH-3 is also distinct from other VH-1-like PTPases. Although VH-1-like PTPases have overlapping substrate specificity, there are differences in their mRNA regulation, response to extracellular stimuli, and tissue-specific expression, suggesting they serve specific roles in cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W1969662122,"Attenuation of receptor-mediated signal amplification in response to external stimuli, an essential step in the balance of cellular activation, may be mediated by receptor phosphorylation. We have recently shown that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) interacts with G proteins and demonstrate here that this same region of the FPR is specifically phosphorylated by a neutrophil cytosolic kinase with properties similar to the G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK2. Both kinase activities show a lack of sensitivity toward protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors but demonstrate almost identical sensitivity toward the kinase inhibitor heparin. Kinetic studies demonstrated that GRK2 has a K m for the carboxyl-terminal domain of the FPR of approximately 1.5 μM and that denaturation of the substrate results in an almost complete loss of phosphorylation. Comparative studies reveal that GRK3 has approximately 50% of the activity of GRK2 toward the FPR carboxyl terminus, whereas GRK5 and GRK6 have no detectable activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of numerous regions of the FPR carboxyl terminus demonstrated that, whereas Glu 326/Asp 327 and Asp 333 are critical for phosphorylation, the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids are not required. Simultaneous substitution of Thr 334, Thr 336, Ser 338, and Thr 339 resulted in an ∼50% reduction in phosphorylation, whereas simultaneous substitution of the upstream Ser 328, Thr 329, Thr 331, and Ser 332 or merely the Ser 328 and Thr 329 residues resulted in an ∼80% reduction in phosphorylation. The introduction of negatively charged glutamate residues for Ser 328 and Thr 329 or Thr 331 and Ser 332 resulted in marked stimulation of phosphorylation. These results suggest a hierarchical mechanism in which phosphorylation of amino-terminal serine and threonine residues is required for the subsequent phosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal residues. These results provide the first direct evidence that an intracellular domain of a chemoattractant receptor is a high affinity substrate for GRK2 and further suggest a role for GRK2 or a closely related kinase in the attenuation of receptor-mediated activation of inflammatory cells.

https://openalex.org/W1997346441,"NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase) appears to be a 2-electron transfer flavoprotein, which catalyzes the conversion of quinones into hydroquinones. Upon photoreduction in the presence of dimethylformamide, the enzyme forms a red semiquinone. In the absence of dimethylformamide, only 10% of the radical form is thermodynamically stabilized. This indicates a redox potential of the enzyme-bound semiquinone/reduced flavin couple that is higher than the midpoint potential for the oxidized flavin/semiquinone couple. The 2-electron redox potential was determined to be −159 ± 3 mV at 25°C, pH 7.0. In the presence of benzoquinone or 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate, as NADPH analogue, there is no change in the redox properties of the enzyme flavin. A significant decrease is observed in the presence of the competitive inhibitor dicumarol (Em = −234 ± 2 mV at pH 7.0). The reaction mechanism of the flavoprotein has been investigated by steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic methods using NADPH, NADH, deamino-NADPH, and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide reduced form (APADH) as electron donors and K3Fe(CN)6, 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrolo-[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylic acid (PQQ), and 2,5-diaziridinyl-3,6-bis(carboethoxyamino)-1,4-benzoquinone (AZQ) as electron acceptors in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25°C. No evidence could be obtained to indicate that semiquinoid intermediates play a part in the catalytic mechanism of DT-diaphorase with quinones as acceptors. The rates of the reduction by NADPH, NADH, deamino-NADPH, and APADH (1.3 × 109, 8.8 × 108, 8.3 × 108 and 9.8 × 106M -1 min -1, respectively) as well as the rates of the reoxidation by PQQ and AZQ (9 × 104 and 2.8 × 106M -1 min -1, respectively) are directly proportional to substrate concentration, and there is no evidence of the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes. If such complexes do indeed exist, the affinity of the enzyme for substrate must be extremely low. Using K3Fe(CN)6 as electron acceptor, the rate of oxidation of fully reduced enzyme is 4.6 × 107M -1 min -1 and it is accurately proportional to ferricyanide concentration. This rate represents that of flavin semiquinone formation, with the subsequent oxidation of the semiquinone being much faster, since no spectral evidence for semiquinone formation could be obtained. Studies were also conducted attempting to use apo-DT-diaphorase reconstituted with PQQ as coenzyme. The lack of activity toward AZQ, K3Fe(CN)6, and menadione suggests that DT-diaphorase can use PQQ only as electron acceptor and not as redox cofactor.

NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2), also known as DT-diaphorase, is a flavoprotein widely distributed in animal tissues (1Ernster L. Chem. Scripta. 1987; 27A: 1-13Google Scholar). It is a dimeric enzyme with two molecules of FAD, one for each subunit(2Huang M.-T. Miwa G. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3930-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The name DT-diaphorase arose because of its ability to use either NADH or NADPH as cofactors in its reduction of quinone substrates. The enzyme is also remarkable in its high sensitivity to inhibition by dicumarol. However, little is known about the mechanism by which dicumarol inhibits the electron transfer functions of this protein, except to note that the sequence of addition of NAD(P)H and dicumarol appears important(3Huang M.-T. Miwa G. Lu A.Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another unique property of the enzyme is the result of the initial observation by Iyanagi and Yamazaki (4Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) that DT-diaphorase serves to transfer 2 electrons to a quinone, resulting in the formation of a hydroquinone product, without the accumulation of a dissociated semiquinone. This property has served as the starting point for a large number of studies to examine the possible relationship of DT-diaphorase to oxygen toxicity. By 1-electron reduction of quinones, semiquinones are generated that react spontaneously with molecular oxygen to give the parent quinone and superoxide. They can also react with nucleophiles, such as reduced glutathione, depleting the reduced thiol and nicotinamide nucleotide pools. Furthermore, quinone metabolites contribute significantly to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of aromatic hydrocarbons. By reducing quinones directly to hydroquinones, DT-diaphorase is proposed to be a cellular device against their toxicity(5Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Ltd., New York1991: 195-211Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme can participate in the metabolism of vitamin K and in the activation of anticancer drugs like AZQ, 1The abbreviations used are: AZQ2,5-diaziridinyl-3,6-bis(carboethoxyamino)-1,4-benzoquinoneDMFdimethylformamidedeamino-NADPHnicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide phosphate reduced formAPADH3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide reduced formAADP +3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphatePQQ4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrolo-[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylic acid. mitomycin C, dinitrophenylaziridine (CB 1954), and benzotriazine-di-N-oxide SR 4233 (6Riley R.J. Workman P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) by 2-electron reduction processes. However, in spite of the many studies of the biological role of DT-diaphorase and its possible use in cancer chemotherapy, the redox properties of the flavoprotein were undefined and the presumed obligatory 2-electron reduction of quinones rested largely with the initial observation of Iyanagi and Yamazaki(4Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this study we determined the midpoint potential for the couple FAD/FADH2 in DT-diaphorase and the properties of the radical form. Moreover, mechanistic studies are reported using different electron donors (NADPH, NADH, deamino-NADPH, and APADH) and three electron acceptors: K3Fe(CN)6, PQQ, and AZQ. K3Fe(CN)6 was chosen as the only obligatory 1-electron acceptor that is reported to be a good substrate for DT-diaphorase(7Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 309-317Crossref Scopus (699) Google Scholar), PQQ as a coenzyme with quinoid properties(8Sugioka K. Nakano M. Naito I. Tero-Kubota S. Ikegami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and AZQ as very important anticancer nitrocompound that seems to be activated in vivo by DT-diaphorase reduction. A possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of dicumarol (9Ordonez I.D. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) on the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity is also proposed. 2,5-diaziridinyl-3,6-bis(carboethoxyamino)-1,4-benzoquinone dimethylformamide nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide phosphate reduced form 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide reduced form 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrolo-[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylic acid. DT-diaphorase overexpressed in Escherichia coli was purified by Paulis Deng according to a previously published procedure (10Chen H. Ma J.X. Forrest G.L. Deng P.S.K. Martino P.A. Lee T.D. Chen S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). NADPH, NADH, APADH, AADP +, deamino-NADPH, and PQQ were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade. AZQ was a generous gift from Dr. David Ross, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado. DT-diaphorase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by following the decrease in absorbance of the electron donor at 340 nm, 350 nm (isosbestic point for the reduction of PQQ), and 333 nm (isosbestic point for the reduction of AZQ) using K3Fe(CN)6, PQQ, and AZQ as electron acceptors. All determinations were made at 25°C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of excess FAD. Using PQQ as a substrate, all the values were corrected for the contribution of the free PQQ nonenzymatically reacting with NADPH or its analogues(8Sugioka K. Nakano M. Naito I. Tero-Kubota S. Ikegami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Photoreduction of DT-diaphorase was achieved by irradiating the protein under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 15 mM EDTA, 1 μM 5-deazaflavin-3-sulfonate as catalyst, and 5 μM benzylviologen, at 25°C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0(11Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The concentrations of semiquinone and reduced enzyme were calculated at 450 and 400 nm for each point in the photoreduction using the following equation: ΔA(ox-x)=[red](εox-εred)+[sq](εox-εbc)(Eq. 1) where ΔA (ox - x) is the decrease in absorbance in comparison to the spectrum of the oxidized enzyme, ∊ ox, ∊ red, and ∊ sq are the extinction coefficients for oxidized, reduced, and radical enzyme forms, respectively, and [red] and [sq] are the molar concentration of reduced DT-diaphorase and its red semiquinone. The extinction coefficients of the semiquinone at different wavelengths were obtained by photoreduction of the enzyme in the presence of 75 mM DMF. When experiments were carried out in the presence of AZQ or benzoquinone, they were photochemically reduced as described above. After complete reduction the enzyme was added from the side arm of the anaerobic cuvette in order to be itself photochemically reduced. DT-diaphorase (1.0 ml) was made anaerobic and titrated with dithionite in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25°C by adding aliquots of an anaerobic dithionite solution from a gas-tight syringe attached to the anaerobic cuvette by ground glass joints. Benzylviologen (5 μM) was present during the titration to ensure redox equilibration. The redox potential for the flavoprotein was determined at 25°C, pH 7.0, 50 mM phosphate buffer by a spectrophotometric method employing a reducing system of xanthine and xanthine oxidase and a suitable mediator such as benzylviologen(12Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 59-66Google Scholar). The stopped-flow apparatus has been described previously(13Beaty N. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4611-4618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brissette P. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anaerobiosis of the flow system was achieved by equilibration overnight with an anaerobic solution of protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase (a generous gift of Dr. David P. Ballou, University of Michigan). Rate constants were obtained by exponential fits using the software “Program A” (developed by Chung-Jen Chiu, Rong Chung, Joel Dinverno, and Dr. David P. Ballou, University of Michigan), which permits the analysis of experimental data by exponential fits based on the Marquardt algorithm(15Bevington Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York1969: 235-242Google Scholar). This program permits the fixing of as many as five rate constants and two amplitudes and subsequent curve fitting to evaluate the absorbance of any intermediate species. It also permits the simulation of model kinetic pathways for comparison with the experimental data. To 10 ml of about 15 μM enzyme in the main compartment of a tonometer, 250 μM xanthine and 1.5 μM benzylviologen (the redox mediator) were added. After anaerobiosis, 50 μl of xanthine oxidase (A 450 nm = 0.35) was added from the side arm and the reduction was carried out at room temperature(12Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 59-66Google Scholar). When PQQ was used as electron acceptor, the enzyme was reduced by glucose-6-phosphate/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase using 50 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.1 μM NAD +, and a catalytic amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. DT-diaphorase apoprotein was prepared by dialyzing the holoenzyme at 4°C against 2 M KBr as described elsewhere. 2Tedeschi, G., Chen, S., and Massey, V., J. Biol. Chem., in press. Reconstitution with PQQ was performed at ice temperature in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, and activity assays were carried out as described in a previous section, in the presence of an excess of free PQQ. Visible spectra were taken using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Photoreduction experiments were carried out by irradiating the solution with a Sun Gun (Smith Victoria Corp., Griffith, IN). DT-diaphorase yields the characteristic red semiquinone spectrum upon photoreduction(11Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, a quantitative production of red semiquinone was obtained in the presence of 75 mM DMF. From the plot of absorbance at 474 nm versus 380 nm (inset of Fig. 1) the extinction of fully formed radical could be calculated. In the presence of benzylviologen a slow disproportionation occurs to yield 80% of the red semiquinone in thermodynamically stabilized form. On the other hand, in the absence of DMF, only 8% of semiquinone was obtained upon photoreduction. The result suggests that the organic solvent changes the protein environment or directly interacts with the N1C2=O position of the flavin(11Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The spectral changes after each irradiation were complete within 10-15 min, and no further changes were detected during periods up to 30 min in the dark. More than 30 min of irradiation was required for complete reduction. On mixing with air, no detectable radicals were observed; the reoxidation followed a pseudo-first order reaction with a rate constant of 0.0462 min -1 at ice temperature. Photoreduction in the presence of 30 μM AADP +, as NADP +/NADPH analogue, showed the same pattern. The reoxidation rate at ice temperature was practically identical with that previously determined in the absence of AADP +, indicating that the autoxidation of the flavin is unaffected by the presence of pyridine nucleotide. The same results were obtained in the presence of 50 μM photoreduced AZQ or 100 μM photoreduced benzoquinone, suggesting that the presence of the product does not increase the thermodynamic stabilization of the red semiquinone. According to Clark (16Clark W.M. Oxidation Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. The Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore1960: 184-188Google Scholar) 8% of radical produced at equilibrium corresponds to a negative separation of the two redox potentials for FAD/FADH ˙ (E m1) and FADH ˙/FADH2 (E m2) in the enzyme. From the Nernst equation (E m1 - E m2) was calculated to be −0.083 V at 25°C, pH 7.0. Addition of 1 mol of dithionite/FAD, or 2 electron equivalents, brings complete reduction of DT-diaphorase (results not shown). The concentration of semiquinone was quantitated from the change in absorbance at 400 and 450 nm. The maximum percent of red semiquinone was calculated to be 10%. From the Nernst equation, (E m1 - E m2) was calculated to be −0.072 V, at 25°C and pH 7.0, in quite good agreement with the value from the photoreduction experiment. To measure the potential of the FAD/FADH2 couple in DT-diaphorase, a reductive titration was done in the presence of 1-hydroxyphenazine (Em at pH 7.0 = −0.172 V; (17Muller O. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 145: 425-441Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) according to the method of Massey(12Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 59-66Google Scholar). A 5-μl sample of 5 mM 1-hydroxyphenazine was added to 1 ml of DT-diaphorase in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mM xanthine, 6 mM EDTA, and 5 μM benzylviologen at pH 7.0 and 25°C, with 2.38 × 10 -8M milk xanthine oxidase added under anaerobic conditions to start the reaction. The amounts of oxidized and reduced indicator dye as well as the amounts of oxidized and reduced DT-diaphorase were quantitated at 370 and 480 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). The log(ox/red) for the 1-hydroxyphenazine was plotted versus the log(ox/red) for the enzyme-bound-FAD (Fig. 2, inset) according to the method of Minneart(18Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plot gives a 1-unit slope and a value of −159 ± 3 mV for the FAD/FADH2 potential (Table 1). A similar titration was done in the presence of indigo disulfonate (Em = −125 mV at pH 7.0; (19Fultz M.L. Durst R.A. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1982; 140: 1-8Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which undergoes a loss of absorbance at 610 nm during reduction and shows an isosbestic point at 444 nm. The potential for the FAD/FADH2 couple was found to be −159 ± 3 mV (Table 1) in excellent agreement with the value from the 1-hydroxyphenazine titration. From the Minnaert plot (cf.Fig. 2, inset), a 1-unit slope was calculated, as expected for equilibrium between a 2-electron acceptor dye and a 2-electron donor without semiquinone formation. When the redox titration in the presence of 1-hydroxyphenazine was repeated in the presence of 10 μM photoreduced benzoquinone or 100 μM AADP + the potential for the FAD/FADH2 couple was calculated to be −159 ± 3 mV and −165 ± 3 mV, respectively (Table 1), suggesting that both the products of the reductive and the oxidative half-reaction do not change the redox properties of the enzyme flavin. However, a large decrease in the Em for the FAD/FADH2 couple was observed when the reduction of DT-diaphorase was carried out in the presence of 7 μM phenosafranine (Em = - 252 mV at pH 7.0; (17Muller O. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 145: 425-441Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and 22.5 μM dicumarol. The amount of reduced dye was quantitated by measuring the percent decrease at 530 nm compared with the maximum observed decrease at this wavelength before the reduction of benzylviologen. The amount of reduced FAD was quantitated by measuring the percent decrease at 456 nm corrected for the contribution of the dye at this wavelength. The Minnaert plot gives an E m7 of −234 ± 2 mV for the FAD/FADH2 couple without semiquinone formation (Table 1). The lowering of E m7 with dicumarol implies that dicumarol binds preferentially to the oxidized form of the enzyme. From the shift in midpoint potential of FAD (−207 mV, ref 12) upon binding to the enzyme (−159 mV) and the known dissociation constant of FAD from the oxidized enzyme (K ox = 1.8 × 10 -7M)2 a value of 4.2 × 10 -9M for K red can be calculated using the following equation(16Clark W.M. Oxidation Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. The Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore1960: 184-188Google Scholar). ΔE=RT/nF×ln(Kox/Kred)(Eq. 2) Tabled 1 Moreover, from the calculated value of (E m1 - E m2), the redox potential for the FAD/FADH ˙ and FADH ˙/FADH2 couples can be predicted to be approximately −0.2 and −0.118 V, respectively. Steady-state assays were performed following the decrease in absorbance of NADPH or its analogues at 25°C, pH 7.0. Data such as those presented in Fig. 3 were obtained using PQQ, AZQ, or K3Fe(CN)6 as electron acceptors. As far as we know, this is the first time that PQQ, which is a well known cofactor for quinoproteins, has been reported to be a substrate for DT-diaphorase. Using this coenzyme as electron acceptor, the parallel pattern of the double-reciprocal plot confirms that the reaction proceeds with a ping-pong mechanism, as described previously for DT-diaphorase reacting with AZQ(20Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7293-7300PubMed Google Scholar). The same result was obtained when K3Fe(CN)6 was used as acceptor. The steady-state data may be described by a general equation of the form shown below(21Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar). e/v=ϕo+ϕA/[A]+ϕy/[B](Eq. 3) However, with DT-diaphorase, with all electron donors and acceptors that we have studied, results such as those shown in Fig. 3 have been obtained. With none of the substrates is there evidence for the existence of a limiting velocity, and in all cases the kinetic results are described within experimental error by the second order rate constants k1 and k2 for any set of substrate concentrations. Thus the reaction may be formulated as shown in Reactions 1 and 2 Eox+AH3⇀k1Ered+A REACTION 1 Ered+B⇀k2Eus+BH2 REACTION 2 and e/v=1/k1[AH2]+1/k2[B](Eq. 4) where AH2 = reduced pyridine nucleotide and B = electron acceptor. The second-order rate constants for NADPH or its analogues, k1, cannot be determined with accuracy from steady-state assays as it is impracticable to work with electron donor concentrations sufficiently low to influence significantly the rate of the reaction. Values of k2 for different electron acceptors, obtained from slope of intercept plots such as that of Fig. 3B, are reported in Table 2.Tabled 1 The only rapid reaction studies so far reported with DT-diaphorase are those of Hosoda et al.(22Hosoda S. Nakamura W. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They reported an extremely fast second order reduction of the enzyme by NADPH, with an estimated value of 3.1 × 108M -1 s -1 at pH 7.0, 15°C. Similar results were found in this study, but because of the rapidity of the reaction, our data were obtained at 4°C. The reductive half-reaction has been studied by stopped-flow spectroscopy, monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 450 nm after mixing 7.5 μM oxidized enzyme with electron donor (10-50 μM; concentrations after mixing) anaerobically. The observed changes in absorbance versus time were monophasic, and the total change was always equal to the expected change in absorbance for the complete reduction of the enzyme. Data obtained at longer wavelengths showed no evidence of transient charge-transfer complexes. With each of the 4 reduced pyridine nucleotides studied, the observed rate of reduction was directly proportional to the reduced pyridine nucleotide concentration, with the second order rate constant shown in Table 3. Thus, from the rapid reaction studies, there is no evidence for the formation of a complex between oxidized enzyme and pyridine nucleotide. If such a complex does exist, then it must be of low affinity, with Kd values > 0.5 mM. The reaction of oxidized enzyme with NADPH, NADH, deamino-NADPH, and APADH can be reduced to Eox+AH2⇀k1Ered+ATabled 1 which sufficiently describes the experimental results. Hosoda et al.(22Hosoda S. Nakamura W. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the very rapid reoxidation of reduced enzyme by menadione, too fast to be measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. We were able to confirm this finding; even at 4°C the reoxidation of reduced enzyme by menadione, at concentrations barely in excess of that of the enzyme, was complete within the 3-ms dead time of our stopped-flow apparatus. For this reason, in order to study the oxidative half-reaction, reduced DT-diaphorase was prepared and reacted under anaerobic conditions at 25°C with slower substrates: AZQ and PQQ. With both the substrates, there were no detectable intermediates formed in the dead time of the stopped-flow experiments (Figure 4:, Figure 5:) or spectral indications of intermediates at any wavelength. In particular only two spectrophotometrically distinguishable forms of both the flavin and the acceptor (oxidized and reduced) were detected in the 600-700 and 420-500 nm regions, where the PQQ semiquinone is reported to have maximum absorbance(8Sugioka K. Nakano M. Naito I. Tero-Kubota S. Ikegami Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as at 375 and 480 nm, where both AZQ (23Butler J. Hoey B.M. Lea J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and flavin radical can be easily observed. The reactions followed second order kinetics, and again there was no evidence for the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. The oxidative half-reaction can then be written as Ered+B⇀k2Eox+BH2Figure 4:Reaction of the reduced flavoprotein with PQQ. The reduced flavoprotein (17.3 μM before mixing) was mixed with different concentrations of PQQ in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25°C. The graph shows changes at 450 nm (PQQ concentrations of 52, 56.5, 135.5, 294, and 362 μM, traces from right to left). Inset, direct plot of the observed rate as a function of PQQ concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) where k2 values are reported in Table 2, and found to be in good agreement with those obtained from steady-state kinetics. Since K3Fe(CN)6 is an obligatory 1-electron acceptor, a flavin semiquinone intermediate must occur in the oxidation of reduced enzyme. Experimentally no flavin radical could be detected as an intermediate and it was possible to monitor only the complete oxidation of the enzyme. The rate traces were single exponential at all wavelengths and a second order rate constant was calculated as shown in Table 2. The mechanism to account for a stepwise 1-electron oxidation of fully reduced flavin is the case of two irreversible consecutive reactions Ered+Fe(CN)b3-⇀k2EBq+Fe(CN)A4- Reaction 3 EBq+Fe(CN)b3-⇀k3Eox+Fe(CN)b4- Reaction 4 where k3 is faster than k2. In order to confirm this observation, the oxidation by K3Fe(CN)6 of semiquinone-DT-diaphorase was carried out by stopped-flow measurements. The red semiquinone was obtained by photoreduction in the presence of DMF and was oxidized using K3Fe(CN)6 under anaerobic conditions. The oxidized enzyme was completely formed in the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument (3 ms), even at ferricyanide concentrations barely in excess of the enzyme concentration, giving a lower limit estimate of k3 as 3.7 × 109M -1 min -1, at least 80 times greater than the value of k2. PQQ appears to be a water-soluble, organic, 1-electron transfer redox cofactor, and quinoprotein dehydrogenases are reported to operate via two single electron processes(24McWhirter R.B. Klapper M.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6919-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DT-diaphorase, on the contrary, appears to react with PQQ as a 2-electron acceptor. It was considered interesting to check if the enzyme can also use PQQ as coenzyme. Apo-DT-diaphorase was prepared as described elsewhere2 and incubated with an excess of PQQ. The enzyme showed no activity versus AZQ, K3Fe(CN)6, or menadione, which is a typical substrate for FAD-DT-diaphorase. The FAD-reconstituted protein, in control experiments, was fully active when tested under the same conditions. In free solution the flavin radical exists in very rapid equilibrium with its oxidized and fully reduced form with only a few percent of the total flavin being in the radical form. It is well known that when bound to a protein the stability of the flavin radical is generally enhanced. In particular, Massey et al.(25Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discussed some correlative properties of flavoproteins and suggested that with few exceptions the semiquinoid form of the oxidases is the red (or anionic) form, whereas the dehydrogenases/oxygenases are remarkable in displaying little stabilization of any radical form. Finally, the enzymes involved in obligatory 1-electron transfer reactions almost uniformly appear to give thermodynamic stabilization of the blue neutral flavin radical, and there is real evidence for the catalytic functioning of the radical state. DT-diaphorase stabilizes only 8-10% of the red semiquinone upon photoreduction or sodium dithionite titration, corresponding to a negative difference in the redox potentials of the couple EFAD/EFADH ˙ and EFADH ˙/EFADH2. These data suggest that DT-diaphorase does not operate with a typical semiquinone intermediate form of finite lifetime and thermodynamic considerations favor a simultaneous 2-electron transfer mechanism. The results are in agreement with earlier studies on DT-diaphorase(4Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This property is peculiar to the protein and is presumably important for the physiological role of the enzyme in its function in the cellular detoxification of hydroquinones without semiquinone formation. Iyanagi and Yamazaki (4Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) reported electron spin resonance studies as direct experimental evidence of DT-diaphorase behaving as a 2-electron donor. However, the possibility was not ruled out that an unstable radical intermediate was present during the reoxidation of the flavin(22Hosoda S. Nakamura W. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the redox properties of DT-diaphorase and the reaction mechanism were not studied in detail. The present determination of redox potentials and the photoreduction experiments give further insight into this behavior. The results obtained with the obligatory 1-electron acceptor, K3Fe(CN)6, are particularly instructive. Although the intermediate formation of the enzyme flavin radical is a clear requirement in this reaction, no flavoprotein semiquinone could be detected, simply because the second electron transfer was much faster than the first 1-electron transfer. This possibility clearly exists with all of the acceptors studied. Since DT-diaphorase uses FAD as coenzyme, it could participate in two 1-electron transfer reactions as well as in one 2-electron transfer process. In the first case, the lifetime of the flavin radical could be very short and the coenzyme would be fully oxidized before the release of the product, as previously suggested in the reaction versus menadione(22Hosoda S. Nakamura W. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chen S. Liu X.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 545-548PubMed Google Scholar). Of course, these arguments do not rule out the possibility of a simple 2-electron transfer mechanism, as commonly assumed. From the data reported in this work, the redox potential for the EFAD/EFADH ˙ couple can be predicted to be ∼-0.200 V. Many molecules like quinone-epoxides(27Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Ernster L. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1988; 5: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (28Buffinton G.D. Öllinger K. Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 1988; 257: 561-571Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), benzoquinones(28Buffinton G.D. Öllinger K. Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 1988; 257: 561-571Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and anthraquinones(29Dodd N.J.F. Mukherjee T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which have redox potentials for the quinone/quinone radical couple much lower than −0.200 V, are very good acceptors of DT-diaphorase, arguing against single electron transfer. While the possibility exists that binding of the substrate can change the redox properties of the flavin and circumvent the thermodynamic barrier against 1-electron transfer between FADH2 and these molecules, it is important to note that with none of the compounds tested was any evidence found for the formation of radical intermediates. The result is clearly not surprising since in studies with FAD analogues,2 we observed that the enzyme is catalytically active when reconstituted with 5-deaza-FAD, which can be oxidized only through a single 2-electron step(30Blankenhorn G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme cannot use PQQ as redox coenzyme but only as electron acceptor. Remarkably, this coenzyme is involved in 1-electron transfer catalysis in bacterial quinoprotein dehydrogenases (24McWhirter R.B. Klapper M.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6919-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and seems to be present in mammalian tissues as a new vitamin whose potential biochemical role is correlated with the nonenzymatic oxidation of NAD(P)H(31Duine J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 96-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The molecule efficiently scavenges superoxide by oxidation and in pharmacologic doses protects against glutathione depletion(32Nishigori H. Yasunaga M. Mizumara M. Lee J.W. Iwatsuru M. Life Sci. 1989; 45: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed it will be interesting to investigate further its function as a DT-diaphorase substrate in order to clarify the role of both the enzyme and PQQ in NAD(P)H metabolism. A ratio of binding constants for oxidized and reduced flavin to the apoenzyme can be calculated from the shift in redox potential of FAD when bound to DT-diaphorase. The midpoint potential for the enzyme-bound FAD of −159 mV at pH 7.0 is not very different from that of free flavin (−207 mV at pH 7.0) and corresponds to a ratio of binding constants of 43 with the reduced flavin bound more tightly to the apoenzyme than oxidized FAD. This results in thermodynamically more favorable reduction of the coenzyme. The presence of reduced benzoquinone and the reductive pyridine nucleotide analogue AADP + has no effect on the midpoint potential of the enzyme-bound FAD, as well as the semiquinone stability, suggesting that the thermodynamic electron transfer to and from the enzyme is not controlled significantly by the substrate or the product. This result is in accord with the steady-state kinetics, which indicate lack of binding or at best very weak binding of substrates to the enzyme. On the other hand, the presence of dicumarol results in a change in the redox potential from −0.159 to −0.234 V, making the reduction thermodynamically more difficult. While it is tempting to speculate that this decrease might explain why dicumarol is reported to be a competitive inhibitor of pyridine nucleotide and uncompetitive inhibitor of the electron acceptor in spite of the fact that its binding site seems to be different from the binding site of NAD(P)H and its analogues(22Hosoda S. Nakamura W. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its dramatic inhibition of reduction rate by NAD(P)H (2Huang M.-T. Miwa G. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3930-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) makes this explanation unlikely. These results argue for a conformational change upon binding of dicumarol, consistent with the observations reported with FAD analogues2 and proteolytic digestion experiments(33Chen S. Deng P.S.K. Bailey J.M. Swiderek K.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Regarding the steady-state and stopped-flow data, a few points require comment. In our studies, four electron donors and three different electron acceptors were used as substrates. DT-diaphorase is remarkable in its ability to reduce a variety of oxidants including quinones(28Buffinton G.D. Öllinger K. Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 1988; 257: 561-571Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar), azo-compounds(34Huang M-T. Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3930-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chromium VI compounds(35De Flora S. Morelli A. Basso C. Romano M. Serra D. De Flora A. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3188-3196PubMed Google Scholar), benzotriazine di-N-oxides(36Riley R.J. Workman P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and nitro-compounds(37Sugimura T. Okabe K. Nagao M. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 1717-1721PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these substrates, however, are not suitable for kinetic studies because of their solubility or spectral properties and because they are reduced too fast by DT-diaphorase. In this study, using K3Fe(CN)6, PQQ, and AZQ as electron acceptor, the reaction was sufficiently slow to be followed accurately by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. In addition, both PQQ and AZQ can form semiquinone species sufficiently stable to be detected by the stopped-flow technique. With all the oxidative and the reductive substrates, there was no evidence for the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex and two simple irreversible half-reactions put together provide a sufficient scheme to account for all the kinetic data. The schemes to which the rates apply are the following. For AZQ and PQQ as electron acceptors, Eox+AH2⇀k1Ered+A Ered+B⇀k2Eox+BH2 For K3Fe(CN)6, Eox-AH⇀k1Ered+A Ered+Fe(CN)B3-⇀k2EBq+Fe(CN)B4- Esq+Fe(CN)63-⇀k3Eox+Fe(CN)64- In none of these cases are there definable values of k cat and Km for either electron donor or acceptor, with catalytic velocities determined directly by the concentration of the donor or the acceptor. It appears from the experimental results that if a complex is formed at all, the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate must be strikingly low and the true rate-limiting step is the reoxidation of the flavin. This result is in accordance with the lack of specificity shown by DT-diaphorase with respect to the electron accepting substrate as well as the electron donor, suggesting that the active site of this enzyme can accommodate molecules of varying size and structure."
https://openalex.org/W2036403955,"The effect that altering amphipathicity has on the folding process and self association of melittin, a small model protein, has been investigated using single amino acid substitutions of lysine 7, a residue distant from the contact residues involved in the hydrophobic core of tetrameric melittin. While substitutions of such a residue were not expected to interfere with the packing process, the largest alterations in the potential overall amphipathicity of melittin were found to prevent the folding into an α-helical conformation to occur and, in turn, to prevent the self association. Amphipathic α-helices were found to be a key determining feature in the early folding process of the self association of peptides and protein segments. Those substitutions, which prevented the inducible amphipathic folding ability, were also found to result in a loss in hemolytic and antimicrobial activity. These results, combined with studies of the binding to artificial liposomes and to polysialic acids, indicate that the losses in activity were due to an initial inability to be induced into an amphipathic α-helix and to self associate. Ultimately, melittin's self association is proposed to be required to penetrate the carbohydrate barrier present in biological membranes.

Ultimately, melittin's self association is proposed to be required to penetrate the carbohydrate barrier present in biological membranes. Amphipathic α-helices are a ubiquitous structural feature found in many proteins and biologically active peptides. This structural motif has been found to play multiple roles in protein folding, protein-protein recognition, protein-membrane interactions, and protein and peptide biological activity. Amphipathic α-helices, in turn, have a pronounced tendency to self associate in defined structural arrangements (for review, see (1Stewart J.M. Epand R.M. The Amphipathic Helix. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 21-37Google Scholar). However, due to the complexity and compound variables involved in such interactions, the identities of the amino acid residues and/or sequences that contribute to the folding, self association, stability, and activity of the native proteins are not well understood. In an effort to study this problem, a number of groups using protein mutants (2Blaber M. Zhang X. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and guest peptides(3Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 5Lyu P.C. Liff M.I. Marky L.A. Kallenbach N.R. Science. 1990; 250: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) are investigating the propensity of individual amino acid residues to induce specific secondary structures, regardless of the resulting alteration of the amphipathicity of peptide and protein domains. The role and importance that altering the amphipathicity plays in relation to the folding process was studied in the present work using melittin, a model, small tetrameric self assembling protein. Melittin is a 26-residue peptide (GIGAVLKVLTTGLPALISWIKRKRQQ-NH2), which is known to adopt an amphipathic α-helical conformation in the presence of biological membranes, micelles, and surfactants(6Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at high peptide concentration or at high ionic strength, melittin is known to self associate into a tetrameric structure driven by the formation of a hydrophobic core(7Goto Y. Hagihara Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reduction of electrostatic repulsion between the positive charges occurring at high pH and/or high salt concentration was also found to favor the self association of melittin(7Goto Y. Hagihara Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Wilcox W. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Variations of residues distant from the hydrophobic core and clearly solvent-exposed are not expected to interfere with the protein packing process and, in turn, should result in the formation of a similar self aggregational state. Thus, the lack of self association following substitution or omission of specific residues in a peptide sequence would tend to imply that the alteration of the amphipathicity of the modified region and/or the nature of the mutation are important elements in the early stages of the folding process. Using x-ray crystallography, the lysine at position 7 in melittin's sequence has been shown to be fully solvent exposed following tetrameric self association(9Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6010-6015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Terwilliger T.C. Weissman L. Eisenberg D. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and its microenvironment has been shown to be essentially unaltered upon tetramerization(11Oomen R.P. Kaplan H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Single substitution analogues at position 7 with amino acids having varying chemical properties were synthesized in the present study to determine the effect of such alterations on melittin's folding and self association capability, using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In addition to its importance in the folding process, the role of amphipathic α-helices self association on melittin's and other peptides' biological activity remains unclear. Thus, the relationship between the tetrameric self assembly of melittin or mastoparan in solution and their lytic activities has not been defined, nor has the role of the trimerization of glucagon. The results obtained in the current structural studies using melittin's substitution analogues were therefore related to the differences in the biological activities (hemolytic and antimicrobial activity) of these substitution analogues in order to elucidate the effect amphipathic α-helices have on the self association in relation to the biological activity of peptides. Peptides were prepared by simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry as described elsewhere(12Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Final cleavage and deprotection were carried out using a “low-high” hydrogen fluoride procedure using a 24-vessel cleavage apparatus ((13Houghten R.A. Bray M.K. De Graw S.T. Kirby C.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 27: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), Chiron Mimotopes Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA). The peptides were then purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyegg PCegg phosphatidylcholinePSphosphatidylserineMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidRBCred blood cellSUVsmall unilamellar vesicle. using a DeltaPrep 3000 reverse phase HPLC combined with a Foxy fraction collector (Millipore Corp., Waters Division, San Francisco, CA). Analytical reverse phase HPLC and laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (Kratos Kompact MALDITOF mass spectrometer, Kratos, Ramsey, NJ) were used to determined the purity and identity of the peptides. high performance liquid chromatography egg phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid red blood cell small unilamellar vesicle. Size exclusion chromatography of the purified synthetic peptides was performed on a Ultraspherogel SEC 2000 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) size-exclusion column run isocratically in low salt (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 5 mM MOPS) or high-salt (1.5 M NaCl, 5 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0) buffer at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Prior to injection, samples were filtered using 1-μm Acrodisc CR PTFE filters (Gelman Sciences, MI). Samples were applied to the column at 0.5-1 mg/ml. Bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, cytochrome c, and insulin chain B (Sigma) were used as standards. A mixture of egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS, Sigma) (10 mg) was dissolved in a chloroform/methanol (9:1 (v/v)) mixture and dried by a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried lipid was hydrated in 2 ml of 5 mM MOPS-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, with repeated vortex mixing for 15 min. The suspension was sonicated in an ice-water bath for 20 min using an ultrasonic generator equipped with a microtip probe (Vibra cell, Sonics and Materials, Inc., Danbury, CT). All measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-720 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (CD, Eaton, MD) in conjunction with a Neslab RTE 110 waterbath and temperature controller (Dublin, CA). The CD instrument was routinely calibrated with an aqueous solution of D-10-camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 nm. CD spectra were the average of a series of three to seven scans made at 0.2-nm intervals. CD spectra of the same buffer and/or lipid solutions without peptides were used as baseline in all of the experiments. Ellipticity is reported as mean molar residue ellipticity [ θ]; the limits of error of measurements at 222 nm were ± 500 (deg cm2 dmol -1). The secondary structure of the peptides was estimated using the curve fitting procedure described by Yang et al.(14Yang J.T. Wu C.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Although this algorithm is based on the CD spectra of known secondary structures of proteins, this method can be used for the comparison of the secondary structures of sequence-related peptides. For salt-induced aggregation, liposome binding studies, and sialic and colominic acid titrations, stock solutions were separately prepared with: 1) peptide in buffer (5 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0); 2) 5 M NaCl; 3) 5.6 mM phospholipid egg PC/PS (8% PS in mol) or egg PC/PS/cholesterol (33% cholesterol, 5% PS in mol); 4) sialic acid (1 mg/ml); and 5) colominic acid (1 mg/ml). The samples studied were then prepared by mixing the appropriate solutions at a range of defined ratios. Samples were tested for nonspecific peptide aggregation or peptide-induced liposome aggregation using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array UV spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA). Peptide concentrations were determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm in buffer and in the presence of 7.2 M guanidine HCl; the reported extinction coefficient standard for melittin in buffer ( ∊ 280 = 5570 M -1 cm -1; (15Quay S.C. Condie C.C. Minton K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 831: 22-29Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used as reference. The concentration dependence of the CD spectra of the peptides in 5 mM MOPS-NaOH buffer at pH 7.0 was analyzed for size-defined oligomer formation, nM - L, K diss = [M]n/[L], where [M] and [L] are the monomeric and self-assembled concentrations of the peptides, respectively, n is the degree of association, and K diss is a dissociation constant. The experimentally determined mean molar ellipticity/residue at 222 nm for each peptide at varying concentrations was analyzed using the formalism proposed by Taylor and Kaiser (16Taylor J.W. Kaiser E.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 473-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the software Graphpad (ISI, San Diego, CA). The guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation studies were carried out by preparing mixtures of a stock solution of peptide in buffer (5 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0), buffer alone, plus a solution of 7.2 M guanidine HCl in buffer. The ratios of buffer and 7.2 M guanidine HCl solutions were varied to give the appropriate final guanidine HCl concentrations. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature prior to CD measurement. The thermal dependence of ellipticity at 222 nm was analyzed using the program TTSCAN (Jasco) with a step resolution of 0.1°C and a temperature slope of 20°C/h. The ellipticity values obtained from both, guanidine HCl and thermal denaturation studies were analyzed using the software Graphpad. The hemolytic activities of the peptides were determined using human red blood cells (RBCs). The blood was collected in heparin, maintained at 4°C, and used either the same day or the following day. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (35 mM phosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.0) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Neuramidase (Sigma) was added to half of the samples for a final concentration of 10 IU/ml(17Lin G.S.B. Macey R.I. Mehlhorn R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 732: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both the neuramidase-treated and untreated control samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The neuramidase and liberated sialic acids were washed away with isotonic sucrose, and the resulting pellets were retained. The hemolytic activity of the peptides were determined as described (18Blondelle S.E. Simpkins L.R. Pérez-Payá E. Houghten R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using 96-well tissue culture plates. In brief, 100 μl of a 0.5% RBC solution were added to an equal volume of each peptide in phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 414 nm. The concentration of peptide necessary to lyse 50% RBCs (HD 50) was then determined for each peptide using a sigmoidal curve fitting method (Graphpad). Microdilution assays were carried out against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli BAS 849 in 96-well tissue culture plates as described elsewhere(19Blondelle S.E. Houghten R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12688-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Following overnight incubation at 37°C, the optical density at 620 nm of the bacterial suspension in Muller-Hinton broth was measured in the presence of serial 2-fold dilution of peptides. The concentration of peptide necessary to inhibit 50% of the bacterial growth (IC 50) was then determined for each peptide using a sigmoidal curve fitting method (Graphpad). Melittin and eight substitution analogues at position 7 were prepared using simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis ((12Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar); sequences listed in Table 1). As determined by CD spectroscopy, random structure with a characteristic minimum near 200 nm was found in aqueous buffer for melittin and all of the substitution analogues except subK7E, which adopted a 40%α-helical conformation (Table 1). In order to confirm the ability of these peptides to adopt an α-helical conformation, the CD spectra of each peptide of this series were measured in the presence of trifluoroethanol, a solvent known to induce helicity in single-stranded potentially α-helical polypeptides(20Lehrman S.R. Tuls J.L. Lund M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5590-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In 60% trifluoroethanol, the ellipticities at 222 nm of all of the analogues (including the parent sequence) were found to have values of approximately −25,000 ± 2,000 deg cm2 dmol -1, except for subK7A and subK7E, which had slightly higher values (Table 1). The ellipticity values determined at 222 nm were found to be independent of the peptide concentration (up to 600 μM, data not shown), which suggests that the helical structure in each peptide is unimolecular in this environment as reported for other amphipathic peptides(21Zhong L. Johnson Jr., W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Peptides that have the potential to form amphipathic α-helical structures in many instances aggregate in a highly cooperative manner in aqueous solution. In such an aggregate, the hydrophobic domains of amphipathic helices generally interact to form a hydrophobic core. In order to evaluate the concentration dependence of this self association process of melittin and its analogues, their CD spectra were analyzed at varying peptide concentrations in 5 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, at 25°C. At low peptide concentration, only subK7E showed a partial α-helical conformation ([ θ] 222 = −13,400 deg cm2 dmol -1; Fig. 1A). This may be due to tight intermolecular interactions stabilized by electrostatic effects in a manner similar to reported coil coiled structures(3Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At elevated peptide concentrations (concentration greater than 0.15 mM), the ellipticity values found at 222 nm for those peptides with a positive or negative charge at position 7 are indicative of an α-helical protein (Fig. 1A). Those analogues lacking a charge at position 7 failed to aggregate in the range of concentrations tested (Fig. 1B). This lack of self aggregation correlates with a decreased hydrophobic moment relative to the parent sequence (Table 1). The significant self association of melittin, subK7D, and subK7E can be best explained by the formation of a tetramer. The dissociation constants found for these peptides correspond to free energies of tetramerization of −17.0, −17.9, and −18.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The free energy of tetramerization obtained for melittin is similar to the previously reported value of −17.7 kcal/mol obtained in phosphate buffer(22Quay S.C. Condie C.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and higher than the value obtained in Tris buffer (−15.4 kcal/mol; (8Wilcox W. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that, as described in the case of phosphate buffer(22Quay S.C. Condie C.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), MOPS buffer stabilizes the tetrameric form of melittin. It has been shown that melittin is in an unfolded state at micromolar concentrations under conditions of low ionic strength, but adopts a tetrameric helical structure under conditions of high ionic strength (7Goto Y. Hagihara Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Pérez-Payá E. Houghten R.A. Blondelle S.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Folding of the eight melittin substitution analogues as a function of ionic strength was therefore investigated further (Fig. 2). In agreement with the concentration-dependent results described above (Fig. 1A), melittin, subK7D, and subK7E were found to fold into an α-helical conformation with increasing NaCl concentration (Fig. 2A). The NaCl concentration required to induce 50% folding ([NaCl] 50) was 0.73, 0.47, and 0.15 M for melittin, subK7D, and subK7E, respectively. The CD spectra of each peptide in the presence of varying NaCl concentration exhibited an isodichroic point at 203 nm, indicating a two-state equilibrium between a random coil and an α-helix. Furthermore, the shape of each analogues' CD spectra in the presence of a high salt concentration indicates the presence of α-helical content. In contrast to the concentration dependent behavior of the three analogues described above (Fig. 1B), two distinctly different behaviors were observed for the remaining six analogues (Fig. 2B). It should be noted that these six peptides differ from the preceding ones by their lack of a charged amino acid at position 7. The α-helical content of subK7A and subK7G increased with increasing ionic strength (Fig. 2B), but not with increasing peptide concentration ([NaCl] 50 = 0.5 and 1.0 M, respectively). On the other hand, in the presence of 1 M NaCl, the CD spectra of subK7I, subK7L, subK7V, and subK7W indicated a predominantly β-sheet structure (minimum around 217 nm; the shape of the CD spectra is similar to the recently reported spectra for a predominantly β-sheet protein(24Smith C.K. Withka J.M. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Minimal or a lack of α-helicity was indicated by the absence of a clearly defined minimum at 208 nm. The degree of self assembly of the peptides was also investigated using size exclusion chromatography. Two separate solvent systems were used to mimic the environment used in our CD studies: 5 mM MOPS containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in order to minimize the nonspecific interactions between the peptides and the chromatographic support (no change in conformation for melittin appeared in CD upon decreasing the pH); and 5 mM MOPS-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1.5 M NaCl. Both conditions are expected to favor self association. The elution times of the nine peptides, as well as a range of molecular weight standards, are shown in Table 2. In 5 mM MOPS, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, all of the peptides had elution times similar to insulin chain B, indicating that they were monomeric. The presence of a minor peak (for subK7I, subK7L, and subK7V) was found at an elution time close to the void volume of the column and is believed to indicate the presence of large nonspecific aggregated structures. In the presence of 1.5 M NaCl, however, melittin, subK7A, subK7D, subK7E, and subK7G appear to be tetramers, as described for melittin(9Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6010-6015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Terwilliger T.C. Weissman L. Eisenberg D. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Only monomeric forms were indicated in both chromatographic systems for the other four peptides (subK7I, subK7L, subK7V, and subK7W).Tabled 1 The denaturation curves were determined at 25°C by monitoring the peptides ellipticities at 222 nm as a function of the concentration of guanidine HCl. These studies were initially carried out for melittin, subK7A, subK7D, subK7E, and subK7G, peptides found earlier to self associate at high peptide concentration or high ionic strength (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). The minimum concentration in NaCl that ensured the presence of the tetrameric structures was used to compare the stability of tetrameric forms of these analogues (1.2 M NaCl for subK7A, subK7D, and subK7E, and 2 M NaCl for melittin and subK7G; Fig. 3A). The peptide concentrations for the five peptides were equal (20 μM) to rule out the possible concentration effects on stability. Significant differences in the guanidine HCl concentration transition midpoint values ([guanidine HCl] 50, concentration at which the helical content is 50% of the maximum helical content in the absence of denaturant) were found among these peptides (Table 3). The highest [guanidine HCl] 50 was found for subK7E (2.13 M), which is in sharp contrast to the value of 0.54 M found for subK7G. These variations in the indication of aggregation stability are noteworthy when one takes into account the fact that these analogues differ by only 1 amino acid.Tabled 1 In a monomer-to-tetramer transition, the unfolding process should follow a two-state equilibrium model between folded tetramers (F4) and unfolded monomers (U): F4 4U, with K diss = [U]4/[F4] = 4Pt3(fu4/(1 - fu)(3Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Goto Y. Hagihara Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). K diss represents the tetramer dissociation constant; Pt represents the total peptide concentration; and fu represents the molar fraction of unfolded peptide as determined from the ellipticity at 222 nm. The formula fu = ( θn - θ)/( θn - θu) is used to calculate fu, where θ represents the observed ellipticity at a given guanidine HCl concentration, and θn and θu are the ellipticities of the tetrameric folded and monomeric unfolded states, respectively. The value K diss was calculated in the transition zone for each guanidine HCl concentration tested. The K diss were found to increase logarithmically with guanidine HCl concentration for the five peptides (mel, subK7A, subK7D, subK7E, and subK7G). These results suggest the presence of an invariant tetramer structure, which, upon increasing guanidine HCl concentration, vary in stability. The free energy variation in the unfolding process (ΔGu) was determined at each guanidine HCl concentration using the formula ΔGu = -RT lnK diss. The free energy of the unfolding process in the absence of denaturant (ΔGuH2O) was estimated by linear extrapolation of the ΔGu values to a guanidine HCl concentration equal to zero using the equation ΔGu = ΔGuH2O - m [guanidine HCl](25Matouschek A. Kellis Jr., J.T. Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The ΔGuH2O and m values for all the peptides are listed in Table 3. Based on the crystal structure of tetrameric melittin(9Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6010-6015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Terwilliger T.C. Weissman L. Eisenberg D. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), position 7 is fully exposed to the solvent. If one envisions that the stability of a four-bundle or tetrameric melittin array results solely from the hydrophobic interactions occurring in the hydrophobic core, one would expect to find the same stability for all the peptides studied. However, at 25°C in the absence of denaturant, tetrameric self assembly of subK7E was found to be approximately 3 kcal/mol more favorable than the tetrameric self assembly of melittin. SubK7E also had the highest transition midpoint, indicating greater stability. In contrast, subK7G had the lowest transition midpoint ([guanidine HCl] 50 = 0.54 M), which can be related to its elevated m value. As proposed by Matouschek et al.(25Matouschek A. Kellis Jr., J.T. Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), an m value of this magnitude suggests a significant exposure to the solvent of subK7G on denaturation. The denaturation curves for subK7I, subK7L, subK7V, and subK7W were determined in 5 mM MOPS-NaOH buffer, pH 7, in the presence or absence of 1.0 M NaCl. As shown in Fig. 3B, the denaturation process was virtually independent of the initial buffer conditions. In all cases, the [guanidine HCl] 50 values were found to be approximately 3 M (Table 3). These results, combined with those derived from the CD aggregation studies and size exclusion experiments described above, require a different analysis of the guanidine HCl denaturation curves for these peptides. If one assumes that the intrachain interactions or the orientation of given amino acid residues are determinant factors in the folding of these analogues, then the unfolding reaction should follow a two-state equilibrium model between folded and unfolded monomers: F U, with Ku = [U]/[F] = fu/(1 - fu)(26Merutka G. Lipton W. Shalongo W. Park S. Stellwagen E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7511-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ku represents the equilibrium constant for the unfolding process, and fu represents the molar fraction of unfolded peptide as determined from the ellipticity at 222 nm described above (similar Ku values were obtained using fu values generated from ellipticities at 217 nm). The free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (ΔGuH2O) was estimated in a similar manner by linear extrapolation of ΔGu at each guanidine HCl concentration to a final guanidine HCl concentration equal to zero (Table 3). The four analogues were found to have virtually identical stability. The thermal stability of melittin and its substitution analogues was investigated by monitoring the changes in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. In agreement with the above mentioned studies, the thermal behavior shows that the nine peptides can be separated into three different groups. The first group included those peptides that have a charged amino acid at position 7. The second group was made up of subK7A and subK7G; both showed salt-induced α-helical conformation but remained monomeric and unstructured at a high peptide concentration in NaCl-free buffer. Finally, the third group was made up of those peptides having a bulky hydrophobic amino acid at position 7, which did not fold either in high ionic strength or at high peptide concentration. Fig. 4 illustrates representative examples of the effect of temperature on the ellipticity at 222 nm for one peptide from each of these groups. For melittin, subK7D, and subK7E (first group of peptides), the CD spectral changes seen upon thermal denaturation in the presence of NaCl re"

SP, BPA3-SP, and BPA8-SP bind with high affinity (K A large majority of the known receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily (Baldwin, 1994). These receptors are characterized by the presence of seven hydrophobic regions of primary structure thought to represent transmembrane domains. The receptors lie in the bilayer such that the amino-terminal region of the protein is extracellular and the carboxyl-terminal region is cytoplasmic. The agonists which bind to and activate G-protein-coupled receptors vary widely in size, from glycoprotein hormones (>30 kDa) to single photons. The larger agonists (>10 kDa; e.g. thyroid stimulating hormone and follicle stimulating hormone) bind to the amino-terminal region of their G-protein-coupled receptors, while the smaller agonists (<0.2 kDa; e.g. norepinephrine, serotonin, and photons) bind within the plane of the bilayer between the seven transmembrane domains (Bockaert, 1991). Essentially all characterized receptors for bioactive peptides (0.5-5 kDa) are also members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, but which regions of their receptors interact with these agonists of intermediate size has not yet been defined.

SP belongs to the tachykinin peptide family which is characterized by a conserved COOH-terminal sequence -FXGLM-NH2, where X is an aromatic or aliphatic amino acid (Maggio, 1988). The SP receptor (also known as the neurokinin-1 or NK-1 receptor) has been cloned from several species including human, mouse, rat, and guinea pig and displays a very high degree of primary sequence homology across species (Gerard et al., 1993).

Chimeric and point-mutated SP receptors have been constructed to probe receptor structure-function in an attempt to identify binding domains for peptide agonists and nonpeptide antagonists as well as domains associated with agonist-stimulated second messenger responses (e.g. Cascieri et al., 1994; Fong et al., 1992a, 1992b, 1993, 1994a 1994b; Gether et al., 1993a, 1993b, 1993c, 1994; Huang et al., 1994a, 1994b; Jensen et al., 1994; Sachais et al., 1993; Yokota et al., 1992; Zoffmann et al., 1993). These studies have indicated that both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the SP receptor are important for the binding of agonist, and several specific residues conserved in all species examined have been identified as important for peptide binding. Analysis of SP analogs further suggested the COOH-terminal carboxyamide of SP may interact with residues in the second transmembrane domain (Huang et al., 1994b). However, the identification of a particular residue as necessary for agonist binding does not necessarily imply direct interaction of that side chain with agonist, as loss of function may instead result from changes in protein folding. Since the binding of SP (1350 Da) must involve a larger number of receptor/ligand contacts than small nonpeptide agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, 170 Da), it has not been possible to define the interaction of SP and its receptor by mutagenesis alone. Photoaffinity labeling has been proven to be a useful tool in identifying structural domains of receptors involved in ligand binding (e.g. Dohlman et al., 1991). This technique offers a unique approach by directly identifying the contact regions of a receptor and its ligands. As an essential complement to mutagenesis approaches, we have applied photoaffinity labeling to identify agonist peptide binding domains of the SP receptor. p-Benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (BPA), a photoreactive amino acid, has been used to replace amino acids in peptides for receptor photoaffinity labeling (Dorman and Prestwich, 1994). Photoactivated (triplet biradical) BPA reacts preferentially with C-H bonds but has low reactivity toward water; furthermore, the chromophore can be activated in the visible, avoiding protein-damaging UV wavelengths. In previous work by others (Boyd et al., 1991a, 1991b, 1994; Kage et al., 1993), an SP derivative containing BPA at position 8 and acylated with 3-(3-iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid at the side chain of Lys3 has been synthesized to study the SP receptor. Photolysis of this ligand with membrane-bound SP receptors from rat submaxillary gland led to about 70% incorporation of bound label into two polypeptides (46 and 53 kDa); enzymatic studies suggested that the smaller protein resulted from proteolysis of the larger (Kage et al., 1993). P388D1 cells, a nontransfected murine macrophage/monocyte cell line (Dawe and Potter, 1957), express a high density of functional SP receptors (Persico et al., 1988; Li et al., 1994) but no detectable levels of other tachykinin receptors. 2H.-P. Too and J. E. Maggio, unpublished results. The SP receptors of this cell line are coupled to Ca 2+ mobilization (Li et al., 1994). In the present study we have used two site-specific, high affinity photolabile analogs of SP (incorporating BPA in the third (BPA3) or eighth (BPA8) position) to label the SP receptor of P388D1 cells and map the peptide-binding domains of the receptor for each ligand. Racemic DL-BPA was synthesized and resolved into L- and D-BPA as described by Kauer et al.(1986). The resolved amino acid (or alternatively the racemic mixture) was treated directly with Fmoc-chloroformate (Aldrich) or Fmoc-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) to provide the protected amino acid (Fmoc-BPA) for solid-phase synthesis. Peptide synthesis of the SP analogs, BPA3-SP and BPA8-SP, was performed by our departmental Biopolymers Facility or by Quality Control Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA) using a standard Fmoc solid-phase synthetic strategy (Maggio et al., 1992). The crude synthetic peptide was then purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 column (Vydac 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) on a Waters Liquid Chromatographic System equipped with a variable wavelength UV detector. The column was eluted with a linear water-acetonitrile gradient (26-56% acetonitrile, 1%/3 min; 1.0 ml/min) containing 10 mM trifluoroacetic acid. The racemic peptide had two major UV active (254 nm) components of equal intensity. The L-BPA peptide was identified by elution position; that is, L-BPA8-SP (synthesized from Fmoc-L-BPA) showed only one UV active peak which was coincident with the earlier eluting HPLC peak of DL-BPA8-SP (synthesized from Fmoc-DL-BPA). Thus, the earlier HPLC peak corresponds to L-BPA8-SP and the later peak to D-BPA8-SP. In addition, Marfey's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanineamide) formed an adduct (Marfey, 1984) with isolated L-BPA that precedes that formed from D-BPA. When the L-BPA8-SP and D-BPA8-SP fractions were tested for receptor binding and biological activity, the earlier eluting peptide, i.e.L-BPA8-SP, was much more active than the later eluting D-BPA8 analog. By analogy to the greater activity of L-Phe8-SP relative to D-Phe8-SP (Fournier et al., 1982), this result further confirms that the first of the paired HPLC peaks is the L-BPA-isomer. The L-BPA diastereomer has also been shown to precede the D-BPA diastereomer of other peptides in reverse-phase HPLC elution (Shoelson et al., 1993). The isolated L-BPA8-SP was analyzed for purity and correct structure by amino acid analysis, laser desorption mass spectroscopy, and sequence. The peptide was sequentially Y 0.2 R 0.9 P 0.7 K 1.0 P 0.7 Q 1.0 Q 1.0 F 1.2 (BPA) G 1.0 L 1.0 M 0.8 with m/z 1616.2 ((M+H) +). Neither BPA or its phenylthiohydantoin derivative elute from the analyzer column under standard conditions (Kauer et al., 1986). Nevertheless, the high UV extinction coefficient of BPA at 254 nm, ∊ = 21 × 103, verifies that BPA is incorporated (Kauer et al., 1986), confirming the results of mass spectrometry. Tyrosine was partially destroyed under the hydrolysis conditions employed. The radioligand [ 125I]BPA8-SP ([ 125I]iodotyrosyl0-L-BPA8-SP) was formed using general peptide iodination techniques previously described (Too and Maggio, 1991). Typically 10 nmol of dry peptide was dissolved in 50 μl of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and vortexed with 1 mCi of Na 125I (10 μl, Amersham Corp.). Chloramine-T (10 μg in 10 μl of water) was added to activate iodine incorporation, and Na2S2O5 (100 μg in 10 μl of water) was added after 1 min of vortexing to quench the reaction. The mixture was diluted and acidified with 0.6 ml of 60 mM trifluoroacetic acid, and 25 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin was added to limit nonspecific adsorption. To separate the peptide from the unincorporated 125I, the mixture was then applied to an activated C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) and the iodide and peptide eluted with a series of 0.5-ml portions of 10 mM trifluoroacetic acid solutions of increasing alcohol (ethanol/methanol, 1:1) content, 10, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, and 100%. Unincorporated iodide elutes immediately, while the peptide is retained until the alcohol concentration reaches about 60%. The peptide fractions (containing both oxidized and reduced methionine), eluting with 60-90% alcohol, were pooled and reduced in volume under a nitrogen stream. After the addition of 20% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, the sample was heated at 90°C for 2 h to reduce methionine sulfoxide to its thioether. Further purification was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column as above. The eluate was collected in fractions during gradient elution and the fractions counted for radioactivity. The reduced (Met) and monoiodinated (Tyr) peptide eluted in a wellresolved peak (34.6% acetonitrile), predictably later than the original compound (33.2%) or the oxidized products, but prior to the diiodinated reduced peptide. The reduced monoiodinated tracer (specific activity ˜2000 Ci/mmol; 1Ci = 37 GBq) was protected from oxidation by 0.5%β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) added immediately after purification and stored at −20°C until use. Radioiodinated BPA3-SP was prepared similarly. The murine cell line P388D1 (Dawe and Potter, 1957; Persico et al., 1988) was a gift of Dr. J. Jackie (Harvard Medical School) and has been maintained in our laboratory in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). P388D1 cells were cultured on 12-mm diameter round glass coverslips that had been pretreated with laminin. These were used within 24-48 h after plating. Dye loading was achieved by exposing the cells to fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester at a concentration of 8 μM for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with 2% bovine serum albumin and kept on ice until used. Experiments were performed using a standard saline buffer with the following components: NaCl 120 mM, KCl 4.2 mM, CaCl2 2.5 mM, MgSO4 1.0 mM, Na2HPO4 1.0 mM, glucose 12 mM, and HEPES 10 mM, pH 7.40. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Nikon microscope optically linked to a PTI Deltascan instrument (Photon Technologies) that produces dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Emitted light was collected after passing though a 510-nm band pass filter. A 40X Nikon fluor objective was used and the field was limited to about 15-20 cells for data collection. P388D1 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were inoculated on FCS precoated 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The confluent cells ( ˜1 × 106 cells/well) were washed twice (0.5 ml/well) with ice-cold buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) and incubated with 0.5 ml of buffer on ice for at least 10 min. Then radioactive ligand, in the presence or absence of unlabeled displacers, was added to a final concentration of 150 pM ( ˜5 × 105 cpm/ml) and incubated for 2 h. Nonspecific binding is defined as binding in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled SP. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml/well phosphate-buffered saline (104 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2), then solubilized by 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) for 20 min and transferred for gamma counting. Unlabeled SP and CP-96345 were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dimethyl sulfoxide at less than 3% (v/v) had no detectable effects on the binding assay. Cells (5 × 106) were inoculated on FCS-pretreated dishes (60 mm) and grown for at least 12 h before labeling. The cultured cells ( ˜1 × 107) were washed twice (5 ml) with ice-cold buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) and incubated with 5 ml of buffer on ice for at least 10 min. The photolabile radioligand, in the presence or absence of unlabeled displacers, was added to a final concentration of 2 nM ( ˜6 × 106 cpm/ml) and incubated 2 h. The dishes were then irradiated on ice for 15 min using a focused HBO 100-watt mercury short arc lamp through an optical filter to eliminate light below 310 nm. A second filter removed infrared wavelengths to minimize sample heating during photolysis. After photolysis, the cells were washed twice (5 ml) with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube to collect cell pellets by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and hypotonically lysed for 30 min at room temperature. Then the samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to remove debris. The resulting supernatants were sedimented at 16,000 × g for 30 min and the membrane pellets stored at −20°C until analysis. The presence or absence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (bacitracin, chymostatin, and leupeptin) did not affect the results of binding or photolysis experiments. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as described by Laemmli(1970) using 1.5-mm 8% gels. The labeled cell membranes were solubilized in 1 × SDS sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.025% bromphenyl blue, 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 30 min at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gel was directly dried on a filter paper and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5) with an intensifying screen (DuPont). The labeled bands were isolated from the preparative gel using a passive elution protocol similar to that described by Blanton and Cohen(1994). After autoradiography, radioactive bands of the labeled complex were excised from dried gels and rehydrated with extraction buffer (0.1% SDS, 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8). The gel slices were macerated and eluted for 1-4 days with extraction buffer. The eluted protein was filtered (Whatman No. 1) and concentrated using Centriprep-10 or Centricon-10 (Amicon). Finally, the labeled complex was precipitated by cold acetone (85-90%, v/v) overnight at −20°C. The precipitate was dried and stored at −20°C until use. For all electrophoretic gels, the ratio of bis-acrylamide to acrylamide was 3%. For gels above 12% acrylamide, 1% glycerol was added to the running buffer to prevent cracking of gels during drying. The acetone precipitate was resuspended in 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% N-octylglucoside, 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and then digested with Flavobacterium meningosepticum endoglycosidase F (Endo F) (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 days at room temperature. The acetone precipitate was resuspended in 0.1% SDS, 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and then digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (V8) (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2-4 days at room temperature or L-1-tosyl-amido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin (Sigma) for 1-4 days at room temperature. Both BPA3-SP and BPA8-SP completely resist cleavage by these proteases under these conditions (not shown) as both ligands lack glutamic acids residues, and basic residues are protected by adjacent prolines (Fig. 1). The V8-digested samples were loaded into a Vydac C8 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) and eluted with increasing solvent B (0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol) in solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The elution of 125I-labeled SPR fragments was monitored by gamma counting of the fractions. More than 90% of injected radioactivity was recovered in the eluate for all HPLC experiments. The HPLC fractions were dried and resuspended in 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 25 mM and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 50°C, then DTNB (final concentration 75 mM) was added and allowed to react with the peptide for at least 30 min. The mixture was then diluted with 20% solvent B and loaded onto reverse-phase-HPLC as described. Both BPA3-SP and BPA8-SP (Fig. 1) are full and potent agonists relative to SP for the calcium responses of P388D1 cells. This action is completely blocked by CP-96345, a specific nonpeptide antagonist of the SP receptor (Fig. 2). Both photoreactive ligands bound to SPR (Table 1) with the same affinity (IC 50 values ˜3 nM) as SP and the binding of each was similarly inhibited by CP-96345 (IC 50 values ˜35 nM).Tabled 1 After photoinsertion of radioiodinated BPA3-SP or BPA8-SP bound to P388D1 cells, two radioactive bands were observed on SDS-PAGE. A major broad band of 75 kDa accounted for about 95% of the radioactivity, while a minor band of 205 kDa accounted for about 5% (Fig. 3). Labeling of both bands was completely inhibited by SP (Fig. 3) or CP-96345 (not shown). For BPA8-SP, 46 ± 3% of bound ligand is recovered in the broad 75 kDa band; for BPA3-SP, the major band represents about 6% of the total bound radioactivity. For both ligands, deglycosylation with Endo F shifted the broad major band to a sharp band of 42 kDa (Fig. 4), indistinguishable from the molecular mass of the murine SPR calculated from its cDNA sequence (Sundelin et al., 1992). The major band labeled by both photoprobes was partially purified by preparative SDS-PAGE and used for further studies. Incubation of cells with the photoprobes in the dark resulted in no detectable incorporation into protein.Figure 4:Autoradiography of Endo F deglycosylated photolabeled SP receptor following SDS-PAGE (12% gel). Acetone-precipitated 125I-labeled SPR (5000-8000 cpm) from preparative SDS-PAGE was dissolved in 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% N-octylglycoside, 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and digested by Endo F (0.8 unit) for 2 days at room temperature. The gel was directly dried without fixation or staining prior to autoradiography. Lanes 1 and 2, [ 125I]BPA8-SP-labeled SPR; lanes 3 and 4, [ 125I]BPA3-SP-labeled SPR.

Molecular weights indicated are at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) V8 protease (Glu-C) cleaves proteins specifically at the COOH-terminal side of glutamate residues under the conditions employed. V8 digestion of partially purified [ 125I]BPA8-SP-labeled SPR showed five detected bands (33, 25, 19, 9, and 3.2 kDa). The larger proteolytic fragments were converted into the smaller ones at higher concentration of V8 protease, with the smallest fragment, designated BPA8-SPR-3.2k, being the limit digest (Fig. 5A). Double digestion of [ 125I]BPA8-SP-labeled SPR with Endo F and V8 protease revealed the same five-band pattern seen with V8 digestion alone. Peptide fragments from V8 digestion of [ 125I]BPA8-SPlabeled SPR were isolated by HPLC (Fig. 6A). One major peak ( ˜33% solvent B), accounting for most of the eluted radioactivity, corresponded to BPA8-SPR-3.2k (Fig. 6B). BPA8-SPR-3.2k and BPA8-SP tracer eluted in a similar position on reverse-phase HPLC but were cleanly resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B). A second peak of radioactivity eluting from the HPLC column, accounting for most of the recovered radioiodine not in BPA8-SPR-3.2k, corresponded to BPA8-SPR-9k. Further digestion of BPA8-SPR-9k with V8 protease converted this fragment to BPA8-SPR-3.2k (not shown). BPA8-SPR-3.2k, the limit digest, was reacted with DTNB, a specific sulfhydryl modification reagent which converts free peptidyl -SH groups to mixed disulfides of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid. Treatment of BPA8-SPR-3.2k with DTNB shifted the HPLC elution position of the peptide to later elution by 3.2% solvent B (Fig. 6C). A parallel sample incubated identically but without DTNB showed no change in elution position. V8 digests of SPR photolabeled with [ 125I]BPA3-SP displayed a different pattern of proteolytic fragments than digests of SPR photolabeled with [ 125I]BPA8-SP (Fig. 5). A major fragment of 40 kDa (BPA3-SPR-40k) was detected under conditions which reduced SPR photolabeled with [ 125I]BPA8-SP to peptides of less than 10 kDa. Very high concentrations of V8 produced, in addition to the major band at 40 kDa, minor bands at about 3 and 10 kDa. Endo F digestion of BPA3-SPR-40k produced a 3.5-kDa fragment, BPA3-SPR-3.5k. The same fragment was produced by double digestion with Endo F and V8 protease of SPR photolabeled with [ 125I]BPA3-SP. V8 protease-digested fragments of [ 125I]BPA3-SP-labeled SPR were separated by HPLC. A major peak containing >70% of eluted radioactivity passed through without being retarded by the reverse-phase column. These fractions were dried, digested with Endo F, and reanalyzed by HPLC. The Endo F-treated sample (BPA3-SPR-3.5k) was retained by the HPLC column and eluted at 30% solvent B (Fig. 7). BPA3-SPR-3.5k and BPA3-SP were separable by HPLC. A control sample (identically treated in the absence of Endo F) still passed through the HPLC column without retention. Double digestion of [ 125I]BPA8-SP-labeled SPR with Endo F and trypsin revealed the same pattern of radioactive fragments as seen with trypsin digestion alone. However, double digestion (with Endo F and trypsin) of [ 125I]BPA3-SP-labeled SPR produced a different pattern of fragments than that seen with trypsin treatment alone. As seen with Endo F and V8, digestion of the major high molecular mass (>45 kDa) tryptic fragment of [ 125I]BPA3-SP-labeled SPR with Endo F converted it to a much smaller fragment. Replacement of amino acid residues at the third (Lys3) or eighth (Phe8) positions of SP by BPA and addition of Tyr at the NH2-terminal (Tyr0) gave analogs (Fig. 1) which triggered calcium responses of P388D1 cells (Fig. 2) with the same potency as the parent peptide. The calcium response was inhibited by CP-96345, a specific SPR antagonist. Binding of 125I-labeled BPA8-SP and BPA3-SP to P388D1 cells was blocked by cold SP and CP-96345 at nM concentrations (Table 1). The two photolabile ligands thus are high affinity full agonists of the SPR of P388D1 cells. Previous studies showed that Phe8 of SP could be structurally modified without a marked decease in activity on affinity on several bioassays (Lee et al., 1983; Maggio, 1988; Viger et al., 1983). Boyd et al. (1991a, 1991b) have demonstrated that replacement of Phe8 of SP by BPA is well tolerated in binding affinity and biological activity. The results of the present study illustrate that substitution of Lys3 of SP with BPA also maintains biological activity and binding affinity at the SPR of murine P388D1 cells. To facilitate radioiodination, we added a tyrosine at the NH2 terminus of the peptide; the Tyr0 peptides also retain full biological activity and binding affinity (Sachais et al., 1993; Cascieri et al., 1994). Upon near UV irradiation (>310 nm), 125I-labeled BPA8-SP and BPA3-SP are photoincorporated into a major broad radiolabeled band of ˜75 kDa in P388D1 cells (Fig. 3). The broad range of molecular mass reflects heterogeneous glycosylation, as Endo F treatment dramatically converted the broad 75 kDa band to a sharp one of ˜42 kDa (Fig. 4). This size is consistent with the value deduced from the cDNA sequence for the mouse SPR (Sundelin et al., 1992). The sensitivity of photolabeling with these ligands to SP and CP-96345 (Table 1, Fig. 3) further indicated that BPA8-SP and BPA3-SP were cross-linked with the SPR. This intact cell-photolabeling technique demonstrates that the SPR expressed in this natural (i.e. nontransfected) cell line is highly glycosylated. Reports of photolabeling of SPR prepared from various other sources suggests a heterogeneity of molecular size. Dam et al.(1987), using a photoreactive SP analog in which Phe8 was replaced by p-azidophenylalanine, demonstrated specific photolabeling of a single polypeptide, ˜46 kDa, in a rat brain membrane preparation. Boyd et al.(1994) reported that the molecular mass of SPR in rat tissues labeled with 125I-3-(3-iodophenyl-4-hydroxylphenyl)propionyl- ∊-Lys3-BPA8-SP varied from 53 and 46 kDa for submaxillary or parotid gland to 72 kDa for large intestine and 90 kDa for striatum or olfactory bulb. Deglycosylation of each of these photolabeled receptors from different tissues yielded a discrete radiolabeled band of ˜46 kDa, while in salivary gland an additional band at ˜36 kDa was also observed. Limited V8 digestion of [ 125I]BPA8-SP-labeled SPR implies that the smallest labeled complex, BPA8-SPR-3.2k, represents the interaction site of the ligand and receptor, as all other fragments are converted to the 3.2-kDa fragment at high concentrations of protease. Since BPA8-SP has a molecular mass of ˜1.7 kDa, a SPR V8 fragment peptide with molecular mass of ˜1.5 kDa is involved in the BPA8-SPR-3.2k complex. DTNB reaction indicates that this peptide contains a cysteine residue. The V8 digestion map of the mouse SPR deduced from its cDNA sequence shows only four cysteine-containing peptides, with values of 10.7 kDa (SPR 79-172, 2 Cys), 1.3 kDa (SPR 173-183, 1 Cys), 3.8 kDa (SPR 194-227), 1 Cys), and 11.1 kDa (SPR 239-312, 6 Cys). The two larger fragments (Mr > 10 kDa) are excluded based on their molecular masses. Of the remaining two, the smaller (1.3 kDa) is clearly a much better candidate than the larger (3.8 kDa) for the ˜1.5-kDa fragment deduced from the V8 digestion studies. Consistent with the size prediction, HPLC elution behavior confirms that SPR 173-183 (1.3 kDa) is the photolabeled receptor fragment. SPR 173-183 is a part of the relatively polar second extracellular domain of the SPR (between transmembrane domain (TM) IV and TMV), with a hydrophobic index (Engelman et al., 1986) of −1.8. The addition of such a fragment to BPA8-SP (hydrophobic index −15.1) would have little effect on HPLC elution position, as is observed experimentally (Fig. 6). Both the tracer alone, and its photoadduct with the receptor fragment, elute as sharp peaks at the same ( ˜33% solvent B) position in the solvent gradient. In sharp contrast, SPR 194-227 ( ˜3.8 kDa) is comprised mainly of the very hydrophobic TMV region of the receptor and has a hydrophobic index of 35. Hydrophobic peptides elute from reverse-phase HPLC columns as relatively broad peaks at very high solvent concentrations. For example, a photolabeled transmembrane domain (α-M4, residues 401-428, hydrophobic index = 36.9) from the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, with very similar molecular weight and amino acid composition to SPR 194-227, elutes in a very broad peak at about 74% solvent B in the same HPLC system (Blanton and Cohen, 1994). Such behavior is inconsistent with the reverse-phase-HPLC elution of BPA8-SPR-3.2k (Fig. 6). Thus, molecular weight, HPLC elution behavior, and presence of cysteine, taken together, establish that the SPR region photolabeled by BPA8-SP is SPR 173-183 of the second extracellular loop, whose primary sequence is TMPSRVVCMIE. Using a different SP tracer containing BPA at position 8, Boyd et al.(1993) also found labeling of the second extracellular loop of rat SPR in transfected hamster cells, a finding consistent with the present results. Because the radiolabel in these probes is located at a site distinct from the photoreactive amino acid, radiochemical sequencing cannot be used to define the specific amino acid of the SPR labeled by BPA. Limited V8 digestion of [ 125I]BPA3-SP-labeled SPR suggested that the glycosylated peptide complex, BPA3-SPR-40k, represents the interaction site of the ligand and receptor because Endo F plus V8 mixed digestion shifted the 40-kDa complex to a much smaller fragment, BPA3-SPR-3.5k. This is further confirmed by HPLC analysis. BPA3-SPR-40k passed though the reverse-phase column in the void volume, behavior common to very polar biopolymers such as carbohydrates. Deglycosylation of BPA3-SPR-40k converted the complex to a smaller peptide ( ˜3.5 kDa) which was retained by the reverse-phase column and eluted by the solvent gradient at about 30% solvent B. There are two potential sites (N-X-S/T) for N-linked glycosylation in the SP receptor. Both are located in the NH2-terminal extracellular tail of the receptor, based both on primary sequence (Sundelin et al., 1992) and experimental results (Boyd et al., 1991b, 1994). The V8 digestion map of the murine SPR indicated that NH2-terminal peptide (SPR 1-21, ˜2.3 kDa) contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, while all other fragments have none. The hydrophobicity index of this (deglycosylated) peptide is −27.3, which predicts that the deglycosylated receptor fragment cross-linked with BPA3-SP would elute earlier than the free photoprobe. Consistent with this prediction, the complex does elute earlier in the solvent gradient than [ 125I]BPA3-SP. Thus, molecular size of the complex, the presence of carbohydrate, and HPLC elution behavior, taken together, establish that the NH2-terminal extracellular tail of the receptor (SPR 1-21, whose primary sequence is MDNVLPVDSDLFPNTSTNTSE) is the insertion site of [ 125I]BPA3-SP. Photoaffinity labeling identifies receptor domains in close proximity to the bound photoligand. Another approach to receptor-ligand interactions, site-directed mutagenesis, identifies domains necessary for function, but which are not necessarily proximal to the site of that function. Chimeras of the substance P receptor with other tachykinin receptors (e.g. substance K receptor) demonstrated the agonist ligand specificity of the tachykinin receptors is mainly determined by the region around TMII TMIV and also partly by the extracellular NH2-terminal domain of the receptors (Yoshifumi et al., 1992). Fong et al. (1992b) found that extracellular domains of SPR (also known as NK-1R), including a segment of NH2-terminal tail and the first extracellular loop were essential for high affinity binding of agonist peptides. Furthermore, they identified several residues in the NH2-terminal domain (Asn 23, Gln 24, and Phe 25), first extracellular (also known as E2) loop (Asn 96, His 108), and part of second extracellular (also known as E3) loop (Ser 176-Glu 83) which are required for high affinity binding of peptides (Fong et al., 1992a). Other mutagenesis studies demonstrated that residues in TMII (Asn 85, Asn 89, Tyr 92) and TMVII (Tyr 287) are also required for high affinity binding of peptide agonists (Huang et al., 1994b). Analysis of SP analogs further suggested the COOH-terminal carboxyamide of SP may interact with Asn 85 in the second transmembrane domain (Huang et al., 1994b). Taken together, these data demonstrate that both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of SPR are important for the peptide binding. The present studies identify the interaction sites of the third (BPA3) and eighth (BPA8) positions of SP as (i.e. BPA3 and BPA8 contact and photolabel) the NH2-terminal extracellular tail (SPR 1-21) and the second extracellular loop (SPR 173-183) of the receptor, respectively. The results of the present photolabeling experiments and those of previous mutagenesis experiments are distinct, in that the different regions of the SPR are identified, but not inconsistent. The photolabeling results do not match the predictions of a graphics-computer-generated model (Trumpp-Kallmeyer et al., 1994) of SP bound to its receptor. Combining the present results with those of previous mutagenesis studies, a model of the agonist peptide-binding site of the SPR can be constructed (Fig. 8). In this model, the COOH-terminal hydrophobic sequence -GLM-NH2 of SP inserts into a hydrophobic ligand binding pocket between the transmembrane domains and between the extracellular surface and center of the bilayer. This binding pocket is formed by TMII and TMVII with contributions from other transmembrane domains. The carboxyamide penetrates to the level of and interacts with Asn 85 (Huang et al., 1994b). Other than this COOH-terminal tail, the remainder of the SP molecule interacts with amino acids on the extracellular face on the receptor. Specifically, position 8 of SP interacts with the second extracellular loop (SPR 173-183) and position 3 of SP with the NH2-terminal extracellular tail (SPR 1-21). These regions of the SPR are highly conserved across species; 10 of 11 amino acids of SPR 173-183 and 18 of 21 amino acids of SPR 1-21 are invariant across the four mammalian species whose SPR cDNA sequences have been reported (Gerard et al., 1993). The binding site for specific, high affinity nonpeptide antagonists of the SPR is at a distinct location (Cascieri et al., 1994; Fong et al., 1992a, 1992b, 1993, 1994a, 1994b; Gether et al., 1993a, 1993b, 1993c, 1994; Huang et al., 1994a; Jensen et al., 1994; Sachais et al., 1993; Yokota et al., 1992; Zoffmann et al., 1993). Studies of other G-protein-coupled receptors have demonstrated that those which bind larger (>10 kDa) agonists have agonist-binding sites within their NH2-terminal extracellular domains. In contrast, receptors of this superfamily which bind smaller (<0.5 kDa) nonpeptide agonists have agonist-binding sites deep within the bilayer between the transmembrane domains (Bockaert, 1991; Dohlman et al., 1991). The smallest neuropeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (360 Da) apparently also binds within this same region (Perlman et al., 1994). Recently Gerszten et al.(1994) found that the specificity of thombin receptors for peptide agonists was determined by the extracellular face of the receptor. Substance P, a peptide agonist of intermediate size, apparently interacts with both the extracellular region and transmembrane region of its receptor. Thus, the regions of interaction between SP and its receptor include elements of both the large and small agonist-receptor systems. Other bioactive peptides among the dozens in this intermediate size range may similarly interact with both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of their own G-protein-coupled receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2006051351,"The Escherichia coli FadR protein regulates the transcription of many unlinked genes and operons encoding proteins required for fatty acid synthesis and degradation. Previously, we demonstrated that the ability of purified FadR to bind DNA in vitro is inhibited by long chain acyl coenzyme A esters (DiRusso, D. D., Heimert, T. L., and Metzger, A. K.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8685-8691). In the present work, we show that FadR binds acyl-CoA directly. Ligand binding resulted in a shift in the apparent pI of FadR from 6.9 to 6.2 and in a marked decrease in intrinsic fluorescence. The K m for FadR binding of oleoyl coenzyme A was determined to be 12.1 nM using the fluorescence quenching assay. The binding site for acyl-CoA was identified by selection of noninducible mutations in the FadR gene. One altered protein carrying the change Ser 219 to Asn (S219N) was purified and shown to have a reduced affinity for oleoyl coenzyme A as evidenced by a K m of 257 nM. S219N retained the ability to bind DNA and to repress or activate transcription. Alanine substitution of amino acid residues 215 through 230 identified Gly 216 and Trp 223 as also required specifically for induction. This region of FadR shares amino acid identities and similarities with the coenzyme A-binding site of Clostridium thermoaceticum CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase. Due to the alteration in binding affinity of the purified S219N protein, the non-inducible phenotype of several proteins carrying alanine substitutions and similarities to CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase we propose this region of FadR forms part of the acyl-CoA-binding domain. The Escherichia coli FadR protein regulates the transcription of many unlinked genes and operons encoding proteins required for fatty acid synthesis and degradation. Previously, we demonstrated that the ability of purified FadR to bind DNA in vitro is inhibited by long chain acyl coenzyme A esters (DiRusso, D. D., Heimert, T. L., and Metzger, A. K.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8685-8691). In the present work, we show that FadR binds acyl-CoA directly. Ligand binding resulted in a shift in the apparent pI of FadR from 6.9 to 6.2 and in a marked decrease in intrinsic fluorescence. The K m for FadR binding of oleoyl coenzyme A was determined to be 12.1 nM using the fluorescence quenching assay. The binding site for acyl-CoA was identified by selection of noninducible mutations in the FadR gene. One altered protein carrying the change Ser 219 to Asn (S219N) was purified and shown to have a reduced affinity for oleoyl coenzyme A as evidenced by a K m of 257 nM.

The Escherichia coli fadR gene product, FadR, plays a critical role in the regulation many genes required for fatty acid metabolism. Specifically FadR is a repressor of transcription of genes which are required for fatty acid transport and β-oxidation including fadL, fadD, fadE, fadBA, and fadH. FadR is an activator of transcription of the fabA gene which is required for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (reviewed in (1Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1210: 123-145Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Induction of FadR-dependent expression of the fatty acid degradative (fad) genes occurs upon growth of E. coli in medium containing long chain fatty acids (C14-C18). The same growth conditions result in an decrease in fabA expression. It has been demonstrated in vitro that FadR exerts its effect at the level of transcription by directly binding to DNA to repress the expression of the fad genes and to activate the expression of fabA(2DiRusso C.C.

Six FadR binding sites have been identified by footprinting analyses in the promoter regions of four FadR-responsive genes giving a consensus sequence which is 5′-AGCTGGTCCGAYNTGTT-3′(1Black P.N.

FadR-specific DNA binding in vitro is prevented by the addition of long chain acyl-CoA esters (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Medium chain acyl-CoA esters or free fatty acids do not prevent DNA binding(2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that long chain acyl-CoA esters are the effector molecules that regulate fatty acid metabolism at the level of FadR-dependent transcription in E. coli(2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this conclusion was based on an indirect measurement of FadR-acyl-CoA interaction using protein-DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The present study had two goals, to identify mutations in fadR which specifically altered effector binding and to demonstrate that long chain acyl-CoA esters bind directly to FadR and thereby mediate induction. The mutational analyses reported here selected fadR alleles that were non-inducible by long chain fatty acids but which maintained the ability to repress or activate transcription (termed super-repressors). Such mutants were expected to identify amino acid residues within FadR specifically required for induction. The experiments reported in this study show that 5 amino acid residues Gly 216, Glu 218, Ser 219, Trp 223, and Lys 228 near the carboxyl terminus of FadR were required for maximal levels of induction by long chain fatty acids. Additionally, we measured FadR-acyl-CoA binding directly by using isoeletric focusing and by quenching of intrinsic fluorescence. Our results demonstrated that purified FadR binds long chain acyl-CoA with high affinity and that the altered phenotype of the fadR allele S219N was correlated with a reduced affinity for long chain acyl-CoA in vitro. Due to amino acid similarities and identities between the region of FadR identified by this mutational analysis and the CoA-binding site of the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase (CODH) 1The abbreviation used is: CODHCO dehydrogenase/acetylcoenzyme A synthase. of Clostridium thermoaceticum identified by biochemical studies (6Morton T.A.

For growth of cells for biochemical assays, tryptone broth (TB, which contained 10 g of Difco bacto tryptone and 5 g of sodium chloride/liter) was used. When necessary to maintain plasmids antibiotics were added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml kanamycin, or 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The minimal medium used was medium E(10Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Fatty acids were provided at 5 mM in 0.5% Brij 58. Liquid cultures were grown at 37°C with shaking in a New Brunswick gyratory incubator. Bacterial growth was monitored in a Klett Summerson Colorimeter equipped with a blue filter. The plasmid pCD126 was constructed by cloning an 800-base pair HindIII-TaqI fragment carrying wild-type fadR into HindIII-ClaI restricted pACYC177(11Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For overexpression, S219N encoded within pRW22 was subcloned to pT7-5 by excision of a HindIII-XhoI fragment containing fadR, addition of an oligonucleotide linker to convert the XhoI site to a HindIII site, and insertion of the HindIII fragment into HindIII digested pT7-5 to generate pCD22. pCD126 DNA (50 μg) was incubated in 100 μl of 0.8 M hydroxylamine, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, at 37°C. Aliquots were removed at 24, 36, 48, and 96 h, ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 25 μl of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer. The mutagenized DNA was transformed into LS1085 and plated onto LB plates containing ampicillin, and then the transformed colonies were tested for growth on minimal plates containing oleate or decanoate. Two-thousand colonies were screened and three were identified as putative non-inducible super-repressors by an inability to grow on minimal media containing oleate or decanoate (ole - dec -) and by non-inducible levels of in vivo β-oxidation as compared with the same strain carrying pACYC177 or pCD126. Specific amino acid substitutions in fadR were constructed using the Altered Sites System (Promega). A 4-kilobase pair HinDIII fragment encoding FadR was subcloned from pCD103 (previously called pACfadR3(12DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to pSELECT-1 to generate pCD152. fadR-specific oligonucleotides (24-27 bases in length) were synthesized carrying an alanine codon substitution in place of the amino acid of interest. Mutagenesis was carried out according to the manufacturer. Mutations were identified by sequencing. For analysis of the mutant proteins, a HinDIII-BamHI fragment was removed from the pCD152 derivative and subcloned to pACYC177. Wild-type and S219N FadR proteins were overexpressed and purified as previously detailed(2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity of wild-type or mutant FadR for OB was assessed using the 377-base pair DNA fragment carrying the fadB promoter obtained from pCD154 after treatment with HinDIII and EcoRI. The DNA-protein gel shift assay was performed as previously detailed(2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of β-oxidation in whole cells was measured as the release of [14C]CO2 from 1-[14C]oleate after growth in TB using 5 mM oleate as described in Simons et al.(13Simons R.W. Eagan P.A. Chute H.T. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 726-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the assay of β-galactosidase activity in strains carrying fadB-lacZ or fabA-lacZ, cells were grown in 10 ml of TB to mid-log phase, rinsed twice with Z buffer, resuspended to 5 × 108 cells/ml, and lysed by sonication. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed immediately using o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate as described by Miller(10Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Specific activities were calculated using a value of 1.25 μg of protein/Klett unit. The fadR allele encoded within pRW22 was sequenced in its entirety across both DNA strands by the dideoxy chain-terminating method using 10 fadR-specific primers, each 17 nucleotides in length. The double-stranded DNA (2-5 μg) was denatured by incubation for 15 min in 20 μl of 0.2 N NaOH and 0.5 mM EDTA. The solution was neutralized by the addition of 5 μl of 5 M sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and DNA was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of ethanol. The DNA was centrifuged, rinsed, dried, and sequenced using Sequenase and a reagent kit purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland OH). Mutants generated using the Altered Site system were sequenced using a fadR primer which read across a 250-base pair region which included the site of the mutation which had been introduced. The isoelectric point of native FadR or FadR complexed with acyl-CoA was determined by electrophoresis at 10°C on pH 3-10 isoelectric focusing gels (Isolab, Inc.) using a Hoeffer HE950 flatbed apparatus. Five μl of 4.5 μM FadR in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol was applied one-quarter of the distance of the gel from the cathode. The sample was electrophoresed for 10 min at 1 watt constant power, the sample template was removed, and electrophoresis continued for 1 h at 10 watts constant power. The gels were fixed in glutaraldehyde, dried, and the protein detected by staining with silver nitrate as recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence studies were performed with an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer according to the principles given by Ward(15Ward L.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Emission spectra from 290 to 400 nm were recorded at room temperature in a stirred cuvette containing purified FadR (0.12 μM in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) with excitation at 285 nm, a band pass of 8 nm, and step size of 1. There were no corrections made for inner filter effect. To estimate FadR-acyl-CoA binding, we measured the relative decrease of intrinsic fluorescence of purified FadR upon addition of long chain acyl-CoA compounds by titrating acyl-CoA and scanning the protein at approximately 10-min intervals. The quenching of fluorescence occurred rapidly and was stable for at least 1 h as determined using multiple scans of the same sample. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA Polymerase, Klenow DNA polymerase, and Sequenase V.2 were purchased from U. S. Biochemicals Inc. [α- 32P]dATP and 1-[14C]oleate (57 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Plasmid pCD126 encoding wild-type FadR was treated with hydroxylamine in vitro and then used to transform the fadR strain LS1085. Transformants were selected on rich media containing ampicillin and were subsequently tested for the ability to grow on minimal media containing oleate (C 18:1) or decanoate (C 10:0) as sole carbon and energy source. Approximately 1.5% of the colonies were able to grow on both oleate and decanoate which is the usual phenotype of fadR strains. Most of the transformants appeared to be wild-type since they were able to grow on media containing oleate but not decanoate (fadR +). This is because long chain fatty acids but not medium chain fatty acids induce FadR and allow expression of the fad genes which encode proteins required for fatty acid transport and degradation by β-oxidation. Three isolates were unable to grow on media containing either fatty acid (fadRS). Plasmids isolated from these strains retransformed the ole - dec - phenotype. However, two gave mixed phenotypes upon retransformation and were not stable to propagation. Only one of these plasmids identified after hydroxylamine mutagenesis, pRW22, has proven stable to propagation and allowed subsequent analysis. It is possible that the production of the mutant FadR proteins encoded by the unstable isolates was toxic. To assess inducibility, plasmid DNA was transformed into strain LS1346 (fadR) and in vivo rates of β-oxidation were measured after growth under inducing (TBO, tryptone broth containing 5 mM oleate) or non-inducing conditions (TB, tryptone broth). These results, presented in Table 1, demonstrated that FadR encoded within pRW22 resulted in very low levels of β-oxidation, which were induced 2-3-fold as compared with 18-fold for wild-type FadR. These low levels of in vivo β-oxidation were correlated with the inability of E. coli cells harboring pRW22 to use long chain fatty acids as a carbon and energy source. The fadR allele encoded within pRW22 was sequenced in its entirety across both strands. A single amino acid substitution of serine at position 219 for asparagine (S219N) resulted from a codon change of AGT to AAT.Tabled 1 FadR acts as both a repressor of genes encoding proteins required for growth on fatty acids and as an activator of at least one gene required for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, therefore we tested the ability of S219N to repress or activate transcription from a lacZ reporter. β-Galactosidase activities were measured in LS1346 which is fadR fadB-lacZ and LS1348 which is fadR fabA-lacZ(3DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Basal and induced levels of β-galactosidase of strain LS1346 transformed with the vector pACYC177 were 8-fold higher than those obtained for the same strain transformed with wild-type FadR grown under non-inducing conditions. LS1346 transformed with pCD126 encoding wild-type FadR and grown under inducing conditions had levels four times the same strain grown under non-inducing conditions, showing the usual pattern of induction for wild-type fadR. In contrast, transformants of pRW22 encoding S219N had very low levels of β-galactosidase whether grown under inducing or non-inducing conditions. β-Galactosidase activities for LS1348 (fadR fabA-lacZ) transformed with wild-type or S219N were 14- and 10-fold higher, respectively, than control cells. Addition of oleate to the growth medium caused a 50% reduction in activity for LS1348 transformed with pCD126 (wild-type FadR) as compared with an 11% reduction for cells transformed with pRW22 (S219N). Therefore, S219N retained the ability to bind DNA and to repress or activate transcription. However, the change in activity with regard to repression or activation in response to long chain fatty acids in the growth medium was reduced for S219N as compared with wild-type FadR. There are at least three mechanisms through which S219N could result in the non-inducible phenotype: (i) an increased ability to bind DNA; (ii) a decreased ability to bind acyl-CoA; or (iii) an inability of the altered protein to undergo the allosteric transition which results in a conformation unfavorable for DNA binding. To distinguish between these possibilities, we overexpressed and purified S219N using the T7 expression system as previously detailed for wild-type FadR(2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was tested for the ability to bind DNA containing the FadR-binding site within fadB (OB) using the DNA-protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay (gel shift) (detailed in (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of wild-type FadR for DNA containing OB was 3 ± 1 × 10 -10 and the affinity of S219N was 5 ± 2 × 10 -10 (Fig. 1). Therefore, increased DNA binding did not appear to account for the non-inducible phenotype. We also tested whether acyl-CoA would prevent DNA binding. In these experiments 5 nM FadR was mixed with varying concentrations of C 18:1-CoA and 1 × 10 -12 [ 32P]OB DNA. DNA bound by FadR was separated and detected from unbound DNA on standard 5% native gels (Fig. 2). These experiments showed that the apparent Ki for inhibition of DNA binding by C 18:1-CoA was 10-fold higher for S219N than for wild-type FadR. A similar change in apparent Ki was determined for C 16:0-CoA. While there was a change in apparent Ki of FadR-specific DNA binding by long chain acyl-CoA compounds assayed using gel shift assays, this method was an indirect measure of FadR-acyl-CoA interaction. To directly evaluate binding, two methods were employed, isoelectric focusing and quenching of intrinsic fluorescence. A change in the apparent isoelectric point upon binding the substrate myristoyl-CoA was previously demonstrated for N-myristoyl-CoA-acyl-transferase(16Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Adams S.P. Ropson I.J. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the apparent change in isoelectric point occurs as a result of surface charge redistribution upon ligand binding to the native protein. The pI of FadR was determined to be 6.9 by displaying the purified protein on isoelectric focusing gels with a pH range of 3 to 10. Upon addition of long chain acyl-CoA the apparent pI shifts to 6.2 (Fig. 3). The shift in pI did not occur upon addition of C 10-CoA, CoA, or long chain fatty acid (Fig. 3). This follows the same pattern of induction of β-oxidation and fad gene activity observed in in vivo studies and the pattern observed for inhibition of DNA binding using the gel shift assay whereby induction was shown to be specific for long chain fatty acids and DNA binding was specifically prevented by the long chain acyl-coenzyme derivatives. When purified S219N was mixed with acyl-CoA under the same conditions a partial shift of the protein was noted only at the highest concentrations tested (10-fold molar excess of ligand over protein) (Fig. 3). In order to estimate the affinity constant of FadR-acyl-CoA binding, we measured quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of purified protein upon addition of long chain acyl-CoA. Purified FadR (0.12 μM) was excited at 285 nm and an emission spectrum was recorded from 290 to 400 nm. There was no discernable difference in the spectra observed for wild-type or S219N proteins without added ligand. Upon addition of C 18:1-CoA there was a marked decrease in observed fluorescence for wild-type FadR (Fig. 4A). When C 10-CoA was added to a solution containing FadR there was a small decrease in intrinsic fluorescence (approximately 10% at 1 μM C 10-CoA) which could not be used to determine an affinity constant for either the wild-type or mutant proteins. The decrease in intrinsic fluorescence for C 18:0-CoA was used to quantitate FadR-acyl-CoA binding affinity by titration of FadR with acyl-CoA. The data were analyzed using the program Hypero(17Cleland W.W. Methods. Emzymol. 1976; 63: 103-148Crossref Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), and an apparent Km for C 18:1-CoA was determined to be 12.1 ± 4.8 nM for wild-type and 257 ± 67 nM for S219N. These results obtained for S219N upon addition of long chain acyl-CoA esters supports the conclusion that the non-inducible phenotype was due to reduced affinity for these ligands. Assuming Ser 219 is part of the acyl-CoA binding pocket within FadR, then there are expected to be amino acid identities and structural similarities with other proteins which bind the same or related ligands. Since FadR induction and ligand binding are specific for long chain acyl-CoA esters (C14 or greater), the binding pocket is expected to distinguish both acyl chain length and the coenzyme A moiety, most likely through hydrophobic contacts with the acyl tail and charged residues within the CoA-binding domain. Upon comparison of this region of FadR with proteins which bind acyl-CoA, fatty acids or coenzyme A (using TFASTA and BLAST as well as through literature searching), there was only one protein for which we could detect significant similarities, the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase (CODH) of C. thermoaceticum.(6Morton T.A. Runquist J.A. Ragsdale S.W. Shanmugasundaram T. Wood H. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23824-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously determined that tryptophan residue 418 of CODH was specifically protected from modification with 2,4-dinitrophenol sulfenylchloride by CoA(6Morton T.A. Runquist J.A. Ragsdale S.W. Shanmugasundaram T. Wood H. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23824-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 28: 7112-7116Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A comparison was made between amino acid residues adjacent to and including Ser 219 of FadR and the region of CODH protected from modification by CoA (Fig. 5). We observed that there are 6 amino acid identities and four conservative substitutions (allowing a 1 amino acid gap in FadR) between the regions encompassing Ser 219 through Arg 239 in FadR and Tyr 413 through Ile 425 in CODH. Trp 418 of CODH, which was identified by 2,4-dinitrophenol sulfenylchloride modification, was among the amino acid identities. These similarities between FadR and CODH suggested that this region of FadR may form all or a portion of the binding site for the CoA moiety of the inducing ligand. To test the contribution of amino acid residues found within the region of FadR which appeared homologous to CODH to induction of FadR by acyl-CoA, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids 215 through 230 to substitute alanine for the native amino acid. The FadR alleles carrying amino acid substitutions were classified by their relative ability to confer inducible levels of β-oxidation to the fadR strain LS1346. Individual transformants were grown in TB media or TB media containing 5 mM C 18:1 (TBO) and in vivo β-oxidation of 1-[14C]C 18:1 was measured. For each experiment, cells transformed with pACYC177 (vector), pCD126 (FadR +), and pRW22 (S219N) were included as controls. The results are presented in Table 2. Cells carrying FadR with substitutions of alanine for His 427, Glu 221, Ile 222, His 224, Arg 225, and Met 226 had fully inducible levels of β-oxidation and were classified as wild-type. Alteration of Leu 230 resulted in slightly elevated basal levels of activity as compared with fadR +, however transformants of LS1346 carrying the plasmid encoding L230A were not able to grow on minimal media containing decanoate as a carbon source so this allele was also classified as wild-type. Substitutions of alanine for amino acid residues Tyr 215, Gly 220, Gln 227, and Asn 229 appeared to eliminate FadR function as indicated by the constitutive levels of β-oxidation. Substitutions of alanine for Gly 216 and Trp 223 yielded a strong non-inducible, super-repressor phenotype which was comparable to S219N. LS1346 transformed with plasmid encoding G216A or W223A were not able to grow on media containing long chain fatty acids. A final group of alanine substitutions had induction levels intermediate to wild-type and S219N. These included Glu 218, Ser 219, and Lys 228. Growth on minimal medium containing long chain fatty acids was slowed for cells transformed with plasmids encoding FadR carrying alanine substitutions for these 3 amino acids as compared to wild-type FadR (4 days as compared to 2 days for wild-type FadR). Therefore, these three alleles were designated Weak S to reflect growth and biochemical phenotypes which were intermediate to wild-type and S219N.Tabled 1 In these experiments, we used a genetic approach to identify mutations in FadR which resulted in a non-inducible, super-repressor phenotype. Three other FadR alleles which conferred a super-repressor phenotype were previously identified by Hughes et al.(18Hughes K.T. Simons R.W. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1666-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the amino acid alterations in those super-repressors encoded within the bacterial chromosome were not defined. The experiments detailed here have identified a region in the carboxyl terminus of FadR which is likely to constitute in part the acyl-CoA binding pocket for this transcriptional regulator. It is expected that binding of long chain acyl-CoA to FadR results in a protein conformation unfavorable for DNA binding causing a cascade of enzyme induction due to the release of FadR-dependent repression of many genes and operons required for growth on fatty acids. Since FadR binding to the fabA promoter activates fabA transcription, binding of acyl-CoA to FadR prevents transcription activation of at least this gene which is required for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. In previous work (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that long chain acyl-CoA compounds specifically inhibits DNA binding of FadR. This provided indirect evidence that FadR was able to bind long chain acyl-CoA and that binding of these compounds prevents DNA binding. In the present work, it was shown by isoeletric focusing and by fluorescence quenching that FadR binds long chain acyl-CoA directly. FadR is a 239 amino acid polypeptide which contains 4 tryptophan residues at positions 21, 60, 75, and 223(14DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Three Trp residues are located in the amino terminus within or very close to the 71 residues believed to comprise the DNA-binding domain (14DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and one, Trp 223, is located within the region identified here as required for inducer binding. The location of the Trp residues within the acyl-CoA binding domain was expected to result in a decrease in steady state intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon binding ligand. Indeed, this was supported by the substantial degree of quenching of intrinsic fluorescence shown in Fig. 4 for FadR upon addition of C 18:1-CoA. The magnitude of the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence for FadR upon acyl-CoA binding was somewhat surprising. For yeast N-myristoyl-CoA acyl-transferase, a protein containing 7 Trp residues, only 20% quenching was observed at saturating concentrations of C 14:0-CoA(16Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Adams S.P. Ropson I.J. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This degree of quenching for N-myristoyl-CoA-acyl-transferase was attributed to a single tryptophan residue. For FadR, the substantial decrease in intrinsic fluorescence upon acyl-CoA binding is likely to be the combined result of acyl-CoA binding to the region including Trp 223 and changes in the environment around Trp residues 21 and 60 and possibly also Trp 75 resulting from an allosteric change which disrupts the DNA binding conformation of the protein. Therefore, the change in fluorescence quenching observed for FadR was not due to the contribution of a single Trp residue as estimated for N-myristoyl-CoA-acyl-transferase but may have been due to the contribution of 2-4 Trp residues in FadR. The substitution of Ser 219 in FadR with Asn resulted in a non-inducible or super-repressor phenotype. The mutant protein retained the ability to bind DNA and to repress or activate transcription as evidenced by evaluating DNA binding directly and by measuring β-galactosidase activities in strains carrying fadB-lacZ or fabA-lacZ reporter fusions. The non-inducible phenotype could be due either to a reduced ability to bind long chain acyl-CoA directly or due to an inability to undergo an allosteric transition which disrupts the DNA binding conformation of the protein. These two alternatives are very difficult to distinguish without structural information for the protein bound to either ligand. For example, in LacI substitution of Lys 84 results in a non-inducible phenotype for this repressor(19Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, structural analysis of LacI showed that Lys 84 is surface exposed and does not make direct contact with the ligand. The non-inducible phenotype in the case of LacI is most likely due to conformational perturbations within the quarternary structure of the protein(20Chang W-I. Olson J.S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17613-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence lead us to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of FadR is required specifically for binding long chain acyl-CoA, and residues Gly 216, Ser 219, and Trp 223 most probably interact with the CoA moiety in particular: (i) The Km of binding as estimated by fluorescence quenching or shift in pI differed between the wild-type and the mutant S219N. (ii) This region in FadR, which includes amino acid residues 219-239 of the 239-amino-acid protein shares identities and similarities with CODH of C. thermoaceticum, in a region of CODH for which there is direct biochemical evidence for a CoA-binding site(6Morton T.A. Runquist J.A. Ragsdale S.W. Shanmugasundaram T. Wood H. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23824-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Shenoy B.C. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 28: 7112-7116Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Analysis of the set of FadR alleles carrying alanine substitutions also indicates that this region of FadR is critical for function. Alanine substitutions are in general not expected to have severe effects on protein structure since alanine is found throughout protein secondary structures. This has been generally substantiated by mutational analysis(21Gordon A.J.E. Burns P.A. Fix D.F. Yatagai F. Allen F.L. Horsfall M.J. Halliday J.A. Gray J. Bernelot-Moens C. Glickman B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Alanine mutagenesis therefore primarily tests for functional significance of amino acid side chains. Seven substitutions of the 16 tested resulted in a wild-type phenotype. Four substitutions, Y215A, G220A, Q227A, and N229A, resulted in no detectable FadR function indicating that these residues are critical and are perhaps required in particular to maintain the active conformation of the protein. Substitution of Gly 216 or Trp 223 with alanine in FadR resulted in a non-inducible phenotype which was comparable to that of S219N while substitution of Glu 218, Ser 219, or Lys 228 with alanine resulted in a reduced level of induction. The clustering of non-inducible, super-repressor mutations in FadR in the COOH terminus provides supportive evidence for function of the region of FadR in binding the inducer, a long chain acyl-CoA. We are subsequently determining the structure of FadR complexed with acyl-CoA to verify and extend this mutational analysis. This protein is of interest as a transcriptional regulator whose activity is modulated by acyl-CoA compounds and due to its unique and complex role as a regulator of many genes encoding proteins required for fatty acid and lipid metabolism. We thank Raquel Wilson for initial characterization of pRW22 and Tamra Lynne Heimert for performing the gel shift and β-galactosidase assays. We are grateful to Dr. Earl Shrago (Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison) for valuable insights into the similarities between CODH and FadR."
https://openalex.org/W2068437232,"Activation of human platelets by the peptide YFLLRNP has been shown to induce shape change but not secretion, Ca 2+ mobilization, or pleckstrin phosphorylation (Rasmussen, U. B., Gachet, C., Schlesinger, Y., Hanau, D., Ohlmann, P., Van Obberghen-Schilling, E., Pouyssegur, J., Cazenave, J.-P., and Pavirani, A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14322-14328). YFLLRNP was added to washed human platelets that had been pretreated with EGTA at 37°C or preincubated with the fibrinogen receptor antagonist RGDS to preclude the activation of the integrin α IIbβ3 (fibrinogen receptor). YFLLRNP induced shape change and stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 62, 68, and 130 kDa within 7 s. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins reached maximum levels (2-3-fold) 15-30 s after addition of YFLLRNP and decreased subsequently. The chelation of intracellular Ca 2+ by BAPTA-AM decreased basal tyrosine protein phosphorylation but did not inhibit the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 or the shape change induced by YFLLRNP. Preincubation of platelets with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein or tyrphostin A23 completely inhibited platelet shape change and protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by YFLLRNP. The inactive structural analogs daidzein and tyrphostin A1 were barely inhibitory. P62, P68, and P130, which exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with YFLLRNP, were found in the cytoskeleton. P130 was not identical to vinculin or the focal adhesion kinase pp125 FAK. The results indicate that stimulation of G-protein-coupled thrombin receptors rapidly induces protein tyrosine kinase activation through a Ca 2+- and integrin-independent mechanism. Protein tyrosine kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of novel protein substrates seem to play an essential role in the induction of platelet shape change. Activation of human platelets by the peptide YFLLRNP has been shown to induce shape change but not secretion, Ca 2+ mobilization, or pleckstrin phosphorylation (Rasmussen, U. B., Gachet, C., Schlesinger, Y., Hanau, D., Ohlmann, P., Van Obberghen-Schilling, E., Pouyssegur, J., Cazenave, J.-P., and Pavirani, A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14322-14328).

The results indicate that stimulation of G-protein-coupled thrombin receptors rapidly induces protein tyrosine kinase activation through a Ca 2+- and integrin-independent mechanism. Protein tyrosine kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of novel protein substrates seem to play an essential role in the induction of platelet shape change. Platelet shape change, the earliest platelet response induced by physiological agonists, is generally associated with phospholipase C-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca 2+ mobilization from intracellular stores(1Siess W. Weber P.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8286-8292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), Ca 2+-stimulated myosin light chain (20 kDa) phosphorylation, and protein kinase C-dependent pleckstrin (47 kDa) phosphorylation. Whereas the Ca 2+-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation seems to precede shape change and might play a role in triggering this early platelet response(3Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no such function has been found for protein kinase C-dependent pleckstrin phosphorylation(2Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). However, physiological stimuli such as thrombin and prostaglandin-endoperoxide analogs can induce shape change without increasing cytosolic Ca 2+, and an increase of cytosolic Ca 2+ alone is not sufficient to induce shape change and myosin light chain phosphorylation(4Rink T.J. Smith S.W. Tsien R.Y. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5Simpson A.W.M. Hallam T.J. Rink J.T.

J. 1985; 232: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Physiological agonists apparently activate Ca 2+-independent pathways that might synergize with Ca 2+ to produce myosin light chain phosphorylation and platelet shape change(6Hallam T.J. Daniel J.L. Kendrick-Jones J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, a heptapeptide ligand of the cloned thrombin receptor YFLLRNP has been found that induces shape change but not Ca 2+ mobilization or pleckstrin phosphorylation in human platelets(7Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.-P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using this partial thrombin receptor agonist, we studied the function and regulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation during platelet shape change. The partial thrombin receptor agonist YFLLRNP was synthesized by Dr. Arnold (Max-Planck-Institut, Martinsried, FRG). The tetrapeptide RGDS acetylsalicylic acid, apyrase, sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, Triton X-100, phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine were from Sigma.

The monoclonal antibodies PY20 and Z027 against phosphotyrosine were from Leinco (St. Louis, MO) and Zymed (San Francisco, CA), respectively. The monoclonal antibodies against pp125 FAK and vinculin were from UBI (Lake Placid, NY) and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. The chemiluminescence-based Western blot detection system ECL and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham. Iloprost and SIN-1 were kind gifts from Schering (Berlin, FRG) and Cassella-Riedel (Frankfurt, FRG), respectively. Herbimycin, tyrphostin A1, and tyrphostin A23 were from Biomol (Hamburg, FRG).

Human platelets were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and isolated as described(8Siess W. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Luber K. Siess W. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Platelets were resuspended at a concentration of 0.6 × 109 cells/ml in prewarmed buffer (pH 7.4; 20 mM HEPES, 138 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.36 mM NaH2PO4, 0.6 ADPase units/ml apyrase). In some experiments, platelet suspensions were incubated with EGTA (2 mM) and BAPTA-AM (20 μM) for 20 min at 37°C. Samples (0.6-0.8 ml) of the platelet suspension were transferred into aggregometer cuvettes and incubated at 37°C with stirring (1100 rpm). Following 5 min of preincubation, YFLLRNP was added. Inhibitors (RGDS, genistein, daidzein, and tyrphostin A1 and A23) were added 2-5 min before the stimulus as indicated in the figure legends. Shape change was measured by recording the light transmission in a LABOR aggregometer (Fresenius, Bad Homburg, FRG). For analysis of protein phosphorylation, aliquots (0.06 ml) were transferred to an equal volume of sample buffer(10Siess W. Grünberg B. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Triton-soluble and insoluble fractions were prepared by modification of a method described previously(11Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Edwards H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Platelet suspensions (0.6 ml) were incubated at 37°C in Eppendorf cups using an Eppendorf Thermostat 5320. At various times after addition of YFLLRNP, platelets were lysed by adding equal volumes of ice-cold 2 × Triton lysis buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2% Triton X-100, 100 mM Tris•HCl, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 μM leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μM pepstatin A. Samples were vortexed for 2 s, kept on ice for up to 60 min, and then centrifuged at 15,600 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellets (platelet cytoskeletons) were washed once without resuspension in 1 × Triton X-100 (1%) lysis buffer and dissolved in sample buffer (10Siess W. Grünberg B. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To obtain the membrane skeletal fraction(12Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4°C in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (L5-50) with a 70.1 Ti rotor. Proteins from platelet suspensions or platelet subfractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis on 1.5 mm × 20 cm gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and detected as described(9Luber K. Siess W. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Siess W. Grünberg B. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dilutions of the mixed primary phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and Z027 were both 1:2000; the dilutions of anti-pp125 FAK and anti-vinculin antibodies were also 1:2000. The dilution of the secondary anti-mouse antibody was 1:15,000. The specificity of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was tested by competition using either phosphotyrosine (1 mM) or phosphothreonine (1 mM). Tyrosine-phosphorylated protein bands were measured by laser densitometry (Ultroscan XL, Pharmacia). Absorption of proteins in unstimulated control samples was set to 100%. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of individual experiments from different blood donors. Preliminary experiments have shown that YFLLRNP (300 μM) induced shape change and a weak reversible aggregation of washed platelets but no detectable secretion of ATP from dense granules. In order to allow shape change and prevent platelet aggregation, suspensions of washed human platelets were either pretreated with RGDS for 2 min, which inhibits fibrinogen binding to the integrin α IIbβ3, or preincubated with EGTA for 20 min at 37° C, which dissociates the integrin α IIbβ3. EGTA pretreatment was, in some experiments, combined with BAPTA-AM in order to chelate any increase of cytosolic Ca 2+ eventually elicited by YFLLRNP, although this agonist has been reported not to enhance cytosolic Ca 2+ in fura-2-loaded human platelets(7Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.-P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of YFLLRNP (300 μM) rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of three proteins with the molecular masses of 62, 68, and 130 kDa during platelet shape change (Fig. 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins reached maximum levels (2-3-fold) 15-30 s after addition of YFLLRNP (Fig. 2). Initiation of shape change and the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 showed a good temporal correlation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was reversible within 1 min, but platelet shape change persisted for up to 5 min (Fig. 3) indicating that protein tyrosine phosphorylation was not necessary to maintain this early platelet response. In platelets pretreated with RGDS, maximal protein tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 and shape change upon stimulation with YFLLRNP were observed earlier than in platelets pretreated with BAPTA-AM/EGTA (data not shown). Interestingly, RGDS as well as BAPTA-AM/EGTA pretreatment affected the basal state of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in resting platelets (Table 1). RGDS decreased the phosphorylation of P62 and P68 by 20% but seemed to increase the phosphorylation of P130. BAPTA-AM/EGTA pretreatment decreased the phosphorylation of P62 and P130 by 75% and decreased that of P68 by 25%. These changes were due to the loading of platelets with BAPTA-AM and not due to EGTA (data not shown). In BAPTA-AM/EGTA-pretreated platelets, YFLLRNP increased the phosphorylation of P130 more (up to 3.8-fold) than in RGDS-pretreated platelets (up to 1.7-fold). The experiments with BAPTA-AM/EGTA-preincubated platelets show that the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in P62 and P130 after exposure to YFLLRNP were less than that in control platelets (in the absence of BAPTA-AM/EGTA). Therefore, it seems that the change of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by platelet exposure to YFLLRNP, but not the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, correlates with shape change.Figure 2:Stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 during platelet shape change induced by YFLLRNP and effect of genistein. Suspensions of washed human platelets were incubated with RGDS (2 mM) for 2 min at 37°C and with Me2SO (0.1%) or genistein (150 μM) for a further 2 min before addition of YFLLRNP (300 μM).

The structural inactive analog of genistein, daidzein, barely inhibited shape change and tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 (Fig. 1A and Fig. 3). Concentration-response curves of genistein showed an ID 50 value of 90 ± 4 μM for the inhibition of shape change and ID 50 values of 61 ± 15, 60 ± 11, and 84 ± 7 μM for inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by YFLLRNP of P62, P68, and P130, respectively (values are the means ± S.D., n = 3). A different protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin A23 (500 μM), also inhibited platelet shape change and tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 stimulated by YFLLRNP, whereas the structural inactive analog tyrphostin A1 did not show these inhibitory effects (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Platelet incubation with the prostacyclin analog iloprost (2 nM), which increased platelet cAMP levels 5-7-fold (data not shown), and the NO donor SIN-1 (10 μM), which increased platelet cGMP levels 5-fold (data not shown), prevented platelet shape change, and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 induced by YFLLRNP (Table 2).Tabled 1 Platelets stimulated by YFLLRNP to change their shape were fractionated into the cytoskeleton, membrane skeleton, and supernatant. As can be seen in Fig. 4, P62, P68, and P130 and three further proteins with molecular masses of 50-60 kDa, all of which exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with YFLLRNP were present in the cytoskeleton. P68 was also present in the membrane skeleton, but no increase of tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with YFLLRNP was observed. Proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in aggregated platelets are pp125 FAK and vinculin(13Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parson J.T. Brugge J.S. J.

Vinculin is also present in the cytoskeleton of aggregated platelets (16Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies were carried out to compare the electrophoretic mobility of tyrosine-phosphorylated P130 with the electrophoretic mobility of platelet vinculin and pp125 FAK, which were identified by specific antibodies on immunoblots. We found that P130 had a slower electrophoretic mobility than vinculin or pp125 FAK on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). We estimated that 1.7 ± 0.7% of total vinculin was present in the cytoskeleton of resting platelets. The content of vinculin in the cytoskeleton increased slightly (1.4 fold) during shape change induced by YFLLRNP (p < 0.05). Interestingly, immunoprecipitates of vinculin from control and YFLLRNP-stimulated platelets showed a small increase of phosphotyrosine on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots (data not shown). Therefore, a small fraction of platelet vinculin might be tyrosine-phosphorylated during platelet shape change induced by YFLLRNP, but vinculin is not identical to P130. Previously it was observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125 FAK was dependent on activation of either the α IIbβ3 integrin by fibrinogen (13Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S.

J. 1993; 296: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our studies, in which fibrinogen binding to and activation of the α IIbβ3 integrin were prevented, tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125 FAK was not significantly increased during platelet shape change elicited by YFLLRNP. However, when platelets were stimulated to aggregate, tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125 FAK dramatically increased (data not shown). The present study demonstrates that partial activation by YFLLRNP of the G-protein-coupled cloned thrombin receptor rapidly stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human platelets. The early increase of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is independent of cytosolic Ca 2+ increase and activation of the α IIbβ3 integrin and also is not mediated by the protein kinase C pathway, because no pleckstrin phosphorylation has been observed during platelet shape change induced by YFLLRNP(7Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.-P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the results are consistent with a pathway leading from thrombin receptor activation to protein tyrosine kinases. Previously in Swiss 3T3 cells, bombesin, vasopressin, and endothelin have been shown to stimulate the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase pp125 FAK and the cytoskeletal protein paxillin(18Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly and in agreement with our results, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was found to occur through a pathway that was also independent of the mobilization of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores and protein kinase C activation. However, the dependence of pp125 FAK and paxillin phosphorylation on integrin activation was not investigated in these studies. In platelets, stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125 FAK is mediated by activation of either the integrin α IIbβ3 (fibrinogen receptor) (13Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S.

J. 1993; 296: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we observed that P130, which was tyrosine phosphorylated and present in the cytoskeleton during platelet shape change induced by thrombin receptor activation, was not identical to pp125 FAK. P130 was also not identical to vinculin, which has been reported to undergo Ca 2+-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and to associate with the cytoskeleton in platelets aggregated by thrombin(15Vostal J.G. Shulman N.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our study presents evidence for a novel pathway of G-protein-coupled thrombin receptors to protein tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate specific, still unknown protein substrates during shape change. Interestingly, thrombin receptor activation has recently been shown to cause shape change of neural cells (cell rounding) through a mechanism that was also independent on the Ca 2+ and protein kinase C pathways(20Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our results implicate a role of tyrosine kinases in the induction of platelet shape change elicited by thrombin receptor activation. Two structurally different tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin A23, inhibited platelet shape change, whereas the respective inactive analogs had less (daidzein) or no (tyrphostin A1) inhibitory activity. Also, iloprost and SIN-1 inhibited shape change and tyrosine phosphorylation elicited by YFLLRNP, indicating that the pathway of G-protein-coupled thrombin receptors to protein tyrosine kinases is sensitive to inhibition by cAMP and cGMP. Because many studies have shown a role of myosin light chain phosphorylation in the initiation of platelet shape change ((3Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); for review see (2Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to study the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation of P62, P68, and P130 and myosin light chain phosphorylation. A Ca 2+-independent stimulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation has been suggested in previous studies(4Rink T.J. Smith S.W. Tsien R.Y. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5Simpson A.W.M. Hallam T.J. Rink J.T. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Hallam T.J. Daniel J.L. Kendrick-Jones J. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on our results one could speculate that the Ca 2+-independent activation of protein tyrosine kinases is involved in the regulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation during shape change. The presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated P62, P68, and P130 in the cytoskeleton in our study and the association of phosphorylated myosin with the platelet cytoskeleton observed previously (21Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raise the possibility that these proteins regulate the cytoskeletal reorganization during platelet shape change. The identification of the protein tyrosine kinases and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that are activated and phosphorylated during platelet shape change is of obvious interest. Possible candidates are pp60 src, the src-related protein tyrosine kinases p61 fyn, p58 lyn, and p62 yes, and the tyrosine kinase p72 syk, all of which are present in platelets(22Golden A. Nemeth S.P. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Cichowski K. McCormick F. Brugge J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2277-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation and translocation of pp60 src to the cytoskeleton has been reported in aggregated platelets(25Horvath A.R. Muszbek L. Kellie S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol.

Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, both processes were found to occur subsequent to protein kinase C and/or integrin α IIbβ3 activation. It is therefore unlikely that pp60 src is activated during shape change. An interesting candidate is p72 syk, which apparently is activated in thrombin-stimulated platelets through a Ca 2+-independent mechanism(24Taniguchi T. Kitagawa H. Yasue S. Yanagi S. Sakai K. Asahi M. Ohta S. Takeuchi F. Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2277-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be seen, however, whether p72 syk activation occurs during shape change and whether it is independent of protein kinase C and integrin activation. We thank U. Wielert for expert technical assistance and F. Haag for the skillful photographic reproduction of the autoradiographs."

Here, we demonstrate that such v-relER-transformed cells exhibit B lymphoid determinants in line with earlier studies on v-rel-transformed cells. However, following inactivation of v-RelER oncoprotein activity by administration of an estrogen antagonist, cells differentiate into antigen-presenting dendritic cells as judged by several morphological and functional criteria. Additionally, under yet different culture conditions, v-relER cells differentiate into cells resembling polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Our studies therefore suggest that the conditional v-RelER, and probably also the authentic v-Rel, transform a common progenitor for neutrophils and dendritic cells."

It generally is accepted that albumin, the most abundant serum protein, serves as the principal transporter of bilirubin as well as numerous other hydrophobic molecular species (1Ostrow J.D. Schmid R. Samuelson D. J. Clin. Invest. 1963; 42: 1286-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Cooke J.R. Roberts L.B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1969; 26: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Watson D. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1962; 22: 435-445Google Scholar). The existence of an albumin receptor on the hepatocyte surface was first postulated in 1981 to explain the dependence of hepatic oleic acid uptake on the concentration of the albumin-ligand complex, as opposed to the concentration of free ligand per se(4Weisiger R. Gollan J. Ockner R. Science. 1981; 211: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Serum albumin has since been shown to enhance the hepatocellular uptake of a variety of other organic anions, including bilirubin(5Weisiger R. Gollan J. Ockner R. Gastroenterology. 1980; 79 (abstr.): 1065Google Scholar), fatty acids(6Fleischer A.B. Shurmantine W.O. Luxon B.A. Forker E.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 964-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), taurocholate(7Blitzer B.L. Lyons L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G34-G38PubMed Google Scholar, 8Forker E.L. Luxon B.A. J. Clin.

The “albumin receptor” hypothesis also has received support from studies demonstrating saturable binding of albumin to isolated hepatocytes(4Weisiger R. Gollan J. Ockner R. Science. 1981; 211: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Morgan D.J. Jones D.B. Smallwood R.A. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 1231-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Reed R.G.

Hepatology. 1987; 7: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).However, other investigators refute these findings (15Weisiger R. Ma W.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sorrentino D. Robinson R.B. Kiang C.L. Berk P.D. J. Clin.

Invest. 1983; 72: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and have further shown that the albumin receptor phenomenon is not unique to albumin in that similar uptake kinetics are observed with non-albumin-binding proteins(17Nunes R. Kiang C.L. Sorrentino D. Berk P.D. J. Hepatol. (Amst.). 1988; 7: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Stollman Y.R. Gartner U. Theilmann L. Ohmi N. Wolkoff A.W. J. Clin.

(Tokyo). 1985; 97: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of albumin to isolated hepatocytes and to rat liver plasma membranes is of relatively low affinity(20Wolkoff A.W. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and attempts to identify a specific receptor for albumin on the liver cell surface have, to date, been unsuccessful(21Stremmel W. Potter B.J. Berk P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 756: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, two additional theories have been proposed to explain the kinetics of albumin-bound ligand delivery to the liver. One such hypothesis suggests the induction of a reversible conformational change in the albumin molecule at the surface of the hepatocyte, which enhances albumin binding and facilitates the release of bound ligands(8Forker E.L. Luxon B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Forker E.L. Luxon B.A. Snell M. Shurmantine W.O. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Alternatively, an “extended sinusoidal perfusion” model has been developed (22Weisiger R.A. Pond S.M. Bass L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G872-G884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Forker E.L. Luxon B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G709-G717PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weisiger R.A. Pond S.M. Bass L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G904-G916PubMed Google Scholar), which accounts for the facilitation of ligand uptake in the presence of albumin by postulating an unstirred water layer at the liver cell surface and by correcting for the free ligand concentration in the sinusoidal plasma. According to this theoretical model, which has come under criticism for its complexity(12Morgan D.J. Jones D.B. Smallwood R.A. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 1231-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Forker E.L. Luxon B.A. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 1236-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the rate of dissociation of a given ligand from albumin may, under certain conditions, serve as the rate-limiting step in the hepatocellular uptake process(26Weisiger R.A. Zacks C.M. Smith N.D. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Weisiger R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1563-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).In an attempt to further delineate the mechanism(s) underlying the delivery of albumin-bound organic anions to the hepatocyte, we performed a systematic study of the kinetics of bilirubin transfer between serum albumin and both model and native hepatocyte plasma membrane vesicles. Despite the fact that albumin serves as the principal serum carrier for a host of hydrophobic organic anions, the limited available kinetic data on ligand dissociation from this protein have focused primarily on fatty acids(28Daniels C. Noy N. Zakim D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3286-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2663-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and relatively little information exists regarding the dissociation of the albumin-bilirubin complex(30Gray R.D. Stroupe S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4370-4377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Faerch T. Jacobsen J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 168: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Noy N. Leonard M. Zakim D. Biophys. Chem. 1992; 42: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, the precise determination of ligand off-rate constants from albumin is necessary in order to discriminate between the various models of hepatocellular uptake(27Weisiger R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1563-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, while bovine serum albumin is employed routinely for in vitro studies of hepatocellular transport, there has been no analysis regarding the applicability of results obtained from one specific albumin species to uptake phenomena in general. Finally, we measure directly the transfer of bilirubin from albumin to isolated hepatocyte basolateral plasma membranes and provide kinetic evidence against the presence of an albumin receptor on the liver cell surface. Hence, this study contributes important information regarding the mechanism of organic anion delivery from the serum to the hepatocyte plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsEssentially fatty acid-free human, rat, and bovine serum albumins were purchased from Sigma. Bilirubin IXα was obtained from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT), and purity was documented at over 98.5% by absorbance in chloroform solution ( ∊ 453 = 62,000 M -1 cm -1). Grade 1 egg lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) used for the preparation of phospholipid vesicles was obtained from Lipid Products (Surrey, United Kingdom). The fluorescent phospholipid N-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)dipalmitoyl-L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE) 1The abbreviations used are: dansyl-PEN-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)dipalmitoyl-L-α-phosphatidylethanolaminebLPMbasolateral (sinusoidal) liver plasma membrane(s)HSAhuman serum albuminRSArat serum albuminBSAbovine serum albumin. was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). All glassware was washed in chloroform prior to use.Preparation of Small Unilamellar VesiclesSmall unilamellar vesicles were prepared by a modification (33Zucker S.D. Storch J.

Phospholipids were solubilized in ether, evaporated under argon atmosphere, and then desiccated overnight under vacuum. The lipid film was suspended in 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.4) and sonicated on ice under an argon atmosphere, followed by centrifugation to sediment probe titanium particles and large vesicle contaminants. The phospholipid concentration in the final vesicle preparation was quantified using the lipid phosphorus assay method of Bartlett(35Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Isolation of Basolateral Liver Plasma MembranesRat hepatocyte basolateral liver plasma membranes (bLPM) were isolated according to the method of Meier and Boyer(36Meier P.J. Boyer J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as described previously(37Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats were excised, homogenized, and centrifuged for 15 min (1500 × g ave). The pellets were pooled and subjected to sucrose density centrifugation (90,000 × g ave) for 90 min in a swinging bucket rotor(38Fricker G. Landmann L. Meier P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mixed liver plasma membranes were harvested, washed twice (2700 × g ave for 15 min), rehomogenized, and again subjected to sucrose density centrifugation (197,500 × g ave) for 3 h. The basolateral membrane fraction was collected, and purity was assessed by enrichment in ouabain-sensitive Na +/K +-ATPase activity relative to that of whole liver homogenate(36Meier P.J. Boyer J.L.

Microsomal and canalicular plasma membrane contamination was determined by measuring glucose-6-phosphatase (40Arion W.J.

Cancer (Phila.). 1958; 2: 283-291Crossref Scopus (557) Google Scholar) activities, respectively. This isolation technique produces membrane vesicles, 72% of which are oriented right-side out, such that the outer leaflet of the vesicle corresponds to the extracellular surface in vivo(36Meier P.J.

Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2364-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incorporation into serum albumin and phospholipid vesicles was accomplished by dissolving the bile pigment in alkaline buffer, followed by rapid neutralization(33Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transfer experiments were conducted in a 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer solution (pH 7.4), and all steps were performed in the dark in order to minimize bilirubin photodegradation. An AMINCO-Bowman II fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with an SLM-AMINCO MilliFlow stopped-flow reactor (mixing time of 1.5 ms) was employed to monitor the rate of re-emergence of fluorescence as bilirubin transferred from albumin to acceptor vesicles. At excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 360 nm, respectively, the contribution of bilirubin fluorescence (49Rosei M.A. Experientia (Basel). 1983; 39: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 50Cu A.

A 320-nm long-pass emission filter was utilized to minimize light-scattering effects.As hepatocyte plasma membranes exhibit significant tryptophan fluorescence(37Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of bilirubin transfer from serum albumin to membrane vesicles also was determined by monitoring changes in bilirubin fluorescence. It previously has been shown that bilirubin fluorescence intensity is markedly enhanced when bound to serum albumin(44Chen R.F. Thaer A.A. Sernetz M. Fluorescence Techniques in Cell Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1973: 273-282Crossref Google Scholar, 51Beaven G.H. d'Albis A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 500-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 52Lee J.J. Gillispie G.D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1981; 33: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While bilirubin also exhibits increased fluorescence on binding to membranes(53Glushko V. Thaler M. Ros M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we found that bilirubin fluorescence is much less efficient when associated with phospholipid vesicles as compared with albumin. Thus, the spontaneous transfer of bilirubin from albumin to acceptor vesicles is reflected by a time-dependent diminution in bilirubin fluorescence intensity. Stopped-flow fluorometry was used to monitor the transfer process (excitation at 467 nm and emission at 525 nm) with a 500-nm long-pass emission filter to minimize light-scattering effects. Solutions of albumin-bound bilirubin were exposed to light from a standard 60-watt bulb for 5 min prior to initiation of the experiment in order to minimize any contribution from bilirubin photoisomerization (see “Results”).Measurement of the Rate of Bilirubin Transfer from Phospholipid Vesicles to Serum AlbuminThe kinetics of bilirubin transfer from membrane vesicles to serum albumin were determined using small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles into which the fluorescent phospholipid probe dansyl-PE was incorporated at a concentration of 0.5 mol %. Bilirubin binding to dansyl-labeled vesicles causes a reduction in probe fluorescence intensity due to resonance energy transfer between the dansyl moiety and bilirubin(33Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The rapid rate of bilirubin dissociation from the donor vesicles necessitated the use of an Applied Photophysics fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with an SPF-17 stopped-flow device (mixing time of 0.7 ms) to monitor the re-emergence of dansyl fluorescence (excitation at 340 nm, 520-nm long-pass emission filter) as bilirubin transferred to albumin.Kinetic Analysis of Bilirubin Transfer DataThe time course for bilirubin transfer was analyzed by fitting the time-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity to both single and double exponential functions, with fit quality assessed by multiple regression analysis of variance(33Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Zucker S.D. Goessling W. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19262-19270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variation in the rate constant with respect to the concentration of the donor and the acceptor facilitates the distinction between a collisional and a diffusional mechanism of bilirubin transfer (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that albumin exhibits a low binding affinity for membrane vesicles, such that the amount of bound albumin represents an insignificant fraction of the total protein concentration (21Stremmel W. Potter B.J. Berk P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 756: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and can reasonably be ignored. Assuming that the concentration of the albumin-bilirubin-vesicle complex ([Alb•B•V]) reaches steady-state rapidly(54Nichols J.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), for a collisional mechanism of bilirubin transfer from albumin to acceptor vesicles, d[Alb⋅B⋅V]dt=k5[Alb⋅B]s[V]-k6[Alb⋅B⋅V] -k3[Alb⋅B⋅V]+k4[Alb][V⋅B]=0(Eq. 1) where [V] is the free vesicle phospholipid concentration; s is the monolayer surface area per phospholipid molecule; and [Alb], [Alb•B], and [V•B] are the concentrations of free albumin, the albumin-bilirubin complex, and the vesicle-bilirubin complex, respectively. The rate constant for the collisional transfer of bilirubin from albumin to acceptorvesicles can then be described by (55Nichols J.W. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). kcoll=k3k5s[V]+k4k6[Alb]k3+k6(Eq. 2) Similarly, for a diffusional process, if the bilirubin free monomer concentration ([B]) is assumed to reach steady-state equilibrium rapidly, d[B]dt=k[Alb⋅B]-k2[Alb][B]-k2[V][B]+ks[V⋅B]=0(Eq. 3) and the overall transfer rate constant can be expressed as follows(55Nichols J.W. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). kdiff=k1k7+k2ks([Alb]s[V])k2([Alb]s[V])-k7(Eq. 4) When the ratio of albumin to vesicles is maintained constant, the collisional model () predicts a linear increase in the bilirubin transfer rate coincident with the albumin (or vesicle) concentration, while a constant rate would be anticipated for a diffusional mechanism of transfer (), regardless of the absolute donor or acceptor concentration.RESULTSThe quenching of the steady-state fluorescence of human serum albumin (HSA), rat serum albumin (RSA), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) by unconjugated bilirubin, after correcting for inner filter effects, was linear up to a 1:1 molar ratio of bilirubin to albumin. Hence, bilirubin concentrations within this range were utilized in all transfer experiments.Kinetic Analysis of Bilirubin Transfer from Serum Albumin to Small Unilamellar Phosphatidylcholine VesiclesThe spontaneous transfer of unconjugated bilirubin, at a 1:1 molar ratio with either human, bovine, or rat serum albumin, to small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine acceptor vesicles was monitored over time using stopped-flow fluorescence techniques. The results from a representative set of experiments using RSA are displayed in Fig. 2. Multiple regression analysis of the curve fits indicates that bilirubin transfer from albumin is well described by a single exponential function (p < 0.0005), with no significant improvement in fit obtained using a double exponential equation. Similar results were obtained using human or bovine serum albumin as the bilirubin donor. The first-order transfer kinetics with respect to acceptor vesicle concentration offer support for the presence of a single, high-affinity bilirubin-binding site on albumin(31Faerch T. Jacobsen J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 168: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 45Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 51Beaven G.H. d'Albis A.

The rates obtained from single exponential fits of the transfer curves are plotted against the acceptor vesicle phospholipid concentration for experiments performed at constant RSA concentration (Fig. 3). As shown, the data are consistent with the diffusional model of bilirubin transfer. The fact that the bilirubin transfer rate decreases with increasing acceptor vesicles provides evidence against a collision-mediated transfer process, as an increase in the acceptor concentration causes a corresponding increase in the number of collisions per unit time and therefore should result in a more rapid rate.Figure 2:Effect of acceptor vesicle concentration on bilirubin transfer from rat serum albumin. Data from a series of experiments measuring the transfer of bilirubin from rat serum albumin to small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles are presented. The tryptophan fluorescence of albumin was monitored over a 5-s interval, during which time a steady-state signal was attained. The time-dependent re-emergence of fluorescence reflects the transfer of unconjugated bilirubin (4 μM) from an equimolar concentration of RSA to increasing concentrations of acceptor vesicles (0-8.5 mM phospholipid). Each curve represents the mean of 8-10 repetitive stopped-flow injections performed at 25°C and is fitted by a single exponential function (solid lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Effect of increasing acceptor vesicle concentration on the rate of bilirubin transfer from albumin. Bilirubin transfer from rat serum albumin (1:1 molar ratio) to small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine acceptor vesicles was monitored by changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of albumin. The transfer rate constant is plotted versus the concentration of acceptor vesicle phospholipid (1.0-9.5 mM), with the RSA concentration maintained at 4 μM. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of three separate sets of experiments performed at 25°C. The solid line was generated from the best fit parameters (r2 = 0.976) for the diffusional model of bilirubin transfer (). These data are inconsistent with the collisional transfer model, which predicts a linear increase in rate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further support for a diffusional mechanism of transfer is derived from a plot of the bilirubin transfer rate versus the albumin:vesicle phospholipid concentration ratio (Fig. 4), which is well described by. Moreover, when the molar ratio of albumin (donor) to phospholipid vesicles (acceptor) is held constant, the first-order transfer rate remains unchanged over a wide range of albumin concentrations (Fig. 4, inset), as predicted by the diffusional model of transfer. Under these experimental conditions, the collisional model () predicts a linear increase in rate. Collectively, these data suggest that the spontaneous transfer of bilirubin from serum albumin to small unilamellar vesicles occurs via aqueous diffusion. Bilirubin transfer from serum albumin to dansyllabeled (0.2 mol %) acceptor vesicles also was monitored by the time-dependent changes in dansyl fluorescence. Transfer rates were identical to those obtained measuring the tryptophan fluorescence of albumin, confirming that the observed fluorescence changes reflect the transfer of bilirubin from albumin to acceptor vesicles and are not the result of conformational changes in the albumin molecule(59Rubaltelli F.F. Jori G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1979; 29: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Variations in the bilirubin transfer rate with the donor:acceptor molar ratio. The rate constant for bilirubin (0.25-6 μM) transfer from RSA (1:1 molar ratio) to small unilamellar vesicles (0.5-11 mM phospholipid), as measured by changes in albumin fluorescence at 25°C, is plotted against the concentration ratio of albumin to vesicle phospholipid. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of three separate sets of experiments. The diffusional model of bilirubin transfer () provides an excellent fit (r2 = 0.994) of the data (solid line). In the inset, the concentration of albumin and acceptor vesicles was varied while maintaining a 1:1800 molar ratio of albumin to phospholipid. Under these conditions, the bilirubin transfer rate remains constant over a 24-fold range in albumin concentration, as predicted by the diffusional model (solid line), but not the collisional model (broken line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A concern regarding the use of the above kinetic equations is that they are based on the premise that the concentration of bilirubin remains low, such that the free donor and acceptor concentrations do not change appreciably during the transfer process(55Nichols J.W.

In this context, a novel serine protease, myeloblastin, has been shown to be directly involved in RA-induced differentiation of human HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells(6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Constitutively expressed in proliferating HL-60 cells, mbn is rapidly down-regulated in response to RA(6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Labbaye C. Zhang J. Casanova J-L. Lanotte M. Teng J. Miller W.M. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 475-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of mbn protein expression appears to correlate with the cessation of cell growth. To directly link mbn down-regulation to changes in cell growth and differentiation, mbn protein expression was specifically inhibited in HL-60 cells using antisense oligonucleotides. This manipulation induced spontaneous growth arrest and differentiation, directly implicating mbn as a key component of the signaling pathway involved in transducing the biological effects of RA (6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To elucidate on this pathway, we sought to identify proteolytic targets of mbn.In addition to their role in the development of thermotolerance, members of the highly conserved heat shock protein family have been linked to cell growth and differentiation(8Lindquist S.

Several lines of evidence made it tempting to speculate that hsp28 might be a substrate of mbn. First, hsp28 mRNA was markedly down-regulated by RA during differentiation of HL-60 cells whereas hsp28 protein levels actually increased coincident with the onset of growth arrest(16Spector N.L. Mehlen P. Ryan C. Hardy L. Samson W. Levine H. Nadler L.M. Fabre N. Arrigo A.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that changes in hsp28 protein levels might be posttranscriptionally regulated. Second, mbn and hsp28 proteins appear to be reciprocally regulated during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Third, amino acid sequence analysis of hsp28 revealed several potential serine protease target sites(20Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the current study, we establish hsp28 as the first reported biological substrate of mbn. Considering hsp28 is a molecular chaperone (21Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Briefly, blood from patients diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia was isolated by dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation, and contaminating red blood cells were removed from the resulting supernatant by hypotonic lysis using NH4Cl (0.87%). Leukocytes were obtained by centrifugation (400 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in Hanks' buffered salt solution. Leukocytes were homogenized in 0.34 M sucrose at 4°C, and following centrifugation, the granules were extracted by sonic disruption in 20 mM HCl. After centrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min), the supernatant was chromatographed on a Dyematrix Orange A-agarose dye affinity column. Proteins bound to the column were eluted using a NaCl gradient (0.1-2.5 M) in citrate phosphate buffer. Enzymatically active fractions eluted from the column were combined together and further purified on a Trasylol-Sepharose column to remove potential contaminating neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G and then subjected to cation exchange chromatography using a Mono-S HR 5/5 column with the Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. The resulting material was homogeneous as evaluated by LC electrospray-mass spectrometry, N-terminal amino acid sequence determination, and SDS-PAGE. In addition, no neutrophil elastase or cathepsin G was identified in the final product using immunoblotting and enzymatic assays for these proteases.In Vitro Proteolysis Assayrhsp28, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.075% Tween 20, and purified mbn were co-incubated at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:200-1:500 (mol/mol) in a shaking 37°C water bath for 12-18 h. The reaction was terminated by boiling in 2 × Laemmli sample buffer and then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Purified human neutrophil elastase was co-incubated with rhsp28 under identical conditions to that described above.Preparation of RNA and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was purified by a modification of the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method as described previously(14Spector N.L.

Intactness and equal loading of RNA were verified by ethidium bromide staining. Equal amounts of RNA were run on a 1.3% agarose gel and transferred by Northern blotting onto a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad). Hybridization was performed using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe from the human hsp28 gene.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot AnalysisNB4 cells (5 × 106 cells/time point) were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin. Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the Bradford method, and equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and efficiency and equal loading of proteins were evaluated by Ponceau S staining. The filter was blocked for 1 h in TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) lowfat milk. Blots were then hybridized with α-hsp28 mAb at 1:1500 final dilution in TBS + 1% (w/v) lowfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed 3 times in TBST (TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20) and then developed using either a goat α-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in TBST) or a goat α-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in TBST). Alkaline phosphatase blots were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrates, and horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were visualized by the ECL detection method.DNA DeterminationsNB4 cells were added to microculture plates at 105 cells/well in a final volume of 200 μl. Cell proliferation was determined by pulsing cells with 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 4 h. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and filter-bound [3H]thymidine was counted on a Packard Tri-carb scintillation counter.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn order to establish a link between hsp28 and mbn during RA-induced cell differentiation, we examined the regulation of hsp28 protein in the NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line. APL cells remain one of the prototypic models with which to study cellular and molecular differentiative events since these cells undergo granulocytic differentiation in response to RA(1Breitman T.R.

As the only established APL cell line, NB4 cells contain the t(15;17)(q22;q12-21) cytogenetic marker, which is uniquely associated with APL and thought to confer RA sensitivity through the expression of a hybrid retinoic acid receptor-α protein(24Larson R.A.

Casanova J-L. Lanotte M. Teng J. Miller W.M. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 475-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to HL-60 cells where mbn is rapidly down-regulated, mbn is initially induced in RA-treated NB4 cells and not inhibited until 96 h, at which time NB4 cells growth arrest(7Labbaye C. Zhang J. Casanova J-L. Lanotte M. Teng J. Miller W.M. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 475-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hsp28 protein levels were examined at various time points prior to and following treatment of NB4 cells with tRA (1 μM). During the first 72 h, levels of hsp28 protein progressively decreased, during which time [3H]thymidine incorporation remained unchanged from that of untreated cells (Fig. 1). After nadiring at 72 h, hsp28 protein levels increased at 96 h with continued induction above base-line levels at 4 and 6 days (Fig. 1). Increased hsp28 protein appeared to correlate with cessation of cell proliferation and 55 and 82% inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation at 4 and 6 days, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, the initial down- and subsequent up-regulation of hsp28 mirrors that previously described for mbn, where mbn is up-regulated during the initial 24-72 h following tRA and not down-regulated until 96 h(7Labbaye C. Zhang J. Casanova J-L. Lanotte M. Teng J. Miller W.M. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 475-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Relatively little is known about the mechanism regulating hsp28 protein levels during cell differentiation. To shed light on this process, we examined the expression of hsp28 mRNA during RA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated at various time points prior to and following treatment with tRA. The predicted 0.9-kilobase size hsp28 transcript was markedly down-regulated between 2 and 6 days following treatment with tRA (Fig. 2A). Intactness and equal loading of RNA were verified by ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 2B) and cross-hybridization to the 28 S ribosomal band (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Down-regulation of hsp28 mRNA during differentiation of NB4 cells. NB4 cells were either cultured in control media alone (0 and 48 h) or in the presence of tRA (1 μM) for the indicated periods of time. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells at each time point using a modification of the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method. Equal amounts of RNA (5 μg/lane) were separated by 1.3% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred by Northern blotting to a nitrocellulose membrane and then hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe cloned from the hsp28 gene. As shown, the probe hybridizes to a 0.9-kDa size transcript (panelA). Cross-hybridization to the 28 S ribosomal band suggests comparable loading of intact RNA. A photograph of the ethidium bromide-stained 28 S ribosomal band is shown as a further control of intactness and equal loading of RNA (panelB). The positions of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal bands are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The discordant relationship between hsp28 protein and mRNA suggested that RA might regulate hsp28 protein posttranscriptionally. Analysis of the known amino acid sequence of hsp28 revealed several potential serine protease target sites. To determine whether hsp28 is a substrate of mbn, we isolated mbn from myeloblasts and purified it to homogeneity using a modification of the method described by Kao et al.(23Kao R.C. Wehner N.G.

The purity of the product was verified by mass spectrometry, N-terminal amino acid sequence determination, and SDS-PAGE (data not shown). mbn and rhsp28 were incubated at various substrate:enzyme ratios for 12 h at 37°C, and then hsp28 protein degradation was determined by immunoblot analysis using an α-hsp28 mAb as the primary antibody. When incubated with mbn at an hsp28:mbn ratio of either 1:250 (Fig. 3, lane2) or 1:500 (lane3), the 28-kDa “parent” heat shock protein was almost completely hydrolyzed to two or three lower molecular weight immunoreactive bands (Fig. 3, arrowheads) corresponding to previously described hsp28 digestion products(9Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3058-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, hsp28 did not undergo spontaneous degradation when incubated alone (Fig. 3, lane1). To further characterize the specificity of mbn proteolysis, we examined whether mbn also hydrolyzed proteins such as human Ig, bovine serum albumin, and lysozyme. Representative of these proteins was human IgG, which was not proteolytically cleaved by mbn (Fig. 4).Figure 3:Proteolysis of hsp28 by mbn. Purified mbn and rhsp28 were incubated together for 12 h at 37°C in a shaking water bath and then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was blotted with an α-hsp28 mAb (1:1500 dilution) and visualized using a goat α-mouse AP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution). Proteolysis was examined at an hsp28:mbn ratio (mol:mol) of 1:250 (lane2) and 1:500 (lane3). Arrowheads indicate the location of three new immunoreactive bands.

However, in contrast to mbn, rhsp28 was not affected by hNE (Fig. 5, lane2). rhsp28 alone was included as a control (lane3).Figure 5:hsp28 is not degraded by human neutrophil elastase. rhsp28 was incubated with either myeloblastin (lane1) or hNE (lane2), in both cases at an hsp28:enzyme ratio of 1:500.

In this report, we identify hsp28 as the first reported protein substrate of mbn. As we have shown, this relationship is rather specific since hsp28 was not hydrolyzed by a homologous protease (Fig. 5), nor do these observations represent indiscriminate hydrolysis (Fig. 4). These findings are intriguing in light of the integral role played by hsp28 in physiological processes that directly impact on cell growth and differentiation. For example, cytoskeletal proteins are important components of signal transduction pathways. In fact, a number of growth regulatory molecules appear to exert their effects through interactions with cytoskeletal components(29Brancolini C. Bottega S. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. Desolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Graham S.L. Gibbs J.B. Oliff H. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell.

In this context, hsp28 directly modifies the composition of actin microfilaments through its actin binding activity(22Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a capping protein, the avian low molecular weight analogue of hsp28 inhibits actin polymerization(32Miron T.

Biochem. 1988; 178: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The effects of hsp28 on actin appear to be phosphorylation-dependent(22Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is of interest in light of the identification of a serine kinase involved in the MAP kinase cascade being responsible for hsp28 phosphorylation(34Stokoe D.

Originally associated with mitogen stimulation, activation of MAP kinases has also been linked to cell differentiation, including HL-60 cells(36Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y.

Thus, RA appears to exert a dual effect on hsp28 protein expression through its down-regulation of mbn and activation of MAP kinases.In addition, several members of the heat shock protein family, including hsp28, regulate peptide folding, intracellular protein trafficking, and signal transduction as molecular chaperones(21Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R.

Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar). These interactions have been shown to modify the activity of associated proteins, which has significant consequences when the chaperoned protein is itself involved in growth regulation, as in the case of hsp90 and the oncogenic tyrosine kinase pp60 v- src(45Courtneidge S.A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7117-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 46Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 47Xu Y.

Similarly, following transfection of baby rat kidney cells with either oncogenic or non-oncogenic adenovirus constructs, the presence of a 22-kDa protein associated with the rat low molecular weight hsp correlates inversely with oncogenicity of transformed cells(48Zantema A. DeJong E. Lardenoije R. Van Der Eb A.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of hsp28 by mbn could therefore directly impact on chaperonin activity.Although the direct involvement of hsp28 in cell differentiation remains to be demonstrated, its identification as a target of mbn provides evidence that hsp28 is a component of the signal transduction pathway mediating differentiation of human myeloid leukemic cells. The identification of mbn in hematopoietic stem cells (49Zhao S. Rees J.K. Drach D. Labbaye C. Drach J. Cayre Y.E. Adreef M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1962aGoogle Scholar) suggests that a better understanding of mbn and its substrates may ultimately provide insight into the regulation of normal hematopoiesis.

In this context, a novel serine protease, myeloblastin, has been shown to be directly involved in RA-induced differentiation of human HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells(6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Constitutively expressed in proliferating HL-60 cells, mbn is rapidly down-regulated in response to RA(6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Labbaye C. Zhang J. Casanova J-L. Lanotte M. Teng J. Miller W.M. Cayre Y.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 475-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of mbn protein expression appears to correlate with the cessation of cell growth. To directly link mbn down-regulation to changes in cell growth and differentiation, mbn protein expression was specifically inhibited in HL-60 cells using antisense oligonucleotides. This manipulation induced spontaneous growth arrest and differentiation, directly implicating mbn as a key component of the signaling pathway involved in transducing the biological effects of RA (6Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To elucidate on this pathway, we sought to identify proteolytic targets of mbn.In addition to their role in the development of thermotolerance, members of the highly conserved heat shock protein family have been linked to cell growth and differentiation(8Lindquist S.

Several lines of evidence made it tempting to speculate that hsp28 might be a substrate of mbn. First, hsp28 mRNA was markedly down-regulated by RA during differentiation of HL-60 cells whereas hsp28 protein levels actually increased coincident with the onset of growth arrest(16Spector N.L. Mehlen P. Ryan C. Hardy L. Samson W. Levine H. Nadler L.M. Fabre N. Arrigo A.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that changes in hsp28 protein levels might be posttranscriptionally regulated. Second, mbn and hsp28 proteins appear to be reciprocally regulated during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Third, amino acid sequence analysis of hsp28 revealed several potential serine protease target sites(20Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the current study, we establish hsp28 as the first reported biological substrate of mbn. Considering hsp28 is a molecular chaperone (21Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and key actin binding protein(22Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1998801601,"Pro-protein and pro-hormone convertases are subtilisin/kexin-like enzymes implicated in the activation of numerous precursors by cleavage at sites mostly composed of pairs of basic amino acids. Six members of this family of enzymes have been identified in mammals and named furin (also called PACE), PC1 (also called PC3), PC2, PACE4, PC4, and PC5 (also called PC6). Multiple transcripts are produced for all the mammalian convertases, but only in the cases of PC4, PACE4, and PC5 does differential splicing result in the modification of the C-terminal sequence of these enzymes. A similar molecular diversity is also observed for the convertases of Hydra vulgaris, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. In the third species, two genes homologous to human furin called Dfur1 and Dfur2 have been identified. The Dfur1 gene undergoes differential splicing to generate three type I membrane-bound proteins called dfurin1, dfurin1-CRR, and dfurin1-X, which differ only in their C-terminal sequence. By using recombinant vaccinia viruses that express each of the dfurin proteins, we investigated the potential effect of the C-terminal domain on their catalytic specificities. For this purpose, these enzymes were coexpressed with the precursors pro-7B2, pro-opiomelanocortin, and pro-dynorphin in a number of cell lines, and the processed products obtained were characterized. Our studies demonstrate that these proteases display cleavage specificities similar to that of mammalian furin but not to that of PC2. In contrast, we noted significant differences in the biosynthetic fates of these convertases. All dfurins undergo rapid removal of their transmembrane domain within the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the release of several truncated soluble forms. However, in the media of cells containing secretory granules, such as GH4C1 and AtT-20, dfurin1-CRR and dfurin2 predominate over dfurin1, whereas dfurin1-X is never detected. While pro-segment removal occurs predominantly in the trans-Golgi network for all the dfurins, in the presence of brefeldin A, only dfurin1-CRR and dfurin2 can undergo partial zymogen cleavage. The conclusions drawn from the results of this study may well be applicable to the mammalian convertases PC4, PACE4, and PC5, which also display C-terminal sequence heterogeneity.

For this purpose, these enzymes were coexpressed with the precursors pro-7B2, pro-opiomelanocortin, and pro-dynorphin in a number of cell lines, and the processed products obtained were characterized. Our studies demonstrate that these proteases display cleavage specificities similar to that of mammalian furin but not to that of PC2. In contrast, we noted significant differences in the biosynthetic fates of these convertases. All dfurins undergo rapid removal of their transmembrane domain within the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the release of several truncated soluble forms. However, in the media of cells containing secretory granules, such as GH4C1 and AtT-20, dfurin1-CRR and dfurin2 predominate over dfurin1, whereas dfurin1-X is never detected. While pro-segment removal occurs predominantly in the trans-Golgi network for all the dfurins, in the presence of brefeldin A, only dfurin1-CRR and dfurin2 can undergo partial zymogen cleavage. The conclusions drawn from the results of this study may well be applicable to the mammalian convertases PC4, PACE4, and PC5, which also display C-terminal sequence heterogeneity."

To test this hypothesis, we developed a system of transient transfection of rat adipocytes with constructs containing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and fatty acid synthetase (FAS) promoters fused to gene reporter CAT. Those transfected cells expressed high levels of promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity through correctly initiated transcription as shown by primer extension analysis. Using this system we found a direct effect of insulin on GAPDH and FAS gene expression in rat adipocytes. In transfected adipocytes from obese compared to lean rats, activity of GAPDH and FAS promoters fused to CAT, was 2.6- and 8-fold increased, respectively. In contrast when reporter gene activity was driven by either phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or β-actin promoter, no difference could be observed between lean and obese, pointing out the promoter specificity of genotype effect. 5′ deletion analysis of GAPDH promoter allowed us to narrow down the fa responsive region to nucleotide −488-329. As assessed by gel retardation and DNase I footprinting analysis, adipocyte nuclear protein interactions to this 159-bp fragment were found to be identical and to footprint the same 20-bp sequence. This study pointed out that overexpression of GAPDH and FAS genes in adipose tissue of genetically obese rats relies on promoter activation, through a 159-bp cisacting region within the GAPDH promoter.

INTRODUCTIONMajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmajor histocompatibility complexAPCantigen presenting cellOVAovalbuminNPnucleoprotein. class I molecules display peptides on the antigen presenting cell (APC) surface. CD8+ cytolytic T-cells probe these peptide•MHC complexes to identify and to subsequently eliminate cells that express foreign peptides. The fact that these peptides are derived from cellular proteins allows T-cells to detect intracellular pathogens or transformation events due to expression of new proteins (reviewed in (1Brodsky F.M.

Nathenson S.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.-G.

Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which cellular proteins are targeted to the processing pathway remains poorly understood. Some studies have proposed that these peptides are generated as by-products of normal turnover of cellular proteins(8Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The generality of this mechanism is, however, not clear because differences in antigen presentation activity often do not correlate with differences in stability of donor proteins(8Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 10Del Val M. Schlicht H.-J. Ruppert T.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternate mechansim, it has been proposed that these peptides are generated via a specialized pathway that does not depend upon protein turnover but instead involves novel transcriptional and/or translational mechanisms. Evidence in support of this latter mechanism, referred to as the “pepton hypothesis”(12Boon T. Van Pel A. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), comes from several independent studies that peptide•MHC complexes are generated in APC transfected with antigen genes despite the absence of obvious promoters or translation initiation sites(11Fetten J.V. Roy N. Gilboa E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lurquin C. Van Pel A. Mariamé B. De Plaen E. Szikora J.-P. Janssens C. Reddehase M.J. Lejeune J. Boon T.

Again, which one or more of the several possible mechanisms that can account for this phenomenon has not been yet determined.Our previous study confirmed that presentation of either ovalbumin (OVA)•Kb or influenza nucleoprotein (NP)•Db complexes did indeed occur in APC transfected with OVA or NP genes that were in inappropriate expression context (15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast to other studies, our experiments suggested that presentation of peptide•MHC complexes was related to the translational mechanism. First, the relative differences in presentation activity correlated with particular translational reading frames of the peptide coding sequence. Second, and more significantly, the T-cell stimulating activity was completely abrogated by placing translational stops immediately upstream of the peptide coding sequence. How translation was obtained in the absence of the ATG translation initiation codon was not ascertained.In this report, we have analyzed the mechanism that accounts for the generation of these endogenous peptide•MHC complexes. We identified the cryptic translation initiation codons by screening a random set of codons that allowed presentation of the OVA257-264 (SL8)•Kb complex to T-cells. Interestingly, the seven codons thus identified include ATG, as well as three of four known non-ATG translational initiation codons. Furthermore, we show that despite the ability of these non-ATG codons to allow peptide/MHC expression, the amount of processed peptides in the cells remained below biochemical detection limits estimated to be less than 30 copies/cell. These findings explain previously surprising results and are important for understanding the mechanism of the endogenous peptide/MHC presentation pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid DNA ConstructsThe XGSL8 DNA constructs encoded the SL8 (SIINFEKL) residues that were preceded by a translational stop codon in each of three reading frames, a degenerate codon X, and a glycine codon (Fig. 2a). The constructs were prepared using oligonucleotides synthesized with a mixture of equal parts of A, T, C, and G nucleotides at the codon shown as NNN in Fig. 2a. The oligonucleotides contained complementary overhangs for insertion into the corresponding 5′ HindIII and 3′ XbaI sites in the pcDNAI/neo vector (Invitrogen). Transcription of cDNAs in this vector is regulated by the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. The GTG construct was prepared using synthetic oligonucleotides with GTG as the X codon. Preparation of MGSL8, RF-SL8, and ∗RF-SL8 constructs in the same pcDNAI/neo vector has been described(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). Initial screens were carried out with miniprep DNAs, and all subsequent sequencing and functional analysis was carried out with CsCl-purified plasmids as described below.Transfections and T-cell Activation AssaysVarying concentrations of indicated CsCl-purified plasmids were transfected into 2 × 104 Kb-COS cells/well of a 96-well plate, by the DEAE-dextran procedure described earlier(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). Two days later, transfected cells were co-cultured with 1 × 105 SL8•Kb-specific B3Z T-cells(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar, 16Karttunen J. Sanderson S. Shastri N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). After overnight culture, antigen-specific lacZ activity induced in B3Z T-cells was measured by the conversion of the lacZ substrate chlorophenol red β-galactoside to chlorophenol red at 595 nm as described(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sanderson S. Shastri N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Responses shown are means of duplicate cultures with standard deviations less than 10%. Stable XGSL8•Kb-expressing L-cell transfectants were generated by electroporation with 50 μg of plasmid DNA as described earlier (15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). Pools of 50-100 colonies selected in 1 mg/ml G418 were tested for their T-cell stimulation activity as above.Analysis of Processed Peptides10 × 106 cells were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid according to the protocol described by Rotzschke et al.(18Rotzschke O. Falk K. Faath S. Rammensee H.-G. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g and passed through a 10-kDa cutoff filter (UltraFree, Millipore). The filtrate was dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in complete medium, and assayed for the presence of processed peptides with Kb L-cells as APC and 1 × 105 B3Z T-cells. The amount of processed SL8 peptide recovered was estimated by comparison with synthetic SL8 peptide as a standard.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn an earlier study, we showed that the ovalbumin (OVA)•Kb MHC or the influenza nucleoprotein (NP)•Db MHC complexes were expressed in cells transfected with DNA constructs encoding the minimal OVA257-264 (SL8) or Flu NP366-374 (NP) peptides(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). As in other studies(11Fetten J.V. Roy N. Gilboa E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar, 14Boon T. Van Pel A. De Plaen E. Chomez P. Lurquin C. Szikora J.-P. Sibille C. Mariamé B. Van Den Eynde B. Lethe B. Brichart V. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant Biol. 1989; 54: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also obtained significant T-cell stimulation by APC transfected with DNA constructs in which the codons for SL8 or NP peptides were “out-of-frame” relative to the ATG-defined translation reading frame. This antigen presentation activity of APC transfectants was, however, completely abrogated by placing stop codons directly upstream of the SL8 coding sequence, suggesting that cryptic translation of the SL8 residues could explain the presence of the SL8•Kb complex (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the loss of presentation activity was completely restored by inserting the ATG codon between the termination and the SL8 codons yielding the Met-Gly-SL8 precursor peptide (Fig. 1). The restoration of presentation activity by insertion of the ATG codon suggested the strategy for identifying the cryptic translation initiation codons by their ability to restore presentation of SL8•Kb complex to T-cells.Figure 1:Stimulation of SL8•Kb-specific B3Z T-cell response by transiently transfected Kb-COS cells. DNA constructs encoded the SL8 residues in appropriate (Met-Gly-SL8, MG-SL8), inappropriate (RF-SL8), or without a translational initiation codon (∗RF-SL8). The RF-SL8 and ∗RF-SL8 constructs, respectively, contain the SL8 codons preceded by either no in-frame ATG or with a stop codon in each of the three translational reading frames (see Fig. 2a)(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). MG-SL8 is identical with ∗RF-SL8, but with an in-frame ATG codon. Varying concentrations of indicated CsCl-purified plasmids were transfected into 2 × 104 Kb-COS cells by the DEAE-dextran procedure. Two days later, transfected cells were co-cultured with 1 × 105 SL8•Kb-specific B3Z T-cells. After overnight culture, antigen-specific lacZ activity induced in B3Z T-cells was determined by measuring conversion of the lacZ substrate chlorophenol red β-galactoside (CPRG) to chlorophenol red at 595 nm as described(15Shastri N.

Responses shown are means of duplicate cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A panel of DNA constructs (referred to as XGSL8) was prepared with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding SL8 octapeptide but preceded by varying translational initiation codons (Fig. 2a). The degenerate initiation codon was preceded by translational stop codons and followed by a glycine codon (GGA) to provide the essential features of the Kozak consensus sequence (RYYRYY ATGG) except for the ATG codon(19Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar, 20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA from randomly picked bacterial colonies was transfected into Kb-COS cells as APC. Two days later, transfected cells were assayed for the presence of the peptide•MHC complex by their ability to stimulate the SL8•Kb-specific B3Z T-cells. By this assay, ∼10% of the 367 recombinant plasmids tested scored positive (>2× over background), and 20 with the highest activity were selected for further analysis. Nucleotide sequences of these recombinants revealed seven different codons at the X(NNN) position, ATG (7Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C.

Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar), ATT(3Rammensee H.-G. Falk K. Rotzschke O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), TGG(2Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1992; 52: 1-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), ACG(1Brodsky F.M. Guagliardi L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 707-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), GCG(1Brodsky F.M. Guagliardi L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 707-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and GAT (1Brodsky F.M. Guagliardi L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 707-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). The frequency (7/367 = 1:53) of recombinants containing ATG was close to the theoretical frequency (1:64 codons) and thus validates the random representation of X codons tested in this screen. In addition, four other randomly picked recombinants that did not score positive in the screen were selected as negative controls.The relative efficiency of generating the SL8•Kb complex from these seven constructs was determined by transfecting DNA into Kb-COS cells and then measuring their ability to stimulate SL8•Kb-specific B3Z T-cells. Among these recombinants, the construct containing ATG as the translation initiation codon was clearly the most efficient (Fig. 2b). When compared at the optimal DNA concentration (100-300 ng/well), the T-cell stimulatory activity generated by the non-ATG constructs was within 2-10-fold that of the ATG construct and was within 10-100-fold when compared at half-maximal response. By contrast to these seven constructs, negligible T-cell stimulation was obtained with constructs containing CTA, TCT, GAA, or TTG as the X translation initiation codons (Fig. 2, b and c). These results clearly demonstrate that the usage of initiation codons in translation was not random. The seven codons identified by this assay included, besides ATG, 3 of the 4 (CTG, ATT, ACG, GTG) known non-ATG translational initiation codons(20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar, 21Mehdi H. Ono E. Gupta K.C. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the fourth known initiator codon, GTG, could have been used but may have been missed among the recombinants screened, a construct encoding GTG at the X position was prepared with synthetic oligonucleotides (Fig. 2a). This construct was transfected into Kb-COS cells, but, like the other negative control constructs, it was also inactive, further validating the screening strategy and emphasizing the non-random usage of X codons (Fig. 2c). Moreover, this result also indicates that relative efficiency differences exist among the non-ATG translation initiation codons. We conclude that Kb-MHC can present endogenous SL8 peptide synthesized via cryptic non-ATG translation initiation codons.We next assessed whether the translation initiation codons identified by the transient expression assay were also active when the DNAs were stably integrated. Stable transfectants were generated with murine Kb L-cells with these seven constructs. To control for possible differences in gene expression due to variable integration sites, pools ( ∼50-100 colonies) of G418-resistant cells were tested for their ability to stimulate SL8•Kb-specific B3Z T-cells. As a further internal control, the same transfectants were also tested in the same experiment with another T-cell hybrid, 27.5Z, that recognizes an endogenous and constitutively expressed peptide presented by Kb-MHC(17Sanderson S. Shastri N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 18Rotzschke O. Falk K. Faath S. Rammensee H.-G. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Transfectants with each of the seven constructs generated the SL8•Kb complex, while the parental Ltk - and Kb L-cells were incapable of stimulating B3Z T-cells (Fig. 3, a and b). Again, transfectants with the ATG construct were the most stimulatory, and relative differences in presentation with transfectants expressing the non-ATG constructs were similar to those obtained in transient transfections. The reasons for the somewhat different hierarchy of the non-ATG codons in stable versus transient transfectants are not clear, but may be due to species (murine versus simian) or to cell type (fibroblast versus kidney epithelium) differences. These relative differences in presentation efficiency were, however, limited to expression of the SL8•Kb complex, because the same transfectant cells yielded superimposable response profiles with Kb-restricted 27.5Z T-cells (Fig. 3, c and d). This result confirmed that Kb-MHC can present cryptic translation products derived from either transiently or stably expressed genes. The fortuitous presence of one or more of these alternate initiation codons upstream of the antigen coding sequences can also now satisfactorily explain how antigen presentation activity could have been obtained in our own (15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar) and in other previous studies (11Fetten J.V. Roy N. Gilboa E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lurquin C.

It was possible that, despite predominance of ATG as the most efficient translation initiation codon known(19Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar, 20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar), significant amounts of processed SL8 peptide may have been generated in cells expressing the non-ATG constructs. To directly measure the amount of processed peptides in cells, we assayed trifluoroacetic acid extracts prepared from the stable L-cell transfectants (Fig. 4). High levels of processed peptide were present in extracts of transfectants expressing the ATG construct. However, extracts of transfectants expressing either of the six non-ATG constructs were completely inactive (>300-fold lower yield). This result directly shows that the amounts of the SL8 gene product present in cells was profoundly influenced by the identity of the translation initiation codon, with ATG being by far the most effective. Nevertheless, despite the lack of detectable peptide in the extracts, APC transfected with non-ATG constructs presented the SL8•Kb complex in amounts sufficient to stimulate T-cells (Fig. 3). Due to the complexity of these trifluoroacetic acid extracts (4Van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S.

However, using synthetic SL8 peptide as a standard (sensitivity ∼1-3 pM)(15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar), and assuming quantitative recovery, we estimate that the amount of processed SL8 peptide obtained from non-ATG constructs was equal to or less than 30 SL8 copies/cell. This estimate sets the threshold of peptide•MHC required for T-cell stimulation within a magnitude of the theoretical limit of one peptide•MHC complex on the APC surface. Furthermore, this result directly demonstrates that T-cell assay is an extraordinarily sensitive measure of gene expression in APC.Figure 4:Quantitation of processed peptides extracted from stable Kb L-cells transfected with XGSL8 constructs.

Note that although the fidelity of translation initiation in vitro is often less stringent and was the basis for the discovery of the genetic code, translation initiation in living cells virtually always occurs at the ATG codon(22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). Examples of rare exceptions to this rule that allowed the discovery of non-ATG codons include transcription and growth factors, as well as viral proteins of unknown function(21Mehdi H. Ono E. Gupta K.C. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Taira M. Iizasa T. Shimada H. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Tatibana M. J. Biol.

One possible explanation proposed is that these genes use non-ATG initiation codons, despite their inefficient translation capacity(21Mehdi H. Ono E. Gupta K.C. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), because expression of these potent gene products must be kept extremely low(20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar). Thus, while the occurrence of cryptic translation is firmly established, its mechanism and its significance for biological regulation is yet to be clarified. By contrast to these normal genes where usage of the non-ATG codons is apparently promoted by stable RNA hairpin structures that cause stalling of the ribosome(21Mehdi H. Ono E. Gupta K.C. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), no such RNA structures were apparent in the constructs used by us and by others. Thus, it is unlikely that our artificial constructs were fortuitously favored for cryptic translation. Rather, a more attractive possibility is that cryptic translation could have resulted as a consequence of the high levels of constitutive transcription from viral promoters widely used in expression vectors. Whether similar conditions are possible for normal genes and whether any of the thousands of peptides displayed by MHC include cryptic translation products is not yet known. Conceivably, expression of viral genes in infected cells could be similar to the conditions tested in our experiments.Regardless of the mechanism of cryptic translation, the ability of MHC molecules to present vanishingly small amounts of endogenous peptides is relevant to the efficiency of the immune surveillance mechanism. Ideal surveillance of viral infection or of transformation events within cells requires that all cellular proteins be available as peptide•MHC for recognition by T-cells. However, MHC are constrained to present only consensus motif-bearing peptides(3Rammensee H.-G. Falk K. Rotzschke O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), of which only a small subset are apparently used(27Lipford G.B. Hoffman M. Wagner H. Heeg K. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1212-1222PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presentation of rare cryptic translation products by MHC molecules could be rationalized as a property of the antigen processing mechanism whose function is to ensure that the largest possible set of peptides is made available for survey by the T-cell repertoire. Indeed, the mechanism of cryptic translation and the capture of these small amounts of precursors by the antigen presentation pathway remain to be elucidated. Regardless of the mechanism, our results suggest that the identity of antigenic peptides for candidate vaccines (28Takahashi H. Takeshita T. Morein B. Putney S. Germain R.N. Berzofsky J.A.

The alternate translational initiation codons identified here could prove useful in these pursuits. INTRODUCTIONMajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmajor histocompatibility complexAPCantigen presenting cellOVAovalbuminNPnucleoprotein. class I molecules display peptides on the antigen presenting cell (APC) surface. CD8+ cytolytic T-cells probe these peptide•MHC complexes to identify and to subsequently eliminate cells that express foreign peptides. The fact that these peptides are derived from cellular proteins allows T-cells to detect intracellular pathogens or transformation events due to expression of new proteins (reviewed in (1Brodsky F.M. Guagliardi L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 707-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 2Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Adv.

Immunol. 1993; 11: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).The thousands of distinct peptides that are constitutively displayed by MHC depends upon the corresponding diversity of donor proteins that provide these peptides(4Van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.-G.

Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which cellular proteins are targeted to the processing pathway remains poorly understood. Some studies have proposed that these peptides are generated as by-products of normal turnover of cellular proteins(8Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The generality of this mechanism is, however, not clear because differences in antigen presentation activity often do not correlate with differences in stability of donor proteins(8Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1211-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 10Del Val M. Schlicht H.-J. Ruppert T.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternate mechansim, it has been proposed that these peptides are generated via a specialized pathway that does not depend upon protein turnover but instead involves novel transcriptional and/or translational mechanisms. Evidence in support of this latter mechanism, referred to as the “pepton hypothesis”(12Boon T. Van Pel A. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), comes from several independent studies that peptide•MHC complexes are generated in APC transfected with antigen genes despite the absence of obvious promoters or translation initiation sites(11Fetten J.V. Roy N. Gilboa E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lurquin C. Van Pel A. Mariamé B. De Plaen E. Szikora J.-P. Janssens C. Reddehase M.J. Lejeune J. Boon T.

Again, which one or more of the several possible mechanisms that can account for this phenomenon has not been yet determined.Our previous study confirmed that presentation of either ovalbumin (OVA)•Kb or influenza nucleoprotein (NP)•Db complexes did indeed occur in APC transfected with OVA or NP genes that were in inappropriate expression context (15Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast to other studies, our experiments suggested that presentation of peptide•MHC complexes was related to the translational mechanism. First, the relative differences in presentation activity correlated with particular translational reading frames of the peptide coding sequence. Second, and more significantly, the T-cell stimulating activity was completely abrogated by placing translational stops immediately upstream of the peptide coding sequence. How translation was obtained in the absence of the ATG translation initiation codon was not ascertained.In this report, we have analyzed the mechanism that accounts for the generation of these endogenous peptide•MHC complexes. We identified the cryptic translation initiation codons by screening a random set of codons that allowed presentation of the OVA257-264 (SL8)•Kb complex to T-cells. Interestingly, the seven codons thus identified include ATG, as well as three of four known non-ATG translational initiation codons. Furthermore, we show that despite the ability of these non-ATG codons to allow peptide/MHC expression, the amount of processed peptides in the cells remained below biochemical detection limits estimated to be less than 30 copies/cell. These findings explain previously surprising results and are important for understanding the mechanism of the endogenous peptide/MHC presentation pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1977669947,"The homologous cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes of aspartate aminotransferase (c- and mAspAT, respectively) seem to follow very different folding pathways after synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that the nascent proteins interact differently with molecular chaperones (Mattingly, J. R., Jr., Iriarte, A., and Martinez-Carrion, M.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26320-26327). In an attempt to discern the structural basis for this phenomenon, we have begun to study the effect of temperature on the refolding of the guanidine hydrochloride-denatured, purified proteins and their interaction with the groEL/groES molecular chaperone system from Escherichia coli. In the absence of chaperones, temperature has a critical effect on the refolding of the two isozymes, with mAspAT being more susceptible than cAspAT to diminishing refolding yields at increasing temperatures. No refolding is observed for mAspAT at physiological temperatures. The molecular chaperones groEL and groES can extend the temperature range over which the AspAT isozymes successfully refold; however, cAspAT can still refold at higher temperatures than mAspAT. In the absence of groES and MgATP, the two isozymes interact differently with groEL. groEL arrests the refolding of mAspAT throughout the temperature range of 0-45°C. Adding only MgATP releases very little mAspAT from groEL; both groES and MgATP are required for significant refolding of mAspAT in the presence of groEL. On the other hand, the extent to which groEL inhibits the refolding of cAspAT depends upon the temperature of the refolding reaction, only slowing the reaction at 0°C but arresting it completely at 30°C. MgATP alone is sufficient to effect the release of cAspAT from groEL at any temperature examined; inclusion of groES along with MgATP has no effect on the refolding yield but does increase the refolding rate at temperatures greater than 15°C. These results demonstrate that groEL can have significantly different affinities for proteins with highly homologous final tertiary and quarternary structures and suggest that dissimilarities in the primary sequence of the protein substrates may control the structure of the folding intermediates captured by groEL and/or the composition of the surfaces through which the folding proteins interact with groEL.

https://openalex.org/W2047796782,"Ribosomal protein S4 protects a characteristic set of bases in 16 S rRNA from attack by chemical probes. Use of hydroxyl radical as a probe of the RNA backbone shows that ribose residues in these same regions are also protected by S4, confirming the localization of its interactions with 16 S rRNA to the junction of five helical elements in the proximal region of the 5′ domain. At 0°C, the nucleotides protected by S4 from base-specific probes are confined almost exclusively to the two compound helices formed by residues 404-499. After subsequent heating of the complex briefly at 30 or 42°C, nucleotides in the three adjacent helices are additionally protected, resulting in a pattern of protection that is identical to that which is observed when S4 is incubated with 16 S rRNA under in vitro reconstitution conditions. Preincubation of the protein or the RNA (or both) separately at elevated temperature does not substitute for heating the S4•RNA complex. The regions in the RNA affected by the heat step are known to interact with proteins S12 and S16, both of which depend upon S4 for their binding to the RNA. Thus, the finding that S4 recruits additional sites of interaction in the RNA following its initial binding suggests a possible mechanism to insure the sequential addition of proteins during ribosomal assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1995217696,"Rat renal mitochondrial glutaminase (GA) is initially synthesized in primary cultures of proximal tubule cells as a 74-kDa precursor and is processed via a 72-kDa intermediate to generate a heterotetrameric enzyme which contains three 66-kDa subunits and one 68-kDa subunit (Perera, S. Y., Chen, T. C., and Curthoys, N. P.(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265,17764-17770). The two mature subunits may be derived by either of two possible mechanisms: 1) alternative proteolytic processing or 2) initial synthesis of the 66-kDa subunit followed by its covalent modification to generate the 68-kDa subunit. An in vitro system was utilized to further characterize this unique processing pathway and to investigate the potential function of the 68-kDa subunit. In vitro transcription and translation of the GA cDNA yields a single 74-kDa precursor. Upon incubation with isolated rat liver mitochondria, the precursor is translocated into the mitochondria and processed via a 72-kDa intermediate to yield a 3:1 ratio of the 66- and 68-kDa subunits, respectively. The kinetics of the in vitro processing reaction also closely approximate the kinetics observed in cultured cells. Mitochondrial processing is blocked by o-phenanthroline, an inhibitor of the matrix processing peptidase (MPP). The 72-amino acid presequence of the 66-kDa subunit contains a large proportion of basic amino acids. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of mature GA established that the 68-kDa subunit is slightly more basic than the 66-kDa subunit. In addition, incubation of the 74-kDa precursor with purified MPP yields equimolar amounts of the two mature peptides. A cDNA construct, pΔGA, was created which lacks the nucleotides that encode the amino acid residues 32 through 72 of GA. When transcribed and translated in vitro, pΔGA yields a 70-kDa precursor. This precursor is processed by mitochondria to a single mature subunit with a M of 66 kDa. This observation suggests that the 68-kDa subunit is not produced by covalent modification of the 66-kDa subunit and further supports the conclusion that the two mature subunits of GA are produced by alternative processing reactions which can be catalyzed by MPP. However, the yield of products obtained in intact mitochondria may be determined by some unidentified accessory factor. Submitochondrial fractionation of imported GA and ΔGA precursors suggest that the 68-kDa subunit may function to retain the mature GA within the mitochondrial matrix.

In vitro transcription and translation of the GA cDNA yields a single 74-kDa precursor. Upon incubation with isolated rat liver mitochondria, the precursor is translocated into the mitochondria and processed via a 72-kDa intermediate to yield a 3:1 ratio of the 66- and 68-kDa subunits, respectively. The kinetics of the in vitro processing reaction also closely approximate the kinetics observed in cultured cells. Mitochondrial processing is blocked by o-phenanthroline, an inhibitor of the matrix processing peptidase (MPP). The 72-amino acid presequence of the 66-kDa subunit contains a large proportion of basic amino acids. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of mature GA established that the 68-kDa subunit is slightly more basic than the 66-kDa subunit. In addition, incubation of the 74-kDa precursor with purified MPP yields equimolar amounts of the two mature peptides. A cDNA construct, pΔGA, was created which lacks the nucleotides that encode the amino acid residues 32 through 72 of GA. When transcribed and translated in vitro, pΔGA yields a 70-kDa precursor. This precursor is processed by mitochondria to a single mature subunit with a M of 66 kDa. This observation suggests that the 68-kDa subunit is not produced by covalent modification of the 66-kDa subunit and further supports the conclusion that the two mature subunits of GA are produced by alternative processing reactions which can be catalyzed by MPP. However, the yield of products obtained in intact mitochondria may be determined by some unidentified accessory factor. Submitochondrial fractionation of imported GA and ΔGA precursors suggest that the 68-kDa subunit may function to retain the mature GA within the mitochondrial matrix. Proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix are usually synthesized as cytosolic precursors. These precursors possess N-terminal extensions called presequences (Hartl and Neupert, 1990). It has been reported that the precursors are maintained in a loosely folded conformation by cytosolic heat shock proteins (Chen and Douglas, 1987; Eilers and Schatz, 1986; Eilers et al., 1988). The loosely folded conformation facilitates the interaction of the presequence with receptors present on the outer membrane of mitochondria. The precursor is translocated into the matrix of mitochondria with the help of the dynamic import machinery of the outer membrane and inner membrane (Hannavy et al., 1993). After the precursor enters the matrix, it is bound by mitochondrial heat shock proteins before the presequence is cleaved by resident matrix proteases. There are two proteases in the matrix of rat liver mitochondria, the matrix processing peptidase (MPP) 1The abbreviations used are: MPPmatrix processing peptidaseGAglutaminasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIMSintramembrane space. (Kleiber et al., 1990; Paces et al., 1993) and the matrix intermediate peptidase (Kalousek et al., 1992). MPP is composed of two subunits, α and β (Kalousek et al., 1993) and cleaves most mitochondrial precursors in a single step to yield the mature protein. Such precursors often contain an arginine residue at position −2 from the site of MPP cleavage. MPP acts on other mitochondrial precursors to yield an N-terminal octapeptide intermediate, and matrix intermediate peptidase removes 8 amino acids from the N terminus of this intermediate to generate the mature form. The octapeptide removed by matrix intermediate peptidase frequently contains a hydrophobic residue at position −8 and a serine, threonine, or glycine residue at position −5, relative to the amino terminus of the mature protein (Isaya et al., 1991). matrix processing peptidase glutaminase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis intramembrane space. The rat renal mitochondrial glutaminase (GA) initiates the catabolism of glutamine and participates in the increased renal ammoniagenesis and gluconeogenesis which occur in response to metabolic acidosis (Curthoys, 1988). It is a heterotetramer and is composed of three 66-kDa subunits 2The relative molecular masses of the GA subunits cited here differ slightly from previously published values. The estimates used in this study are based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence (Shapiro et al., 1991). and one 68-kDa subunit (Haser et al.,1985). The renal isozyme of GA is also expressed in the brain, small intestine, and fetal liver. GA-specific antibodies which were affinity purified versus the isolated 66-kDa subunit react with both the 66- and 68-kDa subunits of GA (Shapiro et al., 1987). The 66- and 68-kDa subunits purified from brain GA also generate nearly identical peptide maps when subjected to partial proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Shapiro et al., 1987). Therefore, the two subunits of GA share common immunological determinants and amino acid sequences. Thus, the two GA subunits may result from alternative processing of the presequence, or one subunit may be the product of a covalent modification reaction. Pulse-chase experiments performed on primary cultures of proximal convoluted tubular epithelial cells (Perera et al., 1990) and HTC-hepatoma cells (Perera et al., 1991) have suggested that GA is synthesized as a 74-kDa precursor and is processed via a 72-kDa intermediate to its mature forms. The reported data also indicate that the synthesis of the 66-kDa subunit occurs more rapidly and is initiated before synthesis of the 68-kDa subunit. Thus, the observed kinetics account for the final 3:1 ratio of peptides and suggest that the 68-kDa peptide may be produced by covalent modification of the 66-kDa subunit. A cDNA for GA has been isolated, cloned, and sequenced (Shapiro et al., 1991). In vitro transcription and translation of the GA cDNA yielded a single precursor of the correct molecular mass. Incubation of the precursor with isolated rat liver mitochondria results in the synthesis of the mature subunits of GA (Shapiro et al., 1991). These observations indicate that the mature form of GA arises from a single precursor protein which is generated from a single mRNA. A mitochondrial precursor giving rise to two different mature peptides is a novel discovery. Thus, investigation of GA synthesis should add a new dimension to the various known maturation pathways that nature has adopted as part of the biogenesis of mitochondria. In addition, characterization of the associated processing reaction may also shed light on the specificity of MPP and matrix intermediate peptidase action. The processing of the GA precursor and a modified GA precursor (ΔGA) which lacks amino acid residues 32 through 72 were further characterized in vitro using isolated mitochondria and purified processing peptidases. The resulting data suggest that 1) the 68-kDa subunit of mature GA arises by alternative processing of the presequence and not by a covalent modification of the 66-kDa subunit, 2) the entire processing reaction is catalyzed in vitro by purified MPP and is unaffected by purified matrix intermediate peptidase, and 3) the 68-kDa subunit of GA may function to retain the mature GA within the mitochondrial matrix. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were obtained from the Charles River Laboratory and maintained on Purina Rat Chow. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. RNAsin and T7 RNA polymerase were obtained from Promega and United States Biochemical Corp., respectively. Cell-free protein synthesis was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Pelham and Jackson, 1976; Jagus, 1987). Rat liver MPP was prepared as described previously (Isaya et al., 1991). The MPP preparation lacks any detectable matrix intermediate peptidase activity. GA antibodies were purified using DEAE Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) according to a previously described method (Shapiro et al., 1987). 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethyl benzidene stabilized substrate was obtained from Promega Corporation. Chemicals for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies for cytochrome oxidase complex III and monoamine oxidase were obtained from Dr. E. Bonilla (Columbia University) and Dr. Akio Ito (Kyushu University), respectively. A 300-base pair KpnI-MluI fragment was isolated by performing a KpnI digestion and a partial digestion with MluI on pGA 1-31,73-118CAT (Srinivasan et al., 1995). This fragment was cloned into KpnI-MluI-digested pGA to obtain pΔGA. In vitro transcriptions were carried out using T7 RNA polymerase (Krieg and Melton, 1987; Maniatis et al., 1989). The various plasmids were digested with BsshII to release the cDNA encoding GA or ΔGA with the T7 promotor immediately upstream. The fragments were purified from a low melting point agarose gel. A typical transcription reaction contained a final concentration of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM spermidine, 500 units/ml RNAsin, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 22 mM MgCl2, 4 mM each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 μg of template, and 200 units/ml of T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 min at 30°C. A fraction of the reaction was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the integrity of the RNA. The reaction mixture containing the transcribed RNA was stored frozen at −70°C, and aliquots were used for in vitro translations. The synthesis of proteins in vitro was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Pelham and Jackson, 1976; Jagus, 1987). A 100-μl translation reaction included a final concentration of 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.15-0.25 mM amino acid mixture minus methionine, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.2 units of creatine phosphokinase, 40 units of RNAsin, 10 μM hemin hydrochloride, 6 μl of [ 35S]methionine (30 μCi), and 75 μl of mRNA-dependent lysate. A 1-3-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture containing approximately 2 μg/μl of the transcribed RNA was pretreated with 3 mM methyl mercury hydroxide for 5 min at 25°C. The RNA sample was then added to 100 μl of translation reaction mixture and incubated at 30-32°C for 60 min. In vitro processing of the labeled precursors were carried out using rat liver mitochondria isolated as described previously (Cohen et al., 1985; Perera et al., 1991). The translocation reaction mixture containing 39 μl of mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate, 4 μl of 1 M phosphocreatine, 2 μl of creatine phosphokinase (200 units/ml), 5 μl of 30 mM ATP, 50 μl of freshly isolated mitochondria, and 50 μl of in vitro translate containing the labeled precursor protein was incubated at 28°C for 5-60 min. Following translocation, the mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g, washed, and solubilized in Triton X-100 containing rat brain extract (Haser et al., 1985). Rat brain extract contains brain GA which functions as a carrier and facilitates the immunoprecipitation of GA from in vitro translation and processing reactions (Perera et al., 1990). The samples were centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 30 min to remove any particulate material and incubated with GA-specific antibodies. The samples were shaken on a rotary shaker at 4°C for 120 min or left overnight at 4°C. The samples were gently overlaid on a 0.5 M sucrose cushion (500 μl) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C or room temperature. The pellets were washed twice with 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and once with 0.1% lithium dodecyl sulfate in homogenate buffer (0.33 M sucrose, 0.02 M Tris, 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) before the addition of sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Brain GA was immunoprecipitated with GA antibodies from a solubilized rat brain extract (Haser et al., 1985) containing 0.7 units of GA. The immunoprecipitates were collected by layering the solution over 0.5 M sucrose and centrifuging the samples for 10 min at 16,000 × g in a microfuge. The pellets were washed twice with 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 8, and once with 0.1% lithium dodecyl sulfate in homogenate buffer. The washed pellets were dissolved in sample buffer and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (O' Farrell, 1975). A 5-μl aliquot of the in vitro translation reaction was incubated with 1 μg of purified MPP at 28°C for 1 h (Isaya et al., 1991). The processed products were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (Laemmili, 1970) and fluorography. Mitochondria were prepared as described above and suspended in SEOMK buffer (Glick et al., 1992). A 200-μl volume of 0.375% digitonin in SEOMK buffer was added to 50 μl of mitochondria and mixed gently. The suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min and mixed once during the incubation. After the incubation the mitochondria were centrifuged at 10,000 × g in an SS-34 rotor. The pellet and supernatant obtained at this step were processed differently. The supernatant was transferred to another tube and centrifuged at 370,000 × g (83,000 revolutions/min) in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 30 min. The supernatant obtained after this step is the intramembrane space (IMS) fraction, and the pellet is the outer membrane fraction. Aliquots of both fractions were suspended in appropriate volumes of SDS sample buffer. The pellet obtained in the first step contains mitoplasts which contain about 85% of the total mitochondrial protein. The mitoplasts were suspended in SEOMK buffer to a protein concentration of 40 mg/ml and were treated with Lubrol to a final concentration of 0.18 mg/mg of mitochondrial protein. The mitoplasts were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 370,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor. The supernatant is the matrix fraction and the pellet is the inner membrane fraction. Both fractions were dissolved in suitable volumes of SDS sample buffer. Samples representing equivalent proportions of each of the submitochondrial fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies for monoamine oxidase (outer membrane marker), cytochrome oxidase complex III (inner membrane marker) and ornithine transcarbamylase (matrix marker). Immunoblotting of proteins were performed essentially as described (Towbin et al., 1979; Haser et al., 1985; Shapiro et al., 1987). Briefly, the mitochondrial proteins corresponding to the various fractions were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% gelatin and probed with the appropriate primary antibodies. The dilutions used were 1/1000 for monoamine oxidase and ornithine transcarbamylase and 1/5000 for cytochrome oxidase complex III. Goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseraddish peroxidase were used to bind to the primary antibodies, and the various mitochondrial markers were detected by color development due to horseradish peroxidase action on a chromogenic substrate (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidene stabilized substrate). An in vitro study of the different processing reactions of GA requires that the translocation into mitochondria and the processing reactions conform to certain established criteria. Therefore, the GA precursor was incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria under a variety of conditions that would determine the validity and reproducibility of the import process. We have previously shown that rat kidney mitochondria are unsuitable for in vitro processing studies owing to the presence of an uncharacterized protease (Perera et al., 1990). The radiolabeled GA precursor was synthesized in vitro, and 50 μl of the translation reaction mixture was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane 1). Equivalent volumes of the translation reaction were incubated with freshly thawed reticulocyte lysate and isolated rat liver mitochondria at 28°C. Import and processing of the GA precursor requires the addition of fresh reticulocyte lysate (Perera et al., 1990). After incubation, the mitochondria were sedimented, and both the supernatant and pellet fractions were individually immunoprecipitated with GA antibodies. When the 74-kDa precursor was incubated with mitochondria for 5 min (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3), the pellet contained predominantly the 72 kDa intermediate form of GA while the precursor remained in the supernatant, suggesting that the translocated precursor is rapidly processed to the intermediate. The 66 kDa form was also present in small amounts in the pellet but the 68 kDa form was not detected. These data corroborate the previous observation that the 66-kDa subunit appears to be synthesized at a faster rate than the 68-kDa subunit (Perera et al., 1990). When the incubation was allowed to continue for 90 min (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5), the 68- and 66-kDa mature subunits of GA and a small amount of the intermediate were observed in the mitochondrial pellet. In addition, very little of the precursor remained in the supernatant. These observations support the validity of the precursor-product relationship and indicate that the in vitro import reaction reproduces the processing reactions observed in vivo. Various controls established that the in vitro processing reaction requires a membrane potential, the presence of external ATP, and the involvement of proteinaceous receptors. The GA precursor is also not processed when the mitochondria were pretreated with 2 mMo-phenanthroline, an inhibitor of the MPP (Kleiber et al., 1990). To further establish the validity of the in vitro processing system, equal volumes of the translation reaction containing the radiolabeled GA precursor were incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria for different periods of time. The processed products present in the mitochondrial pellet were immunoprecipitated with GA antibodies and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 2A). The intensities of the various products in the fluorogram were quantitated, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of precursor utilized per import reaction and plotted versus time of incubation (Fig. 2B). Very little of the 74-kDa precursor was recovered from the pelleted mitochondria. However, with increasing time the amount of the 72-kDa peptide increases, peaks at about 10 min, and then decreases. This behavior is characteristic of an intermediate. The levels of the 66- and 68-kDa peptides increase with time and plateau. However, the 66-kDa subunit is synthesized at a faster rate than the 68-kDa subunit. The difference in rates of synthesis accounts for the 3:1 difference in the relative levels of the 66- and 68-kDa mature peptides. To determine whether the two subunits differ with respect to net charge, GA was immunoprecipitated from a solubilized rat brain extract and subjected to two-dimensional-PAGE (O'Farrell, 1975) with isoelectric focusing in one dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. After silver staining, the 68-kDa subunit was observed to be more basic than the 66-kDa subunit. The pI of each subunit was estimated from a plot of pH versus distance migrated (Fig. 3). The experimentally determined pI of 6.1 for the 66-kDa subunit agrees well with the pI of 6.0 calculated from the amino acid sequence. The experimentally obtained pI for the 68-kDa subunit was 6.4. A mature GA peptide which retained 20 or 30 additional amino acid residues from the C-terminal portion of the presequence would manifest a calculated pI of 6.3 or 6.4, respectively. Thus, the observed pI suggests that the 68-kDa subunit is produced by alternative processing of the GA precursor. MPP is the matrix protease that removes the N-terminal targeting signal from most cytosolically synthesized precursors of mitochondrial proteins. To further investigate the alternative processing hypothesis, radiolabeled GA precursor was synthesized in vitro and incubated either in the absence or presence of rat liver MPP (Fig. 4). Addition of MPP generates the two mature subunits of GA. The 72-kDa intermediate is masked by the intensity of the precursor and hence is not discernible on the gel. This observation confirms that the 66- and 68-kDa subunits arise by alternative processing of the N-terminal presequence. The addition of matrix intermediate peptidase neither cleaves the GA precursor nor alters the products generated by MPP (data not shown). In vitro transcription and translation of the ΔGA cDNA yields a 70-kDa precursor. To investigate its rate of translocation and processing, a kinetic analysis of ΔGA uptake and cleavage was performed. 35S-Labeled precursor was synthesized by in vitro translation and was incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria for the indicated periods of time. The mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resuspended samples were immunoprecipitated and processed for SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 5). A single processed product is observed within 5 min which continues to accumulate through 45 min of incubation. This single product exhibits an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the 66-kDa subunit of GA. A notable feature of this experiment is that an intermediate form is not synthesized. This implies that the synthesis of the intermediate form depends on the deleted stretch of amino acids. This also suggests that the synthesis of the intermediate form is not obligatory for the synthesis of the 66-kDa subunit. Earlier experiments have indicated that rat renal GA is located either in the matrix or is associated with the inner leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Curthoys and Weiss, 1974). The current experiments were performed to characterize the mitochondrial distribution of the in vitro processed products of GA and ΔGA precursors. Isolated mitochondria were subfractionated into four compartments with digitonin/Lubrol-WX. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies for monoamine oxidase (outer membrane marker), cytochrome oxidase complex III (inner membrane marker), and ornithine transcarbamylase (matrix marker) showed a preferential enrichment of the various marker enzymes in their respective compartments (data not shown). 35S-Labeled GA precursor was synthesized by in vitro translation and imported into isolated rat liver mitochondria. The mitochondria were then subfractionated with digitonin/Lubrol-WX. Aliquots of the outer membrane, IMS, inner membrane, and matrix fractions were immunoprecipitated with GA antibodies before performing SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 6). The processed GA peptides were found preferentially enriched in the matrix fraction suggesting that newly synthesized GA is initially localized in the matrix. When radiolabeled ΔGA precursor was synthesized in vitro and subjected to the same treatment, processed ΔGA was observed to be preferentially recovered from the IMS fraction. Thus, ΔGA is not retained in the matrix and leaks into the IMS. Hence the 68-kDa subunit may function to retain the GA inside the matrix either by participating in the assembly of the active tetrameric enzyme or by facilitating its association with other proteins. When the GA precursor was incubated with freshly thawed mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate and freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria, the precursor was translocated into the mitochondria and processed to its mature subunits (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). In the absence of added reticulocyte lysate, the import and processing reactions are significantly inhibited (data not shown). Thus, the reticulocyte lysate must possess factors that are required for GA import. When the precursor of GA was incubated with isolated mitochondria for increasing periods of time, the amount of precursor decreased to less than half its initial level within 5 min and to an undetectable level after 90 min of incubation. The 72-kDa intermediate rose sharply relative to the GA precursor, peaked at about 10 min, and then declined. This decrease in the level of the intermediate was matched by a commensurate increase in the amounts of the 66- and 68-kDa subunits of mature GA. The 66-kDa subunit accumulates at a faster rate than the 68-kDa subunit which accounts for the final 3:1 distribution of the 66- and 68-kDa subunits (Fig. 2). It is not clear at present how or why the 66-kDa subunit is synthesized in greater amounts. However, the observed kinetic profile confirms previous experiments and further establishes the origin of the two mature subunits as being produced from one precursor derived from a single mRNA (Shapiro et al., 1991). When mitochondria were treated with protease after translocation, the mature subunits were protected from degradation. Thus, the processed forms were present only inside the mitochondria. This observation also indicates that all of the processing reactions occur within mitochondria and are not due to leakage of the MPP into the external medium. Hence the mitochondrial preparation was intact and could be used in translocation studies. Investigation into the requirement of the 68-kDa subunit in the structure-function of GA necessitates a thorough understanding of the possible relationship between the 66- and 68-kDa subunits of GA. It is known from prior studies that the two peptides share common immunological determinants and contain large portions of similar amino acid sequences (Shapiro et al., 1987). Therefore, the possibility of the 68 kDa form being a covalently modified version of the 66 kDa form was considered (Perera et al., 1990). This hypothesis was proposed as a short term regulatory pathway to explain the observed increase in flux through renal GA upon acute acidosis and was supported by the observation that many mitochondrial proteins are fatty acylated (Vijayasarathy et al., 1989). Two potential covalent modifications, fatty acylation and phosphorylation were investigated. In vitro labeling experiments suggested that the 68-kDa peptide is neither derived by fatty acylation nor by phosphorylation of the 66-kDa subunit (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the previous conclusion that the increase in activity of GA during chronic metabolic acidosis is due to increased synthesis of the enzyme and not due to a modification of the existing enzyme (Curthoys et al., 1976). When the mature subunits of GA were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, the two subunits were observed to possess a different net charge (Fig. 3). The 68-kDa subunit was more basic. This also rules out the possibility that the 68-kDa peptide arises from phosphorylation of the 66-kDa peptide since this process would decrease the pI of the peptide. Given the high content of basic amino acids contained in the GA presequence (Shapiro et al., 1991), the observed difference in pI supports the hypothesis that the two subunits arise by alternative processing of the presequence. Incubation of the GA precursor with purified rat liver MPP yields both of the mature subunits of GA (Fig. 4). Furthermore, mitochondrial processing of the GA precursor is blocked by o-phenanthroline, a known inhibitor of MPP (Kleiber et al., 1990). Matrix intermediate peptidase does not cleave the presequence of GA (data not shown). It is unclear why MPP does not cleave all the precursor molecules to the 66-kDa subunit. A way to test this would be to treat the 72-kDa intermediate or the 68-kDa subunit with MPP individually. However, it was not possible to obtain sufficient amounts of the 72-kDa intermediate and the 68-kDa subunit from the in vitro processing reaction to perform the in vitro analysis with MPP. Regardless of the mechanism which results in the synthesis of the 66- and 68-kDa subunits, the current studies strongly support the conclusion that the two subunits result from alternative processing catalyzed by MPP. Alternative processing of the GA precursor by MPP invokes a critical role for the 68-kDa subunit in the structure and function of GA. In addition, elucidation of the role of the 68-kDa subunit may shed light on the structural features of the presequence that are recognized by the MPP complex. Furthermore, the formation of the 68-kDa subunit per se is intriguing because, as the precursor traverses the mitochondrial membranes, the site of cleavage that would give rise to the 68 kDa form would be exposed to the action of MPP first and yet the rapid synthesis of the 66-kDa subunit occurs before the synthesis of the 68-kDa subunit. This observation can be interpreted as follows. The preprotein is completely taken into the mitochondria before MPP can proteolytically process the presequence. Once inside the mitochondria, MPP may be biased to recognize elements of the presequence that are essential for the synthesis of the 66 kDa form and/or the processing reaction that gives rise to the 68-kDa subunit is made rate-limiting due to other accessory factors. Such effects result in increased synthesis of the 66-kDa subunit and hence the synthesis of the 68 kDa form is not observed during early time periods. The processing of the GA presequence by MPP may be regarded as unbiased because in vitro incubation of the precursor with MPP yields both subunits in approximately equal amounts. Therefore, synthesis of the 68-kDa subunit might be a crucial step in the assembly or localization of GA. The function of the 68-kDa subunit was investigated by using a deletion construct of the GA cDNA which encodes a precursor that is processed to yield only the 66-kDa subunit (Fig. 5). The processing reaction was extremely slow suggesting that the deleted amino acid sequence is required for efficient MPP processing in the mitochondria. However, the synthesis of the 68-kDa subunit was completely obliterated. This suggests that the larger subunit is not produced by covalent modification of the 66-kDa subunit and further supports the alternative processing hypothesis. It is not known whether the N terminus of the putative 66-kDa subunit is identical to that of the 66-kDa subunit of mature GA. However, this construct was used to investigate a possible function of the 68-kDa subunit. Submitochondrial fractionation experiments have suggested that GA is loosely associated with the inner leaflet of the IM. However, GA translocated in vitro was largely recovered from the matrix fraction (Fig. 6). This suggests that GA synthesized de novo is retained in the matrix of the mitochondria. In contrast, the processed form of ΔGA was recovered primarily from the IMS with some present in the matrix (Fig. 6). This suggests that the processed ΔGA had leaked from the matrix space. Hence the 68-kDa subunit might be involved in retaining GA in the matrix by helping GA to fold into the appropriate quaternary structure. This would imply that pre-ΔGA is still targeted to the matrix and that the deletion does not affect translocation of the preprotein. The alternative interpretation that processed ΔGA was directly translocated to the IMS without going through the matrix seems unlikely because of three reasons: 1) such a premise would predict the complete absence of the processed forms in the matrix, 2) the required MPP is present only in the matrix, and 3) proteins that are processed by MPP and eventually accumulate in the IMS require the presence of hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence (Glick et al., 1992) and an additional cleavage by an intramembrane peptidase (Nunnari et al., 1993). The amino acid sequence of ΔGA lacks such membrane spanning regions. Thus, the formation of the 68-kDa subunit may not only be required for efficient processing of the precursor by the MPP complex but also for retention of the mature enzyme at the correct intramitochondrial location. The large amount of ΔGA precursor associated with each submitochondrial fraction may reflect the slow rate of processing. GA may be compartmentalized with other enzymes in the matrix or peripherally associated with other enzymes of the inner membrane (Fahien et al., 1989; Schoolwerth and LaNoue, 1980). Such interactions could be facilitated if the N terminus of the 68-kDa subunit contains the 2 tryptophan residues (residues 57 and 58) of the presequence of GA (Shapiro et al., 1991). Tryptophan residues are present in low abundance in soluble proteins, and the occurrence of two adjacent tryptophan residues implies a critical function (Schiffer et al., 1992). A recent study suggests that tryptophan residues present in mitochondrial creatine kinase aid in catalytic activity, interfacial interactions between dimers, and possibly in the formation of octameric structures (Gross et al., 1994). Thus, these 2 tryptophan residues might aid in the hydrophobic association of GA with other inner membrane or matrix enzymes. To further establish that renal mitochondrial GA is a product of alternative processing of its presequence, we attempted to sequence the 68-kDa subunit. We also attempted to radiosequence the 68-kDa subunit generated from the in vitro processing of [3H]proline- or [3H]leucine-labeled GA precursor. However, neither the amount of peptide isolated nor the level of radioactivity incorporated was sufficient to obtain interpretable sequencing data. Therefore, we are currently developing procedures to overexpress GA and the various chimeric constructs of GA (Srinivasan et al., 1995) in bacteria. Treatment of the purified precursor with MPP should yield an amount of the 68-kDa subunit sufficient for sequencing. We thank Laurie Minamide for her assistance with two-dimensional gels."
https://openalex.org/W2069205873,"Microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 is a multidomain cytoskeletal protein that copurifies with brain microtubules (MTs) through repeated cycles of warm polymerization and cold disassembly. Recent equilibrium binding studies of high molecular weight MAP-2ab to taxol-stabilized MTs suggest that the interactions are highly cooperative, as indicated by sigmoidal binding curves, non-linear Scatchard plots, and an apparent all-or-none response in MAP binding in titration experiments (Wallis, K.

To learn more about the mechanism of MAP-2 binding to MTs, we investigated the binding properties of bacterially expressed MT-binding region (MTBR) of bovine brain MAP-2.

The stoichiometry was 1-1.1 mol of MTBR/mol of tubulin dimer, and the dissociation constant for the MTBR was 1.1 μM. Bovine brain tau protein competitively inhibited MAP-2 binding, as evidenced by an increased K d value for MTBR binding to MTs. Although the second repeat peptide m2 (VTSKCGSLKNIRHRPGGG) is thought to play a dominant role in MAP-2 binding to MTs, a MTBR mutant (with m2 replaced by the third octadecapeptide repeat m3) displays an K d of 2.8 ± 0.1 μM and stoichiometry of 0.9 ± 0.05 mol of MTBR/mol of tubulin dimer. Another mutant with additional copies of the second repeat, designated by us as MTBR[m 12m2m 32], displayed noncooperative binding with a K d of 0.53 ± 0.05 μM and a stoichiometry of 2.2 ± 0.2 mol of mutant MTBR/tubulin dimer. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments demonstrated that the wild-type MTBR is monomeric, whereas MTBR[m 12m2m 32] selfassociates to a stable dimer over the concentration range used in our MT binding studies. This finding indicates that only one of the two MT-binding sites on the dimer is probably linked to a microtubule at any given time. Microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 is a multidomain cytoskeletal protein that copurifies with brain microtubules (MTs) through repeated cycles of warm polymerization and cold disassembly. Recent equilibrium binding studies of high molecular weight MAP-2ab to taxol-stabilized MTs suggest that the interactions are highly cooperative, as indicated by sigmoidal binding curves, non-linear Scatchard plots, and an apparent all-or-none response in MAP binding in titration experiments (Wallis, K.

The inner wall of a glass capillary was coated with a phospholipid bilayer of 25% phosphatidylserine and 75% phosphatidylcholine. Prothrombinase was assembled on this bilayer by perfusion with a mixture containing an excess of factor Va (2 nM) and a limiting amount of factor Xa (1-100 pM), either in the absence or presence of prothrombin. The rate of assembly of prothrombinase in the presence of prothrombin appeared to be limited by the transfer rate of factor Xa to the phospholipid surface. A good agreement was found between the predicted mass transfer coefficient for factor Xa and the observed pre-steady state rate of thrombin production. The eventually obtained steady state rates of thrombin production were proportional to the prothrombin concentration and independent of the surface density of prothrombinase. The observed rate of thrombin production was in excellent agreement with the predicted mass transfer rate for prothrombin. Transport-limited prothrombin conversion was observed for prothrombinase densities exceeding 1 fmol/cm2, which corresponds to 0.05% occupation of available binding sites. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were determined at low prothrombinase densities (0.02-0.04 fmol/cm2). Even in this situation the Michaelis-Menten equation had to be corrected for substrate depletion near the catalytic surface. We hereto employed an accurate approximation of the mass transfer coefficient. The kinetic parameter k cat was 60 s -1 and the intrinsic K m had a surprisingly low value of 3 nM.

Both parameters were not influenced by the wall shear rate. The process of blood coagulation encompasses a complex system of enzymatic reactions in flowing blood at the surface of damaged blood vessels. One of the final steps in this process is the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin(1Jackson C.M. Nemerson Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 765-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activator of prothrombin is a multicomponent complex that consists of the serine protease factor Xa and the non-enzymatic cofactor factor Va. In the presence of calcium ions, the complex of factor Xa and factor Va assembles on a membrane containing negatively charged phospholipids, i.e. phosphatidylserine(3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B.

Other cells like monocytes and endothelial cells have also been reported to support prothrombin activation by providing such a procoagulant surface(7Tracy P.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 743-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rodgers G.M. Shuman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Prothrombin activation at a macroscopic surface under flow conditions has been studied in our laboratory. We previously reported on prothrombin activation in a tubular flow reactor(9Schoen P. Lindhout T. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Hemostas. 1990; 64: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The findings of that study seemed to contrast with the findings on prothrombin activation at planar phospholipid bilayers(10Willems G.M. Giesen P.L.A. Hermens W.Th. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Giesen P.L.A. Willems G.M. Hermens W.Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1379-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, during continuous flow through the tubular flow reactor, the rate of thrombin production appeared to be dependent on the prothrombin concentration in the bulk solution up to about 1 μM. Studies with an uniformly accessible surface, as offered by the rotating disc, however, showed that the concentration of prothrombin in the bulk solution that is required for the half-maximum rate of prothrombin conversion was about 7 nM(10Willems G.M. Giesen P.L.A. Hermens W.Th. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper we describe the results of a kinetic study on prothrombin activation in a tubular flow reactor. Our major goal was to identify the experimental settings, with respect to flow rate, substrate concentration, and prothrombinase surface density, that allow us to derive kinetic parameters from the thrombin production data. Hereto we explored the conditions that gave rates of thrombin production proportional to the true catalytic activity of prothrombinase and thus independent of the rate of transfer of prothrombin from the bulk solution to the catalytic surface. We, therefore, have carefully evaluated the transport limit in the flow reactor and used the theoretical considerations of mass transfer given by Brown(12Brown G.M. A. I. Ch. E. Journal. 1960; 6: 179-183Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Our findings support previous proposals that at a macroscopic phospholipid surface prothrombin activation by prothrombinase is extremely efficient because very low concentrations of prothrombin (a few nanomolar) are required to obtain half-maximal velocity of thrombin production(10Willems G.M. Giesen P.L.A. Hermens W.Th. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Giesen P.L.A. Willems G.M. Hermens W.Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1379-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also addressed the question whether the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase was influenced by the wall shear rate, as has been reported for factor X activation in a flow reactor(13Gemmell C.H. Turitto V.T. Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 1404-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gemmell C.H. Nemerson Y. Turitto V. Microvasc. Res. 1990; 40: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Sigma. The chromogenic substrate for thrombin, S2238, was from Chromogenix, Möhldal, Sweden. All chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available. Human factor Xa, human prothrombin, and bovine factor Va were prepared and quantified as described(9Schoen P. Lindhout T. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Hemostas. 1990; 64: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bovine factor Va was further purified on a Mono S column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described by Rosing et al.(15Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after loading the column with bovine factor Va, a linear gradient of 0.05-1 M NH4Cl was applied. Factor Va activity was eluted in two peaks at 0.45 and 0.75 M NH4Cl. Throughout this study we used factor Va eluted at the higher salt concentration. The glass capillaries (0.65 and 0.29 mm internal diameter and 127 mm length) obtained from Brand AG, Wertheim, Germany were boiled for 10 min in a 1:1:5 solution of NH4OH (25%), H2O2 (30%), and H2O for 10 min and rinsed in deionized water. They were then boiled in a 1:1:6 solution of HCl (37%), H2O2 (30%), and H2O for 10 min and rinsed in deionized water. The clean and hydrophilic capillaries were kept at 4°C in deionized water. Before use the capillaries were dried under a stream of N2. The capillary was filled with a suspension of unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 75 mol % egg phosphatidylcholine and 25 mol % brain phosphatidylserine, prepared as described before(15Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 20 min of incubation with the 1 mM phospholipid suspension, the capillary was rinsed with Tris-buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 175 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mg bovine serum albumin/ml, pH 7.9) containing 3 mM CaCl2 at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min for 2 min to remove non-bound phospholipid(9Schoen P. Lindhout T. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Hemostas. 1990; 64: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Gemmell C.H. Turitto V.T. Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 1404-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flow system was as described by Contino et al.(16Contino P. Repke D. Nemerson Y. Thromb. Hemostas. 1991; 66: 138-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the phospholipid-coated capillary is attached to a Hamilton gas-tight syringe. The flow is controlled by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Co., South Natich, MA). An XYZ translation table (Isel, Eiterfelt, Germany) was used to collect samples (typically 30 μl) from the tip of the flow reactor into disposable cuvettes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) containing 20 mM EDTA in Tris-buffer. Thrombin was measured in the cuvette after the addition of the chromogenic substrate S2238 as described previously(9Schoen P. Lindhout T. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Hemostas. 1990; 64: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 37°C. The amount of factor Xa bound to the phospholipid bilayer in the flow reactor was determined at the end of each experiment. To this end the capillary was rinsed with Tris-buffer containing 3 mM CaCl2 and factor Va (2 nM) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 5 min to remove prothrombin and thrombin. The capillary was then eluated with Tris buffer containing 5 mM EDTA at 30 μl/min for 5 min. The effluent was collected and assayed for factor Xa. The factor Xa-containing samples were diluted in Tris buffer containing 3 mM CaCl2. An aliquot (30 μl) of the dilution was added to a cuvette containing 108 μl of Tris buffer containing 1.4 nM factor Va, 14 μM phospholipid (25% phosphatidylserine, 75% phosphatidylcholine), and 3 mM CaCl2. Thrombin production was started by the addition of 12 μl of a 5 μM prothrombin solution and stopped after 4 min by the addition of 390 μl of 20 mM EDTA in Tris buffer. The amount of thrombin formed was determined by adding 60 μl of S2238 (2.5 mM) and reading of the optical density at 405 nm. Reference curves were constructed from known amounts of factor Xa. The transfer of prothrombin by convection and diffusion to the capillary wall becomes easily rate-limiting(17Levich V.G. Physicochemical Hydrodynamics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1962: 112-116Google Scholar, 18Kobayashi T. Laidler K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 1974; 66: 99-118Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This results in depletion of the prothrombin in the solution near the wall and thus a steady state concentration C(r,z) is established, which depends on the radial co-ordinate r and on the axial co-ordinate z. The concentration C(r,z) is a solution of the convective diffusion equation(17Levich V.G. Physicochemical Hydrodynamics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1962: 112-116Google Scholar, 18Kobayashi T. Laidler K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 1974; 66: 99-118Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) : D(δ2Cδ2r+1δCrδr+δ2Cδ2z)-2Vf(1-r2R2)δCδz=0(Eq. 1a) with D the diffusion constant of the protein, Vf the mean fluid flow velocity and R the radius of the capillary. At the entrance of the capillary, z = 0, C is equal to the perfusion concentration Cb: C(r,0)=Cb(Eq. 1b) and at the capillary wall the diffusional flux must balance the conversion rate: DδC(R,z)δr=Vm(z)C(R,z)C(R,z)+Km(Eq. 1c) with V m the maximal conversion rate per unit area and K m the Michaelis constant. For high values of V m, i.e. for high densities of prothrombinase at the capillary wall, maximal thrombin production and therefore maximal mass transfer of prothrombin by convection and diffusion is attained. According to boundary condition (c), this corresponds to a concentration at the wall that approaches zero. The boundary condition (c) thus can be replaced by C(R,z)=0(Eq. 1d) A convenient and simple approximate solution of the boundary value problem (a, b, and d) was derived by Leveque (19Leveque M.A. Ann. Mines Mem. 1928; 13: 201-239Google Scholar) using the assumption that the boundary layer of substrate depletion is small compared to the capillary diameter. With this so called Leveque approximation, the total mass transfer, Jt (mol/s), is given by: Jt=5.4 D2/3Q1/3L2/3Ch=ΔtCb(Eq. 2) where D is the diffusion constant of the substrate (cm2/s), Q the volumetric flow rate (cm3/s), L the length of the capillary (cm), and Cb the substrate concentration at the inlet (mol/cm3). The total mass transfer can thus expressed as the mass transfer coefficient Δt (cm3/s) times the substrate concentration Cb. It should be noted that the mass transfer rate Jz, expressed in mol/cm2/s, depends on the distance z downstream from the capillary inlet: Jz=DδCnδzCb=0.57 D1/3(Q1/3/R)z-1/3Cb=ΔzCb(Eq. 3) with C o the solution of boundary value problem (a, b, and d) with C b = 1 and Δ z the local mass transfer coefficient (cm/s) which declines steeply in the downstream direction. For low flow rates and relatively long capillaries of small diameter, the depletion layer, however, spans the entire capillary and the Leveque approximation becomes invalid. The depletion at the end of the capillary can be estimated by as: Cend/Cb=1-J/(QCb)=1-5.4 D2/zQ-2/hL2/h(Eq. 4) For a capillary with R = 0.032 (cm), L = 12.7 (cm), a diffusion constant D = 10 -6 (cm2/s) and a flow rate Q = 5 × 10 -4 (cm3/s), this amounts to C end/Cb= 0.53 and will overestimate the transport rate by about 20%. Errors of this size can be avoided by employing the semianalytical approximate solution to the full problem (a, b, and d) as presented by Brown (12, and Equation 15 and Table I therein). The equation, which allows the calculation of the total mass transfer coefficient Δt for a given flow rate and diffusion coefficient, is rather unwieldy. We, therefore, should like to confine ourselves to refer the reader to the paper of Brown(12Brown G.M. A. I. Ch. E. Journal. 1960; 6: 179-183Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Table 1 lists the numerical values calculated on basis of Brown's semianalytical approximate solution for the total mass transfer coefficient, Δt, for prothrombin and factor Xa under the flow conditions used in our experiments. Also given are the mass transfer coefficients calculated on the basis of the Leveque approximation(19Leveque M.A. Ann. Mines Mem. 1928; 13: 201-239Google Scholar). It is apparent that prothrombin transport is overestimated by 10-30% in the latter approximation.Tabled 1 For lower surface concentrations of prothrombinase, a partial depletion of prothrombin near the capillary wall is obtained, i.e.Cb >C(R,z) >0, and in this situation the thrombin generation rate is determined by the solution of the boundary value problem (a, b, and c). Due to the non-linearity in the boundary condition (c) this boundary value problem is intractable for analytical solutions for general distributions of enzyme activity V m(z) and requires a numerical treatment(18Kobayashi T. Laidler K.J. Biotech. Bioeng. 1974; 66: 99-118Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) . The special situation, however, is that the enzyme activity on the capillary wall is proportional to the local mass transfer rate: Vm(z)=βDδCo(R,z)δz(Eq. 5) with β as proportionality constant, allows a simple solution of this problem. It is easily verified that C(r,z)=(Cb-Cm)Ca(r,z)-Cm(Eq. 6) with Cw the substrate concentration at the capillary wall (independent of z) and Co the solution of (a, b, and d) with Cb = 1 satisfies a and the boundary condition (b). Boundary condition (c) is equivalent to second-order equation in Cw, which is independent of z: (Cb-Cm)DδCa(R,z)δz=βDδCo(R,z)δzCw/(Cw+Km)(Eq. 7) Integration of this expression over the inner surface of the capillary results in J1=Δt(Cb-Cm)=VmCm/(Cm+km)(Eq. 8) with Jt the total thrombin generation (mol/s) and Vm the maximal thrombin production rate (mol/s) of the capillary. allows the following explicit solution: Jt=0.5Δt[Cb+Km+Vm/Δt- (Cb-Km-Vm/Δt)2+4KmCb](Eq. 9) Non-linear regression of this equation to measured thrombin production rates as a function of the perfusion concentration Cb of prothrombin then allows the determination of the parameters Vm and Km. Phospholipid-coated capillaries were perfused with solutions containing factor Va (2 nM), prothrombin (0.2 μM), and varying amounts of factor Xa (5-20 pM). It was expected that ongoing perfusion would result in assembly of increasing amounts of prothrombinase at the inner wall of the phospholipid-coated capillary which in turn results in increasing rates of thrombin production. Fig. 1 illustrates that the time to reach the steady state levels of thrombin production decreased with increasing amounts of factor Xa in the perfusion solution. Evidently, because a molar excess of factor Va over factor Xa was used, the rate of assembly of the prothrombinase complex at the macroscopic surface is limited by the transport of factor Xa and/or preformed factor Xa-factor Va complexes from the bulk solution to the surface. The initial part of the thrombin generation curve, therefore, reflects the rate of formation of prothrombinase activity at the phospholipid bilayer, and this rate will increase with increasing amounts of factor Xa in the perfusion mixture. It is also evident from Fig. 1 that the rate of thrombin formation reached a steady state value independent of the amount of factor Xa present. Under the flow conditions used and with 0.2 μM prothrombin in the perfusion solution, the maximum rate of thrombin formation was 1.5 pmol/min. Table 1 predicts a maximal mass transfer of 2.2 pmol prothrombin/min for a prothrombin concentration of 0.2 μM. Therefore, an obvious explanation for the identical steady state levels is that in each experiment the prothrombin converting capacity of the capillary wall ultimately exceeded the transport limit. The alternative explanation that in all experiments the prothrombinase concentration at the wall surface reached a maximal value was refuted by determination of the prothrombinase densities attained in these experiments. The amount of phospholipid-bound factor Xa at the end of the perfusion increased linearly with the factor Xa concentration in the perfusion mixture. Thus, 0.34, 0.65, and 1.13 fmol factor Xa/cm2 was bound after 28 min perfusion with a mixture containing 0.2 μM prothrombin, 2 nM factor Va, and 5, 10, or 20 pM factor Xa, respectively. Thus, despite widely different surface densities of prothrombinase we observed identical rates of thrombin production. It is important to note that when factor Xa was perfused in the absence of factor Va, no factor Xa could be detected in the EDTA effluent of the capillary. Thus, the amount of prothrombinase in the phospholipid-coated capillary is represented by the amount of factor Xa found in the EDTA effluent. Since the rate of thrombin production seemed to be limited not by the prothrombinase binding capacity of the phospholipid-coated capillary, but by the rate of supply of substrate to the catalytic surface, we expected to find that the steady state rate of thrombin production should be proportional to the concentration of prothrombin in the perfusion solution (see). Thus, phospholipid-coated capillaries were perfused with varying concentrations of prothrombin in the presence of fixed amounts of factor Xa (50 pM) and factor Va (2 nM). The steady state rates of thrombin production are presented in Table 2 as a function of the prothrombin concentration. It is seen that the rate of thrombin production increased linearly with the prothrombin concentration. Table 2 also gives the rate of transport of prothrombin to the catalytic surface as a function of the prothrombin concentration in the perfusion solution. These values were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mass transfer coefficient was taken from Table 1. The close agreement between the experimental rate of thrombin production and the rate of prothrombin transport to the catalytic surface strongly indicates that the system employed behaves as predicted by the hydrodynamic theory.Tabled 1 Phospholipid-coated capillaries were first perfused with factor Va (2 nM) and varying concentrations of factor Xa (2.5-100 pM) during 10 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min to obtain controlled amounts of prothrombinase. Subsequently, the prothrombinase-containing capillaries were perfused with prothrombin (0.5 μM) in the presence of factor Va (2 nM). An increase of the factor Xa concentration in the first perfusion solution from 2.5 to 25 pM gave an increase of the steady state rate of thrombin production upon perfusion with 0.5 μM prothrombin. Preperfusion of the phospholipid capillaries with factor Xa concentrations higher than 25 pM did not result in higher rates of thrombin production. To assess the amount of prothrombinase in the capillary, we rinsed the capillary at the end of the perfusion experiment with EDTA and assayed the effluent for factor Xa activity. Fig. 2 clearly shows that whereas the amount of factor Xa bound to the inner wall of the phospholipid-coated capillary increased proportionally with the factor Xa concentration of the first perfusion mixture, that also contained a fixed amount of factor Va (2 nM), the steady state rate of thrombin production did not further increase when the factor Xa (prothrombinase) surface density was greater than 0.6 fmol factor Xa/cm2. We note that the maximum steady state rate of thrombin production in this experiment was 2.5-fold higher than the maximum rate found when a phospholipid-coated capillary was perfused with a mixture that contained factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin as shown in Fig. 1. This difference in rates of thrombin production is readily explained by a 2.5-fold difference in prothrombin concentration of the perfusion solutions. It is apparent that under the conditions of this experiment (wall shear rate of 20 s -1 and prothrombin concentration of 0.5 μM) the rate of thrombin production becomes independent of the amount of phospholipid-bound enzyme when the prothrombinase density exceeded 0.6 fmol/cm2. To assess the kinetic parameters of prothrombinase bound to a macroscopic phospholipid bilayer under flow, phospholipid-coated capillaries were first perfused with 0.5 pM factor Xa in the presence of 2 nM factor Va during 10 min at a wall shear rate of 20 s -1. This preperfusion resulted in about 0.02 fmol of prothrombinase/cm2 which was assumed to be sufficiently low to avoid significant depletion of prothrombin near the catalytic surface (Fig. 2). Subsequently, the capillaries were perfused with varying concentrations of prothrombin in the presence of factor Va (2 nM), and rates of thrombin production were determined from the steady state levels of thrombin at the outlet of the flow reactor. At the end of each perfusion experiment, factor Xa was quantitatively recovered from the flow reactor to establish the prothrombinase surface density. Fig. 3 gives the rates of thrombin production obtained from perfusion experiments in which a capillary with a prothrombinase density of 0.014 fmol/cm2 was perfused with increasing prothrombin concentrations (2-80 nM) at a wall shear rate of 20 s -1 and another capillary (0.018 fmol prothrombinase/cm2) at a wall shear rate of 3000 s -1. The different wall shear rates were obtained by using capillaries with an internal diameter of 0.65 mm at a flow rate of 30 μl/min and capillaries with an internal diameter of 0.29 mm at a flow rate of 440 μl/min. The data as shown in Fig. 3 were analyzed by a non-linear fit to a rectangular hyperbola to obtain apparent Kmm and Vmax values. The calculated data points are presented by the solid line. The same experiment was performed with a 2-3-fold higher prothrombinase density in the flow reactor. Table 3 summarizes the apparent kinetic constants that were determined under the different experimental conditions. A large variation in Km as well as k cat is seen. Noteworthy is the high Km when a small diameter capillary with a high prothrombinase density is perfused with prothrombin at a low wall shear rate. This difference is readily explained by depletion of prothrombin near the catalytic surface. That is, when thrombin production is partly limited by the transport of prothrombin to the catalytic surface, higher prothrombin concentrations in the perfusion solution are required to saturate half the prothrombinase in the flow reactor. Kinetic parameters should be calculated from the steady state rate of thrombin production and the prothrombin concentration near the catalytic surface. Therefore, Km and k cat values were obtained by fitting observed rates of thrombin production and prothrombin concentrations in the perfusion solution to (see “Experimental Procedures”). The intrinsic kinetic parameters thus obtained are also listed in Table 3. From these data we conclude that both Km and k cat are independent of the experimental conditions such as the prothrombinase density and the wall shear rate. Of particular interest is the low Km of 3 nM.Tabled 1 We have characterized the kinetics of prothrombin activation by the complex of factor Va and factor Xa assembled at the macroscopic phospholipid surface of a tubular flow reactor. The present study confirms an earlier observation from our group (10Willems G.M. Giesen P.L.A. Hermens W.Th. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Giesen P.L.A. Willems G.M. Hermens W.Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1379-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that on macroscopic lipid bilayers the Michaelis constant Km is much lower than reported for prothrombin activation at the surface of unilamellar vesicles with a radius of 20-30 nm. It was noticed that the Km decreased with increasing phospholipid area per molecule of the factor Xa-factor Va complex. Indeed the Km was depressed by a factor of 4 when large unilamellar vesicles (radius of 60-80 nm) were used. Moreover, it was shown that on planar phospholipid bilayers, with an area of 1 μm2/prothrombinase complex, the Km was 6-7 nM and thus 25-fold smaller than the Km (170 nM) on small unilamellar vesicles. This marked difference was attributed to an efficient collection of prothrombin from solution by a macroscopic surface, whereas the Km on small unilamellar vesicles represents an apparent value reflecting the limited transport rate of prothrombin from solution to the vesicle(10Willems G.M. Giesen P.L.A. Hermens W.Th. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Giesen P.L.A. Willems G.M. Hermens W.Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1379-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phospholipid bilayers in these studies were present on a slide opposite a stirring bar or on a rotating disc. The latter system especially has the advantage that it presents a uniform accessible surface, with a uniform mass transfer coefficient over the entire surface. The capillary flow system used in the present study has the advantage of an extremely stable and well defined fluid flow. Another advantage is the high surface/volume ratio (0.05 cm2/μl) of the capillary. Its potential disadvantage is the steep decline of the mass transfer rate in the downstream direction (). This could complicate the analysis of the intermediate enzyme kinetics. This potential disadvantage is, however, largely circumvented by the transport limited assembly of prothrombinase (see below), which implies a local prothrombinase activity proportional to the mass transfer coefficient and therefore the applicability of and (see “Experimental Procedures”) for the analysis of the experimental data. Our initial experiments, in which the phospholipid-coated capillary was perfused with a solution of factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin showed that at a shear rate of 20 s -1 the rate of thrombin production became independent of the prothrombinase density at the surface when that density was greater than 1 fmol/cm2 and the prothrombin concentration of the perfusion solution was 0.5 μM. From reported binding data(20Pusey M.L. Mayer L.D. Wei G.J. Bloomfield V.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5262-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Higgins D.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6503-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we could calculate a maximum binding capacity of our phospholipid bilayer between 2 and 10 pmol prothrombinase/cm2. Thus, a fractional occupation of about 0.05% is sufficient to enter a regime of thrombin production that is controlled by the mass transfer rate of prothrombin. From the data shown in Fig. 1, we also could estimate the rate at which prothrombinase was assembled during the initial phase of the thrombin production curve. If we assume a turnover of 60 s -1 (Table 3), then the initial slopes of thrombin production indicate rates of prothrombinase formation of 0.05, 0.10, and 0.18 fmol/min with, respectively, 5, 10, and 20 pM factor Xa in the perfusion mixtures. As a matter of fact these rates of prothrombinase formation are in good agreement with the mass transfer of 0.01 fmol factor Xa/min/pM factor Xa in the perfusate (Table 1). The validity of our theoretical considerations regarding the thrombin production data in the flow reactor also became evident from the excellent agreement between the observed steady state rates of thrombin production under diffusion-controlled conditions (high prothrombinase density and low wall shear rate) and the calculated mass transfer of prothrombin as shown in Table 2. We like to note that the theory was developed for reactions at a homogeneously catalytic surface like that of platinum. The fact that catalysis at a macroscopic surface with a very low enzyme density follows the same theory is compatible with the notion that the lateral diffusion of reactants at the surface exceeds the flux of reactants toward the apparent non-homogeneously catalytic surface(11Giesen P.L.A. Willems G.M. Hermens W.Th. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1379-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When capillaries with prothrombinase density below 0.6 fmol/cm2 were perfused with 0.5 μM prothrombin at a wall shear rate of 20 s -1, the steady state rate of thrombin production became a linear function of the surface density of prothrombinase (Fig. 2). Yet, we have to emphasize that this observation does not exclude prothrombin depletion at the catalytic surface. As outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” thrombin production causes a partial dependence of the rate of thrombin production on the mass transfer rate of prothrombin to the catalytic surface. This is clearly demonstrated by the results presented in Table 3. The apparent Km for prothrombin is much higher at a low shear rate and high prothrombinase density than the Km determined under conditions where much less depletion of prothrombin near the catalytic surface was expected. The apparent difference in Km disappeared when the prothrombin concentration was corrected for depletion of prothrombin near the catalytic surface (). The results as summarized in Table 3 show that both the Vmax and Km did not vary with the shear rate. In this respect prothrombinase bound to a macroscopic surface seems to behave differently from the factor X converting complex tissue factor-factor VIIa. Nemerson and co-workers (13Gemmell C.H. Turitto V.T. Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 1404-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gemmell C.H. Nemerson Y. Turitto V. Microvasc. Res. 1990; 40: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that the Vmax of factor X activation in a tubular flow reactor increased with increasing wall shear rate. Whereas the k cat value for prothrombin activation in the tubular flow reactor is in accordance with those reported for prothrombin activation by prothrombinase in a vesicle system(3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found a much lower Km. However, the value 3 nM is in close agreement with the Km value (6 nM) determined for phospholipid bilayers on a rotating disc(10Willems G.M. Giesen P.L.A. Hermens W.Th. Blood. 1993; 82: 497-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Michaelis constant observed for macroscopic lipid bilayers, which is about 1000-fold lower than the plasma concentration of prothrombin, might have interesting implications for the regulation of thrombin generation in vivo. This low value of Km implies the existence of two control regimes: (i) for low surface densities of prothrombinase, with Vmax below the mass transfer coefficient times the plasma concentration of prothrombin, the thrombin generation is completely determined by the amount of prothrombinase, and (ii) for high surface concentrations of prothrombinase the thrombin generation rate is completely determined by the transport limit and thus by the plasma concentration of prothrombin. The two regimes might also have consequences for the inhibitor-regulated thrombin production. Because of the high catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase for prothrombin, inhibition by pseudo-substrates, like antithrombin, is hardly to be expected. However, when thrombin production is limited by the supply of substrate, inhibition by pseudo-substrates has to be expected, but will not result in a reduced rate of thrombin production. In this respect, it is of interest to see that these transport phenomena have the very same implications for other surface-bound reactions involved in blood coagulation like the activation of factor X(23Andree H.A.M. Contino P.B. Repke D. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4368-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)."

Furthermore, the FACITs do not form homopolymers but rather are associated with collagen fibrils. In fact, their multidomain structure and tissue distribution suggest that FACITs constitute molecular bridges linking together the fibrils of a tissue (8Gordon M.K. Olsen B.R. Curr. Opin.

Yet, these collagens must be degraded during the turnover of fibrillar collagens with which they are so closely associated. The purpose of this study was to examine the susceptibility of one such FACIT, collagen XIV, and in particular its COL1 domain, to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases. 4-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels, acrylamide and prestained molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Bisacrylamide was from Eastman Kodak Company. SDS, 99% pure, was obtained from BDH Chemicals Ltd. (Poole, United Kingdom). Tris base and p-aminophenylmercuric acetate were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Native rat tendon type I collagen was prepared by acid extraction followed by salt and ethanol precipitations as described previously(42Trelstad R.L. Catanese V.M. Rubin D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Human placental type III collagen, purified by pepsin treatment and differential salt precipitation, was kindly provided by Robert Burgeson (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Native bovine type XIV collagen was purified by the method of Aubert-Foucher et al.(4Aubert-Foucher E. Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Lethias C. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15759-15764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a fetal bovine tendon NaCl extract was batch-absorbed to carboxymethyl-cellulose. After extensive washing with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1% isopropyl alcohol, elution was carried out with the same buffer in 0.5 M NaCl. At this point, the eluted material contained mainly a mixture of type I and type XIV collagens. Final purification was achieved using concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. As neither denaturing agents nor proteolytic enzymes were present during these procedures, the resultant collagen is native and intact. The purification of the COL1 domain of collagen XIV was performed as described previously(4Aubert-Foucher E. Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Lethias C. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15759-15764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fetal calves (estimated age, 6-7 months) were obtained at a local slaughterhouse. Skins (hairless) were cut in small pieces at 4°C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and milled in a freezer mill (SPEX Industries, Metuchen, NJ). The powders were suspended in a 0.5 M acetic acid, 0.2 M NaCl solution (15 ml/g of fresh tissue) and treated with pepsin (0.5 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 24 h at 4°C. The digestion was stopped by bringing the pH to 8.5 by the addition of 5 M NaOH. After centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min) the supernatant was salt fractionated by dialysis against increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.9 M, 1.2 M, and 2.0 M) in 0.5 M acetic acid. The material was collected at each step by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 45 min) and dialyzed against 0.5 M acetic acid. The 2.0 M NaCl precipitate was chromatographed by HPLC as described previously (4Aubert-Foucher E. Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Lethias C. van der Rest M. J. Biol.

The equipment used was from Waters and consisted of a model 625 LC chromatograph and a model 484 tunable absorbance detector adjusted at a wavelength of 206 nm. The column used was a C18 Waters Delta Pak (3.9 × 300) protected with a Waters Guard-Pak precolumn. The HPLC system described above was used for fast protein liquid chromatography. The fractions from the HPLC containing the COL1 domain were dialyzed against 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, and chromatographed on a Mono S column (5 mm × 5 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The COL1 domain was eluted by a NaCl gradient (0-1 M, 20 min, 2 ml/min). Human interstitial procollagenase was purified from the serum-containing conditioned media of phorbol-treated U937 cells, as described previously(43Welgus H.G. Campbell E.G. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, media was subjected to sequential CM-52 followed by DEAE/red-Sepharose chromatography, resulting in fully pure enzyme maintained in a zymogen state. Recombinant 92-kDa gelatinase was isolated from E1A-transfected HT-1080 cells as described by Wilhelm et al.(45Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification was achieved by sequential gelatin-agarose and red-Sepharose chromatography and resulted in 92-kDa enzyme free of associated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). Matrilysin was expressed in non-secretor zero mouse myeloma cells and the native recombinant protein purified as described previously(37Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Ward R.V. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Stromelysin was purified from the conditioned media of interleukin-1-stimulated human skin fibroblasts by subjecting the material to zinc-chelate chromatography (Sigma) using a 0.05-0.8 M glycine gradient. Stromelysin-containing fractions were then placed over a DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column linked to reactive red 120-agarose (Sigma). The enzyme was eluted with a 0.05-2.0 M NaCl gradient, and stromelysin-containing fractions were collected and pooled. 72-kDa progelatinase was purified as described (46Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6579-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from human fibroblast conditioned media. This 72-kDa enzyme was isolated as a complex with TIMP-2. 72-kDa gelatinase, largely free of TIMP-2, was kindly provided by Jo Seltzer (47Seltzer J.L. Eschbach M.L. Eisen A.Z. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 326: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Interstitial procollagenase, 92-kDa progelatinase, 72-kDa progelatinase, prostromelysin, and promatrilysin were generally all activated by exposure to 1 mMp-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37°C for 2 h. In the sole case of experiments designed to compare the catalytic efficacy of interstitial collagenase against type I collagen to 92-kDa gelatinase against COL1 (XIV), the following methodology was employed to ensure maximal and irreversible activation. Procollagenase was activated by sequential exposure to trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor (8-fold molar excess to the serine protease) as reported previously(34Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 92-kDa progelatinase was activated by treatment with a 1:20 ratio (w/w) of trypsin-activated stromelysin at 37°C for 1 h(48Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stromelysin was then removed by adsorption to antistromelysin-Sepharose. No stromelysin remained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (detection limit, 1 ng). Proteolytic activity of each of the purified metalloenzymes was established by assay against known susceptible substrates as follows: 1) 92-kDa gelatinase and matrilysin activities were tested by measuring the solubilization of [3H]elastin at 37°C(38Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Fliszar C.J. Shapiro S.D. Goldberg G.I. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7870-7875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2) collagenase activity was determined by degradation of native type I collagen at 25°C and quantification of three-quarter-length tropocollagenA products using scanning densitometry(34Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) stromelysin activity was measured using a proteoglycan bead assay(49Nagase H. Woessner J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). COL1 (2.8 μg) was incubated for 18 h at 30°C with 6.5 × 10 -7M each of matrilysin, interstitial collagenase, 92-kDa gelatinase, or stromelysin in a final volume of 34 μl (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.02% Brij). The reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol, boiled, and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(50King J. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The gels were then stained with 1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue and densitometrically scanned with a Gilford spectrophotometer set at 560 nm. Native collagens were heated to 60°C for 15 min and then used immediately in reactions performed at 30°C. TIMP was purified from human skin fibroblast-conditioned serum-free medium as described previously(51Stricklin G.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12252-12258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 92-kDa gelatinase (2.4 μg) was incubated either alone or with TIMP (1.62 or 8.10 μg) for 15 min at room temperature. The enzyme and enzyme/TIMP mixtures were then added to COL1 for 18h at 37°C, and degradation products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The COL1 domain purified by fast protein liquid chromatography was treated with trypsin as described by Bruckner and Eikenberry(52Bruckner P. Eikenberry E.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The samples were heated from 30 to 39°C at a rate of 12°C/h. At the indicated temperatures, the samples were rapidly cooled in an ice bath. After adding trypsin to 0.01 mg/ml, the samples were incubated for 2 min at 20°C to digest nontriple helical protein. The samples were then prepared for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentrations of type I collagen and COL1 (XIV) were determined by hydroxyproline assay as described by Bergmann and Loxley (53Bergmann I. Loxley R. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 1961-1965Crossref Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Equimolar concentrations of type I collagen and COL1 (XIV) were used in all assays (4 × 10 -6M). Reaction mixture volume was 30 μl, and the buffer used was 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.4 M NaCl, and 0.02% Brij. The 0.4 M NaCl was used to retard any aggregation of type I collagen during the incubation period. Reactions were performed at 30°C and 32°C for 1 h, as indicated. Molarities of 92-kDa gelatinase used to degrade COL1 at 30°C were 6.6 × 10 -7M, 3.3 × 10 -7M, and 1.6 × 10 -7M; molarities at 32°C were 5.3 × 10 -7M, 1.3 × 10 -7M, and 4.4 × 10 -8M. Molarities of collagenase used to degrade type I collagen at 30°C were 3 × 10 -7M, 1.5 × 10 -7M, and 7.5 × 10 -8M; molarities at 32°C were 1.0 × 10 -7M, 3.3 × 10 -8M, and 1.1 × 10 -8M. Degradation was quantified by scanning the gels densitometrically with a Beckman spectrophotometer equipped with a linear scanning device. Prior to studying the degradation of COL1 by matrix metalloproteinases, the melting temperature of this helical fragment was established by determining its trypsin sensitivity after incubation over the temperature range of 30-39°C (Fig. 1). As indicated, this helical fragment exhibited no trypsin sensitivity whatsoever until 35°C, and the Tm was found to be 35-36°C. In view of this result, we performed all subsequent experiments with matrix metalloproteinases at 30°C, a full 5°C below the melting temperature of COL1, thereby ensuring that this collagenous fragment would be maintained in a native state. The capacity of four different matrix metalloproteinases (92-kDa gelatinase, stromelysin, interstitial collagenase, and matrilysin) to degrade the COL1 domain of type XIV collagen was examined. In Fig. 2, COL1 (2.8 μg) was incubated with equimolar concentrations (6.5 × 10 -7M) of 92-kDa gelatinase, stromelysin, collagenase, and matrilysin for 18 h at 30°C. Under these conditions, the only enzyme that exhibited capacity to degrade the COL1 domain was the 92-kDa gelatinase. There were no distinct cleavage products identifiable from the action of 92-kDa gelatinase, which apparently degraded the COL1 domain into small peptides. The highly related 72-kDa gelatinase, which exhibits virtually identical substrate specificity to 92-kDa gelatinase(37Murphy G. Cockett M.I. Ward R.V. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), also degraded COL1 at 30°C (data not shown). The COL1 domain appears as a doublet in these denaturing electrophoretic gels because two different amino-terminal sequences of COL1, VRTIQGPP and IQGPP, are produced during the purification of this domain. The resultant difference in molecular mass is approximately 1 kDa as the three chains are identical. Also, since COL1 is prepared by pepsin cleavage and the specificity of this enzyme is wide, the carboxyl terminus is likely heterogeneous as well. Degradation of the COL1 domain of type XIV collagen demonstrated significant temperature dependence. As shown in Fig. 3, at 32°C and pH 7.4, 92-kDa gelatinase (6.3 × 10 -7M) degraded approximately 90% of the COL1 fragment. However, at 25°C, an identical amount of enzyme cleaved only a trivial proportion of the substrate. To assess the potential relevance of 92-kDa gelatinase degradation of COL1, its efficacy of catalysis was compared with that of interstitial collagenase degradation of native type I collagen, the latter generally accepted to be of high physiologic importance. Incubations were performed at 30 and 32°C for 1 h as indicated. As shown in Fig. 4, at 30°C, approximately 50% degradation of type I collagen required 0.15 μg of interstitial collagenase versus 0.625 μg of 92-kDa gelatinase to achieve similar cleavage of COL1. Normalizing for differences in molecular mass, 92-kDa gelatinase cleavage of COL1 occurred at approximately half the rate of collagenase cleavage of type I collagen. At 32°C, approximately 50% degradation of type I collagen required 0.08 μg of interstitial collagenase versus 0.08 μg of 92-kDa gelatinase to achieve similar cleavage of COL1. On a molar basis, 92-kDa gelatinase cleavage of COL1 occurred twice as readily as collagenase cleavage of type I collagen. Thus, rates of 92-kDa gelatinase degradation of COL1 are of quite similar magnitude to those of interstitial collagenase degradation of type I collagen. Since 92-kDa gelatinase exhibits high efficiency in the degradation of denatured collagens (i.e. gelatin) of all genetic types, we compared the capacity of this enzyme to cleave native versus denatured COL1 fragment of type XIV collagen and also the correspondin"
https://openalex.org/W2059330319,"The sequence of the bacteriophage 434 OR1 (ACAAAACTTTCTTGT) differs from its OR3 (ACAGTTTTTCTTGT) at positions 4-6. X-ray analysis shows that the side chain of Gln33 of the 434 repressor makes van der Waals' and H-bond contacts with the T at position 4′ in complex with OR1, but no specific contact is observed at this position in 434 repressor-OR3 complexes. No contacts are made by repressor to the bases at positions 5 or 6 in either binding site. The significance of the sequence differences between OR1 and OR3 in determining the operator affinity for repressor were examined by constructing synthetic variants of these operators. Measurements of the affinity of these operators for repressor as a function of ionic strength revealed that although base pairs 5 and 6 are not contacted by 434 repressor, they can nonetheless influence operator affinity for repressor by modulating the degree to which ionic interactions contribute to the overall binding energy. Both the magnitude and direction of their effect depends on the status of repressor's contacts to the bases at position 4. The role of contact made by Gln33 to position 4 was examined by mutating this amino acid to Ala and by examining the affinity of wild type repressor for an operator bearing a 5-methylcytosine at position 4′ in an OR1-4G mutant. These experiments showed that repressor's preferences at operator positions 5 and 6 are linked to its position 4 preference via a van der Waals' contact between amino acid 33 and a methyl group on the base at operator position 4′. Together, the results of the experiments shown here reveal that bases that do not contact the protein alter its preferences for bases at the contacted operator position 4."
https://openalex.org/W2064719524,"Rat renal mitochondrial glutaminase (GA) is synthesized as a 74-kDa cytosolic precursor that is translocated into mitochondria and processed via a 72-kDa intermediate to yield a 3:1 ratio of mature 66- and 68-kDa subunits, respectively. The 66-kDa subunit is derived by removal of a 72-amino-acid presequence. The structural determinants necessary for translocation and proteolytic processing were further delineated by characterizing the processing of different chimeric constructs formed by fusing various segments of the N-terminal sequence of the GA precursor to chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT). GA 1-118CAT is translocated and processed in isolated rat liver mitochondria or cleaved by purified mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) to yield an intermediate peptide and two mature subunits that are analogous to the products of processing of the GA precursor. The two reactions also occur with kinetics which are similar to those observed for processing of the GA precursor. Thus, all of the information required for the translocation and synthesis of the mature subunits of GA reside in the N-terminal 118 amino acids of the GA precursor. In contrast, GA 1-72CAT, a construct that contains the GA presequence fused to CAT, is apparently translocated and processed less efficiently. It yields only two peptides that are analogous to the intermediate and 68 kDa forms of GA. In addition, GA 1-31CAT associates with mitochondria but is not proteolytically processed and GA 1-31,73-118CAT is slowly translocated and processed to a single peptide that is analogous to the 66 kDa form of GA. The latter results suggest that the MPP cleavage reactions which yield the GA intermediate and the 66-kDa subunit depend primarily on information that is present C-terminal to the respective sites of cleavage.

The active GA is a heterotetramer that is composed of three 66-kDa 2The relative molecular masses of the GA subunits differ slightly from previously published values. The estimates used in this study are based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the GA cDNA sequence (Shapiro et al., 1991). and one 68-kDa subunits (Haser et al., 1985). The mature peptides are derived from a single 74-kDa precursor that is processed through a 72-kDa intermediate (Perera et al., 1990; Shapiro et al., 1991). The N-terminal sequence of the 66-kDa subunit was previously determined by automated Edman degradation and compared to the sequence deduced from the GA cDNA (Shapiro et al., 1991). This information established the length of the presequence of the 66-kDa subunit of GA to be 72 amino acids. Mitochondrial presequences are enriched in arginines, leucines, and serines and usually do not contain valines, isoleucines, and negatively charged amino acids (von Heijne, 1986). Stretches of amino acids within presequences also possess the ability to fold into amphipathic α-helices which putatively aid in the interaction of the presequence with the receptors on the mitochondrial membrane (Roise, 1993; von Heijne, 1986). Another characteristic feature of the presequences is the presence of an arginine residue at position −2 from the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) cleavage site. This arginine is conserved in many mitochondrial precursors from various species (Hartl et al., 1989). Mutation of the −2 arginine to a glycine in the presequence of ornithine transcarbamylase inhibits import and processing of the precursor in mitochondria (Horwich et al., 1986). Thus, this arginine residue is an important recognition element for MPP. glutaminase mitochondrial processing peptidase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The GA presequence also contains a high content of arginines, leucines, and serines. Based upon calculated propensities (Schiffer and Edmundson, 1967), the N-terminal 16 amino acids of the GA precursor are likely to form an amphipathic α-helix (Shapiro et al., 1991). In addition, the GA presequence appears to exhibit a few unique features. Very few cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial proteins have presequences that are as long as the GA presequence (Hartl et al., 1989). The GA presequence lacks an arginine residue at position −2 from the site of MPP cleavage that generates the 66-kDa GA subunit. This site of cleavage also lacks the consensus amino acid residues (hydrophobic residues at position −8 and a serine, threonine, or glycine residue at position −5) for mitochondrial intermediate peptidase recognition (Isaya et al., 1991). Therefore, the role of the presequence in the translocation and processing of GA and the features of the presequence that are required for MPP recognition and cleavage were investigated by fusing different lengths of the presequence and the mature protein sequence to a passenger protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The reported data demonstrate that 1) the presequence aids in the translocation of CAT into mitochondria, 2) the information required for the synthesis of the two mature subunits of GA resides in the N-terminal 118 amino acids of the GA precursor, 3) purified MPP can catalyze formation of the mature peptides of the various fusion proteins, and 4) MPP recognition and processing of the GA presequence appears to depend primarily on information present C-terminal to the site of cleavage. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were obtained from The Charles River Laboratory and maintained on Purina Rat Chow. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. RNAsin and T7 RNA polymerase were obtained from Promega and United States Biochemical Corp., respectively. L-[ 35S]Methionine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Sequenase version 2.0 kit for dideoxy nucleotide sequencing was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp. Cell-free protein synthesis was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Pelham and Jackson, 1976). Chemicals for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad. CAT antibodies were obtained from 5 Prime →3 Prime, Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. A 1.6-kilobase HindIII/BamHI fragment from pSVOCAT which contains the full coding sequence of the CAT cDNA followed by an SV40 intron and polyadenylation site was subcloned into the pBluescriptII SK - plasmid (Stratagene). The ATG start codon of the CAT gene was mutated to an MluI site using the method of Kunkel et al. (Ausubel et al., 1993; Kunkel et al., 1987), and a 413-base pair KpnI-MluI fragment of pGA (Shapiro et al., 1991) which encodes the N-terminal 118 amino acids of GA was cloned upstream of the CAT sequence to generate pGA 1-118CAT (Fig. 1). Another MluI site was created at position 280 base pair from the 5′ end of pGA 1-118CAT. MluI digestion released a 138-base pair fragment, and subsequent closing of the vector resulted in pGA 1-72CAT which encodes the 72-amino acid mitochondrial presequence of GA attached to CAT. Another construct, pGA 1-31CAT was created in a similar fashion. pGA 1-31CAT was linearized with MluI, and the 138-base pair MluI fragment which encodes residues 73-118 of GA was obtained as described above and cloned into the linearized pGA 1-31CAT to yield pGA 1-31,73-118CAT. All the chimeric constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977). The scheme used for synthesis of the various constructs is illustrated in Fig. 1. In vitro transcriptions were carried out using T7 RNA polymerase (Krieg and Melton, 1987; Maniatis et al., 1989). The various plasmids were digested with BssHII to release the cDNA encoding the GA-CAT construct with the T7 promotor immediately upstream. In vitro transcriptions and translations were performed as described in the preceding article (Srinivasan et al., 1994). In Vitro processing of the labeled precursors was carried out using rat liver mitochondria isolated as described previously (Cohen et al., 1985; Perera et al., 1990). The translocation reactions were performed as described in the preceding article (Srinivasan et al., 1994). The mitochondria were then pelleted, washed, solubilized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4°C with CAT antibodies. A 100-μl aliquot of a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose in RIPA buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the samples and incubated on ice for 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, washed three times in RIPA buffer, and the immunoprecipitated products were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis buffer before being subjected to electrophoresis (Laemmili, 1970; O'Farrell, 1975). To further characterize the differential processing reactions and to determine regions of the targeting signal that may be important in alternative processing, various fusion protein constructs were created (Fig. 2). These constructs have different segments of the GA presequence fused in frame to the N terminus of a non-mitochondrial passenger protein, CAT. The first construct, pGA 1-118CAT, encodes the N-terminal 118 amino acids of the GA precursor fused in frame to CAT cDNA. The N-terminal 118 amino acid sequence includes the 72 amino acid presequence and 46 amino acids from the N terminus of the 66-kDa subunit. pGA 1-72CAT and pGA 1-31CAT code for 72 amino acids (the entire presequence) and 31 amino acids from the N terminus of the GA precursor fused to CAT cDNA, respectively. pGA 1-31,73-118CAT lacks the cDNA encoding amino acids 32 thru 72 of the presequence. The minimal changes in amino acid sequence introduced at the sites of fusion by the recombinant DNA procedures are illustrated in Fig. 3. A BssHII fragment of pGA 1-118CAT was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This procedure yields a protein of the expected mass (40 kDa) which is immunoprecipitated with CAT antibodies (Fig. 4, lane 1). Incubation of the GA 1-118CAT protein with isolated rat liver mitochondria yields three additional peptides of relative molecular masses of 37, 32, and 30 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 2). Based upon the mass differences and relative abundances, the lower molecular weight form, m1, appears to correspond to the 66-kDa subunit of GA and the intermediate molecular weight form, m2, appears to correspond to the 68-kDa subunit of GA. No translocation or processing was observed when CAT synthesized in vitro was incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria (data not shown). Therefore, the mitochondrial uptake and processing of the chimeric protein is directed by the presequence of GA. To determine whether the 37-kDa peptide was a true intermediate, GA 1-118CAT precursor was incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria for different periods of time (Fig. 5, panel A). Much of the precursor was converted to the 37-kDa peptide within 5 min. The levels of this peptide peaked at 10-15 min and then decreased consistent with it being an intermediate. After 45-60 min most of the precursor and intermediate were converted to the mature forms, m1 and m2. Interestingly, m1 is synthesized at a faster rate than m2 (Fig. 5, panel B). To investigate whether m1 and m2 arise by differential proteolytic processing of the presequence by MPP, radiolabeled precursor of GA 1-118CAT was incubated for various times with purified rat liver MPP (Fig. 6). The action of MPP yields form i and the mature subunits m1 and m2. MPP processing results in the generation of form i within the initial 3 min followed by the simultaneous appearance of m1 and m2 after approximately 10 min of incubation. The generation of the two mature subunits continues to increase at similar rates during the 1-h incubation. When the mature forms of GA 1-118CAT were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 7), m2 (pI 6.1) was observed to be more basic than m1 (pI 5.9). The 37-kDa intermediate peptide (i) displayed the most basic pI (6.5) of the three peptides, consistent with the basic nature of the presequence. Thus, the processing of GA 1-118CAT closely parallels that observed for native GA (Srinivasan et al., 1994). Therefore, different deletions of this construct should be useful to further characterize the functional significance of the processing reactions and the specificity of the MPP. The GA 1-72CAT precursor was synthesized in vitro, immunoprecipitated with CAT-specific antibodies, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The precursor was observed to migrate with the expected mass of 33 kDa (Fig. 8, lane 1). Incubation of the precursor with isolated rat liver mitochondria results in translocation and processing to an apparent intermediate and a single apparent mature form (Fig. 8, lane 2). Treatment of the GA 1-72CAT precursor with purified rat liver MPP gives rise to peptides that are identical in apparent mass to the intermediate and the single mature form produced by mitochondrial processing (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and 4). When GA 1-72CAT was incubated with mitochondria for different times, the kinetics of import and processing appear to be slower than those of GA 1-118CAT (Fig. 9).Figure 9:Kinetics of import of GA 1-72CAT into isolated mitochondria. Labeled GA 1-72CAT precursor was synthesized by in vitro translation and incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria at 28°C for the indicated periods of time. The samples were centrifuged and the resulting pellets were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with CAT-specific antibodies. The different samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. The fluorograph was scanned using a Microscan 2000 HP Laserjet scanner, and the relative percentages of the intermediate and mature processed forms at each time point were plotted against the time of incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the processed forms of GA 1-72CAT were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography, the mature subunit was observed to migrate with a pI of 6 (Fig. 10). This pI is slightly greater than the pI of CAT (pI = 5.8). When fully processed GA 1-72CAT and CAT synthesized in vitro were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography, the mature form of GA 1-72CAT was observed to be larger and more basic than CAT (Fig. 10). These data indicate that the observed difference in mobility is due to the presence of basic amino acids derived from presequence of the GA 1-72CAT. Thus, the observed processing reaction appears to be similar to the processing reaction that gives rise to the 68-kDa subunit of GA. GA 1-31CAT was synthesized by in vitro translation (Fig. 11, lane 1) and incubated with isolated rat liver mitochondria. The precursor was observed to be associated with the mitochondria but was not proteolytically processed (Fig. 11, lane 2). Thus, the initial 16 amino acids, which have the calculated propensity to form an amphipathic α-helix, may function as a mitochondrial targeting signal but are not sufficient for interaction with MPP required to generate the intermediate form of GA. This suggests that the mitochondrial import apparatus and the MPP recognize distinct structural elements of the presequence of GA. In vitro transcription and translation of pGA 1-31,73-118CAT yields a peptide of the expected mass (Fig. 11, lane 3). Incubation of this precursor with isolated rat liver mitochondria yields a single mature form (Fig. 11, lane 4). This mature subunit has the same apparent molecular weight as that of the m1 subunit produced from GA 1-118CAT (Fig. 11, lane 5). The m1 subunit corresponds to the 66-kDa peptide of mature GA. An interesting observation in this experiment is the conspicuous absence of an intermediate form which is consistent with the lack of processing of GA 1-31CAT. Presequences function to target and import precursors into mitochondria. The presequence of GA is unique in that it is processed alternatively to yield two different peptides. In order to elucidate the role played by different portions of the presequence and to delineate the structural features that are recognized by the MPP complex, various fusion protein constructs were created. The GA 1-118CAT preprotein (40 kDa) behaved in a manner very similar to that of GA precursor. It was also processed in the presence of isolated rat liver mitochondria to two mature subunits, m1 and m2 (30 and 32 kDa, respectively) via an intermediate (37 kDa) (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). The relative differences in size between these subunits closely corresponds to the differences in apparent molecular mass between the processed forms of GA. This implies that the processing of GA 1-118CAT precursor and the GA precursor are essentially the same. The kinetics of GA 1-118CAT processing (Fig. 5) essentially mimicked those of the GA precursor (Srinivasan et al., 1994). However, the final ratio of the subunits m1 (analogous to the 66-kDa form of GA) and m2 (analogous to the 68-kDa subunit of GA) were 2:1 and not 3:1 as observed with native GA. This might be due to inefficient processing of the fusion protein precursor owing to the propensity of the CAT domain to fold into a globular moiety (Robben et al., 1993). Alternatively, only the presequence may enter the matrix and undergo proteolytic processing while the folded CAT domain may remain outside the mitochondria. However, the latter possibility is unlikely due to the following observation. When mitochondria are treated with protease after import, the processed products are protected from proteolytic degradation (data not shown). This suggests that the processed products are inside the mitochondria. Thus, the altered ratio of products obtained from GA 1-118CAT precursor may be due to either an altered conformation or reduced accessibility of the GA presequence. Action of the purified MPP complex on GA 1-118CAT precursor generated an intermediate and the two mature forms in the ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 6). Proteolytic processing of the GA precursor by the purified MPP also yielded equivalent amounts of the 68- and 66-kDa GA subunits (Srinivasan et al., 1995). Thus, additional factor(s) residing in the mitochondria may be essential to ensure the fidelity of processing. The observed kinetics of MPP processing suggest that the peptide designated as i functions as an intermediate. It appears before either of the mature peptides and then reaches an apparent steady state level. The two mature peptides appear to be synthesized at nearly equivalent rates, suggesting that they may be produced by alternative processing of the intermediate. However, the in vitro processing reaction by MPP was not very efficient as large amounts of precursor molecules were not processed, and the intermediate does not show a decrease. This problem may be alleviated by developing in vitro conditions which would further stabilize the protease. On the other hand, the GA precursor may behave like the ornithine transcarbamylase precursor which is never fully cleaved in vitro (Isaya et al., 1991). This and other experiments are currently being performed to better characterize the action of MPP on the precursors of GA and the GA chimeras. When the mature forms of GA 1-118CAT were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, m2 was observed to be more basic than m1 (Fig. 7). This finding is consistent with the conclusion that the two mature peptides are synthesized by alternative processing of the basic presequence. It also implies that all the information necessary for the synthesis of mature GA resides in the N-terminal 118 amino acids of the GA precursor. When the precursor of GA 1-72CAT synthesized in vitro was incubated either with mitochondria or with purified rat liver MPP, it was processed via an intermediate to a single mature subunit (Fig. 8). The translocation and processing in the presence of mitochondria were apparently less efficient than that observed with GA 1-118CAT. The chimeric precursors were not synthesized in sufficient amounts in vitro to assay for CAT activity. The low yields of the fusion proteins may be due to poor translation of the extremely GC-rich GA presequence. However, significant levels of CAT activity were observed when the native CAT protein was synthesized in vitro and assayed (data not shown). This indicates that CAT synthesized de novo can fold into an active enzyme in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Hence the observed inefficiency of import may be due to the folding of the CAT domain. Alternatively, it may be due to cooperative folding interactions within the CAT peptide which could be initiated during progressive translocation of the presequence into mitochondria. This might block the import sites and thus prevent further uptake of precursor. A low efficiency of import could also be caused by reduced exposure of the presequence on the surface of the precursor protein. This would result in an improper or reduced association of the precursor with the mitochondria and therefore insufficient perturbation of the membrane (Roise, 1993). However, the latter possibility seems less likely since the proteolytic cleavage of GA 1-72CAT by the purified MPP occurred at a rate equal to that observed for GA or GA 1-118CAT. Thus, the presequences of the chimeric constructs must be readily accessible to the action of MPP in the absence of other factors that may be present in mitochondria. The apparent molecular mass of the mature subunit derived from GA 1-72CAT was greater than that of the CAT protein synthesized in vitro. This suggests that MPP identifies recognition elements of the presequence that would give rise to products that are analogous to the intermediate and the 68-kDa form of GA. This conclusion is further supported by the more basic nature of processed GA 1-72CAT than CAT protein (Fig. 10). The combined data suggest that the processing reactions which yield the intermediate and the 68-kDa subunit of GA do not require the amino acids that form the N terminus of the 66-kDa subunit. However, the absence of a second mature subunit suggests that the processing reaction required for formation of the 66-kDa subunit is inhibited. Thus, the latter reaction may require amino acid determinates that are located in the N terminus of the 66-kDa subunit of GA. Hence, MPP activity may require recognition of sequence and/or structural elements that are C-terminal to the site of cleavage. In addition, the data support the hypothesis that the 68-kDa subunit is generated by MPP recognition of specific sequence and/or structural elements that are different from those required for the production of the 66-kDa subunit. The conclusion that MPP may recognize sequence and/or structural determinants C-terminal to the site of cleavage that gives rise to the 72-kDa intermediate is supported by the finding that incubation of GA 1-31CAT preprotein with isolated mitochondria resulted in the association of the precursor with mitochondria but no processing (Fig. 11). The lack of proteolytic processing of GA 1-31CAT indicates that this preprotein lacks the determinants necessary for the synthesis of a peptide akin to the 72-kDa intermediate form of GA. Thus, information present C-terminal to the site of proteolysis which produces the 72-kDa intermediate may be the deciding factor for MPP recognition and cleavage. This conclusion is consistent with the characterization of the specificity of the MPP isolated from Neurospora crassa (Arretz et al., 1994). In this paper, the authors have demonstrated that MPP interacts with the C-terminal, non-amphipathic half of the presequence of cytochrome b2 and that amino acid substitutions at positions −2 and +1 from the MPP cleavage site affect processing but not import of a chimeric protein containing the presequence of cytochrome b2 fused to dihydrofolate reductase. In the absence of an arginine at position −2, as in the case of the GA presequence, the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the proteolytic processing site may determine the fidelity of MPP action. Interestingly, when mitochondria were added to GA 1-31,73-118CAT preprotein, the precursor was processed to a single subunit which had an apparent size equal to that of the m1 subunit obtained from GA 1-118CAT. In contrast, GA 1-72CAT precursor was processed via an intermediate to a peptide corresponding to the 68-kDa subunit of GA. This suggests that the proteolytic processing of the presequence of GA by MPP to give rise to the two mature subunits of GA are independent events. The bias in the generation of the mature subunits of GA may be due to other factors that are present in the mitochondria. It is conceivable that hsp60 binding of the precursor inside mitochondria might predispose MPP to recognize and cleave one of the two sites more rapidly than the other. The available data do not establish that the proteolytic processing site of GA 1-31,73-118CAT is identical with that of the GA 1-118CAT which generates m1. Nevertheless, the non-identity of the apparent m1 forms derived from the two chimeric constructs would not affect the above conclusion. The deletion of amino acids 32 through 72 of the presequence also decreased the apparent efficiency of the import and processing of the above precursors. This suggests that recognition elements present on the N-terminal side of the site of cleavage which yields the 66-kDa GA subunit may be necessary for efficient processing by MPP. This observation is consistent with the previously reported experiments (Isaya et al., 1991) which have characterized the structural requirements for MPP processing of other mitochondrial precursor proteins. In summary, MPP recognition and processing of the three cleavage sites in the GA presequence appear to be independent events which primarily depend upon the information present C-terminal to the sites of cleavage. However, the efficiency of processing may be effected by determinants present N-terminal to the site of proteolytic action."
