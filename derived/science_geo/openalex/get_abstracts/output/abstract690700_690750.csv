https://openalex.org/W4220817556,"Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ophthalmological disorders, resulting from several systemic and ocular etiologies including meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical students are among the high-risk group for DED, mainly due to the increasing use of a visual display terminal (VDT) for online lectures and psychological stress from encountering several changes. Our study aimed to explore the prevalence of DED using the symptom-based definition and potential risk factors in medical students. This is a prospective cross-sectional study that included medical students at Chiang Mai University between November 2020 and January 2021. All participants were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, the Thai version of the 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale-10 (T-PSS-10), the LipiView® II interferometer, and an interview for other possible risk factors. Overall, 528 participants were included in the study; half of the participants were female. The prevalence of DED was 70.8%. In the univariate analysis, female sex, contact lens wear, and T-PSS-10 stress scores were significantly higher in the DED group ( P = 0.002, 0.002, and &lt;0.001, respectively). Moreover, participants with severe DED were likely to have higher meibomian gland tortuosity but not statistically significant. In the multivariate analysis, contact lens use and T-PSS-10 score were significant risk factors associated with the severity of DED. In conclusions, the prevalence of DED in medical students was as high as 70.8%. Contact lens use and psychological stress evaluated using the T-PSS-10 questionnaire had a significant correlation with a risk of DED. Female gender and duration of VDT use were also associated. Most of the risk factors were modifiable and may be used as initial management in patients with DED."

It is largely oligoclonal based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST); in Egypt, ST 627 was recently detected. Despites the global dissemination of this ST, there is still paucity of information about it. Herein, we used 4 K. pneumoniae ST627 for whole genome sequencing utilizing an Illumina MiSeq platform. Genome sequences were examined for resistance and virulence determinants, capsular types, plasmids, insertion sequences, phage regions, and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) regions using bioinformatic analysis. The molecular characterization revealed 15 and 65 antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, respectively. Resistance genes such as tet(D), aph(3'')-Ib, aph(6)-Id, blaTEM-234, fosA, and fosA6; were mainly responsible for tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and fosfomycin resistance; respectively. The capsular typing revealed that the four strains are KL-24 and O1v1. One plasmid was found in all samples known as pC17KP0052-1 and another plasmid with accession no. NZ_CP032191.1 was found only in K90. IncFIB(K) and IncFII(K) are two replicons found in all samples, while ColRNAI replicon was found only in K90. Entero P88, Salmon SEN5, and Klebsi phiKO2 intact phage regions were identified. All samples harbored CRISPR arrays including CRISPR1 and CRISPR2. Our results shed light on critical tasks of mobile genetic elements in ST 627 in antibiotic resistance spreading."
https://openalex.org/W4220722908,"Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prominent symptoms of acute COVID-19. Although both senses recover in many patients within weeks to months, persistency has been described in up to 60%. However up to now most reports on the course of chemosensitive disorders after COVID-19 are not based on psychophysical testing but only on subjective patients' ratings. In this study we assessed both olfaction and gustation using psychophysical tests eight months after COVID-19. Validated psychophysical testing revealed hyposmia in 18% and hypogeusia in even 32% of 303 included patients. This shows that olfactory and especially gustatory disorders have to be seen as important chronic symptoms post-COVID-19. The high prevalence of gustatory dysfunction indicates that gustatory function does not recover or might even deteriorate in the months following the acute infection."
https://openalex.org/W4220921533,"Introduction Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that predominantly affects African Americans in the United States. The disease is associated with complications leading to high healthcare utilization rates, including emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. Optimal SCD care requires a multidisciplinary approach involving SCD specialists to ensure preventive care, minimize complications and prevent unnecessary ED visits and hospitalizations. However, most individuals with SCD receive sub-optimal care or are unaffiliated with care (have not seen an SCD specialist). We aimed to identify barriers to care from the perspective of individuals with SCD in a multi-state sample. Methods We performed a multiple methods study consisting of surveys and interviews in three comprehensive SCD centers from March to June 2018. Interviews were transcribed and coded, exploring themes around barriers to care. Survey questions on the specific themes identified in the interviews were analyzed using summary statistics. Results We administered surveys to 208 individuals and conducted 44 in-depth interviews. Barriers to care were identified and classified according to ecological level (i.e., individual, family/interpersonal, provider, and socio-environmental/organizational level). Individual-level barriers included lack of knowledge in self-management and disease severity. Family/interpersonal level barriers were inadequate caregiver support and competing life demands. Provider level barriers were limited provider knowledge, provider inexperience, poor provider-patient relationship, being treated differently, and the provider’s lack of appreciation of the patient’s SCD knowledge. Socio-environmental/organizational level barriers included limited transportation, lack of insurance, administrative barriers, poor care coordination, and reduced access to care due to limited clinic availability, services provided or clinic refusal to provide SCD care. Conclusion Participants reported several multilevel barriers to SCD care. Strategies tailored towards reducing these barriers are warranted. Our findings may also inform interventions aiming to locate and link unaffiliated individuals to care."
https://openalex.org/W4221085613,"What types of public health messages are effective at changing people's beliefs and intentions to practice social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19? We conducted two randomized experiments in summer 2020 that assigned respondents to read a public health message and then measured their beliefs and behavioral intentions across a wide variety of outcomes. Using both a convenience sample and a pre-registered replication with a nationally representative sample of Americans, we find that a message that reframes not social distancing as recklessness rather than bravery and a message that highlights the need for everyone to take action to protect one another are the most effective at increasing beliefs and intentions related to social distancing. These results provide an evidentiary basis for building effective public health campaigns to increase social distancing during flu pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4220703526,"The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized to play a role in cognition and dementia. Antibiotic use impacts the gut microbiome and has been linked with chronic disease. Despite these data, there is no evidence supporting an association between long-term antibiotic use in adults and cognitive function. We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study among 14,542 participants in the Nurses' Health Study II who completed a self-administered computerized neuropsychological test battery between 2014-2018. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess if chronic antibiotic use in midlife was associated with cognitive impairment assessed later in life. Women who reported at least 2 months of antibiotic exposure in midlife (mean age 54.7, SD 4.6) had lower mean cognitive scores seven years later, after adjustment for age and educational attainment of the spouse and parent, with a mean difference of -0.11 standard units for the global composite score (Ptrend <0.0001), -0.13 for a composite score of psychomotor speed and attention (Ptrend <0.0001), and -0.10 for a composite score of learning and working memory (Ptrend <0.0001) compared with non-antibiotic users. These differences were not materially changed after multivariate adjustment for additional risk factors, including comorbid conditions. As a benchmark, the mean difference in score associated with each additional year of age was (-0.03) for global cognition, (-0.04) for psychomotor speed and attention, and (-0.03) for learning and working memory; thus the relation of antibiotic use to cognition was roughly equivalent to that found for three to four years of aging. Long-term antibiotic use in midlife is associated with small decreases in cognition assessed seven years later. These data underscore the importance of antibiotic stewardship, especially among aging populations."
https://openalex.org/W4220887504,"Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FDBL) is a rare inborn lipid disorder characterized by the formation of abnormal triglyceride- and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (remnant particles). Patients with FDBL have a high risk for atherosclerotic disease. The effect of PCSK9 inhibition on lipoproteins and its subfractions has not been evaluated in FDBL.Three patients (65±7 years, 23±3 kg/m2, 2 females) with FDBL (diagnosed by isoelectrofocusing) and atherosclerosis (coronary and/or cerebro-vascular and/or peripheral arterial disease) resistant or intolerant to statin and fibrate therapy received evolocumab (140mg every 14 days). In addition to a fasting lipid profile (preparative ultracentrifugation), apoB and cholesterol concentrations were determined in 15 lipoprotein-subfractions (density gradient ultracentrifugation; d 1.006-1.21g/ml) before and after 12 weeks of evolocumab treatment. Patients with LDL-hypercholesterolemia (n = 8, 56±8 years, 31±7 kg/m2) and mixed hyperlipidemia (n = 5, 68±12 years, 30±1 kg/m2) also receiving evolocumab for 12 weeks were used for comparison.All patients tolerated PCSK9 inhibition well. PCSK9 inhibitors reduced cholesterol (29-37%), non-HDL-cholesterol (36-50%) and apoB (40-52%) in all patient groups including FDBL. In FDBL, PCSK9 inhibition reduced VLDL-cholesterol and the concentration of apoB containing lipoproteins throughout the whole density spectrum (VLDL, IDL, remnants, LDL). Lipoprotein(a) was decreased in all patient groups to a similar extent.This indicates that the dominant fraction of apoB-containing lipoproteins is reduced with PCSK9 inhibition, i.e. LDL in hypercholesterolemia and mixed hyperlipidemia, and cholesterol-rich VLDL, remnants and LDL in FDBL. PCSK9 inhibition may be a treatment option in patients with FDBL resistant or intolerant to statin and/or fibrate therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4220973593,"In this study, we aimed at exploring the feasibility of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for studying the observation and/or motor imagination of various postural tasks. Thirteen healthy adult subjects followed five trials of static and dynamic standing balance tasks, throughout three different experimental setups of action observation (AO), a combination of action observation and motor imagery (AO+MI), and motor imagery (MI). During static and dynamic standing tasks, both the AO+MI and MI experiments revealed that many channels in prefrontal or motor regions are significantly activated while the AO experiment showed almost no significant increase in activations in most of the channels. The contrast between static and dynamic standing tasks showed that with more demanding balance tasks, relative higher activation patterns were observed, particularly during AO and in AO+MI experiments in the frontopolar area. Moreover, the AO+MI experiment revealed a significant difference in premotor and supplementary motor cortices that are related to balance control. Furthermore, it has been observed that the AO+MI experiment induced relatively higher activation patterns in comparison to AO or MI alone. Remarkably, the results of this work match its counterpart from previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Therefore, they may pave the way for using the fNIRS as a diagnostic tool for evaluating the performance of the non-physical balance training during the rehabilitation period of temporally immobilized patients."
https://openalex.org/W4221034841,"Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role for epidemiological studies, in aiding the diagnosis of COVID-19, and assess vaccine responses. Little is known on dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 serology in African settings. Here, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal antibody response profile to SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia.In this prospective study, a total of 102 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled. We obtained 802 plasma samples collected serially. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined using four lateral flow immune-assays (LFIAs), and an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. We determined longitudinal antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 as well as seroconversion dynamics.Serological positivity rate ranged between 12%-91%, depending on timing after symptom onset. There was no difference in positivity rate between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. The specificity ranged between 90%-97%. Agreement between different assays ranged between 84%-92%. The estimated positive predictive value (PPV) for IgM or IgG in a scenario with seroprevalence at 5% varies from 33% to 58%. Nonetheless, when the population seroprevalence increases to 25% and 50%, there is a corresponding increases in the estimated PPVs. The estimated negative-predictive value (NPV) in a low seroprevalence scenario (5%) is high (>99%). However, the estimated NPV in a high seroprevalence scenario (50%) for IgM or IgG is reduced significantly to 80% to 85%. Overall, 28/102 (27.5%) seroconverted by one or more assays tested, within a median time of 11 (IQR: 9-15) days post symptom onset. The median seroconversion time among symptomatic cases tended to be shorter when compared to asymptomatic patients [9 (IQR: 6-11) vs. 15 (IQR: 13-21) days; p = 0.002]. Overall, seroconversion reached 100% 5.5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Notably, of the remaining 74 COVID-19 patients included in the cohort, 64 (62.8%) were positive for antibody at the time of enrollment, and 10 (9.8%) patients failed to mount a detectable antibody response by any of the assays tested during follow-up.Longitudinal assessment of antibody response in African COVID-19 patients revealed heterogeneous responses. This underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation of seroassays before implementation. Factors associated with failure to seroconvert needs further research."
https://openalex.org/W4220780177,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) include small sensor nodes with battery and processing power and limited memory units then improving power consumption is a major design challenge for any sensor network. In this paper, a new algorithm for routing in the wireless sensor network is proposed using the ultra-innovative algorithm for bacterial Foraging and mobile sink, which leads to energy efficiency. In the proposed method, the number of sensor nodes is determined according to two criteria: the amount of energy on the battery surface and the distance to the sink ahead, which leads to the formation of regular clusters in the network. Nodes adopt a multi-step routing scheme within the network to communicate with the sink. also, the mobile sink is used to balance the load and help consume uniform energy throughout the network. The simulation results show better performance of the proposed method in terms of energy consumption by 17.99%, throughput rate by 30.04%, end-to-end delay by 46.04%, signal-to-noise ratio by 32.81%, delivery rate successfully Data to the sink is 0.80 times higher than the AFSRP (Artificial Fish Swarm Routing Protocol)."
https://openalex.org/W4220832913,"The complex environment of a produce packinghouse can facilitate the spread of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes in unexpected ways. This can lead to finished product contamination and potential foodborne disease cases. There is a need for simulation-based decision support tools that can test different corrective actions and are able to account for a facility's interior cross-contamination dynamics. Thus, we developed agent-based models of Listeria contamination dynamics for two produce packinghouse facilities; agents in the models represented equipment surfaces and employees, and models were parameterized using observations, values from published literature and expert opinion. Once validated with historical data from Listeria environmental sampling, each model's baseline conditions were investigated and used to determine the effectiveness of corrective actions in reducing prevalence of agents contaminated with Listeria and concentration of Listeria on contaminated agents. Evaluated corrective actions included reducing incoming Listeria, modifying cleaning and sanitation strategies, and reducing transmission pathways, and combinations thereof. Analysis of Listeria contamination predictions revealed differences between the facilities despite their functional similarities, highlighting that one-size-fits-all approaches may not always be the most effective means for selection of corrective actions in fresh produce packinghouses. Corrective actions targeting Listeria introduced in the facility on raw materials, implementing risk-based cleaning and sanitation, and modifying equipment connectivity were shown to be most effective in reducing Listeria contamination prevalence. Overall, our results suggest that a well-designed cleaning and sanitation schedule, coupled with good manufacturing practices can be effective in controlling contamination, even if incoming Listeria spp. on raw materials cannot be reduced. The presence of water within specific areas was also shown to influence corrective action performance. Our findings support that agent-based models can serve as effective decision support tools in identifying Listeria-specific vulnerabilities within individual packinghouses and hence may help reduce risks of food contamination and potential human exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4221114353,"Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children globally with the majority of these deaths observed in resource-limited settings. Globally, the annual incidence of clinical pneumonia in under-five children is approximately 152 million, mostly in the low- and middle-income countries. Of these, 8.7% progressed to severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. However, data to predict children at the greatest risk to develop severe pneumonia from pneumonia are limited.Secondary data analysis was performed after extracting relevant data from a prospective cluster randomized controlled clinical trial; children of either sex, aged two months to five years with pneumonia or severe pneumonia acquired in the community were enrolled over a period of three years in 16 clusters in urban Dhaka city.The analysis comprised of 2,597 children aged 2-59 months. Of these, 904 and 1693 were categorized as pneumonia (controls) and severe pneumonia (cases), respectively based on WHO criteria. The median age of children was 9.2 months (inter quartile range, 5.1-17.1) and 1,576 (60%) were male. After adjustment for covariates, children with temperature ≥38°C, duration of illness ≥3 days, male sex, received prior medical care and severe stunting showed a significantly increased likelihood of developing severe pneumonia compared to those with pneumonia. Severe pneumonia in children occurred more often in older children who presented commonly from wealthy quintile families, and who often sought care from private facilities in urban settings.Male sex, longer duration of illness, fever, received prior medical care, and severe stunting were significantly associated with development of WHO-defined severe childhood pneumonia in our population. The results of this study may help to develop interventions target to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality of children suffering from severe pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4220911820,"In-depth analyses of foot surface measurements upon weight bearing are crucial to understand how the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the foot deform during motion to enhance the fit of footwear, which is particularly important for diabetic patients with stringent fit requirements to redistribute the plantar weight forces. This study analyzes diabetic foot deformations under 3 different weight bearing conditions (no weight bearing, half weight bearing, and 80% weight bearing) by using a novel foot scanning method that enables efficient scanning of the dorsal and plantar surfaces of the foot simultaneously. The feet of 48 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are scanned. With increased load on the feet, the width of the forefoot increases by 9.7%-10.4%, height of the midfoot decreases by 15.1%-18.2%, forefoot and midfoot rotate to the medial side by 16.9%-23.9% while the rearfoot rotates to the lateral side by 15.2% simultaneously, and the plantar of the foot increases contact with the floor by 11.4%-23.0%. Gender differences in foot shape are also found between males and females, males have a broader foot than females for the same foot length. Precise anthropometric information of foot changes and deformation therefore enables adequate foot protection, fit and comfort when designing footwear. This research contributes to shoe design considerations that focus on the deformation of the foot under different loads."

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Korean adolescents’ Internet usage time and their mental health. This cross-sectional study included 29,811 high school students ages 16–18 from the 2018 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey. Participants’ mean Internet usage time was 193.4±1.6 min/day. Internet usage time was associated with sex, grade level, type of school, living arrangement, economic status, academic achievement, and experience of school violence. With regard to mental health, subjective health status, stress, feelings of sadness, and suicidal ideation were also related to Internet usage time. The group with more than average Internet usage had poorer subjective health, higher level of stress, and had feelings of sadness and suicidal ideation compared to the group with less than average Internet usage. To effectively manage Internet usage time, interventions to lower Internet usage and leisure programs that could replace Internet usage need to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W4221077656,"Background Brucellosis is listed as one of six priority zoonoses in Tanzania’s One Health strategic plan which highlights gaps in data needed for the surveillance and estimation of human brucellosis burdens. This study collected data on current testing practices and test results for human brucellosis in Arusha region, northern Tanzania. Methods Retrospective data were extracted from records at 24 health facilities in Arusha region for the period January 2012 to May 2018. Data were captured on: the test reagents used for brucellosis, procurement and testing protocols, the monthly number of patients tested for brucellosis and the monthly number testing positive. Generalised linear mixed models were used to evaluate relationships between health facility characteristics and the probability that brucellosis testing was conducted in a given month, and the proportion of individuals testing positive. Results Four febrile Brucella agglutination tests were used widely. The probability of testing for brucellosis in a given month was significantly associated with an interaction between year of testing and facility ownership. Test probability increased over time with more pronounced increases in privately owned as compared to government facilities. The proportion of individuals testing positive for brucellosis was significantly associated with facility type and district, with individuals tested in hospitals in Meru, Monduli and Ngorongoro districts more likely to test positive. Conclusions Febrile Brucella agglutination tests, known for their poor performance, were the mainstay of brucellosis testing at health facilities in northern Tanzania. The study indicates that historical data on human brucellosis in Arusha and other regions are likely to provide an inaccurate measure of true disease burden due to poor performance of the tests used and variation in testing practices. Measures to address these identified shortcomings could greatly improve quality of testing and surveillance data on brucellosis and ultimately inform prevention and control of this priority disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220685321,"Purpose We describe the temporal concordance of 3 hemodynamic monitors. Materials and methods Healthy volunteers performed preload changes while simultaneously wearing a non-invasive, pulse-contour stroke volume (SV) monitor, a bioreactance SV monitor and a wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound patch over the common carotid artery. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting preload change over 3 temporal windows (early, middle and late) was assessed. Results 40 preload changes were recorded in total (20 increase, 20 decrease). Immediately, the wearable Doppler had high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) for detecting preload change with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.98 for both velocity time integral (VTI, 10.5% threshold) and corrected flow time (FTc, 2.5% threshold). The sensitivity, specificity and AUROC for non-invasive pulse contour were equally good (9% SV threshold). For bioreactance, a 13% SV threshold immediately detected preload change with a sensitivity, specificity and AUROC of 60%, 95% and 0.75, respectively. After two SV outputs following preload change, the sensitivity, specificity and AUROC of bioreactance improved to 70%, 90% and 0.85, respectively. Conclusions Carotid Doppler ultrasound and non-invasive pulse contour detected rapid hemodynamic change with equal accuracy; bioreactance improved over time. Algorithm-lag should be considered when interpreting clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W4220711918,"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the primary method for tissue acquisition of intra-abdominal masses. However, the main limitation of cytology alone is the lack of tissue architecture and inadequate samples. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of combined conventional cytology and cell block preparation obtained from EUS-FNA of intra-abdominal masses without Rapid On-site Evaluation (ROSE).Cytologic smears and cell block slides of 166 patients undergoing EUS-FNA during 2010-2015 were reviewed by an experienced cytopathologist blinded to clinical data.125 patients had neoplastic lesions. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was the most common etiology (35.5%), followed by lymph node metastasis (27.7%). The mean mass size was 2.5±1.3 cm. The mean number of passes was 1.9±1.28. Tissue adequacy for conventional cytology and cell block preparation was 78.9% and 78.1%, respectively. Factors associated with tissue adequacy were assessed. For cytology, lesions of > 2.1 cm, masses in the pancreatic body or tail, malignancy, and pancreatic cancer were positively associated with adequate cellularity. For cell block preparation, lesions of > 3 cm and malignancy were associated with increased tissue adequacy. The conventional cytology alone had a sensitivity of 68.5%, a specificity of 95.7%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.821. The cell block preparation alone had a sensitivity of 65.4%, a specificity of 96%, and an AUROC of 0.807. The combined conventional cytology and cell block preparation performed significantly better than either method alone (p<0.05), as demonstrated by an increased AUROC of 0.853. Furthermore, cell block detected malignancy in 9.3% of cases where the cytologic smears failed to identify malignant cells.The combined conventional cytology and cell block preparation increased the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA compared to either method alone. This approach should be implemented in routine practice, especially where ROSE is unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W4220850730,"Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that theta-band activity is useful for investigating neural mechanisms of memory. However, mechanisms specifically driving memory performance remain poorly understood. In sequential memory, performance can be artificially attenuated by shortening the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between memory item presentations. Therefore, we sought to clarify the mechanisms of sequential memory performance by analyzing theta-band (4-8 Hz) activity recorded via magnetoencephalogram in 33 participants during performance of a sequential memory task where memory items were presented at either slow or fast rates in accordance with longer or shorter ISIs, respectively. Particularly in the slow task, theta activity clearly modulated in accordance with the presentation of memory items. Common cortical target regions in the occipital and frontal cortex were identified in both tasks and related to visual encoding and memory maintenance, respectively. Compared to the slow task, occipital-theta activity was significantly lower in the fast task from the midterm until the ending of encoding, in correspondence with significantly lower recall for memory items in this same period. Meanwhile, despite a loss of clarity in responsiveness to individual memory items in the fast task, frontal-theta activity was not different between tasks and exhibited particularly strong responses in both tasks during the holding period prior to recall. Our results indicate that shorter processing time erodes sequential memory performance beginning at the level of visual encoding."

From 83% [95%CI = 83%-84%] visiting outpatient care in the first wave, to 80% [81%-81%], 69% [69%-69%], and 59% [59%-59%] in the second, third, and fourth wave. Similarly, from 4.9% [95%CI = 4.7%-5.0%] visiting inpatient care in the first wave, to 3.6% [3.4%-3.7%], 1.4% [1.3%-1.4%], and 0.5% [0.4%-0.5%]. Of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 41% [41%-41%] relied on self-care in the 30 days after testing positive in the fourth wave, compared to 16% [15%-16%] in the first wave.From 2020 to 2022, the use of COVID-19 related outpatient care services decreased with 29%, whereas the use of COVID-19 related inpatient care services decreased with 80%."
https://openalex.org/W4221021623,"In this paper, we report ethnicity trends in student participation and experience in high school science and engineering fair (SEFs). SEF participation showed significant ethnic diversity. For survey students, the approximate distribution was Asian-32%; Black-11%; Hispanic-20%; White-33%; Other-3%. Comparing the SEF level at which students competed from school to district to region to state levels, we observed that black students made up only 4.5% of the students who participated in SEF beyond the school level, whereas students from other ethnic groups were more equally represented at all levels. The lower percentage of Black students resulted from a combination of lower overall participation in SEF and lower percentage of those students who did participate to advance to SEFs beyond the school level. Students who advanced to SEFs beyond the school level frequently received help from scientists, coaching for the interview, and were not required to participate in SEF. Black students received the least help from scientists, were least likely to receive coaching for the interview, and were most likely to be required to participate in SEF. They also were most likely to receive no help from parents, teachers, or scientists. Asian and Hispanic students (63.8% and 56.8%) indicated a greater interest in careers in science and engineering (S&E) compared to Black and White students (43.7% & 50.7%). In addition to career interest, the most important experiences that correlated with students who indicated that SEF increased their interests in S&E were getting help from the internet, books and magazines; getting help fine tuning the report; and overcoming obstacles by doing more background research, making a timeline, and perseverance. Black students did not report a positive effect of any of these strategies but experienced time pressure as more of an obstacle than did other students. Our findings identify a wide range of student experiences associated with positive SEF outcomes that could be enhanced for all students but especially Black students. More involvement of scientists in helping students who participate in SEFs would be particularly valuable."
https://openalex.org/W4220747536,"Purpose Galectin-1 and -3 are β-galactoside binding lectins with varying effects on angiogenesis and apoptosis. Since in retinal pigment epithelial cells high amounts of human recombinant galectin (hr-GAL)1 and 3 inhibit cell adhesion, migration and proliferation, we investigated if hr-GAL1 and 3 have homologous effects on human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) in vitro . Methods To investigate the effect of galectin-1 and -3 on HRMEC, proliferation, apoptosis and viability were analyzed after incubation with 30, 60 and 120 μg/ml hr-GAL1 or 3 by BrdU-ELISA, histone-DNA complex ELISA, live/dead staining and the WST-1 assay, respectively. Further on, a cell adhesion as well as tube formation assay were performed on galectin-treated HRMEC. Migration was investigated by the scratch migration assay and time-lapse microscopy. In addition, immunohistochemical staining on HRMEC for β-catenin, galectin-1 and -3 were performed and β-catenin expression was investigated by western blot analysis. Results Incubation with hr-GAL1 or 3 lead to a decrease in proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation of HRMEC compared to the untreated controls. No toxic effects of hr-GAL1 and 3 on HRMEC were detected. Intriguingly, after treatment of HRMEC with hr-GAL1 or 3, an activation of the proangiogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was observed. However, incubation of HRMEC with hr-GAL1 or 3 drew intracellular galectin-1 and -3 out of the cells, respectively. Conclusion Exogenously added hr-GAL1 or 3 inhibit angiogenic properties of HRMEC in vitro , an effect that might be mediated via a loss of intracellular endogenous galectins."
https://openalex.org/W4220798620,"The immune response to citrullinated peptides in the mucosa has been suggested to play an important role in the transition from pre-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to clinically evident RA. Although there are reports indicating the presence of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies in the saliva, few studies have reported citrullinated peptide detection in human saliva. This study aimed to identify citrullinated peptides in human saliva and discuss their clinical significance. Saliva samples were collected from 11 patients with RA and from 20 healthy individuals. Citrullinated peptides were detected using an anti-modified citrulline (AMC) antibody. Saliva from the healthy individuals was subjected to two-dimensional protein electrophoresis to isolate citrullinated peptides, which were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and mass spectrometry by peptide mass fingerprinting. The results were corroborated by immunoprecipitation (IP)-western blotting. The signal intensities of the bands precipitated with anti-cytokeratin 13 (CK13) and AMC antibodies were quantified. The signal intensity ratio of the band produced by the AMC antibody was divided by that of the band produced by the anti-CK13 antibody to calculate the citrullinated CK13 (Cit-CK13) ratio. A citrullinated peptide band corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa was detected in the saliva of healthy individuals, and identified as CK13 via mass spectrometry and IP-western blotting. No significant difference was observed between the salivary Cit-CK13 ratios of patients with RA and healthy participants (p = 0.605). This is the first study to show that Cit-CK13 is present in human saliva, and that there is no significant difference between the Cit-CK13 ratios of patients with RA and healthy individuals, suggesting that salivary Cit-CK13 content and RA development may not be associated. The physiological and pathological roles of Cit-CK13 in the oral cavity, and its responsiveness to mucosal immunity, remain unknown and will be the subject of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4220919861,"A quick, reliable, and reproducible biological assay to distinguish individuals with possible life-threatening risk following radiological or nuclear incidents remains a quest in biodosimetry. In this paper, we examined the use of a γ-H2AX assay as an early dose estimation for rapid triage based on both flow cytometry and image analyses. In the experiment, whole blood from 11 donors was irradiated ex vivo inside a water phantom by gamma rays from Co-60 at 0.51 Gy/min. After the lysis of red blood cells, the white blood cells were collected for immunofluorescence labeling of γ-H2AX, CD45, and nuclear stained for signal collection and visualization. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that the relative γ-H2AX intensities of lymphocytes and granulocytes increased linearly with absorbed doses from 0 to 6 Gy with a large variation among individuals observed above 2 Gy. The relative γ-H2AX intensities of lymphocytes assessed by two different laboratories were highly correlated (ICC = 0.979). Using confocal microscopic images, γ-H2AX foci were observed to be discretely distributed inside the nuclei and to increase proportionally with doses from 0 to 2 Gy, whereas large plagues of merged foci appeared at 4 and 6 Gy, resulting in the saturation of foci counts above 4 Gy. The number of total foci per cell as well as the number of foci per plane were significantly different at 0 vs 1 and 2 vs 4 Gy doses (p < 0.01). Blind tests at 0.5 Gy and 1 Gy doses showed that dose estimation by flow cytometry had a mean absolute difference of less than 0.5 Gy from the actual value. In conclusion, while flow cytometry can provide a dose estimation with an uncertainty of 0.5 Gy at doses ≤ 1 Gy, foci counting can identify merged foci that are prominent at doses ≥ 4 Gy."
https://openalex.org/W4220920163,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) subpopulations relevant to vascular disease and injury repair have been depicted in healthy vessels and atherosclerosis profiles. However, whether VSMC subpopulation associated with vascular homeostasis exists in the healthy artery and how are their nature and fate in vascular remodeling remains elusive. Here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to detect VSMC functional heterogeneity in an unbiased manner, we showed that VSMC subpopulations in healthy artery presented transcriptome diversity and that there was significant heterogeneity in differentiation state and development within each subpopulation. Notably, we detected an independent subpopulation of VSMCs that highly expressed regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5), upregulated the genes associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and construction of cytoskeleton compared with the general subpopulation, and mainly enriched in descending aorta. Additionally, the proportion of RGS5high VSMCs was markedly decreased or almost disappeared in the vascular tissues of neointimal formation, abdominal aortic aneurysm and atherosclerosis. Specific spatiotemporal characterization of RGS5high VSMC subpopulation suggested that this subpopulation was implicated in vascular homeostasis. Together, our analyses identify homeostasis-relevant transcriptional signatures of VSMC subpopulations in healthy artery, which may explain the regional vascular resistance to atherosclerosis at some extent."
https://openalex.org/W4220927702,"Rapid diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) could reduce the risk of amputation and death in patients with diabetic foot infection (DFI). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is considered the most useful serum inflammatory marker for the diagnosis of DFO. However, whether severe renal impairment (SRI) affects its diagnostic accuracy has not been reported previously.To investigate the accuracy of ESR in diagnosing DFO in DFI patients with and without SRI.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. From the inpatient electronic medical record system, the investigators extracted demographic information, diagnostic information, and laboratory test results of patients with DFI who had been hospitalized in Longhua Hospital from January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2021. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the interaction between ESR and SRI with adjustment for potential confounders. The area under the curve (AUC), cutoff point, sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and VassarStats.A total of 364 DFI patients were included in the analysis. The logistic regression analysis results showed that elevated ESR increased the probability of diagnosing DFO (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-3.28; adjusted P < 0.001); SRI was not associated with the diagnosis of DFO (adjusted OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 0.40-25.32; adjusted P = 0.271), but it had an obstructive effect on the diagnosis of DFO by ESR (adjusted OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99; adjusted P = 0.048). ROC analysis in DFI patients without SRI revealed that the AUC of ESR to diagnose DFO was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81), with the cutoff value of 45 mm/h (sensitivity, 67.8%; specificity, 78.0%; prevalence, 44.7%; PPV, 71.3%; NPV, 75.0%; LR+, 3.08; LR-, 0.41). In contrast, in patients with SRI, the AUC of ESR to diagnose DFO was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.40-0.75), with the cutoff value of 42 mm/h (sensitivity, 95.0%; specificity, 29.2%; prevalence, 45.5%; PPV, 52.8%; NPV, 87.5%; LR+, 1.34; LR-, 0.17).The accuracy of ESR in diagnosing DFO in DFI patients with SRI is reduced, and it may not have clinical diagnostic value in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4221000328,"This paper focuses on the finite-time generalized synchronization problem of non-identical fractional order chaotic (or hyper-chaotic) systems by a designing adaptive sliding mode controller and its application to secure communication. The effects of both disturbances and model uncertainties are taken into account. A novel fractional order integral sliding mode surface is designed and its stability to the origin is proved in a given finite time. By the aid of the fractional Lyapunov stability theory, a robust controller with adaptive update laws is proposed and its finite-time stability for generalized synchronization between two non-identical fractional-order chaotic systems in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances is derived. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented approach. All simulation results obtained are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis. According to the proposed generalized finite-time synchronization criterion, a novel speech cryptosystem is proposed to send or share voice messages privately via secure channel. Security and performance analyses are given to show the practical effect of the proposed theories."
https://openalex.org/W4220738070,"Estimations of Lyme disease incidence rates in the United Kingdom vary. There is evidence that this disease is associated with fatigue in its early stage but reports are contradictory as far as long-term fatigue is concerned.A population-based historical cohort study was conducted on patients treated in general practices contributing to IQVIA Medical Research Data: 2,130 patients with a first diagnosis of Lyme disease between 2000 and 2018 and 8,510 randomly-sampled patients matched by age, sex, and general practice, followed-up for a median time of 3 years and 8 months. Main outcome measure was time to consultation for (1) any fatigue-related symptoms or diagnosis; or (2) myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models. Average incidence rate for Lyme disease across the UK was 5.18 per 100,000 person-years, increasing from 2.55 in 2000 to 9.33 in 2018. In total, 929 events of any types of fatigue were observed, leading to an incidence rate of 307.90 per 10,000 person-years in the Lyme cohort (282 events) and 165.60 in the comparator cohort (647 events). Effect of Lyme disease on any subsequent fatigue varied by index season: adjusted HRs were the highest in autumn and winter with 3.14 (95%CI: 1.92-5.13) and 2.23 (1.21-4.11), respectively. For ME/CFS, 17 events were observed in total. Incidence rates were 11.76 per 10,000 person-years in Lyme patients (12 events) and 1.20 in comparators (5 events), corresponding to an adjusted HR of 16.95 (5.17-55.60). Effects were attenuated 6 months after diagnosis but still clearly visible.UK primary care records provided strong evidence that Lyme disease was associated with subsequent fatigue and ME/CFS. Albeit weaker on the long-term, these effects persisted beyond 6 months, suggesting patients and healthcare providers should remain alert to fatigue symptoms months to years following Lyme disease diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220786023,"Background Data on health status outcomes after spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) are limited. Methods and findings Using the Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study we compared patients with SCAD and other acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at presentation (baseline), 1-month, and-12 months using standardized health status instruments. Among 3572 AMI patients ≤ 55 years, 67 had SCAD. SCAD patients were younger (median age (IQR) 45 (40.5–51) years vs. 48 (44–52) in other AMI, p = 0.003), more often female (92.5% vs. 66.6%), have college education (73.1% vs. 51.7%) and household income &gt;$100,000 (43.3% vs. 17.7% (All p&lt;0.001). SCAD patients at baseline had higher mean ± SD Short Form-12 [SF-12] physical component scores [PCS] (48.7±10.2 vs. 43.8±12.1, p&lt;0.001) and mental component scores [MCS] (49.6±12.4 vs. 45.4±12.5, p = 0.008), and at 12-months [PCS (50.1±9.0 vs. 44.3±12.3, p&lt;0.001) and MCS (53±10.1 vs 50.2±11.0, p = 0.045)]. The Euro-Quality of Life Scale [EQ-5D] VAS and EQ-5D index scores were similar at baseline, but higher at 12-months for SCAD (EQ-5D VAS: 82.2±10.2 vs. 72.3±21.0, p&lt;0.001; EQ-5D index scores; 90.2±15.3 vs. 83.7±19.8, p = 0.012). SCAD patients had better baseline Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ] physical limitation (88.8±20.1 vs. 81.2±25.4, p = 0.017). At 12-months SCAD patients had better physical limitation (98.0±8.5 vs. 91.4±18.8, p = 0.007), angina frequency (96.4±8.8 vs. 91.3±16.8, p = 0.018) and quality of life scores (80.7±14.7 vs 72.2±23.2, p = 0.005). Magnitude of change in health status from baseline to 12-months was not statistically different between the groups. After adjustment for time and comorbidities there remained no difference in most health status outcomes. Conclusions SCAD patients fare marginally better than other AMI patients on most health status instruments and have similar 12-month health status recovery. Better pre-event health status suggests a need to modify exercise prescriptions and cardiac rehabilitation protocols to better assist this physically active population to recover."
https://openalex.org/W4220793212,"Stimulus-responsive materials enable programmable and adaptive behaviors. Typical solid-phase systems can only achieve small deformations for applications where shape transformations are beneficial or required. Liquids, in contrast, can self-assemble and achieve very high strains in a multifluid environment. Here we report liquid droplet formation by tuning flow potential within a confined fluidic cell. We digitally inject small volumes of liquid-pigment into an otherwise-transparent liquid layer, generating macroscopic droplet assembly over large areas constrained between closely-spaced plates. Droplet morphology is actively controlled by modulating outlet conditions to tune flow fields. Pattern stability is maintained through control over injection rate, interfacial viscosity difference, and interfacial surface tension. We demonstrate time-dependent droplet formation and migration to achieve spatially-tunable optical properties. Applied as a multi-cell array, we imagine this liquid mechanism will enable scalable pattern dynamics for active shading and visual display technologies."
https://openalex.org/W4220885763,"Background Adolescent sexual and reproductive health services in Chile have been primarily provided through health centers. Although some school-based initiatives have been implemented, to date, these have not been assessed. This study aims to identify strengths and challenges of the affectivity and sexuality component of the school-based 3A Program, a health program which seeks to prevent risk behaviors and promote healthy lifestyle habits within public schools (addressing health topics which in Spanish begin with the letter ‘A’, hence ‘3A’), implemented in the municipality of Lo Prado, city of Santiago. Methods We carried out a qualitative study with a descriptive-interpretative approach in three schools. We conducted in-depth interviews with students, teachers, health professionals, and school principals (N = 44); and focus groups with students (N = 3), teachers and health personnel (N = 3). The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Participants highlight the integrative approach to health and to sexual and reproductive health promoted in the 3A Program, which is enhanced by the collaboration of interdisciplinary health teams. Permanent and expedited student access to sexual and reproductive health care is achieved, and affectional bonds are developed between students and the Program’s health staff. The Program assists female participants to imagine and form identities that are not inherently tied to motherhood. It also assists boys and LGBTQ+ adolescents in feeling included as relevant actors in sexual and reproductive health and decision making. The delivery of contraception in schools is highly valued. The most significant challenge identified is ensuring effective and ongoing collaboration between health staff and teachers. Conclusion Participants value the effectivity and sexuality component of the 3A Program as an initiative to improve adolescents’ access to sexual and reproductive health care. Our findings suggest that this Program could be replicated throughout the region and the country to improve the quality and accessibility of health services for adolescents."

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is vital but there are limited randomized clinical trial data supporting AMS interventions such as prospective audit and feedback (PAF). High quality data to demonstrate safety and efficacy of AMS PAF in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are needed.This is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferiority, pragmatic randomized clinical trial evaluating AMS PAF intervention plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone. We include patients with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible ward beds and critical care unit beds will be randomized prior to study commencement at each participating site by computer-generated allocation sequence stratified by intensive care unit versus conventional ward in a 1:1 fashion. PAF intervention consists of real time review of antibacterial prescriptions and immediate written and verbal feedback to attending teams, performed by site-based AMS teams comprised of an AMS pharmacist and physician. The primary outcome is clinical status at post-admission day 15 measured using a 7-point ordinal scale. Patients will be followed for secondary outcomes out to 30 days. A total of 530 patients are needed to show a statistically significant non-inferiority, with 80% power and 2.5% one-sided alpha assuming standard deviation of 2 and the non-inferiority margin of 0.5.This study protocol presents a pragmatic clinical trial design with small unit cluster randomization for AMS intervention in hospitalized COVID-19 that will provide high-level evidence and may be adopted in other clinical situations.This study is being performed at the University of Alberta and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04896866) on May 17, 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4221018257,"Lifestyle physical activity following spinal cord injury (SCI) is critical for functional independence, mental wellness, and social participation, yet nearly 50% of individuals with SCI report no regular exercise. The objective of this study was to better understand factors leading to this participation gap by capturing the physical activity perspectives of individuals living with SCI. We completed small group interviews with nine individuals living with SCI across the United States. Iterative thematic analysis systematically revealed meaningful core concepts related to physical activity engagement with SCI. Emergent themes revealed challenges to lifestyle physical activity behavior including gaps in physical activity education, isolation during psychological adjustment, and knowledge limitations in community exercise settings. A secondary theme related to the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, highlighting additional environmental constraints affecting participation. Our findings suggest that most physical activity education is delivered during inpatient rehabilitation and is related to physical function. Lifetime physical activity strategies are achieved through self-education and peer networking. Personal motivators for physical activity include secondary condition prevention, while social and emotional barriers prevent regular adherence. These findings can inform the development and delivery of physical activity programs to maximize physical activity engagement in individuals living with chronic SCI."

https://openalex.org/W4220670150,"The present study aims to test some of the assumptions of Bowen's Family Systems Theory, specifically, to assess the relationships between differentiation of self (DoS), marital satisfaction and parenting styles, as well as the gender differences in these variables in a Spanish sample. The sample includes 140 Spanish non-single adults, over 30 years old, who have at least one adolescent son or daughter, aged between 12 and 19 years old. The instruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Differentiation of Self Scale, the Warmth Scale-Parents, the Rules and Demands Scale-Parents and the Satisfaction subscale of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. The results show DoS is related to marital satisfaction, and parenting styles' dimensions. Regarding gender, women show higher emotional reactivity and warmth-communication than men do. Furthermore, marital satisfaction mediates the relationship between DoS and parental warmth-communication, criticism-rejection and inductive form. Finally, implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4220673939,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been extensively studied for their wide therapeutic and research applications. Increases in mAb titre has been achieved mainly by cell culture media/feed improvement and cell line engineering to increase cell density and specific mAb productivity. However, this improvement has shifted the bottleneck to downstream purification steps. The higher accumulation of the main cell-derived impurities, host cell proteins (HCPs), in the supernatant can negatively affect product integrity and immunogenicity in addition to increasing the cost of capture and polishing steps. Mathematical modelling of bioprocess dynamics is a valuable tool to improve industrial production at fast rate and low cost. Herein, a single stage volume-based population balance model (PBM) has been built to capture Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell behaviour in fed-batch bioreactors. Using cell volume as the internal variable, the model captures the dynamics of mAb and HCP accumulation extracellularly under physiological and mild hypothermic culture conditions. Model-based analysis and orthogonal measurements of lactate dehydrogenase activity and double-stranded DNA concentration in the supernatant show that a significant proportion of HCPs found in the extracellular matrix is secreted by viable cells. The PBM then served as a platform for generating operating strategies that optimise antibody titre and increase cost-efficiency while minimising impurity levels."

The hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) phenotype is a tool for predicting abnormalities of cardiovascular metabolism. However, the relationship between the HTGW phenotype and hypogonadism remains undetermined. This study aimed to determine the association between HTGW phenotype and hypogonadism in different age groups.Data of this cross-sectional study were obtained from MJ Health Screening Center in Taiwan from 2007 to 2016. The HTGW phenotype was divided into four categories based on whether the waist circumference (WC) and triglyceride levels were normal. WC of <90 cm and triglyceride level of <150 mg/dL were defined as normal. Hypogonadism was defined as a testosterone level of <300 ng/dL.Overall, 6442 male participants were divided into three age groups: <50, 50-64, and ≥65 years (n = 4135, 1958, and 349; age groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The overall prevalence of hypogonadism was 10.6%. In group 1, participants with HTGW (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.354-2.896) had a higher risk of hypogonadism than those with normal WC and normal triglyceride levels after adjustment for body mass index and fasting blood glucose level. In group 2, participants with HTGW (odds ratio, 1.873; 95% CI, 1.099-3.193) had an increased risk of hypogonadism after adjustment for body mass index, fasting blood glucose level, Cholesterol levels, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, low-density lipoprptein (LDL) levels and smoking status. However, no relationship was observed between HTGW phenotype and hypogonadism in group 3.HTGW phenotype was highly associated with hypogonadism in Taiwanese adult men.

Linear models assume that the influence of the built environment is spatially homogeneous. However, given the spatial heterogeneity of urban space, conclusions might be different or even be contrary. The influence of the built environment might also be different by home and work locations. To explore the spatially heterogeneous effect of the built environment from both home-based and work-based perspectives, this study applied large-scale cellular cellphone data in Guangzhou, China. Commuting was measured by decay parameters of probabilistic distributions of commuting distances. Geographically weighted regression models were applied to examine the spatially heterogeneous effect, differentiated by home-based and work-based perspectives. Results confirmed that the impact of the built environment on commuting distance is spatially heterogeneous. The urban space is classified into clusters of central areas, inner suburbs, and outer suburbs. Results also revealed the double-edged effect of the built environment. Residential population, recreation facilities, and mixed development are residence-attractive factors that increase the home-based commuting distance and decrease the work-based commuting distance. Work population and transport facilities are work-attractive factors that decrease home-based commuting distance and increase work-based commuting distance. The results further provide evidence to support area-based policies in urban planning practice."
https://openalex.org/W4220833281,"To investigate the CGE on hair growth and to explore the mechanism that is involved in the acceleration of anagen induction, we investigated the effects of CGE studied on cell proliferation and molecular mechanism in human hair dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). Additionally, hair growth evaluation was carried out following topical treatment of the dorsal skin of telogen C57BL/6 mice with CGE for 14 days. As result, CGE increased cell viability and ALP activity in hDPCs. Moreover, CGE increased the expression of catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1), ALP, sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) genes in hDPCs. CGE increased the expression of proteins such as ALP, β-catenin, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (pGSK3β), and protein kinase B (pAKT) in hDPCs. Furthermore, CGE induced the proliferation of HaCaT cells and up-regulated AKT-ERK-GSKβ-β-catenin signaling in HaCaT cells. Additionally, the anagen induction effects of CGE were confirmed on the telogen-anagen transition mice model. these findings demonstrated that CGE promoted the entering the growth phase of hair follicle via activation of β-catenin signaling pathways in vivo. Thus, this study suggests that CGE might be a potential therapeutic reagent for hair growth."

This study aimed to assess the association between happiness and self-rated health among the Iranian adult population.This cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of adults aged 18-65 In Iran in 2020. Demographic information, the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, and a single item on self-rated health were used to collect the data. The relationship between happiness with demographic variables and self-rated health was examined by performing logistic regression analyses.In all, 19499 were studied (9845 males and 9654 females). The mean age of participants was 36.38± 8.17 years. The mean happiness score was 4.1± 0.57 (out of 6) and this for self-rated health was 3.66±1.2 (out of 5). The results obtained from logistic regression analysis showed that very poor health status (OR: 5.114, 95% CI, P = 4.490-5.824, p <0.001), poor or very poor income status (OR: 1.553, 95% CI, P = 1.406-1.716, p <0.001), unemployment (OR: 1.704, 95% CI, P = 1.432-2.029, p <0.001), being aged 25-34 years (OR: 1.190, 95% CI, P = 1.088-1.302, p <0.001), and years of education (OR for 10-12 years of education: 1.271, 95% CI = 1.174-1.377, p< 0.001) were significant contributing factors to a lower happiness.The results showed that self-rated health was the most significant factor that affected happiness even after adjustment for socioeconomic variables, including age, income, employment, and education. Indeed, improving population health might be an effective measure to improve happiness among Iranians."
https://openalex.org/W4221011890,"Rainfall fluctuation is directly affected by the Earth's climate change. It can be described using the coefficient of variation (CV). Similarly, the ratio of CVs can be used to compare the rainfall variation between two regions. The ratio of CVs has been widely used in statistical inference in a number of applications. Meanwhile, the confidence interval constructed with this statistic is also of interest. In this paper, confidence intervals for the ratio of two independent CVs of lognormal distributions with excess zeros using the fiducial generalized confidence interval (FGCI), Bayesian methods based on the left-invariant Jeffreys, Jeffreys rule, and uniform priors, and the Wald and Fieller log-likelihood methods are proposed. The results of a simulation study reveal that the highest posterior density (HPD) Bayesian using the Jeffreys rule prior method performed the best in terms of the coverage probability and the average length for almost all cases of small sample size and a large sample size together with a large variance and a small proportion of non-zero values. The performance of the statistic is demonstrated on two rainfall datasets from the central and southern regions in Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W4221023742,"Indigenous peoples in Peninsular Malaysia, known as Orang Asli, have been associated with the problem of malnutrition. Approximately 40% of their children are underweight. Indigenous peoples' distinct social, cultural, and economic traits, which differ from those of the dominant communities in which they live, may pose significant challenges for health care providers (HCPs) in addressing the malnutrition issue. This study explores challenges encountered by HCPs, with at least six months of experience in monitoring the growth parameters of Orang Asli children residing in Perak State in Peninsular Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2020 and June 2021, involving three focus group discussions and three in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used. A total of 19 participants (6 nurses, 5 nursing managers, 4 medical officers, 2 nutritionists, a family medicine specialist, and a paediatrician) took part in this study. The challenges were summarized into four themes: (I) accessibility to nutrition, (II) accessibility to healthcare services, (II) skills of HCPs, and (IV) challenges of implementing nutrition programs. The inability of the Orang Asli children to access nutritious food was due to poverty, different perceptions of life priorities, and the practice of food taboos among the communities. Inadequate infrastructure and transportation discourage parents from bringing their children to healthcare facilities. The belief in and preference for traditional healing, the practice of semi-nomadic lifestyles, and fear of HCPs and their timid nature were factors that prevented Orang Asli children from accessing healthcare services. HCPs need to equip themselves with cross-cultural communication and interaction skills and adapt their skills to environmental challenges to overcome unexpected encounters in mobile clinics. The non-exposed food items, the risk of food basket sharing with other family members, and community feeding programs' coordination were the challenges to be addressed when implementing nutrition programmes for Orang Asli children. The challenges of HCPs are multifactorial and require a multifaceted approach. There is a need for joint efforts of stakeholders, from communities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to the health authorities, to address the challenges of HCPs."
https://openalex.org/W4221057198,"Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate whether patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) had changes in their level of performance in extra-dimensional shifting by implementing a novel analysis method, utilizing the new alternate phonemic/semantic fluency test. Method We used machine learning (ML) in order to develop high accuracy classification between PD patients with high and low scores in the alternate fluency test. Results The models developed resulted to be accurate in such classification in a range between 80% and 90%. The predictor which demonstrated maximum efficiency in classifying the participants as low or high performers was the semantic fluency test. The optimal cut-off of a decision rule based on this test yielded an accuracy of 86.96%. Following the removal of the semantic fluency test from the system, the parameter which best contributed to the classification was the phonemic fluency test. The best cut-offs were identified and the decision rule yielded an overall accuracy of 80.43%. Lastly, in order to evaluate the classification accuracy based on the shifting index, the best cut-offs based on an optimal single rule yielded an overall accuracy of 83.69%. Conclusion We found that ML analysis of semantic and phonemic verbal fluency may be used to identify simple rules with high accuracy and good out of sample generalization, allowing the detection of executive deficits in patients with PD."
https://openalex.org/W4220856785,"Despite the increased access to facility-based delivery in Indonesia, the country's maternal mortality remains unacceptably high. Reducing maternal mortality requires a good understanding of the care-seeking pathways for maternal complications, especially with the government moving toward universal health coverage. This study examined care-seeking practices and health insurance in instances of pregnancy-related deaths in Jember District, East Java, Indonesia.This was a community-based cross-sectional study to identify all pregnancy-related deaths in the district from January 2017 to December 2018. Follow-up verbal and social autopsy interviews were conducted to collect information on care-seeking behavior, health insurance, causes of death, and other factors.Among 103 pregnancy-related deaths, 40% occurred after 24 hours postpartum, 36% during delivery or within the first 24 hours postpartum, and 24% occurred while pregnant. The leading causes of deaths were hemorrhage (38.8%), pregnancy-induced hypertension (20.4%), and sepsis (16.5%). Most deaths occurred in health facilities (81.6%), primarily hospitals (74.8%). Nearly all the deceased sought care from a formal health provider during their fatal illness (93.2%). Seeking any care from an informal provider during the fatal illness was more likely among women who died after 24 hours postpartum (41.0%, OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.9, 28.5, p = 0.049) or during pregnancy (29.2%, OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.0, 19.2, p = 0.003) than among those who died during delivery or within 24 hours postpartum (8.6%). There was no difference in care-seeking patterns between insured and uninsured groups.The fact that women sought care and reached health facilities regardless of their insurance status provides opportunities to prevent deaths by ensuring that every woman receives timely and quality care. Accordingly, the increasing demand should be met with balanced readiness of both primary care and hospitals to provide quality care, supported by an effective referral system."
https://openalex.org/W4220906184,"Introduction Nutritional management decreases and/or prevents the complications and deaths associated with diabetes mellitus. However, the majority of patients living with diabetes do not engage in optimal nutritional management of diabetes because they see it as the most difficult aspect of managing the condition. This study aimed to explore and describe the practices and skills on nutritional management of diabetes mellitus among patients living with diabetes attending a Ghanaian hospital. Materials and methods This study employed an exploratory, descriptive qualitative research design. Fifteen participants were recruited using purposive sampling, and interviewed with a semi-structured interview guide. Content analysis was performed on the data gathered, following which three main themes emerged. Results More than two-thirds of the participants of this study had adequate meal planning skills, ate the right quantity of foods, engaged in healthy eating habits, and consumed healthy sources of carbohydrates, fats and protein when eating. However, more than half of the participants had insufficient knowledge and skills in the reading and usage of food labels. Conclusions The participants of this study largely engaged in optimal nutritional management of diabetes due to their healthy dietary practices and preferences. It is recommended that health care professionals in Ghana find practical and robust ways to factor the reading and usage of food labels into the care and management of patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4220937445,"We previously derived a Universal Vital Assessment (UVA) score to better risk-stratify hospitalized patients in sub-Saharan Africa, including those with infection. Here, we aimed to externally validate the performance of the UVA score using previously collected data from patients hospitalized with acute infection in Rwanda.We performed a secondary analysis of data collected from adults ≥18 years with acute infection admitted to Gitwe District Hospital in Rwanda from 2016 until 2017. We calculated the UVA score from the time of admission and at 72 hours after admission. We also calculated quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) and modified early warning scores (MEWS). We calculated amalgamated qSOFA scores by inserting UVA cut-offs into the qSOFA score, and modified UVA scores by removing the HIV criterion. The performance of each score determined by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was the primary outcome measure.We included 573 hospitalized adult patients with acute infection of whom 40 (7%) died in-hospital. The admission AUCs (95% confidence interval [CI]) for the prediction of mortality by the scores were: UVA, 0.77 (0.68-0.85); modified UVA, 0.77 (0.68-0.85); qSOFA, 0.66 (0.56-0.75), amalgamated qSOFA, 0.71 (0.61-0.80); and MEWS, 0.74 (0.64, 0.83). The positive predictive values (95% CI) of the scores at commonly used cut-offs were: UVA >4, 0.35 (0.15-0.59); modified UVA >4, 0.35 (0.15-0.59); qSOFA >1, 0.14 (0.07-0.24); amalgamated qSOFA >1, 0.44 (0.20-0.70); and MEWS >5, 0.14 (0.08-0.22). The 72 hour (N = 236) AUC (95% CI) for the prediction of mortality by UVA was 0.59 (0.43-0.74). The Chi-Square test for linear trend did not identify an association between mortality and delta UVA score at 72 hours (p = 0.82).The admission UVA score and amalgamated qSOFA score had good predictive ability for mortality in adult patients admitted to hospital with acute infection in Rwanda. The UVA score could be used to assist with triage decisions and clinical interventions, for baseline risk stratification in clinical studies, and in a clinical definition of sepsis in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4220958635,"Many knowledge gaps exist in the area of alcohol-related harms in children research such as the potential impact of other's drinking and their social demography. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of characteristics of household members and others' alcohol drinking on harms to children in Thailand.This study examined 952 parents caring for children and adolescents under 18 years of age, using the questionnaire (i.e., The Harm to Others from Drinking under the WHO/ThaiHealth International Collaboration Research Project). They were interviewed between September 2012 and March 2013.The study found that 15.89% of children and young people were affected by someone's drinking in at least one category of harms. People over 60 years of age were less likely to cause alcohol-related harm to children than those aged 18 to 29 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.06-0.58). Households with a binge drinker or regular drinker (≥1 time/week) were more likely to have children at higher risk of suffering alcohol-related harm in comparison to households without alcohol drinker (AOR 4.75 and 1.92, respectively).This study found that children whose family members are young adult or consume alcohol (i.e., weekly drinker or binge drinker) were significantly adversely affected. The most common problems were domestic violence and verbal abuse. Most of the problems, affecting children, were caused mostly by their parents."
https://openalex.org/W4221012117,"Objectives The most perfect example of the mind-body interaction in all of medicine is provided by stress cardiomyopathy. In stress cardiomyopathy, what is initially a purely emotional event may become rapidly fatal. Prolongation of the QT interval is a cardinal feature of the condition, but the mechanism of the prolongation is unknown. We undertook a randomised controlled trial of stress with a cross-over design, comparing the cardiac response of women with a history of stress cardiomyopathy to age-matched controls to explore the mind-body interaction. Our hypothesis is that the hearts of women with a history of stress cardiomyopathy will respond differently to emotional stress than those of the controls. Method This is a randomised cross-over study. Each patient underwent two separate 24-hour Holter monitors performed at least 5 days apart. Baseline recording was followed by either the stress intervention (hyperventilation) or control (diaphragmatic breathing). Our primary endpoint is change in QTc interval over the first hour. Secondary endpoints were change in QTc over 24 hours, and change in SDNN, a measure of heart rate variability. As a secondary stressor, each participant was telephoned four times during their stressed recording and asked to complete a questionnaire. Results Twelve stress cardiomyopathy patients and twelve control patients were recruited. Baseline characteristics did not differ between cases and controls. With hyperventilation, there was a significant initial difference in anxiety (p&lt;0.001), heart rate response (p&lt;0.0001), and QTc (p&lt;0.0002) compared to diaphragmatic breathing, but no differences between the cases and controls. Only first phone call caused an increase in QTc in cases and controls (p = 0.0098). SDNN increased with hyperventilation (p&lt;0.0001) but did not differ between cases and controls. Conclusions QTc response in women with a history of stress cardiomyopathy does not differ from controls. The relevance of QT prolongation and sensitivity in the autonomic response to the pathogenesis of stress cardiomyopathy remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W4221020586,"There are multiple measures for assessment of physical function in knee osteoarthritis (OA), but each has its strengths and limitations. The GaitSmart® system, which uses inertial measurement units (IMUs), might be a user-friendly and objective method to assess function. This study evaluates the validity and responsiveness of GaitSmart® motion analysis as a function measurement in knee OA and compares this to Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), 30s chair stand test, and 40m self-paced walk test.The 2-year Innovative Medicines Initiative-Applied Public-Private Research enabling OsteoArthritis Clinical Headway (IMI-APPROACH) knee OA cohort was conducted between January 2018 and April 2021. For this study, available baseline and 6 months follow-up data (n = 262) was used. Principal component analysis was used to investigate whether above mentioned function instruments could represent one or more function domains. Subsequently, linear regression was used to explore the association between GaitSmart® parameters and those function domains. In addition, standardized response means, effect sizes and t-tests were calculated to evaluate the ability of GaitSmart® to differentiate between good and poor general health (based on SF-36). Lastly, the responsiveness of GaitSmart® to detect changes in function was determined.KOOS, SF-36, 30s chair test and 40m self-paced walk test were first combined into one function domain (total function). Thereafter, two function domains were substracted related to either performance based (objective function) or self-reported (subjective function) function. Linear regression resulted in the highest R2 for the total function domain: 0.314 (R2 for objective and subjective function were 0.252 and 0.142, respectively.). Furthermore, GaitSmart® was able to distinguish a difference in general health status, and is responsive to changes in the different aspects of objective function (Standardized response mean (SRMs) up to 0.74).GaitSmart® analysis can reflect performance based and self-reported function and may be of value in the evaluation of function in knee OA. Future studies are warranted to validate whether GaitSmart® can be used as clinical outcome measure in OA research and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4221028030,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) education may be changing following the simplification of HCV treatment and emergence of direct acting antiviral (DAA). We aimed to characterize HCV knowledge among people who recently completed DAA therapy.The Per-SVR (Preservation of Sustained Virologic Response) is a prospective cohort of patients who achieved a sustained virologic response upon successful completion of DAA therapy. The per-SVR study provided the sampling frame of participants who completed a psychometrically validated 19-item HCV knowledge scale at cohort entry (n = 227). To score the questionnaire, for each correct response one point was awarded, with no point for incorrect response. We assessed mean HCV knowledge score in the overall sample and mutually exclusive populations: people who inject drug (PWID) (n = 71); people with co-occurring HIV (n = 23); PWID and co-occurring HIV (n = 29), and others (n = 104) Using a latent class analysis based on distal outcome, we identified unobserved subgroups and assessed HCV knowledge amongst them.Total mean (SD) percent of correct responses were 83 (11) in the overall sample; 83 (10) in PWID; 79 (12) in people with co-occurring HIV; 81 (10) in PWID and co-occurring HIV, and 84 (11) in rest of the sample Three latent groups were identified: baby boomers who ever experienced homelessness (n = 126); women sex workers who ever experienced homelessness (n = 68); men who inject drug, ever experienced homelessness and had ever diagnosis of mental health disorders (n = 18). Mean percent of correct responses were 85 (8), 82 (11), 85 (10), in latent class 1, 2, and 3, respectively.Patients successfully treated with DAAs had a high HCV knowledge. High knowledge and awareness of reinfection among complex patient groups often facing barriers to HCV care is encouraging and emphasizes the positive outcomes of universal access to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4221120963,"We recently discovered that a rope-pulley system that mechanically coupling the arms, legs and treadmill during walking can assist with forward propulsion in healthy subjects, leading to significant reductions in metabolic cost. However, walking balance may have been compromised, which could hinder the potential use of this device for gait rehabilitation. We performed a secondary analysis by quantifying average step width, step length, and step time, and used their variability to reflect simple metrics of walking balance ( n = 8). We predicted an increased variability in at least one of these metrics when using the device, which would indicate disruptions to walking balance. When walking with the device, subjects increased their average step width ( p &lt; 0.05), but variability in step width and step length remained similar ( p’s &gt; 0.05). However, the effect size for step length variability when compared to that of mechanical perturbation experiments suggest a minimal to moderate disruption in balance (Rosenthal ES = 0.385). The most notable decrement in walking balance was an increase in step time variability ( p &lt; 0.05; Cohen’s d = 1.286). Its effect size reveals a moderate disruption when compared to the effect sizes observed in those with balance deficits (effect sizes ranged between 0.486 to 1.509). Overall, we conclude that healthy subjects experienced minimal to moderate disruptions in walking balance when using with this device. These data indicate that in future clinical experiments, it will be important to not only consider the mechanical and metabolic effects of using such a device but also its potential to disrupt walking balance, which may be exacerbated in patients with poor balance control."
