https://openalex.org/W2040462263,"The sirtuins are members of the histone deacetylase family of proteins that participate in a variety of cellular functions and play a role in aging. We identified a potent inhibitor of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) and found that inhibition of SIRT2 rescued α-synuclein toxicity and modified inclusion morphology in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease. Genetic inhibition of SIRT2 via small interfering RNA similarly rescued α-synuclein toxicity. Furthermore, the inhibitors protected against dopaminergic cell death both in vitro and in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease. The results suggest a link between neurodegeneration and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2083050401,"Ecology seeks to explain species coexistence and its functional consequences, but experimental tests of mechanisms that simultaneously account for both processes are difficult. We used an experimental mycorrhizal plant system to test whether functional similarity among closely related species (phylogenetic conservatism) can drive community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Communities were constructed with the same number of fungal species, but after 1 year of growth, realized species richness was highest where the starting species were more distantly related to each other. Communities with high realized species richness also stimulated plant productivity more than those with low realized species richness. Our findings suggest that phylogenetic trait conservatism can promote coexistence because of reduced competition between distinct evolutionary lineages and enhance ecosystem function because of functional complementarity among those same lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2125176047,"Measurements of midday vertical atmospheric CO 2 distributions reveal annual-mean vertical CO 2 gradients that are inconsistent with atmospheric models that estimate a large transfer of terrestrial carbon from tropical to northern latitudes. The three models that most closely reproduce the observed annual-mean vertical CO 2 gradients estimate weaker northern uptake of –1.5 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year –1 ) and weaker tropical emission of +0.1 Pg C year –1 compared with previous consensus estimates of –2.4 and +1.8 Pg C year –1 , respectively. This suggests that northern terrestrial uptake of industrial CO 2 emissions plays a smaller role than previously thought and that, after subtracting land-use emissions, tropical ecosystems may currently be strong sinks for CO 2 ."
https://openalex.org/W1967487834,"Actin, which is best known as a cytoskeletal component, also participates in the control of gene expression. We report a function of nuclear actin in the regulation of MAL, a coactivator of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). MAL, which binds monomeric actin, is cytoplasmic in many cells but accumulates in the nucleus upon serum-induced actin polymerization. MAL rapidly shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus in unstimulated cells. Serum stimulation effectively blocks MAL nuclear export, which requires MAL-actin interaction. Nuclear MAL binds SRF target genes but remains inactive unless actin binding is disrupted. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrates that the MAL-actin interaction responds to extracellular signals. Serum-induced signaling is thus communicated to nuclear actin to control a transcriptional regulator."

The acquisition of the genome sequence of the yellow fever and Dengue vector, Aedes aegypti ( Aa ), has enabled a comparative phylogenomic analysis of the insect immune repertoire: in Aa , the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae ( Ag ), and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster ( Dm ). Analysis of immune signaling pathways and response modules reveals both conservative and rapidly evolving features associated with different functional gene categories and particular aspects of immune reactions. These dynamics reflect in part continuous readjustment between accommodation and rejection of pathogens and suggest how innate immunity may have evolved."
https://openalex.org/W2009746802,"Aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, which catalyze the attachment of the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA during translation of the genetic code, are proven antimicrobial drug targets. We show that the broad-spectrum antifungal 5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole (AN2690), in development for the treatment of onychomycosis, inhibits yeast cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase by formation of a stable tRNA(Leu)-AN2690 adduct in the editing site of the enzyme. Adduct formation is mediated through the boron atom of AN2690 and the 2'- and 3'-oxygen atoms of tRNA's3'-terminal adenosine. The trapping of enzyme-bound tRNA(Leu) in the editing site prevents catalytic turnover, thus inhibiting synthesis of leucyl-tRNA(Leu) and consequentially blocking protein synthesis. This result establishes the editing site as a bona fide target for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2060459069,"A major challenge for a scalable quantum computing architecture is the faithful transfer of information from one node to another. We report on the realization of an atom-photon quantum interface based on an optical cavity, using it to entangle a single atom with a single photon and then to map the quantum state of the atom onto a second single photon. The latter step disentangles the atom from the light and produces an entangled photon pair. Our scheme is intrinsically deterministic and establishes the basic element required to realize a distributed quantum network with individual atoms at rest as quantum memories and single flying photons as quantum messengers."
https://openalex.org/W2075744820,"Although classical genetic and biochemical approaches have identified hundreds of proteins that function in the dynamic remodeling of cell shape in response to upstream signals, there is currently little systems-level understanding of the organization and composition of signaling networks that regulate cell morphology. We have developed quantitative morphological profiling methods to systematically investigate the role of individual genes in the regulation of cell morphology in a fast, robust, and cost-efficient manner. We analyzed a compendium of quantitative morphological signatures and described the existence of local signaling networks that act to regulate cell protrusion, adhesion, and tension."
https://openalex.org/W2112523443,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the entrance of circulating molecules and immune cells into the central nervous system. The barrier is formed by specialized brain endothelial cells that are interconnected by tight junctions (TJ). A defective function of the BBB has been described for a variety of neuroinflammatory diseases, indicating that proper regulation is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. Under pathological conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly contribute to BBB dysfunction and inflammation in the brain by enhancing cellular migration. However, a detailed study about the molecular mechanism by which ROS alter BBB integrity has been lacking. Here we demonstrate that ROS alter BBB integrity, which is paralleled by cytoskeleton rearrangements and redistribution and disappearance of TJ proteins claudin-5 and occludin. Specific signaling pathways, including RhoA and PI3 kinase, mediated observed processes and specific inhibitors of these pathways prevented ROS-induced monocyte migration across an in vitro model of the BBB. Interestingly, these processes were also mediated by protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a previously unknown player in cytoskeleton and TJ dynamics that acted downstream of RhoA and PI3 kinase. Our study reveals new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying BBB regulation and provides novel opportunities for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1970363742,"The influence of vibrational excitation on chemical reaction dynamics is well understood in triatomic reactions, but the multiple modes in larger systems complicate efforts toward the validation of a predictive framework. Although recent experiments support selective vibrational enhancements of reactivities, such studies generally do not properly account for the differing amounts of total energy deposited by the excitation of different modes. By precise tuning of translational energies, we measured the relative efficiencies of vibration and translation in promoting the gas-phase reaction of CHD 3 with the Cl atom to form HCl and CD 3 . Unexpectedly, we observed that C–H stretch excitation is no more effective than an equivalent amount of translational energy in raising the overall reaction efficiency; CD 3 bend excitation is only slightly more effective. However, vibrational excitation does have a strong impact on product state and angular distributions, with C–H stretch-excited reactants leading to predominantly forward-scattered, vibrationally excited HCl."
https://openalex.org/W2094367249,"The proliferation of icebergs from Antarctica over the past decade has raised questions about their potential impact on the surrounding pelagic ecosystem. Two free-drifting icebergs, 0.1 and 30.8 square kilometers in aerial surface area, and the surrounding waters were sampled in the northwest Weddell Sea during austral spring 2005. There was substantial enrichment of terrigenous material, and there were high concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding each iceberg, extending out to a radial distance of ∼3.7 kilometers. Extrapolating these results to all icebergs in the same size range, with the use of iceberg population estimates from satellite surveys, indicates that they similarly affect 39% of the surface ocean in this region. These results suggest that free-drifting icebergs can substantially affect the pelagic ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and can serve as areas of enhanced production and sequestration of organic carbon to the deep sea."

https://openalex.org/W2070162988,"Obesity is one of the major health problems of our times. Elucidating the signaling mechanisms by which high-fat caloric diet induces obesity is critical for the understanding of this condition and for the development of therapeutic strategies for its treatment. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for protein CD38 as a regulator of body weight during a high-fat diet. CD38 is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of second messengers and has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of signaling pathways. We report that CD38-deficient mice are protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity owing to enhanced energy expenditure. In fact, calorimetric studies indicate that CD38-deficient animals have a higher metabolic rate compared to control mice. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that this resistance to diet-induced obesity is mediated at least in part via a NAD-dependent activation of SIRT-PGC1alpha axis, a well-established cascade, involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis. Thus, together these results identify a novel pathway regulating body weight and clearly show that CD38 is a nearly obligatory component of the cellular cascade that led to diet-induced obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2031346513,"Negative associations between birth order and intelligence level have been found in numerous studies. The explanation for this relation is not clear, and several hypotheses have been suggested. One family of hypotheses suggests that the relation is due to more-favorable family interaction and stimulation of low-birth-order children, whereas others claim that the effect is caused by prenatal gestational factors. We show that intelligence quotient (IQ) score levels among nearly 250,000 military conscripts were dependent on social rank in the family and not on birth order as such, providing support for a family interaction explanation."
https://openalex.org/W1973576115,"Bone is the primary anatomical site of breast cancer metastasis, and bone metastasis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a predominant fibroblast cell population within the bone marrow, and metastatic breast cancer cells that seed within bone would predictably encounter MSC or their soluble factors. Therefore, we examined the impact of primary human MSC on a panel of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-positive (MCF-7, T47D, BT474, and ZR-75-1) and ERalpha-negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) human breast tumor cell lines. All ERalpha-positive breast tumor cell lines displayed low basal activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) until exposed to MSC, which induced chronic phosphorylation of STAT3 on tyrosine-705. Paracrine IL-6 was found to be the principal mediator of STAT3 phosphorylation in coculture studies, and MSC induction of STAT3 phosphorylation was lost when IL-6 was depleted from MSC conditioned media or the IL-6 receptor was blocked on tumor cells. Enhanced tumor cell growth rates were observed in the ERalpha-positive mammary tumor cell line MCF-7 after paracrine and autocrine IL-6 exposure, where MCF-7 growth rates were enhanced by >2-fold when cocultured with MSC in vitro and even more pronounced in vivo with autocrine IL-6 production."
https://openalex.org/W2057235135,"Many top-predator fish stocks in both freshwater and marine systems have collapsed as a result of overharvesting. Consequently, some of these communities have shifted into seemingly irreversible new states. We showed, for predators feeding on prey that exhibit food-dependent growth, that culling of fish prey may promote predator recovery. We removed old stunted individuals of a prey-fish species in a large, low-productive lake, which caused an increase in the availability of small-sized prey and allowed the predator to recover. The shift in community state has been sustained for more than 15 years after the cull ended and represents an experimental demonstration of an alternative stable state in a large-scale field system. Because most animals exhibit food-dependent growth, shifts into alternative stable states resulting from overcompensating prey growth may be common in nature and may require counterintuitive management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2012164145,"Nodulin 26 intrinsic proteins (NIPs) are plant-specific, highly conserved water and solute transport proteins with structural and functional homology to soybean nodulin 26. Arabidopsis thaliana contains nine NIP genes. In this study, it is shown that one of these, AtNIP2;1, is exquisitely sensitive to water logging and anoxia stress. Based on quantitative PCR and promoter::GUS experiments, AtNIP2;1 is expressed at a low basal level in the root tips and the vascular bundle of differentiated roots. Transcript levels are elevated acutely and rapidly upon water logging of root or leaf tissues, increasing 70-fold in roots within the 1st h of submersion. After this large initial increase, mRNA levels decline to steady state levels that remain over 10-fold higher by 6 h post-submersion. An even greater induction of AtNIP2;1 expression was observed upon anoxia challenge of Arabidopsis seedlings, with a 300-fold increase in AtNIP2;1 transcript observed by 2 h after the initiation of oxygen deprivation. Functional analysis of AtNIP2;1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes shows that the protein differs from soybean nodulin 26, showing minimal water and glycerol transport. Instead, AtNIP2;1 displays transport of lactic acid, with a preference for the protonated acidic form of this weak acid. Overall, the data suggest that AtNIP2;1 is an anaerobic-induced gene that encodes a lactic acid transporter and may play a role in adaptation to lactic fermentation under anaerobic stress.

Major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) 2The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; NIP, nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein; PIP, plasma membrane intrinsic protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; LD, long day. are an ancient integral membrane channel protein family of water and uncharged solute transporters that have been found in nearly all living organisms. MIPs are especially prevalent and diverse in higher plants and have been classified into four monophyletic groups as follows: the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), the tonoplast intrinsic proteins, the nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), and the small basic intrinsic proteins (1Johansson U.

Functional analyses indicate that Nod26 is an aquaglyceroporin with a low intrinsic water permeability and the ability to transport uncharged metabolites such as glycerol (4Rivers R.L. Dean R.M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has become clear that NIPs represent a large, diverse family of aquaglyceroporins, with multiple members found in every sequenced higher plant genome (1Johansson U. Karlsson M. Johansson J.

Sjovall S. Fraysse L. Weig A.R. Kjellbom P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), there are nine members of the NIP subfamily. Based on molecular modeling of the pore selectivity sequences, these nine NIPs are subdivided into the following two groups: NIP subgroup I proteins are encoded by NIP1;1, NIP1;2, NIP2;1, NIP3;1, NIP4;1, and NIP4;2, and NIP subgroup II proteins are encoded by NIP5;1, NIP6;1, and NIP7;1 (9Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).

Nature. 2006; 440: 688-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Overall, the observations suggest that NIPs are likely involved in transport functions other than water flux. In this study we show that the NIP subgroup I protein, Arabidopsis NIP2;1, is a lactic acid transporter with an unusually low water permeability that is expressed predominantly in the vascular tissues of roots. Furthermore, we show that AtNIP2;1 expression is exquisitely sensitive to flooding stress and oxygen deprivation. This observation, along with the lactic acid transport selectivity of the protein, suggests a role in metabolic adaptation to oxygen deficit. Plant Growth and Transformation—A. thaliana ecotype Columbia 0 seeds were vernalized on ½-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium containing 1.5% (w/v) sucrose for 2 days at 4 °C, and were then grown under a long day (LD) cycle of 16 h light/8 h dark at 22 °C. Twelve-day-old seedlings were transplanted to Pro-Mix soil (Premier Horticulture Inc., Dorval, Quebec, Canada) and were grown under cool white fluorescent lights (76–100 μmol m-2 s-1) at 22 °C under the LD cycle. For flooding stress experiments, seeds were germinated and grown vertically on the grid A line of square Petri dish plates (gridded 100 × 100 × 15-mm plates; Fisher) containing ½-strength MS agar medium. Flooding stress was administered by submerging the root region of 2-week-old seedlings to the grid B line, and root samples were harvested at intervals over 24 h. For anoxia stress experiments, seeds were germinated on sterile filter paper and were grown on ½-strength MS agar medium under the LD cycle. At 10 days, seedlings were placed into an anaerobic jar, and anoxia was achieved using a BBL GasPak 100 System (BD Biosciences). Seedling samples were harvested at various intervals, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80 °C until RNA isolation. Plant transformation was carried out using the floral dip method (21Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plant inflorescences were submerged into midlogarithmic cultures (A600 = 0.8) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (22Knocz C. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 383-396Crossref Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) in 5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.05% (v/v) Silwet-L77 (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX) for 1 min, and were kept overnight in a growth chamber set to LD conditions. Plants were washed 3–5 times with water and grown under LD conditions until seed set. Germination of seed and selection of transformants were done on ½-strength MS agar containing 50 μg ml-1 hygromycin. Molecular Cloning Techniques—For the AtNIP2;1 promoter::GUS reporter construct, a DNA fragment corresponding to 1098 bp of the AtNIP2;1 gene upstream of the transcriptional start site was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers with HindIII and PstI sites introduced for cloning (supplemental Table S1). The PCR-amplified AtNIP2;1 promoter fragment (1098 bp) was digested with HindIII and PstI and was cloned into the HindIII and PstI sites of pCAMBIA1391Z (23Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar) upstream of a promoterless GUS reporter gene. Xenopus oocyte expression constructs of the open reading frame of the AtNIP2;1 cDNA were generated from Arabidopsis root total RNA (6 weeks Arabidopsis) by reverse transcription-PCR amplification using gene-specific primers with BglII sites (supplemental Table S1). The amplified cDNA fragment was cloned into the BglII restriction site of a modified Xenopus expression plasmid pXβG-ev1 containing a sequence to introduce an in-frame N-terminal fusion of the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK) as described in Ref. 17Wallace I.S.

Capped cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription of XbaI-linearized pXβG-ev1 constructs by using the mMES-SAGEmMACHINE T3 kit (Ambion, Austin) as described previously (17Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M.

For subcellular localization experiments, a cDNA encoding the full-length AtNIP2;1 open reading frame was amplified using gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1) with NcoI sites introduced for cloning into the expression vector pBS-35S-YFP (25Subramanian C. Kim B.H. Lyssenko N.N. Xu X. Johnson C.H. von Arnim A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the preparation of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the AtNIP2;1::YFP fusion, a cassette consisting of CaMV 35S promoter-AtNIP2;1::YFP fusion was cloned into the BamHI site of the pBIN19 plant binary vector (26Frisch D.A. Harris-Haller L.W. Yokubaitis N.T. Thomas T.L. Hardin S.H. Hall T.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing using a model 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the University of Tennessee Molecular Biology Research Facility (Knoxville, TN). Total RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR (Q-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples (200 mg) by using the Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment using the DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Austin) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 20-μl reaction (100 ng of total RNA/μl) with the SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). The quality of first strand cDNA samples was monitored by PCR analysis of the Arabidopsis Actin2 reference gene. Q-PCR analysis was done on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system, and analysis was performed with the ABI Prism 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Gene-specific and internal control primers are described in supplemental Table S2. The Arabidopsis UBQ10 gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (27Czechowski T. Bari R.P. Stitt M. Scheible W. Udvardi M.K. Plant J. 2004; 38: 366-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). cDNA proportional to 10–100 ng of starting total RNA was combined with 200 nm of each primer and 12.5 μl of 2XABsolute SYBR Green ROX dUTP mix (ABgene, Rochester, NY) in a final volume of 25 μl. Q-PCRs were performed using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 5 min at 50 °C, 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 45 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene). Quantitation of AtNIP2;1 expression was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method as described previously (28Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). ΔCt was calculated using Equation 1, ΔCt=Ct(target)−Ct(reference)1 where Ct(target) is the Ct value of gene of interest, and Ct(reference) is Ct value of the Arabidopsis UBQ10. ΔΔCt values were calculated using Equation 2, ΔΔCt=ΔCt(sample)−ΔCt(calibrator)2 where ΔCt(sample) represents the expression value of the gene of interest calculated using Equation 1, and ΔCt(calibrator) is the expression value of the sample to which other samples in the data set are normalized. Each ΔCt(calibrator) of individual Q-PCR experiments are indicated in each figure legend. The relative expression value was obtained from ΔΔCt values by using Equation 3, relative expression=2−ΔΔCt3 Expression and Transport Analyses in Xenopus Oocytes—Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (5Dean R.M. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and microinjected with 46 nl of 1 μg/μl of cRNAs or with RNase-free water as a negative control using a “Nanoject” automatic injector (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). The oocytes were cultured for 72 h in 96-well microtiter plates at 16 °C in Ringer’s solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 0.6 mm CaCl2, 200 mosmol/kg) supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The osmotic water permeability (Pf) of the oocytes was measured by the standard swelling assay as described previously (17Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16826-16834Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Guenther J.F. Chanmanivone N. Galetovic M.P. Wallace I.S. Cobb J.A. Roberts D.M.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16826-16834Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by placing oocytes in an isoosmotic Ringer’s base solution (200 mosmol/kg) with NaCl replaced by 20–100 mm of the test solute. The swelling rate of oocytes was determined using video microscopy imaging and was expressed as the change in oocyte volume (d(V/V0)/dt), where V is the volume at a specific time and V0 represents the initial oocyte volume at time 0, calculated as described previously (17Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16826-16834Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Guenther J.F. Chanmanivone N. Galetovic M.P. Wallace I.S. Cobb J.A. Roberts D.M.

Direct glycerol and urea permeability measurements of Xenopus oocytes were performed by radioisotopic uptake assay as described in Ref. 17Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16826-16834Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar. Lactic acid transport experiments in oocytes were done by a similar approach except that 14C-labeled lactic acid was used. The assay buffer consisted of a modified Ringer’s solution containing 20 mm lactic acid (12 μCi/ml 14C-labeled lactic acid (Sigma)) in a base buffer of 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris succinate, 0.6 mm CaCl2 (200 mosm/kg). Assay incubations were done at 22 °C for 10 min, and oocytes were washed twice with 6 ml of ice-cold Ringer’s solution without isotope. Sensitivity to mercurials was determined by preincubating oocytes in Ringer’s solution containing 1 mm HgCl2 for 10 min prior to assay, essentially as described previously (4Rivers R.L. Dean R.M. Chandy C. Hall J.E. Roberts D.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 256-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After isotopic uptake assays, oocytes were lysed with 300 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS, and scintillation counting was done in 10 ml of Scintsafe (Fisher) by using a Beckman LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Histochemical and Immunochemical Methods—GUS staining was done on 2-week-old Arabidopsis as described in Ref. 29Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8352) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Tissues were incubated for 8–16 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.4 mm K3[Fe(CN)6], 0.4 mm K4[Fe(CN)6], and 0.9 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronidase (Rose Scientific, Ltd., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Seedlings were cleared with 70% (v/v) ethanol at room temperature and were mounted in 50% (w/v) glycerol. Stained tissues were observed and imaged using a Nikon ECLIPSE E600 microscope equipped with Micropublisher 3.3 cooled and QCapture 2.60 software (QImaging Corp., Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Transient expression of AtNIP2;1::YFP in mesophyll protoplasts prepared from 3-week old Arabidopsis Col_0 wild type plants was done by the protocol described in Ref. 30Yoo S.D. Cho Y.H. Sheen J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar. Protoplasts were resuspended (2 × 105 protoplasts/ml) in 0.4 m mannitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MES, pH 5.7, and were transformed with 10 μg of pBS-35S-YFP containing the AtNIP2;1::YFP construct by the procedure described previously (30Yoo S.D. Cho Y.H. Sheen J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were cultured at room temperature for 18 h in 1 ml of 154 mm NaCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MES, pH 5.7. Subcellular localization of AtNIP2;1::YFP was observed using a Leica DMRE laser-scanning confocal microscope with filter setting of 507–532 nm for YFP and 588–716 nm for the chloroplast signal collection at the University of Tennessee Analytical Microscopy Facility (Knoxville, TN). Stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing AtNIP2;1::YFP C-terminal fusion were generated as described under “Plant Growth and Transformation.” AtNIP2;1::YFP was visualized in primary root tissues from 7-day-old T1 generation of AtNIP2;1::YFP expression lines using an Axiovert 200 M microscope (Zeiss) equipped with YFP fluorescence filter setting (Chroma, filter set 52017) of 500–530 nm. Images were captured with a digital camera (Hamamatsu Orca-ER) controlled by the Openlab software (Improvision). Western blots for FLAG-tagged proteins in Xenopus oocytes were done as in Ref. 17Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16826-16834Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar. AtNIP2;1 Is Expressed in the Vascular Tissue of Arabidopsis Roots and Is Induced by Anoxia Stress—Consistent with previous observations of microarray (31Alexandersson E. Fraysse L. Sjovall-Larsen S. Gustavsson S. Fellert M. Karlsson M. Johanson U. Kjellbom P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 59: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and promoter-reporter fusion data (32Mizutani M. Watanabe S. Nakagawa T. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Q-PCR analysis of total RNA from various organs of 2-week old Arabidopsis shows that AtNIP2;1 transcript is predominantly expressed in roots compared with other organs (Fig. 1A). GUS expression analysis supports the findings of Q-PCR and shows that the AtNIP2;1 promoter drives the expression of GUS in root tissues (Fig. 1, B and C). Expression predominantly occurs within the root cap and within the vascular cylinder of mature cells within the zone of cell specialization of the primary root, but it appears to be lacking in the zone of cell division and elongation (Fig. 1, B and C). Additionally, staining is absent in emerging, elongating lateral roots (Fig. 1B). To determine the subcellular localization of AtNIP2;1, C-terminal YFP fusion constructs were generated and were used to transiently transform Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts as well as produce stably transformed transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Fig. 2). Transient expression of AtNIP2;1-YFP results in a uniform expression around the cell periphery of protoplasts with a localization distinct from the cytosolic compartment visualized with endogenous fluorescence from chloroplasts (Fig. 2, A–C), consistent with plasma membrane localization. In addition, CaMV 35S-driven expression of AtNIP2;1::YFP in transgenic Arabidopsis roots shows a similar pattern of fluorescence (Fig. 2D), again consistent with localization in the plasma membrane. Although AtNIP2;1 is predominantly a root-specific transcript, its basal expression under standard plant growth conditions is extremely low compared with other plant MIP/aquaporin genes (32Mizutani M. Watanabe S. Nakagawa T. Maeshima M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given the sensitivity of a number of NIP genes to environmental conditions (15Wallace I.S. Choi W.G. Roberts D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the responsiveness of AtNIP2;1 transcript to various environmental and stress stimuli was investigated by Q-PCR (data not shown). Among the conditions tested, AtNIP2;1 expression showed extreme sensitivity to flooding (Fig. 3). Water logging of the roots of 2-week-old young seedlings results in a 70-fold increase in AtNIP2;1 transcript levels within the 1st h after submergence as assayed by Q-PCR (Fig. 3A). Expression decreased by 6 h post-flooding but still remained between 10- and 20-fold higher than the control transcript levels (Fig. 3A). This expression profile is also apparent in the GUS staining pattern of AtNIP2;1 promoter::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants exposed to flooding stress (Fig. 3B). After submersion, GUS expression rapidly increased and after 1 h peaked with high expression in the vascular cylinder as well as in cortical cells and lateral roots (Fig. 3B). GUS expression declined after this point, reaching a stable but elevated level at 6 h (Fig. 3B). Water logging of roots results in severe oxygen deficit because of the low diffusion coefficient of oxygen in water (33Armstrong W. Adv. Bot. Res. 1979; 7: 225-232Crossref Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). To test whether elevation of AtNIP2;1 expression is part of the response of the plant to oxygen deficit, 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to anoxia and AtNIP2;1 expression, along with that of two established anaerobic polypeptide transcripts (Pdc1 and Adh1 encoding pyruvate decarboxylase 1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1, respectively (34Kuörsteiner O. Dupuis I. Kuhlemeier C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Dolferus R. Jacobs M. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1075-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)), and were analyzed by Q-PCR (Fig. 4). At 30 min after the onset of anoxia, AtNIP2;1 exhibits an increase in expression that parallels that of Pdc1 (Fig. 4A) and Adh1 (Fig. 4B), and by 2 h the expression of AtNIP2;1 is increased 300-fold compared with control levels (Fig. 4B). Other Arabidopsis NIP Genes Are Not Affected by Anaerobic Stress—As pointed out previously, AtNIP2;1 is a member of a multigene subfamily of Arabidopsis NIPs (1Johansson U. Karlsson M. Johansson J. Gustavsson S. Sjovall S. Fraysse L. Weig A.R. Kjellbom P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 15Wallace I.S. Choi W.G. Roberts D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether this sensitivity to waterlogging/oxygen deprivation is a common response among the NIP subfamily, Q-PCR was performed on flooding and anoxia-stressed seedlings using transcript-specific probes for all members of the NIP subgroup I (AtNIP1;1, AtNIP1;2, AtNIP2;1, AtNIP3;1, AtNIP4;1, and AtNIP4;2). As shown in Fig. 5, a low but detectable signal was observed for all NIPs in 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings, except AtNIP4;1, which is expressed at an exceedingly low level based on microarray and Q-PCR data (31Alexandersson E. Fraysse L. Sjovall-Larsen S. Gustavsson S. Fellert M. Karlsson M. Johanson U. Kjellbom P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 59: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Although AtNIP1;1 showed a slight increase in expression in response to water logging, all other NIP transcripts showed little or no change in response to flooding or anoxia stress compared with AtNIP2;1 (Fig. 5A). This argues that AtNIP2;1 is selectively regulated in response to oxygen deprivation. Analysis of the Water and Solute Permeability of AtNIP2;1—To determine its water and solute transport properties, AtNIP2;1 was expressed as an N-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion in Xenopus oocytes. AtNIP2;1 is a member of NIP subgroup 1 (9Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and for the sake of comparison to this group of proteins, its transport properties were compared with the well studied prototypical NIP I protein, soybean nodulin 26, by using the general approach of Wallace and Roberts (17Wallace I.S. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16826-16834Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Injection of AtNIP2;1 cRNA results in expression of the protein in oocytes at approximately the same level as soybean nodulin 26 (Fig. 6) but showed a lower ability to transport water. AtNIP2;1-expressing oocytes showed only a modest 2-fold increase in their osmotic water permeability (Pf = 0.99 × 10-4 cm/s, pH 7.6), compared with control oocytes (0.46 × 10-4 cm/s), and was significantly lower than that observed with control oocytes expressing soybean nodulin 26 (1.93 × 10-4 cm/s, pH 7.6) (Fig. 6). Water flux through AtNIP2;1 and nodulin 26 were both inhibited by 1 mm Hg2+ (Fig. 6B), consistent with previous observations suggesting protein facilitated water flow (4Rivers R.L. Dean R.M. Chandy C. Hall J.E. Roberts D.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 256-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nodulin 26 showed an enhanced Pf in response to lower pH (4.6 × 10-4 cm/s, pH 5; Fig. 6A), consistent with previous observations of pH-dependent gating stimulating the transport of some aquaporins (36Nemeth-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The water permeability of AtNIP2;1 remained low throughout the pH range, although a slight elevation of Pf is observed at pH 4 (Fig. 6A). As discussed previously, given the low intrinsic water permeability of the NIP family and their multifunctional transport activities, they may play a cellular role in the transport of altern"

We have shown that mitoNEET is a member of a small family of proteins containing a 39-amino-acid CDGSH domain. Although the CDGSH domain is annotated as a zinc finger motif, mitoNEET was shown to contain iron (Wiley, S. E., Murphy, A. N., Ross, S. A., van der Geer, P., and Dixon, J. E. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 5318-5323). Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that it contained a redox-active pH-labile Fe-S cluster. Mass spectrometry showed the loss of 2Fe and 2S upon cofactor extrusion. Spectroscopic studies of recombinant proteins showed that the 2Fe-2S cluster was coordinated by Cys-3 and His-1. The His ligand was shown to be involved in the observed pH lability of the cluster, indicating that loss of this ligand via protonation triggered release of the cluster. mitoNEET is the first identified 2Fe-2S-containing protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Based on the biophysical data and domain fusion analysis, mitoNEET may function in Fe-S cluster shuttling and/or in redox reactions."

The lattice-preferred orientations obtained in the sample suggest that slip on planes near (100) and (110) dominate plastic deformation under these conditions. Assuming similar behavior at lower mantle conditions, we simulated plastic strains and the contribution of post-perovskite to anisotropy in the D″ region at the Earth core-mantle boundary using numerical convection and viscoplastic polycrystal plasticity models. We find a significant depth dependence of the anisotropy that only develops near and beyond the turning point of a downwelling slab.

We report here the resurrection of the core protein of a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome and show that the human variant of the intrinsic immune protein TRIM5α can actively prevent infection by this virus. However, we suggest that selective changes that have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species more susceptible to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)."
https://openalex.org/W1996452203,"Two closely related Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), MPK3 and MPK6, are rapidly but transiently activated in plants exposed to ozone. Although the contribution of these MAPKs to control of redox stress has been examined extensively, it remains unclear whether the dual-specificity MKPs play an essential role in the regulation of these processes. To explore this question, specific knockdown of each of the five putative MKPs in Arabidopsis was performed, and the ozone sensitivity phenotype of each MKP-suppressed line was assessed. Silencing of only one previously uncharacterized MKP, designated AtMKP2, rendered the plants hypersensitive to oxidative stress. AtMKP2-suppressed plants displayed significantly prolonged MPK3 and MPK6 activation during ozone treatment, and recombinant AtMKP2 was able to dephosphorylate both phospho-MPK3 and phospho-MPK6 in vitro, providing direct evidence that AtMKP2 may target these oxidant-activated MAPKs. In addition, the in vitro phosphatase activity of AtMKP2 was enhanced by co-incubation with either recombinant MPK3 or MPK6. In AtMKP2:YFP-expressing plants, the fusion protein was localized predominantly in the nucleus, the same compartment into which ozone-activated MPK3 and MPK6 have previously been shown to be translocated. Taken together, these data suggest that AtMKP2, a novel MKP protein in Arabidopsis, acts upon MPK3 and −6, and serves as a positive regulator of the cellular response to oxidant challenge.

At the same time, there is good evidence that specific ROS can also act as signal transduction messengers, most notably in the detection and response processes by which plant cells deal with potential pathogens (4Lamb C.

Song C.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1438-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These seemingly contrasting scenarios require the cell to manage ROS levels through temporally and spatially modulated mechanisms that allow suppression of undesirable ROS accumulation while still permitting intra- or intercellular transmission of ROS-encoded information.

Cell. 2001; 93: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and these kinase-based signal transduction modules are known to regulate a host of cellular processes, including responses to oxidant stress (10Samuel M.A. Miles G.P. Ellis B.E. Plant J. 2000; 22: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the MAPKs most implicated in oxidative stress signaling are MPK3 and MPK6. Suppression of the ozone-activated MAPK, MPK6, results in a marked ozone-hypersensitivity phenotype (11Miles G.P. Samuel M.A. Zhang Y. Ellis B.E. Environ. Pollut. 2005; 138: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as does loss of its close homologue, MPK3 (11Miles G.P. Samuel M.A. Zhang Y. Ellis B.E. Environ. Pollut. 2005; 138: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas constitutive activation of MPK6 in Arabidopsis by ectopic expression of a heterologous tobacco MAPKK, NtMEK, also induces rapid cell death (12Liu Y. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3386-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that either loss or unregulated activation of MPK3 and/or MPK6 makes plant cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress. The activation of MAPKs such as MPK3 and MPK6 is the result of MAPKK-catalyzed dual phosphorylation of a -TXY- motif in the activation loop near sub-domain VIII of the kinase domain (13Jonak C. Okresz L. Bogre L. Hirt H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). ROS-elicited activation of these MAPKs is normally transient (14Desikan R. Hancock J.T. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Neill S.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), indicating that the -pTXpY- phosphate groups are quickly removed, and the MAPK is deactivated, presumably through the action of phosphoprotein phosphatases. Although much is known about the activation and biological roles of MPK3 and MPK6 in plants (15Kovtun Y. Chiu W.L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar), the process by which they are inactivated remains unclear. In mammalian systems, MAPK dephosphorylation is typically catalyzed by a group of specialized dual-specificity phosphotyrosine phosphatases known as MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) that regulate the activities of their MAPK targets through specific dephosphorylation of both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues (16Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Because both the magnitude and duration of MAPK activity can dictate the outcome of physiological responses, MKPs play important roles in modulating MAPK signaling processes. The 11 members of the mammalian MKP family exhibit differential specificities toward their MAPK substrates as well as distinct subcellular localization patterns (17Dickinson R.J. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and they are collectively responsible for the regulated dephosphorylation and inactivation of the 14 presently identified mammalian MAPKs. In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome encodes five potential MKPs, based on the amino acid sequence similarity of the phosphatase catalytic domain to established animal MKPs (18Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Barsam B. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This five member family of putative AtMKPs includes the previously reported members, AtMKP1, DsPTP1, PHS1, and IBR5, but among these, only one candidate, DsPTP1, has been shown to possess dephosphorylation activity against an Arabidopsis MAPK (MPK4) (19Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no physiological context has yet been defined for DsPTP1 activity. AtMKP1, on the other hand, was earlier reported to interact strongly with MAPK MPK6 in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the loss-of-function mkp1 mutant displayed mis-regulation of MPK6 activity specifically in response to genotoxic stress in planta (20Ulm R. Revenkova E. di Sansebastiano G.P. Bechtold N. Paszkowski J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Ulm R. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Peck S.C. Zhu T. Wang X. Shinozaki K. Paszkowski J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6483-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Despite these indications of a functional relationship between AtMKP1 and MPK6, the ability of AtMKP1 to catalyze dephosphorylation of activated MAPKs has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we describe genetic and biochemical studies showing that another putative MKP, AtMKP2 (At3g06110), participates in the regulation of cellular homeostasis in ozone-challenged tissue and can influence the activation state of MPK3 and MPK6. Suppression of AtMKP2 creates a marked ozone sensitivity phenotype in Arabidopsis plants, and this hypersensitivity is accompanied by prolonged activation of both MPK3 and MPK6. We also show that AtMKP2 is a functional MKP capable of dephosphorylating the conserved -pTEpY- motif of MPK3 and MPK6 in vitro and that its catalytic activity is significantly increased by association with these MAPKs. Overall, these results demonstrate that AtMKP2, the fifth member of the putative MKP family in Arabidopsis, contributes to the survival of plant cells challenged by redox stress and that it may do so through its ability to specifically dephosphorylate the oxidant-activated MAPKs, MPK3 and −6. Plant Materials and Treatments—Wild-type Arabidopsis (ecotype “Columbia-0”) and five MKP-RNAi lines (AtMKP1i, AtMKP2i, DsPTP1i, PHS1i, and IBR5i) were used in this study. After sterilization, all seeds were sown on agar-solidified MS medium with or without 50 μg/ml hygromycin and stratified at 4 °C for 3 days before incubation at 22 °C under constant white light for seed germination and seedling growth. One-week-old seedlings were transferred to soil and grown further under environmentally controlled conditions (22 °C under a 16-h photo-period) for 2 weeks. At this point, silencing of each of the five potential MKPs in the appropriate RNAi lines was induced by spraying the plants to run-off with 30 μm dexamethasone (DEX). For the ozone treatment, 24 h following DEX induction, the plants were exposed to ozone (500 ppb) generated by a Delzone ZO-300 ozone-generating sterilizer (DEL Industries, San Luis Obispo, CA) and monitored with a 1003-AH ozone analyzer (Dasibi Environmental Corp., Glendale, CA). For the harpin treatment, the third and fourth fully developed leaves on DEX-induced plants were infiltrated with recombinant harpin (0.5 μg/μl) using a 1-ml syringe without needle. Samples for protein and RNA preparation were collected at various times after these treatments, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Generation of Arabidopsis MKP-RNAi Lines—The double-stranded RNA interference constructs were produced via a PCR-mediated approach using the amplification products from the unique N-terminal regions (∼300 bp) of AtMKP1, AtMKP2, DsPTP1, PHS1, and IBR5. A minimal intron based on the splice junctions and flanking regions belonging to the fourth intron of MPK6 was integrated into the sense strand primers. The sense strands were then amplified using a primer combination that generated a XhoI restriction site on one end and an intron plus restriction site (either EcoR1 or BamH1) sequence on the opposite end of the product. The antisense strands were amplified using a primer combination that added a SpeI site and either EcoR1 or BamH1 restriction sites on the opposite ends of the amplicon. These two products were cloned into XhoI/SpeI-digested pTA7002 by a triple ligation, which placed the RNAi construct under the control of the steroid-inducible promoter (22Aoyama T. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 carrying the different constructs was grown overnight in LB medium containing 25 μg/ml gentamycin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were transformed by the floral dip method (23Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—To analyze the level of gene expression by reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR, total RNA samples were prepared from 3-week-old plants using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. Reverse transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences), and aliquots of the resulting RT reaction product were used as template for RT-PCR analysis. The following primers were used for RT-PCR: ACT8 forward, 5′-ATTAAGGTCGTGGCA-3′; ACT8 reverse, 5′-TCCGAGTTTGAAGAGGCTAC-3′; AtMKP1 forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGTGGAGAGAAGGGCAAAGTTTTG-3′; AtMKP1 reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTTATAGCGCGCTCAGCAGTGCTAGCA-3′; AtMKP2 forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGGAGAAAGTGGTTGATCTCTTCG-3′; AtMKP2 reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGAAGCAATCATGCATTACCTTGGATG-3′; DsPTP1 forward; 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGCCTTCTTTTCCAATGAGTTCTAGAG-3′; DsPTP1 reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTCCACAACCACTTGCTTTTCATCCTC-3′; PHS1 forward, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGATGGCGGAACCTGAGAAGAAGCGAG-3′; PHS1 reverse, 5′-TATAGTCCTTTGGATGGTACCGTTTGATGGCGGAATCA-3′; IBR5 forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGAGGAAGAGAGAAAGAGAGAACC-3′; and IBR5 reverse, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGCTAAGAGCCATCCATTGCAATATCAC-3′. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—The frozen tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 tablet/50 ml extraction buffer of proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10% glycerol, 7.5% (w/v) polyvinypolypyrrolidone). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min, aliquots of supernatant were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-ERK (1:2000, New England Biolabs), anti-MPK3 (1:2000, Sigma), anti-MPK6 (1:5000, Sigma), or anti-GST (1:5000, Sigma) antibody as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) or antimouse IgG (Dako) as secondary antibody. Ion Leakage Assay—Ozone-induced cell death was quantified by measuring ion leakage with a Model 2052 digital conductivity meter (VWR) in whole rosette leaves after 4-h incubation in 5 ml of distilled water. Leakage was expressed as percentage of total ion release, quantified after killing the leaves by autoclaving. Fifteen leaves from five plants per genotype were assayed in each of the replicate experiments. Construction of KIMPK3, KIMPK6, KIMPK12, CAMKK4, CAMKK9, and CIAtMKP2 Clones—Expression vectors were created for mutant forms of GST-MPK3-, GST-MPK6-, GST-MPK12-, GST-MKK4-, GST-MKK9-, and GST-AtMKP2-encoded proteins in which the ATP binding site was modified to block activity (K67R for KIMPK3, K92R for KIMPK6, and K70R for KIMPK12), or the MKK activation phosphorylation sites were replaced with acidic residues to create a constitutively active kinase (T224D and S230E for CAMKK4, and S195E and S201E for CAMKK9), or the catalytic active site cysteine residue was replaced by serine (C109S for CIAtMKP2). All such modifications were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis with the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using the expression plasmid carrying a GST-MPK3, GST-MPK6, GST-MPK12, GST-MKK4, GST-MKK9, or GST-AtMKP2 cDNA insert, respectively, as template. The mutated constructs were sequenced to confirm the changes and the absence of mismatches. Recombinant Protein Production—Full-length cDNAs corresponding to MPK3, MPK6, MPK12, MKK4, MKK9, AtMKP2, and DsPTP1 were amplified by PCR. The amplicons were purified and digested by the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned in either the pGEX 4T-2 or pDEST™15 vector, which expresses the recombinant protein with a N-terminal GST tag, to yield the vectors pGEX-MPK3, pGEX-MPK6, pGEX-MPK12, pGEX-MKK4, pGEX-MKK9, pGEX-AtMKP2, and pGEX-DsPTP1. Wild-type and mutant expression vectors were transformed into the bacterial host strain BL21(DE3), and expression of protein was induced at mid-log phase by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 h at 25 °C). Recombinant proteins were purified on a glutathione affinity matrix according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphatase Assay—Phosphatase activity of AtMKP2 was assayed at 22 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 μm 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) in a 0.8-ml final volume. The reaction was quenched by addition of 0.2 ml of 5 n NaOH, and the amount of product (3-O-methylfluorescein) was determined from the absorbance at 477 nm. Kinetic parameters were determined by Lineweaver-Burke plot, and linear least squares line analyses of initial velocity data were obtained from seven different concentrations of OMFP. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—To prepare phosphorylated MPK3 and MPK6, recombinant GST-CAMKK4 was mixed with either recombinant GST-KIMPK3 or GST-KIMPK6 at 1:4 ratio in the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. To prepare phosphorylated MPK12, recombinant GST-CAMKK9 was mixed with recombinant GST-KIMPK12. The reaction mixture was then desalted on a Centri-Spin-10 column to separate free ATP from the kinases. To dephosphorylate the MPK3, MPK6, and MPK12 protein, various amounts of either recombinant GST or recombinant AtMKP2 and DsPTP1 (0, 1, 2.5, and 5 μg) proteins were mixed with 1.0 μg of phosphorylated MPK3, MPK6, or MPK12 preparation and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and phosphorylation of GST-KIMPK3, GST-KIMPK6, and GST-KIMPK12 was visualized by immunoblot analysis using anti-pERK antibody which specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated -pTXpY- motif in phospho-MPK3, phospho-MPK6, and phospho-MPK12. Subcellular Localization—Constructs expressing AtMKP2-YFP fusion protein were prepared using the Gateway™ system (Invitrogen). To generate 35S: AtMKP2: YFP, the AtMKP2 open reading frame was amplified and introduced into the pENTR™ vector. One fully sequenced clone was inserted into the vector pGWB41 (Research Institute of Molecular Genetics, Matsue, Japan). To generate the ProAtMKP2: AtMKP2: YFP construct, a 1.5-kb AtMKP2 genomic fragment upstream of the open reading frame was amplified, and the amplified fragment was introduced into the vector pGWB40 (Research Institute of Molecular Genetics). Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing each AtMKP2:YFP fusion construct were grown in sterile agar culture for 5 days. DNA was stained with 1 mg/ml 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride for 10 min. Roots were washed three times for 10 min and then mounted in water under glass coverslips for microscopy. The mounted specimens were examined using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. 514 nm was used for YFP excitation, along with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 oil-immersion lens. Recombinant Harpin—Recombinant harpin from Escherichia coli BL-21 cells harboring the pT7-7 plasmid containing the DNA fragment encoding harpinPsph was purified essentially according to Lee et al. (24Lee J. Klessig D.F. Nurnberger T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) except 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate was used for the precipitation, and desalting and concentration were achieved through dialysis (14- to 18-kDa cutoff). RNAi Silencing Yields Gene-specific MKP-suppressed Genotypes—Arabidopsis thaliana plants of the Columbia ecotype are relatively ozone-tolerant and display no visible damage when exposed to ozone (500 ppb) for 24 h. Such continuous ozone treatment results in rapid activation of two MAPKs, MPK3 and MPK6 (11Miles G.P. Samuel M.A. Zhang Y. Ellis B.E. Environ. Pollut. 2005; 138: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Ahlfors R. Macioszek V. Rudd J. Brosche M. Schlichting R. Scheel D. Kangasjarvi J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which then return to basal levels of activity after ∼2 h, but loss of function for either kinase blocks the deactivation of the other and is accompanied by increased ozone sensitivity (11Miles G.P. Samuel M.A. Zhang Y. Ellis B.E. Environ. Pollut. 2005; 138: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the five putative Arabidopsis MKP candidates (AtMKP1, At3g06110, DsPTP1, PHS1, and IBR5) play a role in controlling this refractory behavior, or regulating the ozone tolerance phenotype, we examined the corresponding MKP loss-of-function genotypes. We first sought T-DNA insertional mutant lines lacking each of these five genes but were not able to isolate homozygous lines with T-DNA insertions in all cases, either because of a lack of mutant stocks for a particular gene, or because homozygous mutant plants could not be recovered in progeny populations. Therefore, for consistency of genetic character, we designed gene-specific RNAi constructs that target the highly divergent 5′-region of each of the five potential MKP genes. To avoid potentially damaging effects of long term silencing, we also placed these RNAi constructs under the control of a DEX-inducible promoter. A. thaliana plants were transformed with each of the DEX-inducible MKP-RNAi constructs, and multiple transgenic lines were selected for evaluation. In the absence of DEX induction, all of these lines grew normally and displayed the wild-type phenotype. A series of T2-generation plants carrying each MKP-RNAi construct were then treated with 30 μm DEX for 24 h, and the expression level of each MKP gene was assessed by RT-PCR. Suppression of transcripts from each of the five endogenous MKP genes was observed to degrees ranging from partial to complete reduction of detectable mRNA (Fig. 1A). From among the most strongly suppressed RNAi lines, two independent lines for each of the five MKP candidate genes were selected for confirmation of the specificity and effectiveness of the knockdown (Fig. 1B) and then used for further study. Because high levels of expression of the GVG transactivator in transgenic plants carrying the pTA7002 DEX-inducible cassette have been reported to sometimes display stress phenotypes (26Kang H.G. Fang Y. Singh K.B. Plant J. 1999; 20: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), MKP-RNAi transgenic lines were screened by RT-PCR for GVG expression levels (data not shown), and only lines with moderate to low levels of GVG expression were carried forward. Only At3g06110-silenced Plants Exhibit Enhanced Sensitivity to Ozone Stress—Simultaneous exposure of all five MKP-silenced genotypes to 500 ppb ozone resulted in tissue collapse across the leaf blade of At3g06110-silenced plants within 2 h, whereas no damage was observed on wild-type leaves, or on leaves of the other MKP-RNAi-suppressed genotypes, at this time point (Fig. 2A). Ozone-induced cellular damage can be quantitatively assessed by measurements of ion leakage, indicative of increased membrane permeability. Measurements over an 8-h ozone exposure period confirmed that At3g06110-silenced plants treated with acute ozone lost control of plasma membrane integrity far more rapidly than did wild-type plants (Fig. 2B). Leaves from wild-type plants did not display any visible tissue collapse by 8 h and exhibited only a small increase in ion leakage over this exposure period. DEX-treated plants carrying the empty pTA7002 vector also showed no signs of ozone damage under these treatment conditions (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that loss of At3g06110 function severely compromises the ability of Arabidopsis plants to control redox stress. MPK3 and MPK6 Deactivation Is Delayed in Ozone-treated At3g06110-RNAi Plants—If MPK3 and 6 deactivation in ozone-treated plants is dependent on MKP activity, we predicted that MKP silencing should prolong MPK3 and MPK6 activation profiles during acute ozone challenge. To test this, expression of each MKP-RNAi construct was induced by DEX treatment, and the induced plants were challenged 24 h later with 500 ppb ozone. Leaf samples were collected at times from 0 to 8 h after onset of the ozone exposure, and the state of activation of MPK3 and MPK6 was analyzed on Western blots of leaf extracts, using an anti-pERK antibody that recognizes only the doubly phosphorylated form of these MAPKs. Uniformity of lane loading was monitored by subsequently stripping the blots and re-probing with anti-MPK6 antibodies, because MPK6 levels are known to be unaffected by stress treatments (25Ahlfors R. Macioszek V. Rudd J. Brosche M. Schlichting R. Scheel D. Kangasjarvi J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The ozone activation profiles of both MPK3 and MPK6 were broadly similar in wild-type and in AtMKP1-RNAi, DsPTP1-RNAi, PHS1-RNAi, and IBR5-RNAi plants (Fig. 2C), but in ozone-treated At3g06110-RNAi plants, activation of both kinases could be detected for up to ∼8 h, well beyond the point at which both kinases had been largely inactivated in the other MKP-suppressed lines. Locus At3g06110 Encodes a Functional MKP—Locus At3g06110 encodes a 18-kDa protein with a well conserved dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) catalytic domain. DSPs act on both phospho-Tyr and phospho-Ser/Thr residues in protein substrates, and in animals and yeast the DSP sub-group of MKPs is specifically involved in regulating MAPK activity (27Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine whether the At3g06110 locus encodes a functional MKP enzyme, we examined the catalytic properties of the recombinant protein. Recombinant GST-chimeric protein was successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A). When assayed against the synthetic phosphatase substrate, OMFP, the recombinant protein was shown to dephosphorylate OMFP in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). It is well established that replacement of the conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic active site (VXVHCX2GXSRSX5AYLM) of canonical DSPs by serine eliminates enzyme activity (29Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). As expected, when the C109S mutant was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-CIAt3g06110) this form of the gene product was found to possess no phosphatase activity in the OMFP assay system. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the protein encoded by At3g06110 can be considered a bona fide member of the MKP subfamily of eukaryotic DSPs, and we therefore named it AtMKP2. Recombinant AtMKP2 Dephosphorylates Phospho-MPK3 and -MPK6 in Vitro—The activity of a MAPK is dependent on the phosphorylation status of its -TXY- motif (30Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar), and these phosphoamino acid residues are also the target of MKP activity. The observation that loss of AtMKP2 function in AtMKP2-RNAi plants"
https://openalex.org/W2117233882,"Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including periodontal diseases and preterm birth. A novel FadA adhesin was recently identified for host-cell binding. It consists of 129 amino acid residues, with an 18-amino acid signal peptide. Expression of FadA in Escherichia coli enhanced bacterial binding to host epithelial and endothelial cells. In both E. coli and F. nucleatum, FadA exists in two forms, the intact pre-FadA and the secreted mature FadA (mFadA), with pre-FadA anchored in the inner membrane and mFadA secreted outside the bacteria. Pre-FadA and mFadA formed high Mr complexes. When each form was purified to a single species, mFadA was soluble at neutral pH, whereas pre-FadA was insoluble. Pre-FadA became soluble when mixed with mFadA or under acidic pH. When fluorescence-labeled mFadA alone was added to the epithelial cells, no binding was detected. However, when mixed with nonlabeled pre-FadA, binding and invasion of mFadA into epithelial cells was observed. FadA is a unique bacterial adhesin/invasin in that it utilizes its own two forms for both structural and functional purposes. The pre-FadA-mFadA complex is probably anchored in the inner membrane and protrudes through the outer membrane. Internalization of the pre-FadA-mFadA ensures invasion of the bacteria into the host cells.

Internalization of the pre-FadA-mFadA ensures invasion of the bacteria into the host cells. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections. It is ubiquitous to the oral cavity and is implicated in periodontal diseases (1Moore W.E. Moore L.V. Periodontology 2000. 1994; 5: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The organism coaggregates with microbial species in the oral cavity, playing a critical role in periodontal plaque formation (2Kolenbrander P.E. London J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3247-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). It is also isolated from infections and abscesses of other parts of the body and is one of the most prevalent species in human intrauterine infections (3Chaim W. Mazor M. Arch. Gynecol. Obstet. 1992; 251: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Hill G.B. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1993; 16: 423-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Watts D.H. Krohn M.A. Hillier S.L.

F. nucleatum may translocate from the oral cavity to different sites in the body hematogenously and cause localized abscess or infection (6Hill G.B. Ann. Periodontol. 1998; 3: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The organism binds to and invades different types of host cells. Attachment and invasion of epithelial and endothelial cells by F. nucleatum was observed in vitro, which elicited proinflammatory responses (7Han Y.W. Redline R.W. Li M. Yin L. Hill G.B. McCormick T.S. Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Han Y.W. Shi W. Huang G.T. Kinder Haake S. Park N.H. Kuramitsu H. Genco R.J. Infect Immun. 2000; 68: 3140-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Attachment and invasion of endothelial cells was also observed in vivo in infected mouse placentas, leading to bacterial colonization in the placenta and resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes (7Han Y.W. Redline R.W. Li M. Yin L. Hill G.B. McCormick T.S. Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that F. nucleatum may possess lectin-like and nonlectin-like adhesins for binding to various partners (9Tuttle R.S. Strubel N.A. Mourad J. Mangan D.F. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 7: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Mangan D.F. Novak M.J. Vora S.A. Mourad J. Kriger P.S. Infect.

Shaniztki B. Dotan M. Ganeshkumar N. Kolenbrander P.E. Metzger Z. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 15: 371-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different F. nucleatum strains may bind to the same partner via different adhesins (9Tuttle R.S. Strubel N.A. Mourad J. Mangan D.F. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 7: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The same adhesin(s) may also be involved in binding to different partners (12Weiss E.I. Shaniztki B. Dotan M. Ganeshkumar N. Kolenbrander P.E. Metzger Z. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 15: 371-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several putative adhesin molecules have been suggested for F. nucleatum for involvement in binding to other microbial species or human IgG (13Kinder S.A. Holt S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 840-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaufman J. DiRienzo J.M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shaniztki B. Hurwitz D. Smorodinsky N.

However, none has been characterized, and it was not known if they were involved in bacterial binding to the host cells. A novel adhesin, FadA, from F. nucleatum 12230 was recently identified to be involved in attachment to host epithelial cells (18Han Y.W. Ikegami A. Rajanna C. Kawsar H.I. Zhou Y. Li M. Sojar H.T. Genco R.J. Kuramitsu H.K. Deng C.X. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5330-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The fadA gene was highly conserved among oral fusobacterial species, including F. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, but was absent from the nonoral fusobacteria (18Han Y.W. Ikegami A. Rajanna C. Kawsar H.I. Zhou Y. Li M. Sojar H.T. Genco R.J. Kuramitsu H.K. Deng C.X. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5330-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). FadA consists of 129 aa residues, with the first 18 encoding a typical signal peptide (MKKFLLLAVLAVSASAFA) (18Han Y.W. Ikegami A. Rajanna C. Kawsar H.I. Zhou Y. Li M. Sojar H.T. Genco R.J. Kuramitsu H.K. Deng C.X. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5330-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was not known, however, if the signal peptide was cleaved during secretion in F. nucleatum. Based on the amino acid sequence, FadA appeared to be predominantly α-helical. Using a novel gene disruption technique, sonoporation, we constructed the first double cross-over allelic exchange mutant of F. nucleatum, US1, carrying a deletion of fadA.

Therefore, FadA was involved in binding to epithelial cells (18Han Y.W. Ikegami A. Rajanna C. Kawsar H.I. Zhou Y. Li M. Sojar H.T. Genco R.J. Kuramitsu H.K. Deng C.X. J.

In the current study, the FadA adhesin was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His tag fusion protein, which was purified and characterized. The recombinant FadA not only attached to but also invaded the host cells as a heterogenous complex. The formation of such a complex required both the intact and secreted forms of FadA, and the complex is probably anchored in the inner membrane and protrudes through the outer membrane.

All F. nucleatum strains were propagated as described (19Han Y.W. Coico R. Kowalik T. Quarles J. Stevenson B. Taylor R. Current Protocols in Microbiology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2006Google Scholar). All E. coli strains were maintained in LB broth (Difco) or on LB agar (Difco) and incubated at 37 °C in air. Plasmid pYWH417-6 was constructed as follows. The fadA gene from F. nucleatum 12230 was amplified from pYWH401 using primers fadAtop-NdeI (5′-GGAATTCCATATGAAAAAATTTTTATTATTAGCAG-3′) and fadAbottom-XhoI-His tag (5′-CCGCTCGAGGTTACCAGCTCTTAAAGCTTG-3′), using Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The PCR fragments contained NdeI and XhoI sites (underlined) at their ends, respectively. Following endonuclease digestion and purification using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), the fragment was cloned into pET21(b) (Table 1) at the NdeI and XhoI sites, followed by transformation into competent E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen).TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicSource or referenceStrainsF. nucleatum 12230Transtracheal isolate, working strain in the laboratoryRefs. 8Han Y.W.

The bacteria were then added to the monolayers at a multiplicity of infection of 50–150:1. For inhibitory attachment assays, purified mFadA or reconstituted pre-FadA-mFadA complex was added to the monolayers prior to the addition of bacteria. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, the monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma) and lysed with water. It was shown previously that water lysis under the test conditions did not affect bacterial viability (8Han Y.W. Shi W. Huang G.T. Kinder Haake S. Park N.H. Kuramitsu H. Genco R.J.

The bacterial colonies were enumerated, and the levels of attachment were expressed as the percentage of bacteria recovered following cell lysis relative to the total number of bacteria initially added. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Purification of Recombinant FadA Mixture under Denaturing Conditions—The bacterial pellet (about 1 g) from 250 ml of IPTG-induced culture was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 8.0), and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Clear lysate was collected by centrifugation (7000 × g, 20 min) and mixed with 1 ml of TALON® cobalt resin (BD Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to a small column. After all of the solution was removed, the resin was washed with 6 ml of buffer A and eluted with 4 ml of buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 5.0). The eluted sample (4 ml) was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, in a dialysis tubing with Mr cut-off of 6000–8000. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—Protein bands from SDS-PAGE were excised and eluted from the gel slices. The gel-purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The mass spectrometer (Biflex III; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) was used at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV operated in the linear mode with delayed extraction and a pulsed nitrogen laser source (λ = 337 nm). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of a saturated matrix solution (15 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 60% acetonitrile and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid). One microliter of the mixture was applied onto the laser target probe and was air-dried before being introduced into the mass spectrometer. A total of 200–300 spectra were obtained for each sample. The spectra were averaged and analyzed using the Xacq software provided by the manufacturer. The instrument was calibrated using a mixture of standard proteins. A mass accuracy of 0.02–0.08% was routinely obtained. Production of Polyclonal Antibodies against FadA—Two 12-week-old male New Zealand White rabbits were each injected intradermally with 500 μg of mFadA in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma), followed by three weekly boosts 3 weeks later, by injecting 500 μg of FadA in Freund's incomplete adjuvant each time. Antisera were collected 1 week after the final boost. Production of Monoclonal Antibodies against FadA—The mouse anti-FadA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5G11-3G8 was produced at the Hybridoma Core (Lerner Research Institute) following standard procedures. Briefly, the hybridomas secreting mAb were derived from the BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant mFadA. Antibodies of the desired specificity were identified by their specific binding to FadA in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, followed by Western blotting analysis using purified FadA proteins and F. nucleatum 12230. One of the hybridoma clones was designated as 5G11-3G8. The mAb from this clone was obtained from the serum-free culture, followed by purification using the protein G column, and stored at a final concentration of 4 mg/ml. Western Blotting Analysis—Bacteria culture supernatant, cell pellets, or fractions were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the bacterial components were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Expression of the FadA-His tag fusion protein was detected using either INDIA™ HisProbe-HRP (1:1000 dilution; Pierce) or rabbit anti-FadA polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) or mAb 5G11-3G8 (1:20,000 dilution) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; Sigma), or HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2500 dilution; Pierce), followed by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) or HRP color development reagent (Bio-Rad). Gel Filtration Column Chromatography—Approximately 1.8 mg of protein in 1 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5) was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences), connected and operated by a BioLogic LP system (Bio-Rad). The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C, fractions were collected at 2 or 2.5 ml/tube, and the absorption at 280 nm was recorded. A standard curve was generated using blue dextran (2000 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.3 kDa), all purchased from Sigma. Bacterial Fractionation—Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. All samples were kept at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Bacteria were disrupted by sonication in an ice-water bath using a model 60 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) (15 s with a 45-s interval, 20 cycles) with an output power of 18 watts for a total of 5 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 3000 × g for 15 min and again at 7000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 15 °C, producing the clear supernatant (i.e. cell extract). The pellet was washed with ice-cold 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, resuspended in the same buffer containing 0.8% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sigma), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. After ultracentrifugations at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 15°C, the clear supernatant was saved as the inner membrane fraction. The procedure was repeated once, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, and was saved as the outer membrane fraction. The protein concentrations were measured by BCA. To detect mFadA in the culture supernatant of E. coli, 20 ml of the culture supernatant was filtrated through a Nalgene 0.2-μm syringe filter, followed by 80% ammonium sulfate precipitation in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 16 h. Sedimented protein was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The proteins were dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, followed by washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 80% ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. Purification of mFadA—The bacterial pellet from 3 liters of IPTG-induced culture was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 300 ml of PBS. The suspension was incubated at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The bacterial cell pellet was saved for purification of pre-FadA (see below). The clear supernatant was mixed with 6 ml of TALON® cobalt resin in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0. After transferring to a column and washing, mFadA was eluted with 20 ml of washing buffer containing 0.15 m imidazole. The eluate was suspended in 8 m urea, pH 4.0, and applied to the High S cationic exchange column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm acetic acid, 0.3 m NaCl, 8 m urea) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was then washed with 50 ml of buffer C to collect mFadA. The eluted sample was dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 16 h. The protein concentration was determined by BCA. Purification of Pre-FadA—The bacterial pellet obtained above was resuspended in 120 ml of buffer A and incubated with agitation at room temperature for 1 h. The clear lysate was collected by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 20 min, followed by cobalt column purification as described above. The eluted sample was adjusted to pH 4 with acetic acid and passed through the High S cationic exchange column as described above. Following washes with buffer C, the column was eluted with buffer D (50 mm acetic acid, 1 m NaCl, 8 m urea). Following dialysis, the eluate was applied to preparative 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The pre-FadA band was excised, and the protein was eluted. The eluted sample was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The pre-FadA precipitation was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 50 mm acetic acid when needed. The protein concentration was determined by BCA. Fluorescent Labeling of Proteins—Purified mFadA or cytochrome c were labeled with Alexa-fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, purified mFadA was mixed with Alexa-fluor 488 stock solution at a molar ratio of 5:1 and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. The labeled protein was purified by a D-Salt dextran desalting column (Pierce) and concentrated by Microcon YM-3 (Millipore). Reconstitution of pre-FadA-mFadA Complex—Purified mFadA was mixed with purified and acid-dissolved pre-FadA at a molar ratio of 5:1 by slowly adding pre-FadA into mFadA, followed by incubation at 4 °C for at least 2 h. The mixture was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, with an Mr cut-off of 6000–8000. For the epithelial cell binding assays, fluorescence-labeled mFadA was used for the complex reconstitution (below). Binding of Fluorescence-labeled Recombinant FadA to OKF6/Tert Cells—Immortalized human oral keratinocytes OKF6/Tert cells were inoculated into a Lab-Tek II chamber slide system (Nalge Nunc International Co., Naperville, IL) and grown until 50% confluent. Following preincubation in culture medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, the fluorescence-labeled proteins were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were washed four times with Hanks' buffer. The actin and cell nuclei were sequentially stained with 20 μm Alexa-fluor 568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 15 min and 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 5 min, respectively. For the competition assays, nonlabeled pre-FadA-mFadA complex (mFadA/pre-FadA ratio of 5:1) in 20-fold excess or mFadA alone in 20-fold excess was added to the monolayers 8 h prior to the addition of the fluorescence-labeled FadA complex. The fluorescence was observed under an Olympus IX71 microscope using emission filter BA420 and excitation filter BP330-385 for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (exposure time 2.5 ms), emission filter BA515IF and excitation filter BP460-490 for Alexa-fluor 488 (exposure time 250 ms), and emission filter BA590 and excitation filter BP510-550 for Alexa-fluor 568 (exposure time 500 ms). The images were captured using an Olympus DP70 camera operated with DP controller software version 1.2.1.108. Scanning Confocal Laser Microscopy—The binding assay described above was performed in glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Co., Ashland, MA). Following the assay, the cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. The cell nuclei and actin were stained with 20 μm Draq5 (AXXORA, San Diego, CA) and Alexa-fluor 568 phalloidin, respectively, at 37 °C for 15 min. After washing with Hanks' buffer, the slides were examined with a scanning confocal laser microscope (model LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The argon and helium/neon-2 lasers were used to excite the fluorescent dyes, Alexafluor 488 and 568 and Draq5, respectively. The resulting corrections of images were processed for display by using Java-based program ImageJ for OSX (version 1.33u; W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health) with the LSM reader plug-in. The fadA gene was amplified from pYWH401 by PCR, cloned into the expression vector pET21(b), and transformed into E. coli DH5α (Table 1). The recombinant plasmid carried a fusion gene expressing FadA with eight additional residues, Leu-Glu-His6, at the carboxyl end. Through DNA sequencing analysis, a wild-type FadA fusion construct was identified and designated as pYWH417-6 (Table 1). A mutant construct was also identified and designated as pYWH417-2, with a Glu-to-Lys substitution at position 26 in the mature form of FadA (mFadA E26K). This mutation was presumably introduced during PCR amplification (Table 1). All three plasmids, pYWH417-2, pYWH417-6, and pET21(b), were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression of the recombinant fusion proteins was tested with different amounts of IPTG and induction times, followed by Western blotting analysis using INDIA™ His-Probe-HRP specific for His tag. An optimal amount of FadA-His tag fusion protein was detected from BL21(DE3)/pYWH417-6 following a 2-h induction with 0.1 mm IPTG (Fig. 1A). Under all conditions tested, no His tag fusion was detected from BL21(DE3)/pET21(b) (Fig. 1A). The apparent Mr of the recombinant fusion protein was between 16,000 and 17,000, higher than the calculated Mr of 15,700 for the intact or 13,700 for the mature (secreted) protein (Fig. 1A). The stability of the expressed recombinant proteins was also examined. As shown in Fig. 1B, wild-type FadA-His tag fusion was consistently induced even after 5 h of incubation with 0.1 mm IPTG. The expressed protein appeared to be rather stable, with no detectable degradation following 1 h of incubation on ice. In contrast, expression of the FadA E26K-His tag fusion was much weaker and unstable (Fig. 1B). Moderate expression was detected following 0.5 h of induction with either 0.1 or 1 mm IPTG. However, the protein level quickly decreased with time. It was only weakly detected after 1 h of induction and was not detected at all after 2 h, indicating degradation of the expressed protein. Thus, BL21(DE3)/pYWH417-2"
https://openalex.org/W1971226910,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein/thrombospondin 5 (COMP/TSP5) is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the musculoskeletal system. Its importance is underscored by its association with several growth disorders. In this report, we investigated its interaction with aggrecan, a major component of cartilage ECM. We also tested a COMP/TSP5 mutant, designated MUT3 that accounts for 30% of human pseudoachondroplasia cases, to determine if the mutation affects function. Using a solid-phase binding assay, we have shown that COMP/TSP5 can bind aggrecan. This binding was decreased with MUT3, or when COMP/TSP5 was treated with EDTA, indicating the presence of a conformation-dependent aggrecan binding site. Soluble glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) partially inhibited binding, suggesting that the interaction was mediated in part through aggrecan GAG side chains. Using affinity co-electrophoresis, we showed that COMP/TSP5, in its calcium-replete conformation, bound to heparin, chondroitin sulfates, and heparan sulfate; this binding was reduced with EDTA treatment of COMP/TSP5. MUT3 showed weaker binding than calcium-repleted COMP/TSP5. Using recombinant COMP/TSP5 fragments, we found that the “signature domain” could bind to aggrecan, suggesting that this domain can mediate the interaction of COMP/TSP5 and aggrecan. In summary, our data indicate that COMP/TSP5 is an aggrecan-binding protein, and this interaction is regulated by the calcium-sensitive conformation of COMP/TSP5; interaction of COMP with aggrecan can be mediated through the GAG side chains on aggrecan and the “signature domain” of COMP/TSP5.

The expression pattern and level are altered in patients with arthritis. Compared with normal adult cartilage where a higher level of expression is in the deeper cartilaginous zones, there is decreased COMP/TSP5 expression in the mid and deeper zones and stronger expression in the superficial fibrillated cartilage in osteoarthritic (OA) and rheumatoid arthritic (RA) patients (11Di Cesare P.E.

Quantitative analysis shows a net loss of COMP/TSP5 from arthritic cartilage as compared with normal cartilage. Furthermore, COMP/TSP5 protein that remains in the arthritic cartilage shows increased degradation as compared with the mostly intact COMP/TSP5 extracted from normal cartilage (11Di Cesare P.E.

PSACH and MED/EDM1 differ in severity with the former presenting as a severe growth deficiency affecting cartilage and bone development. Both conditions are associated with gait abnormalities, and patients require hip replacement in the second or third decade of life. Marked dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in growth plate chondrocytes has been observed ultrastructurally (19Maynard J.A. Cooper R.R. Ponseti I.V. Lab.

In this investigation, we have studied the function of MUT3, a COMP/TSP5 single amino acid deletion (D469del) mutation accounting for 30% of the PSACH patients. Although immunohistochemical data and COMP/TSP5 mutations in PSACH and EDM1 suggest that COMP/TSP5 is important in cartilage, its precise functional role is currently unclear. Cartilage ECM contains three classes of proteins: collagens, proteoglycans, and other noncollagenous proteins including COMP/TSP5 (25Mow V.C. Gu W.Y. Chen F.H. Mow V.C. Huiskes R. Basic Orthopaedic Biomechanics and Mechano-biology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2005Google Scholar). Of these major components of cartilage, COMP/TSP5 can interact with type II and type IX collagens in a zinc-dependent fashion via its C-globe region (26Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D.

Through this interaction, COMP/TSP5 is thought to play a direct role in regulating collagen fibril formation and maintaining collagen network integrity. Structurally, COMP/TSP5 shares some of the structural domains that are also found in the other TSP proteins (1Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lawler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has the coiled-coil region and interchain disulfide bonds responsible for pentamer formation, four type 2 repeats, seven highly conserved type 3 repeats that consist of 13 potential calcium binding loops, and a C-terminal globular domain (C-globe region) (1Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lawler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). COMP/TSP5 lacks the two domains that function as heparin binding sites within TSP1, and it has been reported previously that COMP/TSP5 did not bind to heparin or purified proteoglycans (26Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29DiCesare P.E. Morgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J.

We and others (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol.

Mutations in the type 3 calcium binding repeats affect its ability to fold correctly into the mature conformation. Thus, calcium binding is important for maintaining the proper structure of COMP/TSP5. According to sequence comparison and structural analysis, the deleted amino acid residue in MUT3 D469 is involved in calcium coordination, and deletion of this residue is expected to interfere with the calcium binding capacity and disrupt the calcium-sensitive conformation of COMP/TSP5 (32Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In deed, the mutant protein has been shown to possess decreased calcium binding capacity with altered conformation of the molecule (31Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the calcium-sensitive conformation of COMP/TSP5 affects its function to support chondrocyte cell attachment through integrins (33Chen F.H. Thomas A.O. Hecht J.T. Goldring M.B. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, we have noticed during our initial effort to purify COMP/TSP5 from conditioned medium in its native calcium replete conformation that it bound to heparin-Sepharose. This observation prompted us to examine whether COMP/TSP5 could interact with other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and GAG-containing proteoglycans, including aggrecan. We postulated that in previous studies when COMP/TSP5 was isolated from tissues, chelation of calcium with EDTA during the purification procedures may have rendered the purified COMP/TSP5 in a calcium-depleted conformation. This led to results that may not reflect the function of COMP/TSP5 in cartilage extracellular matrix which is in a calcium replete environment (1Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29DiCesare P.E. Morgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J.

Therefore, in this study, we have re-assessed the function of COMP/TSP5 purified in the presence of calcium and investigated whether COMP/TSP5 can interact with one of the major components of cartilage, aggrecan. Proteins and Reagents—COMP/TSP5 and MUT3 were produced and purified as reported previously (31Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recombinant COMP/TSP5 fragments were produced in Drosophila S2 cells as described in detail under supplemental data. These fragments included: 1) the last type 2 repeat, the type 3 repeats, and the C-terminal domain (E4T3C5), 2) the type 3 repeats and the C-terminal domain (T3C5), or 3) just the C-terminal domain (C5) (Fig. 1). Aggrecan and monoclonal antibody against chondroitin sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against keratin sulfate I22 was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Monoclonal antibody against aggrecan core protein is from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). GAGs used for ACE experiments included porcine intestinal heparin, porcine skin dermatan sulfate (DS), bovine corneal keratan sulfate (KS), shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate (chondroitin-6-sulfate; C6S), bovine tracheal chondroitin sulfate (chondroitin-4-sulfate; C4S) from Sigma, and bovine kidney heparan sulfate (HS) from ICN. Affinity Co-electrophoresis (ACE) and Solid-phase Binding Assays—ACE assay was carried out as described before (35Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Herndon M.E.

Karnovsky M.J. Lander A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The detailed method is given under supplemental data. For the solid-phase binding assay, purified COMP/TSP5 was coated at 5 μg/ml on Immulon II 96-well plates (Thermo Labsystems) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 10 mm HEPES pH 7.2, containing 5 mm KCl and 140 mm NaCl) with 2 mm CaCl2 (HBS/C) at 4 °C overnight. Extra binding sites were blocked with heat-inactivated BSA (HI-BSA). Aggrecan at various concentrations in HBS/C was added to the COMP/TSP5-coated wells and incubated at 22 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. After extensive washing with HBS/C, the monoclonal antibody CS-56 against chondroitin sulfate (Sigma) was added to wells, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN). The steps above were performed with buffers containing 2 mm Ca2+. Chromogenic substrate ABTS was added to the wells, and color development was recorded on a microplate reader (Tecan). Wells coated with HI-BSA, but otherwise treated the same, were considered as background. To investigate the binding of COMP/TSP5 fragments to aggrecan, COMP/TSP5 at 7.5 μg/ml, or its fragments at equal molar concentrations, were coated, and the binding assay was performed as above, except that monoclonal antibody against keratin sulfate was used. Where the interaction of aggrecan with COMP/TSP5, depleted of calcium ions, was studied, after coating of COMP/TSP5 in the presence of HBS/C, the wells were incubated with HBS containing 5 mm EDTA (HBS/E) for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by extensive washing with HBS/C. Other steps were carried out as described above. For competition studies, after HI-BSA blocking, the protein-coated wells were incubated with various GAG solutions at 0.5 mg/ml in HBS/C for 60 min at 37 °C. The plates were then washed with HBS/C and continued with aggrecan incubation and development as described above. In our initial attempt to purify COMP/TSP5 from the conditioned medium, we found that COMP/TSP5 in the serum-free conditioned medium can be retained quantitatively by heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). COMP/TSP5 remained bound on the heparin-Sepharose column with a wash solution of TBS containing 0.20 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. This indicates that COMP/TSP5 can bind to heparin under physiological salt concentration. COMP/TSP5 can be eluted from the column with TBS/C containing 0.55 m NaCl (Fig. 2). The binding to heparin suggests the presence of functional GAG binding sites in COMP/TSP5. Because aggrecan, one of the major components of cartilage, have abundant GAG side chains of chondroitin sulfate (∼100 side chains/core protein) and keratan sulfate (∼50 side chains/core protein), we investigated the interaction of COMP/TSP5 with aggrecan using a solid-phase binding assay. Direct binding of aggrecan to COMP/TSP5 was demonstrated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay with COMP/TSP5 in its native calcium-replete state. Using this assay, we showed that aggrecan can bind to COMP/TSP5 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Binding became saturated at aggrecan concentrations of ∼100 μg/ml. Positive binding of aggrecan to COMP/TSP5 was shown with both antibodies against the GAG side chains of chondroitin sulfate (shown in Fig. 3) or keratin sulfate (see below, Fig. 6), or against the core protein (not shown). This suggests that the whole aggrecan molecule, but not merely the side chains, bind to COMP/TSP5.FIGURE 6Binding of COMP/TSP5 fragments to aggrecan molecule. The solid-phase binding assay was carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 3 except that antibody against KS was used in this experiment. Proteins were coated in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Shown are the average ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that COMP/TSP5 is a calcium-binding protein and that calcium binding affects its conformation (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the type 3 calcium binding repeats affect its ability to fold correctly into the mature conformation, and its ability to support chondrocyte attachment (33Chen F.H. Thomas A.O. Hecht J.T. Goldring M.B. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, calcium binding is important for maintaining the proper structure and function of COMP/TSP5. To determine whether the conformation of the type 3 calcium binding repeats could affect the binding of COMP/TSP5 to aggrecan, and to determine whether the mutation found in MUT3 affects this function, we have used COMP/TSP5 with calcium chelated from the molecule and MUT3 for the binding assay. When we chelated calcium ions from COMP/TSP5 with EDTA after coating, aggrecan binding to COMP/TSP5 was greatly diminished (Fig. 3). These data suggested an aggrecan binding site in COMP/TSP5 that was also sensitive to its calcium binding-dependent conformation. In agreement, MUT3 showed greatly reduced interaction with aggrecan in this solid-phase binding assay, regardless of whether MUT3 was in the calcium-replete or calcium-depleted conformation (Fig. 3). Our data showing COMP/TSP5 binding to heparin indicated a functional GAG binding capacity of COMP/TSP5. We therefore investigated whether COMP/TSP5 could bind to other GAGs directly. To evaluate whether COMP/TSP5 is a GAG-binding protein, and to determine whether the conformation of the type 3 calcium binding repeats could affect the functions of COMP/TSP5, we tested the interaction of COMP/TSP5 with common GAGs found in cartilage, tendon, and ligament in the presence of either calcium or EDTA. ACE was used to quantify the binding of COMP/TSP5 to heparin and other GAGs derived from various tissue sources, including chondroitin sulfates from cartilage. The results of these analyses are presented in Table 1, and representative ACE gel images are shown in Fig. 4. In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, COMP/TSP5 bound low molecular weight heparin with an average Kd value of 88.5 nm. This is similar to the Kd value previously determined for the binding of heparin to human platelet TSP1 (41 nm) (39Herndon M.E. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This was in agreement with our observation that COMP/TSP5 could be purified from conditioned medium using heparin-Sepharose.TABLE 1Binding of COMP/TSP5 to glycosaminoglycansGAGCOMP, Kd in 2 mm Ca2+COMP, Kd in 5 mm EDTAMUT3, Kd in 2 mm Ca2+MUT3, Kd in 5 mm EDTAHeparinPorcine intestine <6 kDa73, 104 nm477 nm121, 134 nm404 nmC4SBovine trachea530, 636 nm—aA dash indicates that the value was not determined.1.04 μm—C6SShark cartilage325, 481 nm>10 μm546, 604 nm>12 μmDSPorcine skin325, 346 nm—504, 621 nm—HSBovine kidney1.2 μm—>12 μm—KSBovine cornea>10 μm—>12 μm—a A dash indicates that the value was not determined. Open table in a new tab To better ascertain potential roles of COMP/TSP5 in relation to GAGs and proteoglycans that are present in cartilage, tendon, and ligament, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and three chondroitin sulfates (C6S, C4S, and DS) were tested for binding to COMP/TSP5 in the presence of 2 mm calcium using ACE (Table 1). Our data revealed that COMP/TSP5 bound to the three chondroitin sulfates with comparable affinities, with average Kd values ranging from 336 to 583 nm, while binding to HS was weaker (1.2 μm). COMP/TSP5 did not bind to keratan sulfate (Table 1). To further determine whether the conformation of calcium binding was important for GAG binding, COMP/TSP5 was tested for binding to heparin and C6S in the presence and absence of calcium (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Fig. 4 shows four representative ACE gels, comparing binding of heparin and C6S in 2 mm calcium and in 5 mm EDTA. The Kd values measured from these gels are included in Table 1. These results demonstrated that depletion of calcium reduced COMP/TSP5 affinity for both heparin and C6S. These data suggest the existence of a conformation-dependent CS binding site in the type 3 repeats and/or C-terminal domain of COMP/TSP5. To determine if the PSACH mutation in the type 3 calcium binding repeats affects GAG binding, we measured the binding of MUT3 to the various GAGs in the presence of 2 mm calcium or 5 mm EDTA (Table 1 and Fig. 4). MUT3 was able to bind heparin with a Kd value of 128 nm in the presence of calcium. MUT3 also bound chondroitin sulfates, albeit more weakly than did COMP/TSP5, with average Kd values ranging from 563 nm to 1.04 μm. MUT3 exhibited no discernible binding to HS, or keratan sulfate. Treatment of MUT3 with EDTA also decreased its affinity for heparin by ∼3-fold, and abolished its binding to C6S (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The above data suggest that COMP/TSP5 can bind to aggrecan, probably through its chondroitin sulfate, but not its keratin sulfate side chains. To ascertain that the COMP/TSP5 interaction with the GAG side chains did contribute to COMP/TSP5 binding to aggrecan, we next tested the effect of GAGs on the binding of COMP/TSP5 with aggrecan. Both C4S and C6S were able to inhibit the binding of COMP/TSP5 to aggrecan (Fig. 5). In addition, heparin, which was shown in our ACE assay to be able to bind COMP/TSP5, also inhibited the binding of COMP/TSP5 to aggrecan (Fig. 5). The level of inhibition obtained with heparin, C6S and C4S paralleled the affinity of COMP/TSP5 for these GAGs as measured by ACE (Table 1). To d"

In HIB1B cells PGC-1α and UCP1 expression is cAMP-inducible, but in 3T3-L1 cells, expression is reduced and is cAMP-insensitive.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that C/EBPβ and CREB bound to the CRE region in HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cell lysates. C/EBPβ expression was induced by cAMP only in HIB1B cells, and overexpression of C/EBPβ rescued cAMP-inducible PGC-1α and UCP1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells.

White adipose tissue (WAT) 2The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; UCP1, uncoupling protein 1; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; PGC-1α, PPARγ coactivator-1α; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MSV, mouse sarcoma virus; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; RT, real time. is able to store energy in the form of triacylglycerol, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat to maintain body temperature, particularly in juvenile animals (1Lomax M.A. Sadiq F. Karamanlidis G. Karamitri A. Trayhurn P. Hazlerigg D.G. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The BAT phenotype is characterized by a high density of mitochondria expressing the BAT-specific protein, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (2Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4640) Google Scholar). WAT is also an endocrine organ that secretes adipocytokines, which have been implicated in the control of a wide range of physiological functions that under pathophysiological conditions may lead to the development of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (3Flier J.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the conversion of progenitor cells to the WAT or BAT lineage will improve our understanding of processes that lead to WAT accumulation, obesity, and related pathological conditions. The immortalized mouse brown HIB1B and white 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell lines have been used to study the molecular events underlying the determination and differentiation of adipose tissue. 3T3-L1 cells can be induced to differentiate into lipid droplet accumulating cells by a mixture of hormones. White adipocyte differentiation is the result of a chain of transcriptional events involving CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (4Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), which combine to induce adipogenic genes. The transcriptional events involved in brown adipocyte differentiation are not as well characterized, but genetic ablation studies have demonstrated that PPARγ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, but not C/EBPα, are also essential for this process (9Nedergaard J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptor coactivator, PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) has been shown to be involved in the expression of the BAT phenotype (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is expressed in a number of tissues including brown adipose tissue, muscle, liver and brain (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). It may play a role in the stimulation of oxidative capacity via its interaction with the NRF1 and −2 family, which regulates mitochondriogenesis and the expression of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes (12Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is induced by exposure to cold or adrenergic stimulation in BAT but not WAT, and ectopic expression of PGC-1α induces expression of UCP1 in WAT cells (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is also expressed in non-adipose cells under circumstances in which increased metabolic energy expenditure is favored, for example in exercise-conditioned muscle tissue (13Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M.

Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The expression of PGC-1α is cAMP-dependent in liver and BAT, and a major role of PGC-1α is to augment cAMP-mediated transactivation of effector genes such as UCP1 in BAT, or PEPCK in the liver (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar, 13Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O.

Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). cAMP induction of PGC-1α appears to depend primarily on a single conserved cAMP response element (CRE) found within 200 bp of the transcription start site (14Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 15Cao W.

Although this proximal CRE can drive PGC-1α expression in both BAT and liver, additional unidentified mechanisms operate to silence cAMP-inducible PGC-1α expression in WAT, even though a range of other WAT expressed genes are cAMP-regulated (16Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A genome-wide analysis of CREs in the human genome has revealed that CREB-binding protein (CBP) and phosphorylated CREB (phospho-CREB) are widely bound to CREs without transactivation (17Zhang X. Odom D.T. Koo S.H. Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Best J. Chen H. Jenner R. Herbolsheimer E. Jacobsen E. Kadam S. Ecker J.R. Emerson B. Hogenesch J.B. Unterman T. Young R.A. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Despite the association of phospho-CREB with a number of coactivators (CBP/p300), gene activation is weak and appears to require additional phospho-CREB regulatory partners for stable recruitment of the preinitiation complex. Studies on the PEPCK and interleukin-10 promoters have demonstrated an interaction between CRE and C/EBP binding sites in conferring tissue-specific and differentiation-dependent responses to cAMP (18Park E.A.

To investigate the differential activation of PGC-1α and UCP1 gene expression by cAMP in WAT and BAT, we studied the control of the PGC-1α proximal promoter in HIB1B and 3T3-L1 adipogenic cell lines. Here we report that the CRE-containing proximal region of the PGC-1α promoter is sufficient to confer adipose cell-specific cAMP inducibility. We further report for the first time C/EBPβ expression and binding to the CRE as the mechanism that is able confer a BAT gene expression pattern on 3T3-L1 white preadipocytes. Plasmids—Firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs containing 1873 bp (1873PGC1α-pGL3), 890 bp (890PGC1α-pGL3), and 264 bp (264PGC1α-pGL3) from the region upstream of the rat PGC-1α transcription start site were generated using the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). These fragments were generated by PCR using primers 1873PGC1α sense (GTACGCGTACCATTCTGCTGTCTTGAAG), 890PGC1α sense (GTACGCGTCTGGGAGCCTATGAGAGCCA), and 264PGC1α sense (GTACGCGTAGTGTTTCCTTTCTTTCTTCTAT) and antisense (GTCTCGAGCAACTCCAATCCACTCTGAC) that had MluI or XhoI restriction sites at the 5′-end and were digested with the restriction enzymes MluI and XhoI to generate appropriate protruding ends. The pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) was also digested with the same enzymes, and the inserts were then ligated into these vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis on the luciferase promoter (264PGC1α-pGL3) was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To mutate the CRE the original sequence TGACGTCA was mutated to GACTACTG. Successful mutagenesis was monitored by sequence analysis (John Innes Sequencing Centre, Norwich, UK). The pMSVC/EBPα (rat), pMSVC/EBPβ, and pMSVC/EBPδ (mouse) expression plasmids, which contain the respective cDNAs under the control of the mouse sarcoma virus (MSV) long terminal repeat, were kindly provided by S. McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). The mock plasmid pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen. The CRE positive vector (6CRE-pGL3) was a kind gift from Robert Newton (Dept. of Thoracic Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College School of Medicine, London). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—3T3-L1 cells (ECACC) and HIB1B cells (kindly provided by B. Spiegelman) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2. For differentiation, cells were cultured to confluence (day 0) and then exposed to the differentiation mixture (0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 250 nm dexamethasone, 20 nm insulin, 1 nm T3). After 48 h, cells were maintained in medium containing 20 nm insulin and 1 nm T3 until day 7 for harvest. The reporter plasmids were co-transfected using 3 μlof FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science)/μg of DNA or 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)/μg of DNA into 3T3-L1 and HIB1B cells at 80% confluence in combination with pMSVC/EBPα, pMSVC/EBPβ, pMSVC/EBPδ, or pcDNA3 as a control. The pRL-SV40 (from Promega) that carries Renilla luciferase was also co-transfected as an internal control for monitoring the transfection efficiency. At confluence (approx 24 h later), cells were treated with forskolin under serum-free conditions, and after 12 h cells were harvested and luciferase activities analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Values were expressed relative to the control Renilla to allow for differences in transfectional efficiency; there was no difference between cell type and treatments on the average Renilla values. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Supershift Assay—Preparation of nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assays was performed in the presence of protease and protein phosphatase inhibitors using the nuclear extract kit from Active Motif. 10 μg of nuclear proteins extracted from confluent HIB1B or 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with ∼106 cpm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide in a 20-μl reaction for 30 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotide spanned the PGC-1α-CRE regulatory element: 5′-TGCCTTGGAGTGACGTCAGGAGTTTGTGCA-3′ (CRE motif is in italics). Specific binding was established by co-incubating with 100-fold excess of either unlabeled oligo or oligo containing a mutated (underlined) CRE motif 5′-TGCCTTGGAGAGGACTACTGGAGTTTGTGCA-3′. Nuclear proteins were incubated with antibodies where indicated for 20 min prior to incubation with the radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Antibodies against CREB and C/EBPβ (LAP) were purchased from New England Biolabs, C/EBPα from Active Motif, and C/EBPδ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Competing unlabeled oligonucleotides were added 15 min prior to the addition of labeled probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate). Briefly, HIB-1B and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 until confluence (approx 48 h after plating). Following confluence, the cells were then stimulated with vehicle solution (Me2SO) or forskolin (10 μm) for 1 h. For the cross-linking of transcriptional factors with genomic DNAs, cells were incubated with formaldehyde (1%) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, harvested with scrapers, and lysed with SDS lysis buffer. The whole-cell lysates were sonicated with a Soniprep 150 for 30 s at the maximum setting. This was repeated eight times with 1-min intervals between each 30-s pulse, yielding chromatin fragments between 200 and 500 bp in size. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf microcentrifuge) for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. Normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and salmon sperm DNA-50% protein A-agarose slurry (80 μl) was added to the lysates, which were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific background. Agarose beads were precipitated by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. Antibodies against CREB (Upstate Biotechnology), C/EBPβ (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal rabbit IgG (control samples) were added to the 2-ml supernatant fraction, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were then mixed with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose slurry; the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation to collect the antibody-histone-DNA complex and washed sequentially with low salt buffer, high salt buffer, and lithium chloride wash buffer. After precipitates were washed with Tris-EDTA and extracted with elution buffer, reversal of cross-linking was done by heating at 65 °C overnight in the presence of NaCl. Purification of DNA was done with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and the DNA fragments obtained were analyzed by PCR using the following primer pairs for the mouse PGC-1α promoter: forward (5′-GGGCTGCCTTGGAGTGACGTC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGTCCCCAGTCACATGACAAAG-3′). Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 37 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and harvested with scrapers. The whole cell lysates were centrifuged at top speed for 15 min after 30 min of incubation on ice, and supernatants were mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. An aliquot of 40–50 μg/well was fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After 1 h of blocking in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, the membrane was incubated in fresh buffer with the appropriate antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies used were: 1:1000 dilution of anti-C/EBPα, 1:500 dilution of anti-C/EBPβ and anti-C/EBPδ, and 1:250 dilution of anti-actin (Sigma). The antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubating the membrane for 1 h at room temperature in a buffer containing a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico blotting substrate (Pierce, Perbio Science, Cramlington, UK). Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells by TRI reagent (Sigma). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions in Rotor Gene 3000 (Corbert Research). The sequences of the primers used for real-time PCR were: PGC-1α sense (GCGCCGTGTGATTTACGTT) and antisense (AAAACTTCAAAGCGGTCTCTCAA), UCP1 sense (CCTGCCTCTCTCGGAAACAA) and antisense (TGTAGGCTGCCCAATGAACA), C/EBPα sense (CCGGGAGAACTCTAACTC) and antisense (GATGTAGGCGCTGATGT), C/EBPβ sense (GCAAGAGCCGCGACAAG) and antisense (GGCTCGGGCAGCTGCTT), C/EBPδ sense (ACGACGAGAGCGCCATC) and antisense (TCGCCGTCGCCCCAGTC), aP2 sense (AACACCGAGATTTCCTT) and antisense (ACACATTCCACCACCAG), SREBP-1c sense (CTGGATTTGGCCCGGGGAGATTC) and antisense (TGGAGCAGGTGGCGATGAGGTTC), adipsin sense (CAGAGTGTCAATCATGAACCGG) and antisense (GATGTTTTCGATCCACATCCG) and β-actin sense (TCCTCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTCT) and antisense (GCTCAGTAACAGTCCGCCTAGAA). Computational Analysis of the PGC-1α Promoter Region—Mouse and rat genomic sequences were retrieved from the NCBI browser (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Pairwise comparative analyses were performed with the program BLAST 2 sequences. The TESS analysis (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) was used to predict transcription factor binding sites. All of the positions in the promoter refer to the translation start site of the rat PGC-1α gene. Differential cAMP Induction of PGC-1α and UCP1 Expression in Confluent and Differentiated HIB1B and 3T3-L1 Cells—HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by treating confluent cells with a standardized hormonal mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Differentiation status was verified by oil-red “O” staining (data not shown) and adipogenic gene expression profiling by quantitative RT-PCR (SREBP-1c, aP-2, adipsin, UCP1, PGC-1α; Fig. 1). To stimulate cAMP accumulation, forskolin (10 μm) was added to confluent cells immediately prior to (0 days) or 7 days following exposure to the differentiation mixture. Preliminary studies were performed with HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells to establish the optimal time (3 h) for incubation with forskolin. In HIB1B cells, forskolin treatment increased UCP1 expression by ∼50-fold in undifferentiated cells and by 1000-fold after 7 days of differentiation (Fig. 1B). By contrast, a lower base-line level of UCP1 expression was observed in 3T3-L1 cells, and forskolin had no effect on expression, regardless of differentiation status (Fig. 1B). Qualitatively similar differences in PGC-1α expression were also observed; higher basal expression levels in HIB1B cells, coupled with a pronounced inductive response to forskolin in both undifferentiated and differentiated states but no responses to forskolin were observed in 3T3-L1 cells at 0 and 7 days of differentiation (Fig. 1C). Responses to cAMP stimulation using 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were similar to those observed for forskolin (results not shown). These results demonstrate that cAMP induction of PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA can be observed in undifferentiated confluent HIB1B but not 3T3-L1 cells. Cell-specific Expression of PGC-1α Promoter-Reporter Constructs: The Proximal 264 bp Is Sufficient for Specificity—To analyze the transcriptional mechanisms responsible for these cell-specific differences in PGC-1α expression, different lengths (from 264 to 1873 bp upstream of the predicted transcription start site) of the rat PGC-1α promoter were cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3. These constructs were used in transient transfection experiments in HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells. Preliminary experiments established that reporter activity measurements were optimal at 24 h after adding the hormonal mixture (differentiation mix) that is used to differentiate HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells; these measurements were compared with levels in control undifferentiated Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 2). In HIB1B cells, the addition of the differentiation mix increased luciferase expression from constructs containing all three lengths of the PGC-1α promoter by 4–5-fold (Fig. 2A). By contrast, in 3T3-L1 cells the differentiation mix did not elicit any increase in expression for any of the promoter constructs (Fig. 2B). This result suggested that factors within the proximal promoter region, encompassed by the 264-bp construct, accounted for cell-specific differences in PGC-1α induction by cAMP. This short proximal fragment exhibits very high sequence conservation across species (98% in rat/mouse/human) and contains a CRE, previously highlighted by studies of PGC-1α expression in hepatic cells (14Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). We therefore performed experiments in undifferentiated cells under serum-free conditions to analyze the effects of forskolin on the expression of the 264-bp promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 3, A and B). Under these conditions, forskolin induced reporter expression in both cell lines, but as predicted from the first experiment, the effect was markedly greater in HIB1B cells than in 3T3-L1 cells. These results led us to consider the relative involvements of the core CRE and adjacent flanking regions in the cAMP-inducibility of the 264-bp construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CRE at positions −183 to −175 abolished completely the effect of forskolin on the proximal PGC-1α promoter-reporter activity in both cell types (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicate that the CRE on the proximal PGC-1α promoter is able to give widely differing response characteristics to a cAMP-mediated stimulus in the two different adipocyte cell contexts. Importantly, this result was not due to the different sensitivities to forskolin, or the PKA pathway in the two cell types, because a luciferase reporter construct driven by six CREs in tandem (21Bradbury D.A. Newton R. Zhu Y.M. El-Haroun H. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49954-49964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was induced to the same extent in 3T3-L1 and HIB1B cells (Fig. 3C). Previous studies have demonstrated that both CREB and ATF-2 can bind to the proximal CRE lying within the 264-bp region (14Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 15Cao W. Daniel K.W. Robidoux J. Puigserver P. Medvedev A.V. Bai X. Floering L.M. Spiegelman B.M. Collins S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The C/EBP family of transcription factors has also been reported to modulate the activity of CREs in gene promoters (20Brenner S. Prosch S. Schenke-Layland K. Riese U. Gausmann U. Platzer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5597-5604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore we performed gel shift experiments to identify the presence of CRE-binding proteins in nuclear extracts from HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells. Specific binding of nuclear proteins to the PGC-1α-CRE oligonucleotide was demonstrated by either the disappearance of four bands when incubations included 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A, oligo) or the lack of competition when the labeled PGC-1α-CRE oligonucleotide was incubated with 100-fold excess of a mutated CRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A, mut-oligo). Supershifts with the specific antibodies demonstrated that CREB (bands 1–4) and C/EBPβ (bands 1, 2, and 4) but not C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, were able to bind to the CRE in nuclear extracts from both HIB-1B and 3T3-L1 cells. The overlap in specific binding bands between CREB and C/EBPβ may indicate heterodimer formation between these leucine zipper transcription factors. We further demonstrated by ChIP assay that both C/EBPβ and CREB were part of a protein-DNA complex containing the CRE region of the PGC-1α proximal promoter (Fig. 4B). In HIB1B cells, forskolin increased the binding of both C/EBPβ and CREB, but this was only apparent for C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 cells. These data, along with those showing the cAMP induction of the CRE-positive control reporter in 3T3-L1 cells, suggested that the differential response in forskolin-induced PGC-1α expression between the two cell types was not related to the upstream sensitivity of the PKA pathway but rather to combinatorial transcription factor effects on the proximal CRE, which were able to confer adipocyte-specific differential expression of this promoter to cAMP. The Role of C/EBP Isoforms in Cell-specific cAMP Inducibility of PGC-1α—Evidence of the involvement of the C/EBP family of transcription factors in the modulation of the CRE in the promoter of other genes (20Brenner S. Prosch S. Schenke-Layland K. Riese U. Gausmann U. Platzer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5597-5604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), coupled with the crucial role played by C/EBPs in commitment of progenitor cells to the adipocytes lineage (16Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), led us to consider whether differential expression of C/EBP isoforms might be involved in the cell context-specific cAMP inducibility of the 264PGC1α-pGL3 luciferase reporter construct. To explore this possibility, we first used quantitative RT-PCR to compare expression patterns for three C/EBP isoforms (α, β, δ) in the two cell types during differentiation (Fig. 5A) and forskolin challenge (Fig. 5B). This showed that although there was no clear distinction between HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells in the pattern of C/EBPα expression in response to either differentiation or forskolin, both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ showed cell-specific differences. In the case of C/EBPβ, expression rose markedly during differentiation in HIB1B cells but did not change in 3T3-L1 cells. Additionally, both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were strongly induced by cAMP stimulation in confluent HIB1B compared with 3T3-L1 cells. These observations suggested that increased levels of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ protein expression in HIB1B cells might be necessary for the induction of PGC-1α and UCP1 expression in response to cAMP stimulation during the BAT differentiation program. To test the role of C/EBP transcription factors on PGC-1α gene regulation, we transfected both cell types with the 264-bp PGC-1α promoter-reporter construct and overexpressed the C/EBPα, β, and δ isomers. We first confirmed successful overexpression of the C/EBP isomers by Western blot (Fig. 6A). C/EBPβ overexpression more than doubled the activation of the 264-bp PGC-1α promoter-reporter construct. Importantly, this effect was observed in both HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ had a less marked effect on PGC-1α promoter activity than C/EBPβ (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of the three C/EBP isomers failed to influence the forskolin-induced expression of the 6CRE-pGL3 vector (Fig. 6C). These data suggested that C/EBPβ was responsible for the activation of the proximal PGC-1α promoter without affecting the sensitivity of the upstream PKA pathway. To test the hypothesis that the CRE site mediates C/EBPβ modulation of PGC-1α cAMP-inducibility, we compared the reporter activity of the wild-type −264 bp promoter construct with that of a similar construct in which the CRE was mutated. As shown previously, C/EBPβ overexpression stimulated both basal and forskolin-stimulated activity of the wild-type PGC-1α reporter construct in both HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 7). Mutation of the CRE effectively abolished any potentiating effects of C/EBPβ overexpression in either HIB-1B (Fig. 7A) or 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 7B). These data demonstrate that C/EBPβ overexpression rescues cAMP-inducible PGC-1α expression in 3T3-L1 cells through effects within the proximal CRE containing region of the PGC-1α promoter. To verify whether the observations of C/EBPβ overexpression on the PGC-1α promoter also corresponded to changes of the endogenous PGC-1α mRNA expression and cell commitment, we transiently overexpressed C/EBPβ protein in the two cell types and assessed the impact on cAMP-induced PGC-1α and UCP1 gene expression. As predicted from our earlier experiments, forskolin increased PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA expression in HIB1B cells expressing a control “empty” p-cDNA3 vector but not in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 8). Furthermore, overexpression of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ in HIB1B cells elicited no further increase in PGC-1α or UCP1 expression in response to forskolin (Fig. 8). Remarkably, overexpression of C/EBPβ caused 3T3-L1 cells to exhibit a BAT pattern of gene expression, i.e. highly forskolin-inducible PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA expression. This large response was specific to C/EBPβ, because overexpression of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ had either no effect or much less effect on the PGC-1α or UCP1 mRNA in either cell type (Fig. 8). In conclusion, we have provided evidence that C/EBPβ plays a pivotal role in the adipocyte-specific cAMP-induced expression of PGC-1α and UCP1 and is able to reprogram white preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells to a BAT pattern of gene expression. PGC-1α expression in brown fat is increased during cold exposure due to adrenergic activation of the PKA pathway (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Our initial studies demonstrated that the forskolin-induced increase in PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA in differentiated HIB1B cells was also observed in confluent HIB1B cells, suggesting that these genes become inducible early in the brown adipogenesis program. As expected, forskolin did not stimulate either PGC-1α or UCP1 mRNA in differentiated or confluent 3T3-L1 white preadipocyte cells. Here we demonstrate that the differential response in cAMP-induced PGC-1α expression between HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells is caused by interaction of C/EBPβ with the CRE on the proximal promoter of PGC-1α. In gel shift experiments we found that nuclear extracts from both HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells bound CREB and C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα or C/EBPδ, to the CRE in the PGC-1α proximal promoter. ChIP assays confirmed that in HIB1B cells, C/EBPβ and CREB bound to the CRE region of the PGC-1α promoter in a forskolin-dependent manner. In 3T3-L1 cell lysates, C/EBPβ but not CREB binding was forskolin-dependent. These experiments suggested that C/EBPβ may play an important role in mediating the differential effects of cAMP stimulation on PGC-1α expression in HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells. Evidence to support this hypothesis came from the demonstration that overexpression of C/EBPβ increased forskolin-induced transcriptional activity of the 264-bp PGC1α reporter construct in both HIB1B and 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of C/EBPβ rescued the suppression of forskolin-induced PGC-1α expression in 3T3-L1 cells assessed by both reporter assays and direct mRNA measurements. This effect was specific to C/EBPβ, because similar experiments with C/EBPα or C/EBPδ overexpression failed to elicit the same increased sensitivity to cAMP stimulation. Mutation of the CRE on the PGC1α proximal promoter abrogated adipocyte nuclear protein binding and the potentiating effects of C/EBPβ overexpression on transcriptional activity of the 264-bp PGC1α reporter construct in both the HIB1B or 3T3-L1 cells. Importantly, overexpression of C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα or C/EBPδ, in 3T3-L1 cells enabled cAMP to induce UCP1 expression by 260-fold. These data argue that the programming of preadipocytes to a BAT lineage is due to C/EBPβ interacting with CREB at the CRE on the PGC-1α proximal promoter. C/EBP-related proteins have been found to potentiate cAMP-inducible expression of the PEPCK promoter (19Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in a tissue-specific and differentiation-dependent manner. In contrast with the present study, this required CREB and C/EBPα or C/EBPβ to bind to separate sites on the promoter. Leucine zipper transcription factors also interact as homo- and heterodimers with CREs. Regulation of the interleukin-10 (20Brenner S. Prosch S. Schenke-Layland K. Riese U. Gausmann U. Platzer C. J.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by cAMP involves heterodimer formation between CREB and C/EBPβ, suggesting that the specific profile of transcription factors is capable of inducing tissue-specific patterns of gene expression (14Herzig S.

Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Cooperation between CREB and C/EBPβ has been suggested in rat C6 glioma cells transfected with tandem CRE sites in a pCRE-Luc reporter construct (25Chen Y. Zhuang S. Cassenaer S. Casteel D.E. Gudi T. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4066-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but we were unable to observe this in our adipogenic cell lines. An alternative mechanism, consistent with our results, is that C/EBPβ binds to CREB inducing a conformational change that recruits additional CBP/p300 into the preinitiation complex. C/EBPβ-CREB binding at a site independent of the CREB leucine zipper and CBP binding domains has been demonstrated (25Chen Y. Zhuang S. Cassenaer S. Casteel D.E. Gudi T. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4066-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ interaction with other proteins as well as subcellular localization, DNA binding, and transactivation potential are regulated by phosphorylation and require further investigation. There is physiological evidence to support a role for C/EBPβ in BAT differentiation. Like PGC-1α, C/EBPβ expression in BAT is cold-inducible; during cold exposure, adrenergic stimulation and early development in rodents, C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα or -δ, is increased in BAT but not WAT, in parallel with increases in UCP1 and PGC-1α mRNA (26Rehnmark S. Antonson P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Jacobsson A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Rim J.S. Xue B. Gawronska-Kozak B. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25916-25926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that PGC-1α, C/EBPβ, and UCP1 mRNA increase in BAT but not WAT of cold-stressed mice (results not shown). Furthermore, in the present study we observed that C/EBPβ expression was increased in HIB1B but not 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lines when challenged with forskolin to increase cAMP. C/EBPβ–/– mice have decreased brown adipose tissue and are cold-intolerant, but this is not because of a decrease in BAT UCP1 expression (28Carmona M.C. Hondares E. Rodriguez de la Concepcion M.L. Rodriguez-Sureda V. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Poli V. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, this is likely to be because of a compensatory increase in C/EBPδ expression (28Carmona M.C. Hondares E. Rodriguez de la Concepcion M.L. Rodriguez-Sureda V. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Poli V. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), because double knockout of C/EBPβ and -δ prevents BAT accumulation (10Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the present study, overexpression of C/EBPδ in 3T3-L1 cells increased forskolin-induced PGC-1α and UCP1 expression although to a much lesser extent than with C/EBPβ overexpression (Fig. 8). Genetic ablation studies have demonstrated that C/EBPβ and -δ, but not C/EBPα, play critical roles in brown fat differentiation (10Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) but it is not clear whether C/EBPs play a direct role in the expression of UCP1. An outstanding puzzle is how C/EBPβ can be responsible for transduction to a BAT phenotype when it has been demonstrated that a transient increase in C/EBPβ initiates the adipogenic differentiation program in 3T3-L1 white adipose precursor cells. We speculate that this may be explained by the temporal dynamics of C/EBPβ expression with sustained C/EBPβ exposure resulting in the brown phenotype. Transgenic mice expressing C/EBPβ under the control of the C/EBPα promoter have 60% more brown adipose tissue and reduced white fat cell size than their wild-type littermates (29Chen S.S. Chen J.F. Johnson P.F. Muppala V. Lee Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7292-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). During white adipocyte differentiation, C/EBPα is continously expressed after initiation by C/EBPβ, providing evidence that sustained C/EBPβ expression may be critical in committing cells to the brown phenotype (16Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that C/EBPβ plays a key role in regulating the expression of PGC-1α and UCP1 during early differentiation in adipocyte cell lines and in combination with adrenergic stimulation is able to reprogram white preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells to a brown adipocyte lineage. These data provide new insights into the developmental mechanisms controlling cell differentiation and adipose tissue composition."

In mouse sperm, this process is associated with increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, membrane potential hyperpolarization, increase in intracellular pH and Ca2+, and hyperactivated motility. The molecular mechanisms involved in these changes are not fully known. Present evidence suggests that in mouse sperm the capacitation-associated membrane hyperpolarization is regulated by a cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent pathway involving activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels and inhibition of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl- channel that controls the activity of several transport proteins, including ENaCs. Here we explored whether CFTR is involved in the regulation of ENaC inhibition in sperm and therefore is essential for the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization. Using reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry, we document the presence of CFTR in mouse and human sperm. Interestingly, the addition of a CFTR inhibitor (diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; 250 μm) inhibited the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization, prevented ENaC closure, and decreased the zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction without affecting the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Incubation of sperm in Cl--free medium also eliminated the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization. On the other hand, a CFTR activator (genistein; 5-10 μm) promoted hyperpolarization in mouse sperm incubated under conditions that do not support capacitation. The addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to noncapacitated mouse sperm elevated intracellular Cl-. These results suggest that cAMP-dependent Cl- fluxes through CFTR are involved in the regulation of ENaC during capacitation and thus contribute to the observed hyperpolarization associated with this process.

Sperm capacitation is a complex phenomenon required for fertilization. In mouse sperm, capacitation includes reorganization of the plasma membrane, increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane potential (Em), 2The abbreviations used are: Em, plasma membrane potential; AR, acrosome reaction; ZP, zona pellucida; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; PKA, protein kinase A; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine; MQAE, N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide; DiSC3(5), 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide; SITS, 4-acetomido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; WH, Whitten’s HEPES-buffered. and increases in intracellular pH (pHi) and Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) (reviewed in Refs. 1Darszon A.

Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Capacitation is also associated with the appearance of hyperactivated motility (3Yanagimachi R. Knobile E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 1. 1994: 189-317Google Scholar). All of these changes prime sperm to effectively reach and penetrate the outer layers of the egg and to undergo the acrosome reaction (AR) (4Florman H.M. Arnoult C. Kazam I.G. Li C. O'Toole C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Among the changes observed during mouse sperm capacitation, the hyperpolarization that takes place during this process has been proposed to play the important role of removing inactivation from voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels such that they open upon a zona pellucida (ZP)-induced depolarization and trigger the AR. Little is known about the molecular entities that participate in this hyperpolarization and how all of the capacitation-associated changes are combined to promote capacitation. Several candidates have been proposed to participate in the capacitation-induced hyperpolarization. Studies from our group have demonstrated that inwardly rectifying K+ channels contribute to this hyperpolarization (5Munoz-Garay C. De la Vega-Beltran J.L. Delgado R. Labarca P. Felix R. Darszon A.

In addition, we documented that an electrogenic Na+/HCO3− cotransporter hyperpolarizes mouse sperm when external HCO3− is elevated (7Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J.

Furthermore, we recently reported the presence of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) in mouse sperm and showed that a reduction in the sperm Na+ permeability is essential for the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization (8Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O.

This later work strongly suggests that mouse sperm (ENaCs) are constitutively active in noncapacitated sperm and close during capacitation, resulting in Em hyperpolarization. Interestingly, experiments in this work suggest that closing of ENaCs is regulated directly or indirectly by a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway (8Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Sosnik J.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In other tissues that are absorptive or secretory, depending on the physiological need, activation of CFTR reciprocally inhibits ENaCs (13Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Cystic fibrosis, the most prevalent human genetic disease, is caused by CFTR mutations (14Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Additionally, the involvement of CFTR in male and female infertility has long been recognized (15Jarzabek K. Zbucka M. Pepinski W. Szamatowicz J. Domitrz J. Janica J. Wolczynski S. Szamatowicz M. Reprod. Biol. 2004; 4: 119-129PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile due to a congenital bilateral absence of the vas deference. Recently, Chan et al. (16Chan H.C. Shi Q.X. Zhou C.X. Wang X.F. Xu W.M. Chen W.Y. Chen A.J. Ni Y. Yuan Y.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 250: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) proposed that HCO3− permeation through CFTR (17Poulsen J.H. Fischer H. Illek B. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5340-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) present in endometrial cells plays a role during in vivo sperm capacitation and may account for some cases of female cystic fibrosis infertility. This finding is consistent with the requirement of HCO3− for capacitation. Several modes of regulation of CFTR have been explored, including phosphorylation, Cl- and ATP levels, Em, and direct protein-protein interaction (12Nagel G. Szellas T. Riordan J.R. Friedrich T. Hartung K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R.

Interestingly, CFTR and ENaC colocalize and may interact in several tissues (14Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In this work, we document the presence of CFTR in both mouse and human sperm and demonstrate that diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC), an inhibitor of CFTR, blocks the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization. Moreover, genistein, an activator of CFTR channels, hyperpolarized sperm under conditions that do not support capacitation. These genistein-induced changes in Em were inhibited by DPC. Since CFTR is a Cl- channel, we used the Cl- fluorescent probe N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide (MQAE) to determine the intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) of noncapacitated mouse sperm and explored the influence of CFTR regulators on this parameter. The addition of genistein, as well as cAMP analogues, promoted Cl- influx in noncapacitated sperm that was blocked by DPC. Considering that closing of ENaCs in sperm is regulated by a cAMP pathway, we hypothesized that CFTR regulation of the sperm Em might be mediated by ENaCs. Consistent with this hypothesis, genistein diminished the amiloride-induced hyperpolarization and the amiloride-sensitive Na+ permeability in noncapacitated sperm that we had reported earlier (8Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol.

Materials—Amiloride, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, valinomycin, nigericin, sodium gluconate, and potassium gluconate were purchased from Sigma. MQAE, 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)), 4-acetomido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS) were obtained from Invitrogen. Polyclonal antibody against CFTR was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-goat IgG biotin-conjugated and Avidin TRITC-conjugated were from Pierce. DPC was from Sigma. DPC (10 mm stock), genistein, DiSC3(5), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and valinomycin (1 mm stocks) were prepared in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C until use. Bt2cAMP (1 mm), H-89, and IBMX (100 μm) were prepared on the day of the experiment using a modified Krebs-Ringer medium (Whitten’s HEPES-buffered (WH) medium) (20Moore G.D. Ayabe T. Visconti P.E. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Development. 1994; 120: 3313-3323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used at the indicated concentration. Sperm Preparation—Experimental protocols were approved by the local Animal Care and Bioethics Committee of the Instituto de Biotecnologiía-Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. In most experiments, cauda epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 retired male breeders by placing minced cauda epididymis in WH medium. This medium does not support capacitation unless supplemented with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 24 mm NaHCO3. After 10 min, the sperm suspension was washed in 10 ml of the same medium by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Sperm were then resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml and diluted 10 times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment. To study the role of Cl- in capacitation and in the regulation of Em, NaCl and KCl were replaced by sodium gluconate and potassium gluconate, respectively. Human Sperm Preparation—Semen was obtained from normal, fertile volunteers by masturbation after at least 2 days of abstinence. After liquefaction, 1 ml of Ham’s F-10 was applied to 1 ml of semen to allow the motile sperm to swim up into the upper layer of the suspension (1 h at 37 °C). Swim-up sperm were collected and adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Samples were used for Western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence analysis as described for mouse sperm. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR Experiments—Total RNA was prepared from isolated mouse elongated spermatids (21Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) or ejaculated human sperm, using TRIzol Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA samples with random hexamer-primed reverse transcription (Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen). cDNA was then subjected to PCR amplification using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The CFTR subunit primers were designed using the human and mouse reported nucleotide sequence for these genes (human CFTR NM_020038 and mouse CFTR NM_021050, respectively). Primer sequences for human CFTR are as follows: forward, 5′-ATG ATT ATG GGA GAA CTG G-3; reverse, 5′-ATG AGA AAC GGT GTA AGG T-3′. Primer sequences for mouse CFTR are as follows: forward, 5′-GGA GCA AAC CCA AAC A-3′; reverse, 5′-AGC AGC CAC CTC AAC C-3′. The absence of genomic contamination in the RNA samples was confirmed with reverse transcription-negative controls (no reverse transcription) for each experiment. Amplified products were analyzed by DNA sequencing in order to confirm their identity. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Human and mouse sperm extracts were obtained by the method described by Ref. 22Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Lecona-Valera A.N. Escobar-Herrera J. Mujica A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. Sperm were resuspended in sample buffer containing protease inhibitors without 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. Sperm samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). The samples were boiled for an additional 5 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Electrotransfer of proteins to Immobilon P (Bio-Rad) and immunodetection of CFTR was carried out as previously described (24Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were incubated with anti-CFTR and developed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and the chemoluminescent ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Sperm suspensions were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature, washed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, permeabilized in PBS-Triton X-100 (0.05% final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Specific primary antibodies were added to sperm samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) for 1h at 37 °C. The secondary antibody was then subjected to three consecutive washes with PBS and developed by incubation with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate diluted in HEPES-saline buffer (20 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.2) for 1h at 37 °C. Finally, the samples were washed and mounted in PBS-glycerol (SlowFade, Molecular Probes) and examined using a confocal microscope. Membrane Potential Assay in Sperm Populations—Em was measured as previously described (7Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7001-7009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm were collected as indicated above, diluted in the appropriate medium and capacitated for different time periods depending on the experiment. Eight min before the measurement, 1 μm DiSC3(5) (final concentration) was added to the sperm suspension and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. One μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (final concentration) was then added to collapse mitochondrial potential, and sperm were incubated for an additional 2 min. After this period, 1.5 ml of the suspension was transferred to a gently stirred cuvette at 37 °C, and the fluorescence (620/670 nm excitation/emission) was recorded continuously. Calibration was performed as described before by adding 1 μm valinomycin and sequential additions of KCl. Na+-induced Depolarization and Amiloride-induced Hyperpolarization—After reaching steady state fluorescence, 50 mm NaCl was added while fluorescence was recorded in the presence or absence of different compounds as indicated in each figure. After a new fluorescent steady state was reached, calibration was performed as indicated above. Em changes elicited by NaCl were quantified, taking into consideration the calibration curve and the initial steady state fluorescence before NaCl addition. Controls to determine if amiloride or its solvent (Me2SO) altered the fluorescence of DiSC3(5) were performed with dye only and did not show significant changes in fluorescence (data not shown). Intracellular Cl- Measurements in Sperm Populations—[Cl-]i was measured in sperm populations using a Cl--sensitive fluorescent dye (MQAE) (25Verkman A.S. Sellers M.C. Chao A.C. Leung T. Ketcham R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Sperm were incubated with 10 mm MQAE for 30 min at 37 °C. Excess MQAE was removed by diluting sperm 10-fold with WH-Cl--free medium (100 mm sodium gluconate, 4.4 mm potassium gluconate, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm glucose, 0.8 mm pyruvic acid, 4.8 mm lactic acid, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and centrifuging for 3 min at 300 × g. The sperm pellet was resuspended in aliquots of 2 × 106 sperm/ml with medium under the following conditions. 1) To obtain the maximum fluorescence (Fmax), WH-Cl--free medium with nigericin (10 μm) and tributyltin (10 μm) was used. 2) To determine the fluorescence at defined Cl- concentrations (FCl-), two media were mixed (WH containing different NaCl concentrations (10-100 mm) and WH-Cl--free media keeping Cl- + gluconate- = 100 mm); nigericin (10 μm) and tributyltin (10 μm) were also added. 3) For minimum fluorescence (Fmin), 150 mm KSCN buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 5 μm valinomycin was used. Samples were illuminated at 350 nm, and emission was collected at 450 nm. The relationship between Cl- concentration and MQAE fluorescence intensity expressed as the ratio F0/FCl- provides a straight line with a slope equal to Kq, the Stern-Volmer constant, where the total quenchable signal F0 is defined by Fmax - Fmin. [Cl-]i was estimated using the constructed plot (25Verkman A.S. Sellers M.C. Chao A.C. Leung T. Ketcham R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Inglefield J.R. Schwartz-Bloom R.D. Methods. 1999; 18: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Jayaraman S. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 (-C757): C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sperm [Cl-]i was also evaluated according to Garcia and Meizel (28Garcia M.A. Meizel S. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 88-93PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse sperm were incubated for 30 min in WH medium containing different Cl- concentrations (0-100 mm) and 10 mm MQAE. Excess MQAE was removed as mentioned above, and emission fluorescence intensity data from sperm suspensions (2 × 106 sperm/ml) were recorded for 120 s. The intracellular and extracellular [Cl-] were equilibrated by permeabilizing the sperm membrane with digitonin (10 μm), and the fluorescence was recorded for another 120 s. The [Cl-]i was calculated as described by Garcia and Meizel (28Garcia M.A. Meizel S. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 88-93PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that the values of the [Cl-]i are to be taken cautiously, since they are obtained from a heterogeneous sperm population. Cl- determinations require a calibration, which assumes that the dye behaves in sperm as in other cells (24Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Verkman A.S. Sellers M.C. Chao A.C. Leung T. Ketcham R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Inglefield J.R. Schwartz-Bloom R.D. Methods. 1999; 18: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and does not correct for residual external dye, and some differences in experimental conditions. It is only possible to wash mouse sperm once by centrifugation, since they loose viability if centrifuged further. The influence of different drugs (i.e. genistein, cAMP/IBMX, DPC, H-89, and SITS) on [Cl-]i was determined using sperm suspensions loaded with MQAE as described above, after recording the basal fluorescence for 1-3 min, and measuring for a further 5-10 min. Two controls were performed: 1) drug solvents (Me2SO or water) were added while the fluorescence was recorded, and 2) MQAE fluorescence without cells was recorded, and the drugs were added. No significant fluorescence changes were observed after performing both controls (data not shown). [Cl-]i changes were estimated as described above. Acrosome Reaction Assay—Caudal epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 mice and placed in capped 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing medium 199 (Sigma) supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.4%, w/v), Na+ pyruvate (30 mg/liter), and NaHCO3 (2.2 g/liter) at 37 °C (4-5 × 106 cells/ml). The swim-up method (29Henkel R.R. Schill W.B. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 108Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was used to separate sperm with >90% motility. The sperm suspension was incubated 10 min, and the top ∼1 ml was separated and capacitated for 30 min at 37 °C (30Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3235-3242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). AR was induced after capacitation (in the presence or absence of DPC) in a 30-μl aliquot by adding 5 ZP eq/μl or 15 μm A23187. ZP was obtained from mouse oocytes (31Cross N.L. Meizel S. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 41: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The percentage of AR was determined in a 30-μl aliquot by adding an equal volume of 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Following fixation, 10-μl aliquots of the sperm suspension were spread onto glass slides and air-dried. The slides were stained with 0.22% Coomassie Blue G-250 in 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for ∼5 min, rinsed, and mounted with 50% (v/v) glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline (5Munoz-Garay C. De la Vega-Beltran J.L. Delgado R. Labarca P. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At least 100 sperm were assayed per experimental condition to calculate the percentage of AR. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The means were compared using an unpaired Student’s t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. CFTR Is Present in Mammalian Sperm—CFTR modulates several cellular processes, interacting with various channels and ionic transporters, particularly with ENaCs (14Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 32Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (-S45): S23Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). We reported the presence of αENaC and δENaC subunits in mouse sperm (8Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5623-5633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and have now found the αENaC subunit in human sperm (data not shown). We examined if CFTR is present in mouse and human sperm. First, the presence of CFTR transcripts was analyzed using reverse transcription-PCR; cDNA was synthesized from total RNA extracted from human sperm ejaculates and purified mouse spermatogenic cells (33Trevino C.L. Felix R. Castellano L.E. Gutierrez C. Rodriguez D. Pacheco J. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Gomora J.C. Tsutsumi V. Hernandez-Cruz A. Fiordelisio T. Scaling A.L. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Specific primers for CFTR were designed using the reported human and mouse nucleotide sequences for these genes. CFTR fragments of the expected length were detected from human sperm (476 bp) and mouse spermatogenic cells (581 bp) cDNA (Fig. 1A), and their identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Because expression of CFTR transcripts in mouse spermatids and in human sperm does not imply the presence of the CFTR protein in mature sperm, Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments were conducted using an anti-CFTR polyclonal antibody. This antibody detected a protein band at the expected molecular weight in both human and mouse sperm, as well as in whole extracts from mouse lung that were included as a positive control (Fig. 1B). In all of these cases, preincubation with the CFTR antigenic peptide eliminated the Western blot signal (Fig. 1B). Using the same antibody, CFTR was immunolocalized to the midpiece of human (Fig. 1C) and mouse sperm (Fig. 1E). It is worth noting that αENaC localized to the same sperm region (8Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5623-5633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Previous incubation of the antibody with the respective antigenic peptide blocked the immunofluorescence signal (Fig. 1, D and F). CFTR Is Involved in the Capacitation-associated Hyperpolarization—Since CFTR is a Cl- channel, it may contribute to the mouse sperm resting Em and to the changes it undergoes during capacitation. Interestingly, 250 μm DPC, which inhibits CFTR, was able to block the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization without affecting the Em of sperm incubated under conditions that do not support capacitation (Fig. 2). On the other hand, noncapacitated sperm incubated 10 min with 10 μm genistein, a compound that activates CFTR, undergo a hyperpolarization that was greater than that which accompanies capacitation. Notably, the genistein-induced hyperpolarization was blocked by DPC. These results indicate that CFTR activation influences the sperm Em (Fig. 2, A and B). CFTR Participates in Capacitation—Taking into consideration that DPC blocked the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization, we explored whether CFTR inhibition was also able to block the capacitation process. Two experimental protocols were used. 1) Mouse sperm were capacitated in the presence or absence of 250 μm DPC, and then the AR was induced adding ZP. 2) Sperm were capacitated in the absence of DPC and then incubated for 5 min with DPC, just prior to the induction o"
https://openalex.org/W1976987160,"Tbox18 (Tbx18) and Tbox15 (Tbx15) encode a closely related pair of vertebrate-specific T-box (Tbx) transcription factors. Functional analyses in the mouse have proven the requirement of Tbx15 in skin and skeletal development and of Tbx18 in the formation of the vertebral column, the ureter, and the posterior pole of the heart. Despite the accumulation of genetic data concerning the embryological roles of these genes, it is currently unclear how Tbx18 and Tbx15 exert their function on the molecular level. Here, we have initiated a molecular analysis of Tbx18 and Tbx15 proteins and have characterized functional domains for nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional modulation. We show that both proteins homo- and heterodimerize, bind to various combinations of T half-sites, and repress transcription in a Groucho-dependent manner. Competition with activating T-box proteins may constitute one mode of action as we show that Tbx18 interacts with Gata4 and Nkx2-5 and competes Tbx5-mediated activation of the cardiac Natriuretic peptide precursor type a-promoter and that ectopic expression of Tbx18 down-regulates Tbx6-activated Delta-like 1 expression in the somitic mesoderm in vivo.

T-box (Tbx) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate a variety of developmental processes. The unifying and designating feature of all family members is a highly conserved region of 180 amino acid residues that confers DNA binding. To date, a limited number of direct target genes are known that all contain one or several T half-sites in their upstream promoter sequences. These elements are based on the consensus sequence 5′-AGGTGTGA-3′ that was initially identified in vitro as a DNA binding site for Brachyury (T), the founder of this gene family (1Kispert A. Hermann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Brachyury proteins preferentially bind as dimers to a palindromic repeat of two anti-parallel T half-sites. Orientation and spacing of T half-sites are likely to affect DNA binding of specific T-box proteins (1Kispert A. Hermann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 2Conlon F.L. Fairclough L. Price B.M. Casey E.S. Smith J.C.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 258: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Target gene specificity is additionally controlled by protein interaction partners. T-box proteins have been shown to bind to several classes of transcription factors including homeodomain and zinc finger proteins conferring synergism in binding to adjacent DNA binding elements (4Hiroi Y.

Mammalian genomes are known to harbor 17 family members that have been divided into five major subfamilies based on sequence conservation of the T-box. Loss-of-function studies in the mouse have revealed functional requirements of T-box genes in a diverse array of developmental processes in the post-implantation embryo including formation and patterning of the mesoderm and organogenesis (11Naiche L.A. Harrelson Z. Kelly R.G. Papaioannou V.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 219-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Notably, mutations in a number of T-box genes have been identified as underlying causes for human congenital disorders (12Packham E.A. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R37-R44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Tbx18 and Tbx15 encode a closely related pair of T-box proteins that, together with Tbx22, form a subgroup of the Tbx1 subfamily in vertebrates. Mice carrying a null allele of Tbx18 die shortly after birth due to severe malformations of the axial skeleton, a phenotype that was traced back to the function of Tbx18 in maintaining anterior-posterior somite polarity (13Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, Tbx18 regulates the condensation of mesenchymal cells around the distal ureter stalk. Newborn Tbx18-/- mice display a prominent hydroureter and hydronephrosis phenotype due to the lack of the smooth muscle layer of the ureter (14Airik R. Bussen M. Singh M.K. Petry M. Kispert A. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Finally, Tbx18 is essential for the formation of the sinus horns from the mesenchyme of the pericardial wall and for their myocardial differentiation (15Christoffels V.M. Mommersteeg M.T. Trowe M.O. Prall O.W. de Gier-de Vries C. Soufan A.T. Bussen M. Schuster-Gossler K. Harvey R.P. Moorman A.F. Kispert A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).Mice homozygous for a targeted null allele of Tbx15 or for the spontaneous mutation droopy ear, in which Tbx15 is deleted, exhibit defects in skin pigmentation and in the skeleton. These phenotypic changes reveal a role for Tbx15 in dorso-ventral patterning of the mouse coat and in mesenchymal aggregation that precedes endochondral bone formation (16Singh M.K. Petry M. Haenig B. Lescher B. Leitges M. Kispert A. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Candille S.I. Van Raamsdonk C.D. Chen C. Kuijper S. Chen-Tsai Y. Russ A.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 30-42Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Loss-of-function analyses of Tbx15 and Tbx18 in mice and conservation of expression in other vertebrates has revealed the importance of this closely related pair of T-box transcription factors in an impressive number of patterning and differentiation processes during vertebrate development. In contrast, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes is scarce since neither protein interaction partners nor transcriptional targets for either factor have been identified. As a step toward this goal we initiated a molecular analysis of Tbx18 and Tbx15 proteins. We here characterize the subcellular localization, DNA binding specificities, protein interactions, and transcriptional properties and their structural prerequisites in the two proteins. We provide evidence that competition with activating T-box proteins constitutes a possible mode of regulation of the promoters for Nppa (natriuretic peptide precursor type a) and Dll1 (Delta-like 1) in vitro and in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Constructs—cDNA fragments encoding full-length Tbx18 and Tbx15 and subregions thereof (see Fig. 1A) were PCR-amplified from mouse cDNA AF306666 and NM_009323, respectively.

Stifani). For in vitro expression of proteins, cDNA fragments were cloned with C-terminal myc or HA tags in the vector pSP64 (Promega) that was modified to contain a 5′-β-globin leader and a 3′-β-globin trailer (1Kispert A. Hermann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer-driven expression in cells, the globin leader/cDNA/globin trailer cassette was shuttled into HindIII and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The Tbx18-VP16 fusion construct was generated by introduction of the Herpes simplex VP16 activator fragment (aa 419-490, kind gift of D. Kessler) in front of the stop codon of Tbx18. GAL4 fusions of Tbx18 and Tbx15 were generated by subcloning the coding sequences into the yeast-two hybrid vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) 3′ of the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (aa 1-147) followed by the SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS). cDNA fragments encoding GAL4 fusion proteins were released with HindIII (5′) and SalI (3′) and directionally cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. Expression plasmids encoding Gata4.HA, Nkx2-5.FLAG, Tbx5.HA, and Tbx2 cloned into pcDNA3 were a kind gift from V. Christoffels, and expression plasmids pcDNA3.Tbx6, pcDNA3.Tbx6-VP16, pCS2+.Tcf1e, and pCS2+.β-cateninS33A were provided by B. Herrmann and have been described previously (18Habets P.E. Moorman A.F.

Bacterial expression constructs were generated as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions in pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). All plasmids were sequenced, and expression was tested on Western blot. Details on cloning strategies and primer sequences are available upon request.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (20Ke S.H. Madison E.L.

The binding site selection was essentially carried out as described (1Kispert A. Hermann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). After four rounds, the gel-eluted PCR products were subcloned in pBluescript and sequenced. Oligonucleotides used in EMSA were: BS.pF, 5′-GATCCGGTTTCACACCTAGGTGTGAAAGGA-3′; BS.pR, 5′-GATCTCCTTTCACACCTAGGTGTGAAACCG-3′; BS.invF, 5′-GATCCGGAGGTGTGAAATTTCACACCTGGA-3′; BS.invR, 5′-GATCTCCAGGTGTGAAATTTCACACCTCCG-3′; BS.dirF, 5′-GATCCGGAGGTGTGAAGGTGTGAAAGGA-3′; and BS.dirR, 5′-GATCTCCTTTCACACCTTCACACCTCCG-3′. Oligonucleotides were boiled for 5 min and cooled slowly down to room temperature to anneal. Double-stranded fragments were end-labeled with T4-PNK (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions for gel shift assays contained 2-5 μl of in vitro translated myc-tagged protein in a total volume of 20 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC). Reactions were preincubated for 20 min on ice before 10,000 counts of probe were added. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of anti-myc antibody (9E10, Sigma) was added to the lysate. Complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 20 min, before the reactions were loaded on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA). Gels were run at 10 V/cm at 4 °C for 5 h before they were dried and exposed to autoradiography film.Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Reporter Assays—HEK293 and HeLa cells were seeded at 20-30% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, grown overnight, and transfected using the calcium phosphate method. For reporter assays, HeLa cells were seeded in six-well dishes and transfected with constant amounts of reporter plasmids and 25 ng of pCMVβ (Clontech) for normalization. The total amount of expression plasmid was kept constant by adding empty pcDNA3. Per transfection, 250 ng of 5xGAL4UAS-tk-luciferase reporter plasmid (a kind gift of J. Milbrandt), 75 ng of pGL3.Nppa-luciferase, containing a 0.7-kb fragment of the mouse Nppa promoter (a kind gift of V. Christoffels), or 75 ng of pKS.msd-luciferase (kindly provided by B. Herrmann) was used (18Habets P.E. Moorman A.F. Clout D.E. van Roon M.A. Lingbeek M. van Lohuizen M. Campione M. Christoffels V.M.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2712-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. All transfections were performed in duplicates, and experiments were repeated at least three times. After normalization, the mean luciferase activities and standard deviations were plotted as “fold activation” when compared with the empty expression plasmid. p values were determined with the Student's t test.Immunofluorescence—Experiments in HEK293 cells were performed according to standard protocols. Primary antibodies used were rat anti-HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science) and mouse anti-myc (9E10, Sigma), both at 1:200 dilutions, and secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rat IgG(H + L) fluorescein isothiocyanate and donkey anti-mouse IgG(H + L) rhodamine (both Dianova), at 1:200 dilutions. Immunofluorescent detection of proteins was repeated at least three times, and representative examples were photographed on a Leica DM5000 microscope with DFC300FX camera (Leica).GST Pulldown and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—GST and GST-Tbx18 fusion proteins were produced in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4T beads (Amersham Biosciences). HA- or myc-tagged prey proteins were produced in HEK293 cells that were lysed in pulldown buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 5mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The binding reaction was performed as described (21Wissmuller S. Kosian T. Wolf M. Finzsch M. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, HEK293 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and either transfected with myc-tagged expression construct alone or transfected together with a HA-tagged bait construct. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, cellular debris was precipitated by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was precleared from nonspecific binding by incubation with 25 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). 5 μl of anti-HA antibody and 25 μl of protein A-agarose were added to the supernatant for 2 h at 4 °C, before the beads were washed three times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Proteins eluted from the beads were analyzed by Western blot with anti-myc and anti-HA antibodies, and 5% of the input was loaded as a control.Quantification of Endogenous Nppa Expression—The mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor cell line HL-1 was cultured as described (22Claycomb W.C. Lanson N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). For transfections, 1.3 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes. Transfections were performed on the following day using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science, 20 μl of each) according to the supplier's instructions. Each transfection was performed using 250 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen), 3 μg of expression plasmid, and 3 μg of pMACS4.1 (Miltenyi Biotech), which encodes a truncated CD4 cell surface marker. After 48 h, magnetic cell sorting of CD4+ cells was carried out using anti-CD4 magnetic beads and MS columns (Miltenyi Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. In a control experiment, the transfection of pd1EGFP-N1 (Clontech) resulted in an approximate efficiency of 5% GFP+ cells before and 50% GFP+ cells after magnetic cell separation. From the eluted cells, total RNA was isolated with PeqGOLD (Peqlab), and cDNA was synthesized using 0.75 μg of RNA and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7000 cycler and SYBR Green was performed in triplicates with primers specific for Nppa and HPRT as endogenous control. Primer sequences are available upon request. Mean relative gene expression levels and standard deviations were calculated from two independent transfections with the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method following the ABI Prism user manual. Additionally, p values were determined from ΔCT values using the Student's t test.In Situ Hybridization Analysis—Embryos for expression analysis were derived from matings of mice heterozygous for a mutant allele of Uncx4.1 (23Leitges M. Neidhardt L. Haenig B. Herrmann B.G. Kispert A. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA prepared from yolk sac or tail biopsies was used for genotyping by PCR. For timed pregnancies, vaginal plugs were checked in the morning after mating; noon was taken as embryonic day 0.5. Fetuses were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed following a standard procedure with digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes (24Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Stained specimens were transferred into 80% glycerol prior to documentation on a Leica M420 microscope with a Fujix digital camera HC-300Z. All images were processed in Adobe PhotoShop 7.0.RESULTSTbx18 and Tbx15 Harbor a Classical Nuclear Localization Signal—To analyze the subcellular localization of Tbx18, we transfected a series of Tbx18 expression constructs (Fig. 1A)in HEK293 cells and detected the myc tag by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B). Full-length Tbx18 protein showed exclusive nuclear localization in HEK293 (Fig. 1B) and in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Deletion of the C-terminal region did not alter this distribution, whereas removal of the N-terminal region resulted in relocalization to the cytoplasm. The N-terminal region alone was found in the nucleus, demonstrating that it is not only necessary but also sufficient for nuclear import. Similar results were obtained for Tbx15. However, a truncation mutant of Tbx15 lacking the N-terminal region retained partial nuclear localization (Fig. 1B, white arrowhead). Inspection of the primary structure of Tbx18 and Tbx15 revealed a cluster of 5 basic amino acid residues resembling a classical NLS at a conserved position at the N terminus of the two proteins (Fig. 1C, marked in red). Deletion of this cluster resulted in exclusive (Tbx18) and predominant (Tbx15) cytoplasmic localization of the full-length proteins (Fig. 1B). Our results demonstrate that a classical NLS mediates constitutive nuclear localization of Tbx18. Tbx15 might possess additional sequences mediating nuclear localization as it has been previously seen in other DNA-binding proteins including T-box transcription factors (25Kispert A. Koschorz B. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4763-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Tbx18 and Tbx15 Bind to Repeats of T Half-sites—To date, transcriptional targets of Tbx18 and Tbx15 have not been described. As a first step toward the identification and validation of potential target genes, we determined the DNA binding specificities of the two proteins using a PCR-based in vitro cyclic binding site selection protocol (1Kispert A. Hermann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). DNA fragments recovered after four rounds of the selection protocol were isolated by molecular cloning and sequenced (Fig. 2). In each pool, some oligonucleotides were represented several times, indicating that the complexity of the selected pool had decreased at this stage in favor of strong binding sites. All oligonucleotides represented repeats of the core sequence 5′-AGGTGTGA-3′ (Fig. 2, upper panel) that is known as a common T half-site. A consensus target sequence for Tbx18 was identified through the compilation of 19 sequences. It constitutes an imperfect palindrome, composed of two anti-parallel T half-sites. The orientation of these half-sites is inversed with respect to the reported binding site of Brachyury (BS.p (see Ref. 1Kispert A. Hermann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)) and was therefore designated BS.inv. For Tbx15, nine of fifteen selected oligonucleotide sequences matched the BS.inv consensus sequence (Fig. 2, middle panel). A smaller fraction (6 of 15 sequences) featured a direct repeat of the T half-site, indicating differences in binding specificity between the two proteins (Fig. 2, lower panel). The consensus of this directly repeated binding site was named BS.dir.FIGURE 2DNA binding sites of Tbx18 and Tbx15 contain variably arranged T half-sites. Sequences of DNA fragments isolated after four rounds of PCR-assisted in vitro binding site selection are shown. In total, 20 bound fragments were analyzed for Tbx18 (upper panel), and 15 were analyzed for Tbx15 (lower panel), respectively; some fragments were isolated several times. Sequences were aligned at the invariant core 5′-AGGTG-3′ and grouped according to the orientation of the half-sites. Consensus sequences were derived for nucleotide positions that were found in >70% of the cases. All except one site selected by Tbx18 exhibit a palindromic orientation, whereas Tbx15 selected both direct repeats and palindromes. The arrows indicate the orientation of the half-sites. Conserved positions are marked in gray color, and linker sequences are shown in lowercase letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next compared the DNA binding properties of Tbx18, Tbx15, and the distant family member Brachyury by EMSA. All three proteins failed to bind to DNA fragments harboring single T half-sites under our experimental conditions (data not shown). In contrast, DNA fragments with repeats of T half-sites supported protein-DNA binding of full-length, in vitro translated Tbx18, Tbx15, and Brachyury (Fig. 3). All three proteins formed specific complexes with the consensus sites BS.inv, BS.dir, and the palindromic binding site identified for Brachyury, BS.p (Fig. 3A). Brachyury was found to bind strongly to BS.p and BS.inv but weakly to BS.dir. In the case of Tbx18 and Tbx15, BS.inv and BS.dir sites supported stronger binding than the BS.p site (Fig. 3C, open arrowheads). The addition of specific antibody resulted in the generation of slower migrating complexes (supershifts), confirming the specificity of DNA binding (Fig. 3C, black arrowheads). We next determined whether the T-box region is sufficient to recapitulate the binding characteristics of the full-length proteins (Fig. 3D). T-box-containing peptides of Tbx18, Tbx15, and Brachyury exhibited strongly diminished DNA binding (Fig. 3D, lanes 3), indicating that the N- and C-terminal regions participate in protein-DNA complex formation. T-boxes of Tbx18 and Tbx15, but not of Brachyury, exclusively bound to the BS.inv site (Fig. 3D, open arrowheads), suggesting that the T-boxes of Tbx18 and Tbx15 possess an inherent binding specificity for this sequence. A strong increase in protein-DNA complex formation was observed for all truncated T-box peptides and full-length proteins after the addition of anti-myc antibody (Fig. 3, C and D, black arrowheads). Since this effect was not observed using a probe containing a single T half-site (data not shown), we assume that the divalent antibody may stabilize binding to composite sites as dimers.FIGURE 3Comparative DNA binding analysis of Tbx18, Tbx15, and Brachyury. A, double-stranded oligonucleotides with different orientation of half-sites (arrows) were tested for binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. B, assays were performed with equal amounts of in vitro synthesized myc-tagged Tbx18, Tbx15, and Brachyury full-length proteins (left) and their T-boxes (right), respectively, as determined by anti-myc Western blot. C, Tbx18 and Tbx15 bind to composite sites irrespective of the orientation of the half-sites (open arrowheads). Specificity of binding is confirmed by the addition of anti-myc antibody that results in the formation of a supershifted complex (black arrowheads). Binding experiments were performed under the following conditions: lane 1, probe alone; lane 2, non-programmed lysate; lane 3, programmed lysate; lane 4, programmed lysate plus anti-myc antibody. D, T-box regions of Tbx18 and Tbx15 preferentially bind to BS.inv; experiments were performed as in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tbx18 and Tbx15 Dimerize—The composite nature of the DNA binding site of T-box proteins had previously suggested that dimerization of T-box proteins increases DNA binding specificity and/or affinity (27Muller C.W. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 28Kusch T. Storck T. Walldorf U. Reuter R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, dimerization in the absence of DNA and in living cells had not been explored experimentally. To address the possibility that Tbx18 dimerizes in vitro, we performed pulldown assays using bacterially expressed GST-Tbx18 proteins that were incubated with lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with expression constructs for myc-tagged Tbx18, Tbx15, or Brachyury protein. Since GST-Tbx18 full-length protein could not be expressed in bacteria, we used a series of bacterially expressed fusion proteins of GST with the N- and C-terminal region and the T-box of Tbx18 instead (Fig. 4A, left). Tbx18 specifically bound to GST-Tbx18(N + T) and-Tbx18(T) but not to GST-Tbx18(N) or -Tbx18(C) (Fig. 4A, right), showing that dimerization via the T-box region occurred in the absence of DNA binding. A weaker interaction was observed with Tbx15 but not with Brachyury, indicating that related T-box proteins are able to form heterodimers.FIGURE 4Tbx18 and Tbx15 form homo- and heterodimers. A, dimerization in vitro. Left, GST and fusion proteins of GST and N + T-, N-, T-, and C-domains of Tbx18 were purified from E. coli extracts and analyzed for integrity and quantity by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

https://openalex.org/W2138577310,"The synaptic serine protease neurotrypsin is thought to be important for adaptive synaptic processes required for cognitive functions, because humans deficient in neurotrypsin suffer from severe mental retardation. In the present study, we describe the biochemical characterization of neurotrypsin and its so far unique substrate agrin. In cell culture experiment as well as in neurotrypsin-deficient mice, we showed that agrin cleavage depends on neurotrypsin and occurs at two conserved sites. Neurotrypsin and agrin were expressed recombinantly, purified, and assayed in vitro. A catalytic efficiency of 1.3 x 10(4) M(-1) x s(-1) was determined. Neurotrypsin activity was shown to depend on calcium with an optimal activity in the pH range of 7-8.5. Mutagenesis analysis of the amino acids flanking the scissile bonds showed that cleavage is highly specific due to the unique substrate recognition pocket of neurotrypsin at the active site. The C-terminal agrin fragment released after cleavage has recently been identified as an inactivating ligand of the Na+/K+-ATPase at CNS synapses, and its binding has been demonstrated to regulate presynaptic excitability. Therefore, dysregulation of agrin processing is a good candidate for a pathogenetic mechanism underlying mental retardation. In turn, these results may also shed light on mechanisms involved in cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2020083886,"Netrins were first identified as neural guidance molecules, acting through receptors that are members of the DCC and UNC-5 family. All netrins share structural homology to the laminin N-terminal domains and the laminin epidermal growth factor-like domains of laminin short arms. Laminins use these domains to self-assemble into complex networks. Here we demonstrate that netrin-4 is a component of basement membranes and is integrated into the laminin polymer via interactions with the lamininγ1 andγ3 short arms. The binding is mediated through the laminin N-terminal domain of netrin-4. In contrast to netrin-4, other members of the netrin family do not bind to these laminin short arms. Moreover, a truncated form of netrin-4 completely inhibits laminin-111 self-assembly in vitro, and full-length netrin-4 can partially disrupt laminin self-interactions.

Furthermore, netrin-1 has been suggested as a ligand for the laminin receptors integrins α6β4 and α3β1 and hence has been described as acting as an adhesive cue (25Yebra M. Montgomery A.M.

We have previously shown that netrin-4 is also a component of basement membranes in a variety of tissues (13Koch M. Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. Olson P.F. Jin W. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices underlying all endothelia and epithelia and surrounding many forms of mesenchymal cells (26Yurchenco P.D. Wadsworth W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). They have both physical and signaling functions that alter with both tissue type and stage of development. In addition to forming surfaces to which cells attach, they also transmit force between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Basement membrane components may also regulate many aspects of intracellular activity by signaling via the integrin, dystroglycan, and syndecan receptor families. Furthermore, basement membranes can act as reservoirs for cytokines and growth factors, e.g. members of the fibroblast growth factor family. Finally, signaling by other cytokines may be complemented by basement membrane-induced signals, as seen with neurotrophins. Hence basement membrane-induced signaling plays an important role in cell survival and differentiation as well as in cell migration and as an axonal guidance cue. Laminins are the major noncollagenous proteins of basement membranes and are crucial in its formation. Laminin-111, the prototype laminin, is a cross-like shaped molecule formed as a multidomain heterotrimer assembled of one α1, one β1, and one γ1 chain (27Chung A.E. Jaffe R. Freeman I.L. Vergnes J.P.

The laminin trimer has one long and three short arms, the latter being formed from the three free N-terminal ends of the α1, β1, and γ1 chains (30Beck K. Dixon T.W. Engel J. Parry D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). These parts of the β1 and γ1 chains each contain two globular domains, designated LN and L4/LF. The globules are interspersed by multiple LE modules, forming rods in domains LEa and LEb. Certain laminin chains have been described as maintaining the domain structure of those in the original laminin-111 (e.g. α2 and β2), whereas others have N-terminal truncations, lacking an LN domain. So far 15 laminin isoforms have been shown to occur (29Aumailley M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carter W.G. Deutzmann R. Edgar D. Ekblom P. Engel J. Engvall E. Hohenester E. Jones J.C. Kleinman H.K.

Laminins self-assemble into a network through Ca2+-dependent interactions between their N-terminal parts (32Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and polymerization of laminin-111 may be inhibited by proteolytic laminin fragments that contain LN domains (33Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Netrin-4 is the most recently described soluble netrin family member, and its biological significance is still poorly understood. We have shown that netrin-4 is widely expressed with the protein being concentrated in certain basement membranes and having a spatial expression that broadens during later development. Here we demonstrate the integration of netrin-4 into the basement membrane via the binding to the N-terminal region of the laminin γ1 chain. Furthermore, we show the significance of netrin-4 in basement membrane assembly and its effect upon branching morphogenesis. Recombinant Expression and Purification of Murine Netrin and Laminin-derived Proteins—The following full-length or truncated netrin forms were amplified by PCR and subcloned into an episomal expression vector: mouse netrin-1 (U65418), nucleotides 1–1368 with three additional nucleotides after nucleotide 69, which leads to an insertion of an additional glycine and a single amino acid substitution valine to leucine at nucleotides 259–261 (present in all the sequenced clones, all of which were independent PCR products); mouse netrin-4 (AF281278), nucleotides 311–2166; mouse Δnetrin-4 (AF281278), nucleotides 311–1672; and mouse netrin-G1e (AB038663), nucleotides 52–1305. The PCR products were subcloned (rapid DNA ligation kit, Roche Diagnostics) into a modified pCEP-Pu (13Koch M. Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. Olson P.F. Jin W. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) expression vector (an 8-histidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site were introduced either at the N-terminal or the C-terminal end of the protein sequence). On the basis of the Δnetrin-4 and Δnetrin-G1e constructs, the following Δnetrin-4 deletion and Δnetrin-4-netrin-G1 hybrid constructs were cloned: Δnetrin-4 (LN + EGF 1–2), nucleotides 311–1432; Δnetrin-4 (LN + EGF 1 + 3), nucleotides 311–1242 and 1432–1672; netrin-4 (EGF 1–3.5), nucleotides 1031–1672; Δnetrin-4 (LN) + netrin-G1 (EGF 1–3), nucleotides 311–1036 (netrin-4) and 889–1305 (netrin-G1e); netrin-G1 (LN) + netrin-4 (EGF 1–3.5), nucleotides 52–891 (netrin-G1e) and 1040–1672 (netrin-4). In addition, a fragment of the laminin γ1 chain (J02930), nucleotides 292–1668, containing the N-terminal LN domain and four LEa repeats and a fragment of the laminin γ3 chain (NM 011836), nucleotides 148–3133, containing domains LN, LEa, L4, and LEb, were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the modified pCEP-Pu expression vector. The expression vectors were transfected into 293-EBNA cells with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics), and selected clones with the highest protein expression were expanded for large scale production. The purification of the secreted proteins was performed as described previously (13Koch M. Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. Olson P.F. Jin W. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—For antibody KR1, a rabbit was immunized with purified recombinant Δnetrin-4. The antiserum was affinity-purified by applying it to a Sepharose column to which mouse Δnetrin-4 protein had been coupled. Bound antibodies were eluted with triethylamine, pH 11.5, immediately neutralized, and dialyzed against PBS. For antibody KR 24, a rabbit was immunized with purified recombinant netrin-1, and the antiserum was affinity-purified as described for antibody KR1. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Newborn (P2) and adult mouse tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek Europe). 7-μm-thick sections were cut with a Leica cryostat and stored at –20 °C. For use, slides were returned to room temperature, fixed, washed in PBS, and blocked with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed, blocked with 5% goat serum, and incubated with antibodies against netrin-4 (KR1, see under “Antibody Production”) and the laminin γ1 chain (rat anti-laminin β2 chain monoclonal antibody, Chemicon). After incubation with secondary antibodies (Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch; or Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rat IgG, Molecular Probes), mounted sections were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica) scanning the sections 16 times. ELISA Style Ligand Binding Assay—Unless otherwise specified, all solutions used contained 2 mm CaCl2. For testing the divalent cation dependence of interactions, no CaCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, or 20 mm EDTA was added to the solutions. Purified proteins were diluted in TBS, pH 7.4, and coated at 10 μg/ml (500 ng/well) overnight at room temperature onto 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorb). After washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, plates were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with TBS containing either 5% milk powder or 1% bovine serum albumin. Ligands were diluted to concentrations between 0.001 and 50 nm and incubated in the wells for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound ligands were detected with specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against netrin-1 and netrin-4, respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO Cytomation) and tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. Absorption was measured at 450 nm after stopping the reaction with 10% sulfuric acid. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assays—Assays were performed using a Biacore 2000 (BIAcore AB). Coupling of proteins to the CM5 chip was performed in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A 7-min pulse of 0.05 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide, 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide was used to activate the surface. The protein was injected until the desired amount was coupled (500–1000 RU), and excess reactive groups were deactivated by a 7-min pulse of 1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. Measurements were carried out in HBS (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% P20 at a flow of 25 μl/min. The injection of 100 μl of protein solution (0.05–1 μm) was followed by a 400-s dissociation. Each analysis was carried out at six different concentrations. The data were analyzed with BIAe-valuation software 3.2 according to the Langmuir model for 1 to 1 binding. All binding curves were fitted with an accuracy of χ2 <1% of Rmax (maximal RU). The mean ka, kd, and KD values for the six concentrations are given in Table 2.TABLE 2Surface plasmon resonance analysis of netrin-4 binding to laminin γ1AnalytekakdKDm-1 s-1s-1mNetrin-4 (LN + EGF 1-3.5)Laminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)5.70 × 1041.24 × 10-33.71 × 10-8Laminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-4 (LN + EGF 1-3.5)1.83 × 1051.29 × 10-31.69 × 10-8Laminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-G1 (LN + EGF 1-3)NBaNB indicates no binding.NBNBLaminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-4 (LN + EGF 1/3)3.88 × 1041.32 × 10-35.66 × 10-8Laminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-4 (LN + EGF 1-2)2.60 × 1059.94 × 10-41.39 × 10-8Laminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-4 (LN) + netrin-G1 (EGF 1-3)4.92 × 1046.24 × 10-35.82 × 10-7Laminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-4 (EGF 1-3.5)NBNBNBLaminin γ1 (LN + EGF 1-4)Netrin-G1 (LN) + netrin-4 (EGF 1-3.5)NBNBNBa NB indicates no binding. Open table in a new tab Cross-linking Assays—Cross-linking assays were carried out using the lysine side chain-reactive cross-linker bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate (Pierce). The reaction was carried out at a protein concentration of 2.8 μm in a final volume of 50 μlof PBS, pH 7.4. The cross-linker was used at concentrations from 0.5 to 2 mm. The reaction was allowed to continue for 1 h on ice and was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Organ Culture—Submandibular glands from embryonic day 13.5 BL/6 mice were placed on a Nucleopore filter (Whatman) and cultured at the air/medium interface. Cultures were carried out in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml transferrin, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For testing the effects of full-length netrin-4 protein and Δnetrin-4, lacking the netrin C domain and Δlaminin γ1, these were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml at the onset of organ culture. For negative controls the same amount of PBS was added. Medium was changed every day. After 3 days the explants were photographed under a microscope and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek Europe). Sections were cut and stained as described above. Aggregation of Laminin-111-Nidogen Complexes—Laminin-111 (laminin-111-nidogen complexes) was extracted from mouse EHS tumor tissue (kindly provided by Juörgen Engel and Therese Schuthess, EDTA extraction method of Paulsson et al. (34Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar)), and Δnetrin-4 in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g at room temperature. Aliquots of laminin-111 (0.67 mg/ml, Fig. 6A, and 0.5 mg/ml, Fig. 6B) were pre-equilibrated at 37 °C for 30 min in the cuvettes of a thermostatted Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. To one sample 5 mm EDTA was added, and to the other samples prewarmed Δnetrin-4 (0.21 mg/ml, Fig. 6A, and 0.14 mg/ml, Fig. 6B) or full-length netrin-4 (0.19 mg/ml, Fig. 6B) was added. After supplementing all samples with 1 mm CaCl2, turbidity development was monitored as absorbance at 360 nm. After 300 min EDTA (5 mm) was added to such samples that had not been kept in the presence of EDTA for the duration of the experiment. In a second independent polymerization assay, laminin-111 (0.6 mg/ml, laminin-111-nidogen complex) in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h after the initiation of polymerization by addition of 1 mm CaCl2 (35Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cheng Y.S. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Aggregation was assayed after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 8% polyacrylamide gels. When desired 10 mm EDTA or serial dilutions of Δnetrin-4 or Δnetrin-1, giving a 1:1 to 1:125 molar ratio between netrin and laminin, were added prior to incubation. Netrin-4 Expression in Newborn and Adult Mice—We described previously the expression pattern of netrin-4 in the adult mouse and showed that it is present in basement membranes in a variety of tissues (13Koch M. Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. Olson P.F. Jin W. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, the netrin-4 expression in kidney was studied during development, initially by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a netrin-4-specific polyclonal antibody on kidney sections from day 14.5 (E14.5) and day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse embryos, newborn mice (P2), and 3–4-month-old adult mice (for antibody specificity see supplemental Fig. 1). Surprisingly, expression was not observed until birth (Fig. 1B), with no immunostaining of the embryonic kidney (not shown). Postnatally expression increases, so that while at P2 netrin-4 staining was mainly localized to the glomerular basement membrane and the vascular basement membranes (Fig. 1, B and C), and in the adult kidney the tubular basement membrane and that of the tissue capsule also stained for netrin-4 (Fig. 1, E and F). A strong co-localization of netrin-4 and the laminin γ1 subunit was observed, although netrin-4 was also observed at non-basement membrane sites (Fig. 1, C and F), for instance in the mesangium of the glomerulus. This suggests that netrin-4 expression occurs as epithelial structures mature, e.g. the kidney tubules. Netrin-4 Interactions with Laminin LN Domains—The basement membrane localization of netrin-4 suggests its involvement in protein-protein interactions. Its marked homology to the LN domains of laminin, which participate on laminin self-interactions, raised the possibility that netrin-4, as well as other members of the netrin family, could be a laminin-binding protein. Hence, recombinant proteins were produced that corresponded to the N-terminal part of laminin chains or were full-length or modified forms of netrin-1 or netrin-4 (Fig. 2). Initially, surface plasmon resonance-based assays were carried out to identify any possible binding between short arms of laminins and netrin-1 and -4. This showed a strong binding of the Δlaminin γ1 chain-(LN + LEa) and γ3 chain (LN + LEa + L4 + LEb)-derived proteins to Δnetrin-4 (LN + EGF 1–3.5; Fig. 3) but not to Δnetrin-1 (LN + EGF 1–3; data not shown); the calculated KD was 2.35 × 10–8 m for the γ1 chain fragment (Fig. 3A) and 1.96 × 10–8 m for the γ3 chain short arm (Fig. 3B). In addition binding to the Δlaminin β1 chain (LN + LEa) could be observed (not shown). The following experiments focused on the Δlaminin γ1 chain, since this subunit is common to most laminin heterotrimers (29Aumailley M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carter W.G. Deutzmann R. Edgar D. Ekblom P. Engel J. Engvall E. Hohenester E. Jones J.C. Kleinman H.K. Marinkovich M.P. Martin G.R. Mayer U. Meneguzzi G. Miner J.H. Miyazaki K. Patarroyo M. Paulsson M. Quaranta V. Sanes J.R. Sasaki T. Sekiguchi K. Sorokin L.M. Talts J.F. Tryggvason K. Uitto J. Virtanen I. von der Mark K. Wewer U.M. Yamada Y. Yurchenco P.D. Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We also tested the laminin γ1 chain-netrin-4 interaction in an ELISA style ligand-binding assay. After coating the Δlaminin γ1 protein (LN + LEa) onto wells, increasing concentrations of Δnetrin-4 (LN + EGF 1–3.5) were added, and binding with an apparent KD of 1.38 × 10–11 m was detected (not shown). In addition, we investigated whether Δnetrin-4 also binds to native laminin-111 isolated from mouse EHS tumor. ELISA style assays were carried out with laminin-111 as the immobilized ligand, and increasing concentrations of Δnetrin-1 and Δnetrin-4 were added to the solution (Fig. 4). ΔNetrin-1 failed to bind laminin-111, whereas Δnetrin-4 bound to native laminin-111 with an apparent KD of 3.70 × 10–11 m, similar to the one observed in the experiment with recombinant Δlaminin γ1 (LN + LEa) chains in the same kind of assay. These results suggest that the netrin-4 binding activity for laminin-111 resides in the LN and LE domains of the laminin γ1 chain. The laminin γ1 chain-netrin-4 interaction was also studied using the water-soluble covalent cross-linking agent BS3. As shown previously and in this cross-linking experiment, the N-terminal Δlaminin γ1 chain fragments do not self-interact (Fig. 5A) (37Odenthal U. Haehn S. Tunggal P. Merkl B. Schomburg D. Frie C. Paulsson M. Smyth N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44504-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ΔNetrin-4 on the other hand shows self-interaction as well as an interaction with Δlaminin γ1 chain fragments (Fig. 5, A and B). Remarkably, Δnetrin-4 binding to an N-terminal Δlaminin γ1 chain fragment (LN + LEa) results only in the formation of dimers, whereas the Δnetrin-4 self-interaction results in multimers. As expected no interaction between netrin-1 and the Δlaminin γ1 chain was detected (Fig. 5C). The Netrin-4 Interaction with Laminin LN and LE Domains Is Independent of Divalent Cations—To analyze whether Ca2+ ions affect the netrin-4-laminin binding, ELISA style ligand binding assays were performed either in the absence of added CaCl2 or after the addition of either 2 mm CaCl2 or excess EDTA. Binding was observed under all conditions and had similar apparent KD values (1.38 × 10–11 m in the absence of added CaCl2; 1.07 × 10–11 m in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 1.64 × 10–11 m in the presence of excess EDTA) (supplemental Fig. 2A). Some laminin LN domains undergo a conformational change in the presence of Ca2+ (37Odenthal U. Haehn S. Tunggal P. Merkl B. Schomburg D. Frie C. Paulsson M. Smyth N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44504-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine whether the conformation of Δnetrin-4 is also influenced by Ca2+, circular dichroism spectra of Δnetrin-4 were recorded in the absence of CaCl2, in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, and after the addition of excess EDTA (Table 1; supplemental Fig. 2B). In contrast to the laminin LN domains, no significant conformational changes in Δnetrin-4 could be observed upon addition of CaCl2 or EDTA. Apparently neither the conformation of the netrin-4 LN domain nor its interaction with the Δlaminin γ1 subunit requires the presence of divalent cations, suggesting a different mechanism of interaction than between laminins.TABLE 1Secondary structures of Δnetrin-1 and Δnetrin-4Proteinα-Helixβ-Strandβ-TurnUnorderedCONTINCDSSTRCONTINCDSSTRCONTINCDSSTRCONTINCDSSTR%%%%Secondary structure of Δnetrin-1Δnetrin-16.3640.93920.92131.833Δnetrin-1 + 2 mm CaCl210.6743.65219.31826.521Δnetrin-1 + 4 mm EDTA8.6742.23820.32228.832Secondary structure of Δnetrin-4Δnetrin-4610434020.51830.532Δnetrin-4 + 2 mm CaCl24.9546.34220.32128.631Δnetrin-4 + 4 mm EDTA7.1639.75322.92130.320 Open table in a new tab Localization of the Lami"
https://openalex.org/W2137971431,"The transposon piggyBac from the genome of the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni has been observed in the laboratory to jump into the genomes of key model and pathogenic eukaryote organisms including mosquitoes, planarians, human and other mammalian cells, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Introduction of exogenous transposons into schistosomes has not been reported but transposon-mediated transgenesis of schistosomes might supersede current methods for functional genomics of this important human pathogen. In the present study we examined whether the piggyBac transposon could deliver reporter transgenes into the genome of Schistosoma mansoni parasites. A piggyBac donor plasmid modified to encode firefly luciferase under control of schistosome gene promoters was introduced along with 7-methylguanosine capped RNAs encoding piggyBac transposase into cultured schistosomula by square wave electroporation. The activity of the helper transposase mRNA was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA from the transformed schistosomes, and hybridization signals indicated that the piggyBac transposon had integrated into numerous sites within the parasite chromosomes. piggyBac integrations were recovered by retrotransposon-anchored PCR, revealing characteristic piggyBac TTAA footprints in the vicinity of the endogenous schistosome retrotransposons Boudicca, SR1, and SR2. This is the first report of chromosomal integration of a transgene and somatic transgenesis of this important human pathogen, in this instance accomplished by mobilization of the piggyBac transposon."

We reported the first missense APOB mutation, R463W, in an FHBL kindred (Burnett, J. R., Shan, J., Miskie, B. A., Whitfield, A. J., Yuan, J., Tran, K., Mc-Knight, C. J., Hegele, R. A., and Yao, Z.

Heterozygotes for L343V (n = 10) had a mean plasma apoB at 0.31 g/liter as compared with 0.80 g/liter in unaffected family members (n = 22). The L343V mutation impaired secretion of apoB-100 and very low density lipoproteins. The secretion efficiency was 20% for B100wt and 10% for B100LV and B100RW. Decreased secretion of mutant apoB-100 was associated with increased endoplasmic reticulum retention and increased binding to microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and BiP. Reduced secretion efficiency was also observed with B48LV and B17LV. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of apoB domain constructs showed that L343V and R463W altered folding of the α-helical domain within the N terminus of apoB.

ApoB-48 is the truncated form of apoB-100 consisting of the N-terminal 48% of full-length apoB-100. ApoB-48 is synthesized in the intestine and is essential for the formation and secretion of chylomicrons. ApoB-100 is synthesized in the liver and is an essential structural component of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its metabolic products, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL), and is also a ligand for the LDL receptor. Unlike humans, the rat liver produces both apoB-100 and apoB-48, and both forms can assemble VLDL (6Elovson J. Chatterton J.E. Bell G.T. Schumaker V.N. Reuben M.A. Puppione D.L. Reeve Jr., J.R. Young N.L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1461-1473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A pentapartite model for human apoB-100 has been proposed, which depicts a five-domain structure composed of alternating amphipathic α-helices and amphipathic β-strands, namely βα1-β1-α2-β2-α3 (7Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The βα1 domain is a mixture of 13 amphipathic β-strands and 17 amphipathic α-helices, whose amino acids share extensive sequence homologies to the yolk protein lipovitellin (7Segrest J.P. Jones M.K.

The apoB βα1 domain has been modeled on the structure of silver lamprey lipovitellin, in which the 13 β-strands (amino acids 21-263) form a β-barrel, whereas the 17 α-helices (amino acids 440-592) form a two-layered helical bundle (10Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 895-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). There is an interface between the α-helical bundle and the extended amphipathic β-sheets (termed C-sheet and A-sheet in the lipovitellin structure). Recent studies have shown that the ability of apoB to initiate lipid binding resides in a region within the amphipathic C-sheet (i.e. between apoB-19 (residues 1-862) and apoB20.1 (residues 1-912)) (11Shelness G.S.

Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL; OMIM 107730) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal co-dominant disorder characterized by low levels (<5th percentile for age and sex) of plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins (27Schonfeld G.

Heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic with LDL cholesterol and apoB-100 concentrations <50% of those in normal plasma. Homozygotes have undetectable plasma LDL cholesterol and apoB, and their clinical presentation, depending on the specific mutation, varies from no symptoms to severe gastrointestinal and neurological dysfunction, similar to that in abetalipoproteinemia (27Schonfeld G.

Nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations in the APOB gene leading to formation of prematurely truncated apoB species have been reported in FHBL subjects (27Schonfeld G. J.

Groenewegen W.A. Wu J. Schonfeld G. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 76: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The study of monogenic lipid disorders has revealed key metabolic steps and biologically relevant mechanisms (34Hegele R.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1161-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring gene mutations in affected families have been useful in identifying important domains of apoB (35Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J. Hegele R.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13442-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Four years ago, we discovered the first missense mutation in APOB causing FHBL, namely R463W, in a Christian Lebanese kindred (35Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J. Hegele R.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13442-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The R463W mutation specified a local domain that appeared to be critical for the efficient secretion of apoB and for lipid recruitment during lipoprotein assembly. The Arg463 residue is located within the βα1 domain, which contains sequence elements important for proper folding of apoB, for the physical interaction of apoB with MTP, and for lipoprotein assembly. Expression of recombinant human apoB-48 carrying the R463W mutation in stably transfected rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells resulted in markedly decreased secretion efficiency as compared with the wild-type apoB-48 (35Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J. Hegele R.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13442-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we report a second novel nonsynonymous nontruncating APOB gene mutation, namely L343V, in another FHBL kindred, in which the mutation also appears to impair the secretion of apoB. Our findings provide new evidence that proper folding of the α-helical domain of apoB is important for efficient secretion of apoB. Phenotyping and Genotyping of the L343V Kindred—The proband (Fig. 1A, subject II:1) was referred to a lipid disorders clinic with marked hypocholesterolemia detected on routine lipid screening. The subject was also noted to have iron deficiency anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. A pedigree was constructed, and the kindred extended to a total of 32 members, including 10 heterozygotes and 22 unaffected subjects. Fasting blood (10 ml) samples obtained from each individual were collected into a plain tube and a tube containing EDTA (1 mg/ml) to separate serum and plasma, respectively, by centrifugation (2,500 rpm, 15 min, 20 °C). The protease inhibitor aprotinin (100 kilounits/ml) was added to plasma. Plasma total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and the serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1), and γ-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2) were measured enzymatically using reagents from Roche Diagnostics on a Hitachi 917 analyzer. Plasma apoB-100 and apoA-I were measured using Behring reagents (Lane Cove, Australia) on a Behring BN-II nephelometer. Serum α-tocopherol and retinol were determined by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography using a C-18 column. Serum 25-dihydroxyvitamin D was determined using the INCSTAR/DiaSorin radio-immunoassay (Stillwater, MN). In some experiments, proteins in delipidated plasma were subjected to PAGE (5% gel) containing 0.1% SDS (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) as described previously (36McCormick S.P. Fellowes S.P. Walmsley A.P. George P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1D1 (a gift of Drs. R. W. Milne and Y. L. Marcel, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada) that recognizes an epitope of human apoB in amino acids 401-582. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by a standard Triton X-100 procedure. The 29 exons of APOB, including intron-exon boundaries, were amplified using PCR. Each reaction contained 100-200 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PCR Buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 pmol of each of forward and reverse primer (M13-tagged), and 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) in a total volume of 25 μl. DNA was amplified under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension for 2 min at 72 °C. BigDye Terminator sequencing reactions were then carried out in both directions using PCR product as template and M13 primers. Sequencing reactions were purified and detected on an ABI Prism 3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were visually checked and then edited and aligned to control sequences using the program Bio-Edit (37Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). The L343V mutation was confirmed by sequencing of a second PCR of APOB exon 9 of the proband. As the L343V mutation creates an HphI restriction site, family members were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Genotype analysis of APOE was performed by PCR amplification followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme HhaI as described previously (38Hixson J.E. Vernier D.T. J.

Numbers following apoB represent the percent of full-length apoB (apoB-100). The resulting pB48wt and pB17wt were used as templates to prepare pB48RW and pB17RW, respectively, using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously (35Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J. Hegele R.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13442-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the preparation of pB100RW, a NotI-ClaI fragment (the NotI site was located at the 5′ upstream of the apoB cDNA and the ClaI site at nucleotide 5849 of the apoB cDNA) was excised from pB48 and inserted into pB100wt that had been digested with NotI and ClaI. Expressing plasmids encoding variants of apoB-100, apoB-48, and apoB-17 that contained the L343V mutation were similarly constructed. The mutagenic primers used to introduce the L343V mutation were as follows: CA TCT CTC TTG CCA CAG GTG ATT GAG GTG TCC AGC (forward) and GCT GGA CAC CTC AAT CAC CTG TGG CAA GAG AGA TG (reverse). Both primers presented are in the 5′ → 3′ orientations. The cDNAs coding for apoB domain constructs, namely B6.4-13 (residues 292-469), B6.4-17 (residues 292-782), and B13-17 (residues 611-782), were cloned into the pET24a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described previously (42Jiang Z.G. Carraway M. McKnight C.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Detection of Recombinant ApoB—McA-RH7777 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% horse serum. Transient (for apoB-17) and stable transfection (for apoB-17, B-48, and B-100) were achieved using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (43Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of apoBs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of conditioned media (DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate) that had been incubated with cells stably or transiently transfected with respective apoB expression plasmids. In brief, the human apoBs were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody against human LDL (produced in our laboratory), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting using mAb 1D1. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells were pretreated with methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate for 30 min, and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) in the same medium for 30 min. After pulse-labeling, the medium was changed to normal DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate and further cultured (i.e. chase) for up to 4 h. In some experiments, 25 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) was included in both pulse and chase media. The 35S-apoB was recovered from cell and media at each chase time point by immunoprecipitation, resolved by SDS-PAGE (3-15% gel), and then subjected to fluorography as described previously (35Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J. Hegele R.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13442-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation of intracellular microsomes was performed as described previously (35Burnett J.R. Shan J. Miskie B.A. Whitfield A.J. Yuan J. Tran K. McKnight C.J.

In brief, cells (two 10-cm dishes) were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer (H and Y Enterprise, Red-wood City, CA). Postnuclear supernatants were subjected to fractionation by centrifugation in a gradient of Nycodenz (Sigma). The recombinant human apoB in each fraction was probed by immunoblotting using mAb 1D1. The anti-calnexin (StressGen, Ann Arbor, MI) and anti-giantin (Abcam, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) antibodies were used to probe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cis/medial Golgi, respectively. Lipoprotein Fractionation—Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml) for 4 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM with or without 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate. After labeling, the media were fractionated into VLDL1 (Sf >100), VLDL2 (Sf 20-100), and other lipoproteins by rate flotation ultracentrifugation. The 35S-apoB proteins in each fraction were recovered by immunoprecipitation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were treated with MG132 (25 μm) for 1 h, washed twice with cold PBS, and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, protease inhibitor mixture). The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C by gentle mixing, and the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 °C, 15 min). Aliquot of the supernatant (500 μg of protein) was mixed with lysis buffer to a final volume of 1 ml. The samples were pre-cleared by incubation with non-immune rabbit serum (2 h, 4 °C) prior to incubation with an anti-human LDL antiserum (16 h, 4 °C). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads, and proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting for apoB, MTP (using anti-MTP antibody that was a gift of Dr. C. C. Shoulders, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK), and BiP (the anti-Grp78 (BiP) antibody was purchased from StressGen, Ann Arbor, MI). Assessment of ApoB Polyubiquitination—Cells (∼80% confluence in 10-cm culture dishes) were incubated in media ±MG132 (25 μm) for 1 h and lysed with 1% SDS in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% w/v phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 80 °C. The samples were incubated for additional 16 h (4 °C) and diluted to 0.1% SDS with RIPA buffer, and apoB proteins were immunoprecipitated with the rabbit anti-human apoB antiserum as described above. After repeated washing with 0.1% SDS in RIPA buffer, the captured proteins were released into SDS-PAGE sample buffer, divided into 2 equal aliquots, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed by mAb 1D1 or anti-ubiquitin (SPA-203: StressGen, Ann Arbor, MI), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Protease Protection Analysis of ApoB-100—Cells (80% confluence in 10-cm dishes) were incubated in media +MG132 (25 μm) for 1 h. The media were removed, and the cells (combined from two dishes) were harvested in ice-cold PBS. The cells were collected after centrifugation (50 × g, 2 min), resuspended in microsome buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μm MG132, 10 kilounits/ml aprotinin), and homogenized using ball-bearing homogenizer as described previously (44Lapierre L.R.

The microsomes were resuspended in the microsome buffer (without protease inhibitors) and subjected to protease protection analysis as described previously (44Lapierre L.R. Currie D.L. Zao Z. Wang J.

Immunoblotting for human apoB (1D1), protein-disulfide isomerase (SPA-891, StressGen, Ann Arbor, MI), Hsp70 (SPA-820, StressGen), p97 (RDI-PRO6527, Research Diagnostics, Inc., Concord, MA), and the N-terminal epitope of calnexin (SPA-865, StressGen) was performed using respective antibodies. Preparation of Bacterially Expressed ApoB Domain Constructs—For protein expression, plasmids coding for apoB domain constructs, namely B6.4-13, B6.4-17, and B13-17, were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6-0.8 at 600 nm in Luria broth and treated with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h. Cell pellets were collected, treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml, 30 min, 25 °C), and disintegrated with a probe sonicator (Branson, Danbury, CT). Inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea after washing with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 m urea. For protein preparation, denatured proteins were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) at pH 8.0. Purified proteins were refolded by slowly adding the denatured protein into a refolding buffer (50 mm Tris, 800 mm arginine, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm oxidized glutathione, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 8.0.) The proteins (1-2 μm in the refolding buffer) were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h and dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5 (TS buffer). The final protein volume and concentration were adjusted using an Amicon Ultra concentrating apparatus (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the protein concentration"
https://openalex.org/W1645088669,"Moral concerns about the primary source of stem cells, human embryos, have prompted one of the most contentious public debates in the history of biomedical science. Following the announcement of a restriction of U.S. federal funding to research with about 20 cell lines isolated from embryos before August 2001 (1) and, more recently, a presidential veto upholding this restriction (2), there has been a clear message from the scientific community that the eligible lines are not only inadequate in number but also unsafe for translational research. There is also mounting evidence that American scientists are losing ground to other countries with lessrestrictive policies (3). Further, surveys of the American public indicate that there is widespread support for embryonic stem cell (ES cell) research that cuts across political, religious, and socioeconomic lines, with approval estimated at 66% of the public overall (4)."

The function of a number of proteins is regulated by acidic pH. This is particularly the case for a series of bacterial protein toxins with intracellular targets (1Menetrey J. Gillet D. Menez A. Toxicon. 2005; 45: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These include, for instance, Pseudomonas exotoxin A (2Mere J. Morlon-Guyot J. Bonhoure A. Chiche L. Beaumelle B. J. Biol.

After binding to a cell surface receptor, these toxins are internalized into the endosome. The acidic pH found in this compartment triggers the insertion of a translocation moiety into the membrane, which assists the passage of a catalytic domain into the cytoplasm. There, the catalytic domain modifies a substrate, leading to perturbation of a physiological process. The purpose of the present study is to determine how pH controls the conformational changes leading to the interaction of the translocation domain (T domain) 5The abbreviations used are: T domain, translocation domain; ANTS, 8-amino-naphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid; DPX, p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle(s); MG, molten globule; WT, wild type. 5The abbreviations used are: T domain, translocation domain; ANTS, 8-amino-naphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid; DPX, p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle(s); MG, molten globule; WT, wild type. of the diphtheria toxin with membranes.In its soluble form, the T domain of the diphtheria toxin is composed of 10 α helices named TH1-TH9 and TH5′, organized in a globular shape (6Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Hydrophobic helices TH8 and TH9 are sandwiched by two layers of amphiphilic helices, TH1-TH4 and TH5-TH7. In solution, the acidification of pH between 6 and 5 induces a conformational change, leading to a molten globule (MG) state prone to interact with membranes (7Zhan H. Oh K.J. Shin Y.K. Hubbell W.L.

In the presence of membranes however, the T domain binds to the phospholipid bilayer between pH 7 and pH 6. This interaction involves the C terminus of the domain, whereas the N terminus is more exposed to the solvent (9Montagner C. Perier A. Pichard S. Vernier G. Menez A. Gillet D. Forge V. Chenal A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1878-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Between pH 6 and pH 4, the protein rearranges its structure and penetrates deeply inside the membrane (8Chenal A.

The pH ranges at which these transitions occur suggest that the protonation of His side chains may be involved. Indeed, it has been shown that His residues may function as pH sensors for many molecular mechanisms involving protein-membrane interaction (11Mason A.J. Gasnier C. Kichler A. Prevost G. Aunis D.

Biol. 2005; 348: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The T domain of diphtheria toxin contains six His residues (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the protein aggregates around its isoelectric point at high concentration (15Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This precludes probing the role of these His residues by NMR. To overcome this experimental problem, we substituted the His by Phe residues using site-directed mutagenesis and studied the behavior of the mutant T domains by a combination of biophysical approaches. The data showed that MG formation and membrane interaction involve the concerted protonation of key His side chains. However, different His residues have a preponderant role in the different steps studied: the pair His223-His257 and His251 are important for the formation of the MG state in solution, whereas the pair His322-His323 and His251 are the most sensitive triggers of the membrane binding step.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Proteins—The recombinant T domain containing mutation C201S (native diphtheria toxin numbering) and referred to as “wild type” (WT) has been described previously (15Chenal A.

His to Phe mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in plasmid pA/T C201S and checked by DNA sequencing. Protein expression was performed as described previously (15Chenal A. Nizard P.

Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) except that yields were increased by growing overnight precultures at 25 °C. The T domains were purified from the soluble cytoplasmic fraction as described (9Montagner C. Perier A. Pichard S. Vernier G. Menez A. Gillet D. Forge V. Chenal A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1878-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to immobilized nickel affinity, size exclusion, and ion exchange chromatography. The purification buffer of the T domain was finally exchanged with NH4HCO3 on a G25SF column before lyophilization and storage at -20 °C. The molar epsilon used was 17,780 m-1·cm-1 at 280 nm, and the molecular mass was 21,860 g·mol-1.Lipid Vesicles—Suspensions of large unilamellar vesicles of anionic lipid bilayers at a lipid concentration of 10 mm were prepared in 5 mm citrate buffer at pH 7.5 with egg phosphatidylcholine and egg phosphatidic acid (Avantipolar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at a 9:1 molar ratio by reverse phase evaporation and filtration twice on 0.4-μm and four times on 0.2-μm filters (17Rigaud J.L.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As described previously (5Chenal A. Nizard P. Gillet D. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2002; 21: 321-358Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 8Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43425-43432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the T domain requires anionic lipids for membrane insertion at pH < 6. Zwitterionic lipids are sufficient for the binding step at pH ≥ 6. A 9:1 molar ratio of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidic acid was chosen, because it corresponds to the minimal anionic lipid content, allowing membrane insertion of the T domain.Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—CD experiments were performed on a J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (15Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteins were diluted in 5 mm sodium citrate buffer at the indicated pH 1 h before measurements. Protein concentration and pH were checked after measurements. For near UV and far UV measurements, each spectrum is the average of 20 scans and 10 scans, with proteins at concentrations of 20 and 5 μm, respectively. The spectra were corrected for the blank and were not smoothed. Spectra were treated as described previously (15Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Spectroscopy in Solution—Fluorescence measurements were performed with an FP-750 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (9Montagner C. Perier A. Pichard S. Vernier G. Menez A. Gillet D. Forge V. Chenal A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1878-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins were diluted at a concentration of 1 μm in 5 mm sodium citrate buffer, 200 mm NaCl at the indicated pH, 2 h before measurements. pH was checked after measurements. Maximum emission wavelength (λmax) and fluorescence intensity ratios at 360 nm over 320 nm (FI360/320) represent the average of three values obtained from emission spectra that were corrected for blank measurements. Values of pK1/2MG (pH of midtransition from the native to the MG state) were determined from curves of FI360/320 as a function of pH fitted with a two-state model: A + nH+ ⇐ AHn, where n is the number of protons and A and AH represent the native and molten globule states. The dissociation constant of the transition is given by Kn = [A][H+]n/[AHn]. The measured fluorescence signal S depends on the species composition at each pH value according to the following equation: S = Si + (Sf - Si) × fA with fA = A/(A + AHn) = 1/(1 + (AHn/A)) = 1/(1 + (H+/K)n). S is the signal used to monitor the reaction, Si and Sf are the initial and final values, respectively, [H+] is the proton concentration, K is the dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. Curves were fitted using Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).Fluorescence Spectroscopy in the Presence of LUV—The proteins at a concentration of 1 μm were mixed with LUV at a lipid/protein molar ratio of 500 in a 5 mm citrate buffer at the indicated pH. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 22 °C before measurements. pH values were always measured afterward. The two-step model we used to fit the experimental data from the mutant proteins is based on two consecutive Hill plots, using the same equation as described above. The parameters of the membrane penetration step were considered as constants (nH2 and pK2 from the second transition were taken from the WT T domain fitting results), whereas the parameters describing the binding step (nH1 and pK1 from the first transition) were fitted for each mutant. For physical binding measurements, samples were centrifuged in an L-70 ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Roissy, France) using a Ti 70.1 rotor at 60,000 rpm for 20 min at 22 °C to pellet the LUV. The fraction of bound proteins was determined as (F0 - F)/F0, where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of the sample before and after centrifugation.LUV Leakage Assay—Protein-induced permeabilization of LUV at pH 4 was measured using the ANTS/DPX assay. LUV were prepared in a 5 mm sodium citrate, 200 mm NaCl buffer at pH 7.5 containing 20 mm ANTS (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nonencapsulated ANTS was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Concentrated protein samples at pH 7.5 were diluted in a suspension of LUV in 5 mm sodium citrate, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm DPX (Molecular Probes) at pH 4 at 22 °C. Protein concentration was 9 nm at a lipid/protein molar ratio of 1000. The fluorescence decrease, due to the leakage of ANTS out of the LUV and its quenching by DPX, was recorded. Fluorescence measurements were performed by setting the emission at 516 nm and the excitation at 360 nm.RESULTSSecondary and Tertiary Structures of the Mutant T Domains in the Native and MG States—The T domain contains six His residues at positions 223, 251, 257, 322, 323, and 372 (Fig. 1). In order to investigate the effect of the absence of protonation of His residues on the behavior of the protein, 16 mutants of the T domain were produced in which single or multiple His residues were replaced by Phe (Table 1). The mutant T domains are numbered thereafter according to the mutated position(s). Phe was chosen because the shape and volume of its side chain are similar to those of a neutral His. Thus, it is the best amino acid to mimic a nonprotonable form of His. Among the six His residues of the T domain (Fig. 1), two pairs are located in loops. His223 between helices TH1 and TH2 is stacked with His257 located between helices TH3 and TH4. His322 and His323 are between helices TH7 and TH8. His251 and His372 are located in helices TH3 and TH9, respectively.TABLE 1Mutated positions, pK1/2MG, pK1/2B pK1, and pK2 (corresponding to membrane binding and membrane penetration monitored by fluorescence) for all mutant T domainsNumber of mutationsIn solutionWith membranesTrp fluorescencePhysical partitionTrp fluorescenceN > MGN > BN > BB > IpK1/2MGpK1/2BpK1pK2Twt05.36.56.45.2T22314.86.36.25.2T25114.756.26.155.2T25714.86.56.55.2T32215.36.16.45.2T323156.26.25.2T37215.26.46.45.2T223-25724.66.46.45.2T251-25724.26.16.15.2T322-323256.16.15.2T223-257-37234.46.356.45.2T223-251-25733.96.46.55.2T322-323-37234.766.15.2T223-257-322-32344.35.96.15.2T251-322-323-37244.35.6–5.2T223-257-322-323-37254.35.35.65.2TΔHis63.85.25.35.2 Open table in a new tab We studied by CD spectropolarimetry the secondary and tertiary structures of the mutant T domains at pH 7.5 at which the WT is in the native state (8Chenal A.

The far-UV CD spectra of all mutants (Fig. 2A and data not shown) were nearly identical to that of the WT T domain. They all indicated a secondary structure mainly composed of α-helices, in agreement with the crystal structure of the diphtheria toxin (6Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D.

Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The near UV CD spectra of the mutants were also very similar to that of the WT T domain (Fig. 2C) (data not shown). They all exhibited a band at 292 nm attributed to a Trp constrained in an organized tertiary structure (8Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol.

His251 is positioned at about 4 Å of Tyr278 in the tertiary structure. Its replacement by a Phe, which may induce constraints on Tyr278, may explain the appearance of this band.FIGURE 2Far UV (A and B) and near UV (C and D) CD spectra of a selection of mutant T domains in solution, at pH 7.5 or 3.5.

Measurements were all done at pH 3.5, which was necessary for some of the mutants to complete their transition (see below for the fluorescence results). The far-UV CD spectra of all the mutants were similar to that of the WT T domain (Fig. 2B) (data not shown). They indicated that all of the proteins retained most of their helical secondary structure. Near-UV CD spectra showed that the signal at 292 nm disappeared, indicating a loss of the tertiary constraints on the Trp (Fig. 2D) (data not shown). As shown previously, this loss of tertiary structure combined with the persistence of the secondary structure corresponds to the MG state of the T domain (8Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F.

Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Overall, the data suggested that all mutants were folded in a native-like conformation at neutral pH and adopted an MG state at acidic pH, similar to that of the WT T domain.His to Phe Mutations Shifted the Transition to the MG State toward Lower pH Values in an Additive Manner—The acid-induced conformational change of the mutant T domains was monitored by Trp fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The results were compared with those obtained with the WT T domain (Fig. 3A, closed circles). As described previously (8Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43425-43432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the spectra of the WT T domain in solution showed a red shift of the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) from 336 nm in the native state to 341 nm in the MG state. All mutants followed a transition toward higher λmax. The end of the transition corresponded to the MG state, in agreement with the results of the CD experiments described above. However, this transition occurred at lower pH for practically all mutants to various extents (Fig. 3 and Table 1). In the case of TΔHis, in which all His residues were mutated, this transition was strongly altered with a shift of λmax from 332 to 336 nm. This suggested that the Trp remained in a rather apolar environment despite the release of tertiary constraints revealed by the near UV CD spectra.FIGURE 3Effect of His to Phe mutations on the transition of the T domain from the native state to the MG state monitored by Trp fluorescence.

The pH values of midtransition from the native to the MG state ( pK1/2MG) found for the corresponding mutants were 4.8, 4.75, and 4.8, respectively, whereas the pK1/2MG was 5.3 for the WT T domain. Mutations 323 and 372 had moderate effects with pK1/2MG of 5 and 5.2, respectively. The pK1/2MG of the mutant T322 was the same as for the WT T domain.The combination of mutations within the T domain had cumulative effects (Fig. 3 and Table 1). A correlation was observed between the number of mutations carried by the protein and the pK1/2MG, the maximum effect being observed for the mutant TΔHis with pK1/2MG = 3.8. However, as for the proteins bearing a single mutation, the addition of any of the mutations 223, 251, and 257 had an effect on the pK1/2MG stronger than that of the mutations 322, 323, and 372. Remarkably, the triple mutant T223-251-257 had a pK1/2MG similar to that of TΔHis.These results indicated that the protonation of all of the His residues of the T domain were implicated in the formation of the MG state in solution, with a preponderant role for His223, His251, and His257.His to Phe Mutations Shifted Membrane Binding, but Not Membrane Penetration, toward Lower pH Values in an Additive Manner—We studied the interaction of the mutant T domains with anionic LUV as a function of pH. The interaction was monitored by centrifugation and Trp fluorescence. All mutants interacted with the membrane according to the two-step process found for the WT T domain (8Chenal A. Savarin P.

A first transition corresponding to membrane binding was detected by centrifugation (Fig. 4, closed circles) and by a change of fluorescence λmax (Fig. 4, open circles), from 336 to 344 nm for the WT T domain (Fig. 4A). A second transition corresponding to penetration into the bilayer was characterized by a decrease of λmax (Fig. 4, open circles), from 344 to 332 nm for the WT T domain (Fig. 4A). LUV permeabilization was found to accompany membrane penetration (8Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol.

If this were the case, the alteration of the fluorescence transition pattern found for these mutants could be explained by the only shift of the first transition, which would mask the second transition. We designed a fitting model to evaluate the validity of this interpretation. For all mutants, we fitted the data of the second transition with the same parameters (pK and nH) taken from the WT T domain fitting curve (see “Experimental Procedures”). Then for each mutant, we determined the value of these parameters for the first transition. These values (Table 1) reproduced well the experimental data (Fig. 4). Thus, the model strongly supported the observation suggesting that the mutations affected membrane binding but not membrane penetration. We propose that as soon as the membrane-bound state started to be populated (i.e. at a pH below 6), the second transition occurred simultaneously and reached the level of membrane penetration found for the WT T domain at this pH value. In other words, the membrane-bound state could not be observed in these steady-state experiments.The shift of the pK1/2B (the pH of midtransition from the soluble to the membrane-bound state) was strongest for mutations 251, 322, and 323, with pK1/2B of 6.2, 6.1, and 6.2, respectively, whereas the pK1/2B of the WT T domain was 6.5 (Fig. 4F and Table 1). Mutations 223 and 372 led to shifts of pK1/2B of 6.3 and 6.4, respectively. Mutation 257 had no effect. Thus, the data clearly indicated that the protonation of His251, His322, and His323 was important for triggering the binding of the protein to the membrane.The combination of mutations had cumulative effects (Fig. 4F and Table 1). Correlations were observed between the number of mutations carried by the protein and the pK1/2B, the maximum effect being observed for the mutant TΔHis with pK1/2B = 5.2. The proteins combining the mutations 322 and 323 (Fig. 4F, squares) or the mutation 251 (Fig. 4F, diamonds) exhibited a shift of pK1/2B stronger than that of proteins combining mutations 223 and 257 (Fig. 4F, circles) and 372 (Fig. 4F, triangle). As illustrated in Fig. 6, a correlation was found between the pK1/2MG and pK1/2B values for proteins carrying the mutations 322 and 323 (Fig. 6, squares). In contrast, the mutations 223 and 257, which had an effect on MG formation had no effect on membrane binding (Fig. 6, circles). This sugges"

Engagement of PRRs elicits a wide variety of responses, including the production and release of cytokines and chemokines. These responses require the activation of several parallel signaling pathways, including NF-κB, the interferon regulatory factors, and the MAPKs. The JNK and p38 MAPK groups are major PRR effectors and are key to the PRR-dependent induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-8. The mammalian Ste20 orthologue germinal center kinase (GCK) is required for the activation of JNK by a subset of PAMPs; however, the mechanisms by which GCK couples to downstream events remain unclear. Here we show that GCK is required for JNK and, unexpectedly, p38 activation by three bacterial PAMPs, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and flagellin (FliC). We show that these same PAMPs, in a GCK-dependent manner, activate mixed lineage kinases-2 and -3, MAPK kinase kinases upstream of JNK, and p38. We also show that MLK2 and -3 are required for activation of JNK and p38 by ectopically expressed GCK. Finally, we show that MLK2 and -3 are required for lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and FliC recruitment of JNK and p38 as well as for PAMP recruitment of the transcription factor c-Jun, and for the induction of interleukin-8.

Multicellular organisms must constantly maintain a vigilant defense against an environment rich in pathogenic microorganisms. These defense mechanisms are remarkably conserved among multicellular organisms and are referred to as innate immunity (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J.

PRRs can also be activated by some host cell proteins (e.g. oxidized low density lipoprotein in atherogenesis) and by the metabolic by-products of dying cells (e.g. deposition of crystalline sodium urate, as occurs in gout) (4Meylan E.

Recruitment of PRRs elicits a dramatic and often self-reinforcing proinflammatory process that includes cytokine and chemokine release, fever, and, in extreme systemic cases, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Triggering of the innate immune response also elicits the activation of the acquired immune system (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J.

Two broad classes of PRRs have been identified as follows: the transmembrane toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the cytosolic PRRs, which include the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain/leucine-rich repeat proteins (NOD-LRRs) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene-like helicases (RLHs) (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 352-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 4Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). LPS produced by Gram-negative bacteria recruits TLR4. TLR2 is activated by bacterial peptidoglycans (PGNs), whereas TLR5 responds to bacterial flagellin. The NOD-LRRs and RLHs are thought to recognize PAMPs produced by microbial pathogens that invade the cytosol (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 352-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 4Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding/oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2), mutations that have been linked to Crohn disease, is a NOD-LRR protein that recognizes cytosolic PGN and, along with TLR2, contributes significantly to the innate immune response to PGNs. Naip5 (neuronal inhibitor of apoptosis-5) is a second NOD-LRR protein that is likely a cytosolic flagellin receptor. A subset of the RLHs recognizes viral DNA and RNA (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 352-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 4Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M.

Neither the PRRs, the NOD-LRRs, nor the RLHs possess ligand-induced enzymatic activity that is relevant to signaling. Instead, these receptors signal via the signal-dependent recruitment of additional cytosolic polypeptides. The intracellular extensions of TLRs and the IL-1 receptor contain a TLR/IL-1 receptor (TIR) motif; and upon receptor occupancy, these TIR motifs bind to TIR motifs on a suite of cytosolic adapter proteins that relay the signals to downstream components. For example, myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) and TIR-associated protein (TIRAP) are two such adapters that are necessary for optimal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation by TLR4 (1Creagh E.M.

MyD88, at the receptor complex, binds to proteins of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. IRAKs, in turn, bind to another adapter, TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 also recruits proximal elements in MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Cytosolic PRR signaling is much more poorly understood; however, adapters of the receptor-interacting protein, IRAK, and TRAF family have been linked to these receptors (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J.

The MAPKs represent key signaling intermediates in the cellular responses to PAMPs. Of particular note, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK groups collaborate to recruit the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 352-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 8Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a heterodimer that consists of c-Jun coupled with either c-Fos, other members of the Jun family (JunB and D), or members of the activating transcription factor (ATF) family (9Karin M. Liu Z-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). AP-1 activation is critical to PAMP-induced cytokine and chemokine gene expression (TNF, IL-1, IL-8, IL-12, etc.), as well as the expression of cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II), and the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules (E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 for example) (9Karin M.

MAPKs act not only at the transcriptional level but, especially in the case of p38s, at the post-transcriptional level where they function in the signal-induced stabilization of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs that contain A/U-rich elements (13Dean J.L.E. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Gene disruption studies indicate that TRAF6 is key to the recruitment by PAMPs of the MAPKs (14Lomaga M.A. Yeh W-C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). However, a clear picture of how TRAF6, or other TRAFs for that matter, couples to MAPKs is still elusive. MAPKs are activated by MAP3K → MAPK kinase (MKK) → MAPK core pathways. It is clear that MKK-3 and -6, upstream of p38, and MKK-4 and -7, upstream of the JNKs, as well as the ERK-specific MKKs MEK1 and -2 are key to PAMP signaling (1Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A.J.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar). Proximal to these MKKs, several MAP3Ks have been variously linked to MAPK signaling. Several studies indicate that PAMP (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) activation of ERK requires the MAP3K tumor progression locus-2 (Tpl2) (15Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamakis K.

Some studies have linked transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and MAPK kinase kinase-3 (MEKK3), MAP3Ks upstream of the JNKs and p38s, to PAMP signaling, at least in fibroblasts and lymphocytes (16Sato A.

Immun. 2004; 5: 98-103Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A role for TAK1 in the responses of critical innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes to PAMPs has not been established. MAP3Ks of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family, especially MLK3, are potent activators of MKK-4 and -7 upstream of JNK and MKK6 upstream of p38. MLK3 has been linked to cytokine recruitment of JNK and p38 (8Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar, 19Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but a role for the MLKs in PAMP signaling has also not yet been demonstrated. Moreover, the mechanisms by which these MAP3Ks are activated are still unknown. Germinal center kinase (GCK) is the founding member of a group of protein kinases, the GCKs, whose amino-terminal kinase domains are distantly homologous to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae STE20 (20Kyriakis J.M.

The carboxyl-terminal regulatory regions of GCK are highly divergent; and genetic and biochemical studies implicate the GCKs in a broad range of functions, including inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (20Kyriakis J.M.

Experiments using transfection and overexpression indicated that GCK could selectively activate the JNKs, but not the p38s, ERKs, or NF-κB (25Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sánchez I. Katz P. Avruch J.

Our early RNAi studies indicated that although GCK was activated by PAMPs (LPS, PGN, and poly(I-C), a PAMP that mimics viral RNA), as well as by TNF, IL-1, and CD40, it was apparently only required for JNK activation by LPS and PGN (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recruitment of other MAPKs was not examined in detail (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GCK is constitutively active catalytically, and the kinase activity is required for GCK ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent proteolytic degradation. Regulation of GCK involves a transient inhibition of the degradation of ubiquitinated GCK. This process is mediated by the stimulus-dependent binding of GCK to TRAF6 and by the binding of GCK to the MAP3K MEKK1 (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These events sequester GCK from the proteasome and enable accumulation of GCK polypeptide and consequent GCK-dependent signaling. Thus, although GCK can activate MEKK1 in vitro (26Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), MEKK1 is likely to function more as a stabilizer of GCK in situ (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GCK can also activate recombinant MLK3 in vitro (26Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but the physiologic significance of MLK3 to GCK signaling has, until now, remained unclear. Accordingly, we sought to dissect further the signaling pathways by which PAMPs, through GCK, recruit MAPK pathways. Our findings reveal that GCK is activated by at least three PAMPs, LPS, PGN, and bacterial flagellin (FliC; in this paper FliC was derived from Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli), and that GCK signals through MLK2 and -3 to recruit the JNKs p38 and their effectors. Our results point to an important role for GCK and the MLKs in PAMP-stimulated MAPK pathway activation. Cells and Treatments—Jurkat human T lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum as described (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell.

LPS (Calbiochem, highly purified from E. coli serotype 0111:B4) and PGN (Staphylococcus aureus) were each used at 1 μg/ml for the times indicated in the figures. Recombinant FliC (His-tagged, from O113:H21 Shiga-toxigenic E. coli strain 98NK2, purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose) and heat-inactivated FliC (50 °C, 4 h, negative control) were kindly provided by Dr. Cheleste Thorpe (Tufts-New England Medical Center) and were used at 100 ng/ml each for the times indicated in the figures. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Assays—Full-length FLAG-GCK as well as deletion constructs of FLAG-GCK have been described (26Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell.

GST-tagged mammalian expression constructs of full-length and truncated MLK3 were prepared by PCR cloning into the pEBG vector. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.

Phospho-specific and conventional antibodies for JNK, p38, and ERK were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anti-GCK, MLK2, and MLK3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG was from Sigma. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were as described (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell.

Immunoblots were quantified with the Image J software package (Macintosh platform). Protein kinase assays for MLK3, JNK, and p38 have been described (19Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat.

RNA Interference—siRNA-dependent RNAi was performed on Jurkat cells as described (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The primary GCK sense siRNA used was 5′-GGUGCAUAUGGGCGCCUGC-3′. The alternative sense GCK siRNA was 5′-CCCCUACACGGGUGCCACC-3′. The primary human sense MLK3 siRNA was 5′-GCGCGAGAUCCAGGGUCUC-3′. The alternative sense human MLK3 siRNA oligonucleotide was 5′-GCUGGAGAUUCAGCACAUG-3′. The primary human sense MLK2 siRNA oligonucleotide was 5′-GCUGGAGAUUCAGCACAUG-3′. The alternative sense MLK2 oligonucleotide was 5′-AAGCAGUGAUGUCUGGAGC-3′. All oligonucleotides were constructed with 3′-dTdT overhangs. In all instances, complementary strands (not shown), also with 3′-dTdT overhangs, were routinely synthesized for conventional siRNA-based RNAi approaches. Alternative siRNA sequences were used where indicated in the figures/legends (for LPS-treated cells). Otherwise, the primary sequences were used. For negative controls, a nonspecific control siRNA (for green fluorescent protein, Dharmacon, Inc.) was employed. Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed as described (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The human IL-8 primers were forward, ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT, and reverse, TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC. The β-actin control primers were forward, GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA, and reverse, CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC. LPS, PGN, and FliC Recruitment of JNK and p38 but Not ERK Requires GCK—We have shown previously that the activation of JNK by LPS and PGN requires GCK (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the activation of other MAPKs required GCK. Accordingly, Jurkat human T lymphoma cells were subjected to GCK RNAi, and the cells were treated with LPS (Fig. 1, A and B), PGN (Fig. 1C), or FliC (Fig. 1D) for the times indicated. MAPK activation was monitored by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. As a control for FliC signaling, we exploited a heat-inactivated preparation of FliC protein. As is evident from Fig. 1, all three PAMPs trigger the characteristic (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) time-dependent stabilization of GCK, which is typically maximal within 3 min. This stabilization is closely followed by activation of all three MAPKs, with PGN and FliC producing a particularly robust response. Activation of the MAPKs is maximal at between 10 and 30 min. Heat-inactivated FliC produces none of these responses. Silencing of gck substantially impairs JNK and p38 but not ERK activation by all three agonists. Thus, GCK is important for both JNK and p38 activation by these three PAMPs but is dispensable for ERK activation. A second gck-specific RNAi produces identical results (Fig. 1, A versus B), ruling out off-target effects. MLK2 and -3 Are Activated by PAMPs (LPS, FliC), Activation Requires GCK—The mechanisms by which GCK couples to MAPKs is unknown. Our previous studies indicated that GCK could activate the MAP3Ks MEKK1 and MLK3 but not MEKK3 in vitro (26Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, MEKK1 appears to function in the stabilization of GCK, rather than as a downstream effector (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MLK3 and the closely related MLK2 contain amino-terminal Src homology 3 domains and can recruit both JNK and p38 (at least in overexpression studies). The carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of GCK contains several proline-rich consensus SH3 interaction motifs and recombinant GCK and MLK3 interact in situ (20Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 26Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). With these observations in mind, we asked if PAMPs could activate endogenous MLK3 in a GCK-dependent manner. Thus, gck was silenced as above, and cells were treated with LPS (Fig. 2, A and C) or FliC (Fig. 2B) for the indicated times. MLK3 (Fig. 2, A and B) or MLK2 (Fig. 2C) was immunoprecipitated and assayed for phosphorylation of a model substrate (biotinylated MEK1; see Ref. 19Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). From Fig. 2, it is evident that LPS and FliC trigger the characteristic (22Zhong J. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) stabilization of GCK, first detectable at 1 min of stimulation and reaching a maximum by 3 min. Both MLK3 and -2 are activated by LPS, and MLK3 is also activated by FliC. In each case, activation is first detected at 1 min, and reaches a maximum at 10 min of stimulation. As with JNK and p38 activation, MLK3 and MLK2 activation by PAMPs is strikingly impaired upon silencing of gck. Thus, optimal MLK2/3 activation by LPS, PGN, and FliC requires GCK. In further support of the idea that MLK2 and -3 are GCK effectors, we find that ectopic expression of GCK activates JNK and p38 in a manner completely ablated upon contemporaneous silencing of mlk2 and mlk3. Thus, 293 cells were subjected to siRNA-dependent RNAi of either mlk2, mlk3, or both. Cells were then transfected with either vector or GCK and either JNK or p38. JNK and p38 were then recovered by immunoprecipitation and assayed in vitro for phosphorylation of the substrate proteins c-Jun or activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2), respectively (Fig. 3). From Fig. 3A, it is evident that ectopically expressed GCK triggers a substantial activation of coexpressed JNK. This is only moderately affected upon silencing of mlk2 or mlk3 individually. However, contemporaneous silencing of both mlk2 and mlk3 abolishes GCK activation of coexpressed JNK. Activation of p38 by GCK also requires MLK2 and -3 (Fig. 3B). That ectopic GCK was able to activate p38 was surprising insofar as our previous studies (25Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sánchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) indicated that GCK was selective for the JNKs. However, subsequent work has shown that MLK3 and -2 can activate the p38 pathway (28Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Of note, we consistently do not observe ERK or NF-κB activation"
https://openalex.org/W1977170422,"Many of the biological functions of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans can be attributed to specialized structures within HS moieties, which are thought to modulate binding and function of various effector proteins. Cyclophilin B (CyPB), which was initially identified as a cyclosporin A-binding protein, triggers migration and integrin-mediated adhesion of peripheral blood T lymphocytes by a mechanism dependent on interaction with cell surface HS. Here we determined the structural features of HS that are responsible for the specific binding of CyPB. In addition to the involvement of 2-O,6-O, and N-sulfate groups, we also demonstrated that binding of CyPB was dependent on the presence of N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues (GlcNH2), which have been reported to be precursors for sulfation by 3-O-sulfotransferases-3 (3-OST-3). Interestingly, 3-OST-3B isoform was found to be the main 3-OST isoenzyme expressed in peripheral blood T lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells. Moreover, down-regulation of the expression of 3-OST-3 by RNA interference potently reduced CyPB binding and consequent activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Altogether, our results strongly support the hypothesis that 3-O-sulfation of GlcNH2 residues could be a key modification that provides specialized HS structures for CyPB binding to responsive cells. Given that 3-O-sulfation of GlcNH2-containing HS by 3-OST-3 also provides binding sites for glycoprotein gD of herpes simplex virus type I, these findings suggest an intriguing structural linkage between the HS sequences involved in CyPB binding and viral infection.

These interactions are mediated mainly via the HS moieties of the proteoglycans, which bind to growth factors, cytokines, matrix components, enzymes, and enzyme inhibitors and thereby regulate tissue distribution, biological availability, and activity of the proteins. Characterization of heparin/HS oligosaccharides with high affinity to proteins such as antithrombin and growth factors has led to the identification of specialized protein binding domains with structural features exhibiting varying degrees of specificity (1Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 2Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 3Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 390-412Crossref Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The structural distinctions in these functional heparin/HS domains are derived from enzymatic modifications in the Golgi apparatus of the nascent polymer composed of alternating d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetylated d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units. The nonsulfated precursor is first subject to partial N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, which leads to the occurrence of consecutively N-sulfated regions, regions that escape modification and remains N-acetylated, and regions of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units. Sometimes, the N-deacetylation/N-sulfation reaction is partial, giving rise to N-unsubstituted glucosamine units (GlcNH2). The further modification reactions include C5 epimerization of some GlcUA into l-iduronic acid (IdoUA), 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA, and 6-O-sulfation of GlcN units. Rarely, O-sulfation also occurs at position 2 of GlcUA and at position 3 of N-sulfated GlcN (GlcNS) and of GlcNH2 units, the latter modifications are hallmarks for the respective binding HS domains of antithrombin and glycoprotein gD of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-I). These modifications are regulated by HS biosynthetic enzymes, including N-deacetylases/N-sulfotranferases, 2-O-sulfotransferase (2-OST), 3-O-sulfotransferases (3-OST), 6-O-sulfotransferases (6-OST), and C5-epimerase. Importantly, spatially and temporary coordinated modifications of nascent HS precursor by these enzymes are thought to control the activities of HS-binding proteins, presumably through the interactions with structurally distinct HS species from different cell types and tissue loci (3Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 390-412Crossref Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 4Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, immunohistochemical studies of tissues with antibodies to HS epitopes have demonstrated differences within HS in distinct cellular environments (5van den Born J. Salmivirta K. Henttinen T. Ostman N. Ishimaru T. Miyaura S. Yoshida K. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20516-20523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Structural characterization of the binding heparin/HS domain of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) has illustrated the importance of contiguous stretches of the disulfated disaccharide IdoUA2S-GlcNS ± 6S for efficient interaction. Surprisingly, experimental data have demonstrated that 6-O-sulfation of GlcNS, although not directly involved in the binding of the protein to heparin/HS, is an absolute requirement for proliferative activity of FGF-2 (6Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structural heterogeneity of HS could explain the remarkable tissue-specific activities of FGF-2, with regard to the ability of HS to form active complexes with the protein and its cognate signaling receptor on responsive cells (8Allen B.L. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Another example of binding heparin/HS domain specifically involved in protein interaction is the well defined pentasaccharide required for the binding and activity of antithrombin-III. The most distinguishing feature of this motif is the unusual 3-O-sulfated GlcNS unit, which is essential for high affinity binding of antithrombin and anti-coagulant activity (9Shworak N.W. Liu J.

Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).With regard to the ability of HS domains to form active complexes with extracellular soluble mediators, it could be hypothesized that many of the regulatory functions attributed to proteoglycans may actually be related to the interactions with cell-specific HS species. A class of recently identified inflammatory mediators is secreted cyclophilins (11Allain F. Vanpouille C. Carpentier M. Slomianny M-C. Durieux S. Spik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2006; 177: 4870-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which are mostly known as cyclosporin A-binding proteins (15Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 16Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that cyclophilin B (CyPB) triggers chemotaxis and integrin-mediated adhesion of T lymphocytes mainly of the CD4+/CD45RO+ phenotype (11Allain F. Vanpouille C. Carpentier M. Slomianny M-C. Durieux S. Spik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2714-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These activities are dependent on the interactions with two types of binding sites, CD147 and cell surface HS. By using site-directed mutated ligands, we demonstrated that the peptides 3KKK5 and 14YFD16, which are located in the N-terminal extension of CyPB, are required for efficient binding of CyPB to heparin and cell surface HS expressed on T cells (17Carpentier M. Allain F. Haendler B. Denys A. Mariller C. Benaiössa M. Spik G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CyPBKKK-, for which the sequence 3KKK5 was replaced by AAA, and CyPBΔYFD, which corresponds to the protein depleted of the sequence 14YFD16, were both deficient in their capability to induce cell adhesion to fibronectin (18Carpentier M. Allain F. Slomianny M-C. Durieux S. Vanpouille C. Haendler B. Spik G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5222-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Most recently, we found that octasaccharides are the minimal length unit required for efficient binding of CyPB to heparin and cell surface HS of T lymphocytes. Molecular modeling confirmed that 3KKK5 and 14YFD16 tripeptides were spatially arranged in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, so that they may act synergistically to form a binding site for an octasaccharide (19Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, an intriguing possibility is that the pro-migratory activity of CyPB may be dependent on interaction with specific binding HS domain present at the cell surface of responsive T cells.The focus of this study was to characterize structural features within cell surface HS, which could explain the specific interaction with CyPB. Heparin is structurally related to the sulfated regions of HS, and we demonstrated that heparin and cell surface HS of T lymphocytes share the same capability to interact with CyPB (20Denys A. Allain F. Carpentier M. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, heparin and chemically modified derivatives were used to determine the structural features within HS for optimal CyPB binding. In addition to the requirement of N- and O-sulfate groups, which is a common feature for binding of numerous heparin-binding proteins, we demonstrated that interaction of CyPB with heparin/HS was strictly dependent on the presence of GlcNH2 residues. 3-OST are represented by seven distinct isoenzymes that are expressed at distinct levels in various human tissues, suggesting their involvement in making tissue-specific HS with different biological functions (9Shworak N.W.

Interestingly, certain isoforms of 3-OST have been reported to sulfate GlcNH2-containing disaccharides within HS (23Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

Therefore, we explored the relationships between the expression of multiple 3-OST isoforms and the responses triggered by CyPB binding to T cells. Our results suggest an intriguing implication of the GlcNH2 residue and 3-O-sulfation by 3-OST3B isoform in efficient binding of CyPB to responsive T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cells—Human recombinant CyPB and FGF-2 were produced and purified as described (25Ke L.D.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Heparin-derived octasaccharides were prepared from partial heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7) digests of pig mucosal heparin (Sigma), as described (19Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the main dissacharide unit (>75%) being IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S. Biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated to heparin via its reducing end was purchased from Sigma. N-Desulfated, N-desulfated N-reacetylated, and N-acetylated heparin derivatives were produced as described (27Wei Z. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15742-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 2-O-Desulfated and 6-O-desulfated heparins were a generous gift from B. Mulloy (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Herts, UK). Cell surface HS were purified from peripheral blood T lymphocytes as described (19Vanpouille C. Denys A. Carpentier M. Pakula R. Mazurier J. Allain F. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell surface proteoglycans were purified by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and treated by enzymatic digestion of anionic contaminants by sequential treatments with chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1), and neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18) (all enzymes from Sigma). Glycopeptides were then obtained by digestion with Pronase E (EC 3.4.24.4) (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C and subjected to nonreductive β-elimination. The liberated glycosylamines were converted in reducing oligosaccharides through the addition of boric acid and freeze-dried before use. Reagents for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. The pan-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) antibodies, which recognize p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) regardless of their phosphorylation status, and the antibodies to phosphorylated forms of p44/42 MAPK were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Secondary peroxidase-labeled anti-IgG antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals, except where otherwise mentioned, were purchased from Sigma.Human citrated venous blood samples were obtained from the local blood transfusion center (Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine, Lille, France). Isolation of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes was conducted by exhaustive negative selection as described (11Allain F. Vanpouille C. Carpentier M. Slomianny M-C. Durieux S. Spik G. Proc. Natl.

The purity of the CD4+ T cell population was assessed by flow cytofluorimetry and found to be >95%. Heparinase-treated T lymphocytes were obtained by incubating cells with 0.75 unit of heparinase I/106 cells for 2 h at 37 °C (11Allain F. Vanpouille C. Carpentier M. Slomianny M-C. Durieux S. Spik G.

Human lymphoblastic Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1, ATCC TIB-152) and promonocytic leukemia THP-1 cells (88081201, ECACC, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK) were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm gentamycin, in a 5% CO2-enriched atmosphere at 37 °C. To induce responsiveness to CyPB, THP-1 cells were differentiated for 72 h with 50 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, as described (29Pakula R. Melchior A. Denys A. Vanpouille C. Mazurier J. Allain F. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human epithelial carcinoma HeLa cells (ATCC-CCL2) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and gentamycin, as above.Biotinylation of Heparin and Oligosaccharides—N-Hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin (Pierce) was used to biotinylate heparin through internal free amino groups, as described (30Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). According to the manufacturer (Sigma), biotinylated heparin-BSA contains 50% (w/w) heparin and 3-5 biotin residues per molecule of conjugate. Heparin chains were linked via reductive amination of the terminal reducing sugar to BSA with a hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagent, and conjugation of biotin to the albumin moiety was performed via biotinamidocaproic acid (31Sasaki H. Hayashi A. Kitagaki-Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. Seno N. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 400: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To check whether biotinylation did not lead to partial derivatization of free amino groups of heparin, we quantified the amount of biotin residues that are distributed between glycanic and protein moieties of heparin-BSA conjugate, by using 4′-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid. Briefly, biotinylated heparin-BSA conjugate was treated with either 0.75 unit/ml heparinase I or 1% Pronase (w/v) overnight at 37 °C, in order to liberate biotin residues that would be covalently linked to heparin or albumin moieties, respectively. Products of enzymatic digestion were then separated from not degraded material by gel filtration, and the amount of biotin in solution was determined by competition with known amounts of 4′-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid bound to avidin, according to the protocol provided by Pierce. As expected, biotin residues were only recovered in the Pronase-sensitive fraction, indicating that the procedure of biotinylation of heparin-BSA conjugate has only modified primary amino groups of some lysine residues in the albumin moiety. Therefore, this type of chemical linkage would allow access of ligands to the full length of the glycanic polymer and provide heparin biosensor surfaces with high binding capacity. Heparin-derived oligosaccharides were biotinylated at their reducing ends, as described in Ref. 32Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 235-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, oligosaccharides and biotin-X-X-hydrazide (Calbiochem) were allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature. Unreacted biotin reagent was removed by ion exchange chromatography, and successful biotinylation of oligosaccharides was confirmed by a dot-plot procedure (32Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 235-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Immobilization of Heparin and Oligosaccharides—Streptavidin was immobilized on planar aminosilane surfaces according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (IAsys, Neosensors, Durham, UK) and then allowed to react with biotinylated derivatives. Glycosaminoglycans give a variable and poor response in optical biosensors (32Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 235-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kinsella L. Chen H.L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj.

Therefore, the amount of biotinylated molecules immobilized onto the cuvettes was titrated indirectly by measuring the response to a concentration of HGF above the Kd value (35Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Delehedde M. Lyon M. Vidyasagar R. McDonnell T.J. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12456-12462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sufficient amounts of each size of oligosaccharides or heparin were immobilized to yield a response of no more than 100 arc seconds (600 arc seconds corresponds to 1 ng of protein/mm2 of the cuvette surface) in the presence of 25 nm HGF. The distribution of bound HGF, and by inference immobilized heparin or oligosaccharides on the surface of the biosensor cuvette, was inspected by examination of the resonance scan in the course of the association phase of binding reactions. This allowed showing that at all times HGF was distributed uniformly on the sensor surface and therefore was not aggregated. In addition, controls demonstrated that in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-T, phosphate buffered saline/Tween 20), CyPB, FGF-2, or HGF did not bind to aminosilane surface or to a streptavidin surface derivatized with biotin hydrazide (results not shown).Optical Biosensor Binding Assays—A binding assay consisted of adding the ligands at a known concentration in 5 μl of PBS-T into a cuvette containing either heparin- or oligosaccharide-derivatized aminosilane surface equilibrated in 45 μl of PBS-T. The association reaction was followed over 250 s. The cuvette was then washed three times with 50 μl of PBS-T, and the dissociation of bound ligand into the bulk PBS-T was followed over time. The surface was regenerated by washing twice with 50 μl of 2 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.2. All biosensor experiments were carried out at least three times on at least two different surfaces. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the binding reactions as described previously (30Rahmoune H. Chen H.L. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7303-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 32Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A single binding assay yielded four binding parameters as follows: the initial rate of association, the on-rate constant (kon), and the extent of binding, all calculated from the association phase, and the off-rate constant (koff), calculated from the dissociation phase. To avoid artifactual second phase binding due either to rates of diffusion of soluble ligands approaching or exceeding the rate of association or to steric hindrance at the binding surface, kon was only determined at low concentrations of ligands, whereas koff was preferentially measured in separate experiments, using higher concentrations of CyPB and competing heparin (100 μg/ml) in the dissociation buffer to avoid any rebinding artifacts (34Fernig D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 505-518PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated both from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants and, independently, from the extent of binding at the equilibrium in order to provide an estimate of the self-consistency of the results. A single binding site model fitted the data at least as well as a two-site binding model in both the competitive binding assays and the kinetic experiments. Therefore, the binding reaction between the ligands and immobilized heparin was deemed to be monophasic, and a single site model was used to calculate all binding parameters using the nonlinear curve fitting FastFit software (Neosensors). In competitive binding assays, an aminosilane cuvette derivatized with biotinylated BSA-heparin was used with a customized program for the Iasys Auto+ instrument (Neosensors). The cuvette was equilibrated at 20 °C in 40 μl of PBS-T, and 5 μl of the relevant dilutions of chemically modified heparins in PBS-T was added. Once the base line was stable, 5 μl of CyPB was added to initiate the association phase. The binding reaction was continued for 5 min. The surface was washed three times with 50 μl of PBS-T and was regenerated with 2 m NaCl. No change was detected in the amount of CyPB bound to immobilized heparin in the absence of competing heparin derivatives at the start and the end of the experiments. The extent of binding was calculated by fitting the association curve to a single site binding model using the nonlinear curve fitting FastFit software.Deaminative Cleavage of Heparin/HS with Nitrous Acid—To affect N-unsubstituted or N-sulfated GlcN residues, heparin, cell surface HS, and heparin-derived octasaccharides were cleaved with nitrous acid at high pH (pH 4.0) or at low pH (pH 1.5), respectively (37Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In both reactions, freshly prepared reagent was added to the dry oligosaccharide sample and incubated for the indicated times at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of saturated Na2CO3 solution, and the cleavage products were desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). To separate CyPB-specific and nonspecific octasaccharides, heparin-derived octasaccharides were incubated with CyPB in 20 mm phosphate, 400 mm NaCl buffer, and the complexes formed by the association of the protein with specific octasaccharides were purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. Following desalting, specifically bound octasaccharides were eluted from the complex by incubation overnight with 1 m NaCl, desalted, and dried under vacuum. In some experiments, octasaccharides were labeled with the fluorescent probe 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) at the reducing end and then treated with nitrous acid. Fluorescent derivatization was performed by reductive amination as described previously (19Vanpouill"
https://openalex.org/W2041073972,"Microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase-alpha (G6Pase-alpha) and glucose 6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) work together to increase blood glucose concentrations by performing the terminal step in both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Deficiency of the G6PT in liver gives rise to glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD1b), whereas deficiency of G6Pase-alpha leads to GSD1a. G6Pase-alpha shares its substrate (glucose 6-phosphate; G6P) with hexose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (H6PDH), a microsomal enzyme that regenerates NADPH within the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, thereby conferring reductase activity upon 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1). 11beta-HSD1 interconverts hormonally active C11beta-hydroxy steroids (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents) to inactive C11-oxo steroids (cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, respectively). In vivo reductase activity predominates, generating active glucocorticoid. We hypothesized that substrate (G6P) availability to H6PDH in patients with GSD1b and GSD1a will decrease or increase 11beta-HSD1 reductase activity, respectively. We investigated 11beta-HSD1 activity in GSD1b and GSD1a mice and in two patients with GSD1b and five patients diagnosed with GSD1a. We confirmed our hypothesis by assessing 11beta-HSD1 in vivo and in vitro, revealing a significant decrease in reductase activity in GSD1b animals and patients, whereas GSD1a patients showed a marked increase in activity. The cellular trafficking of G6P therefore directly regulates 11beta-HSD1 reductase activity and provides a novel link between glucose metabolism and function of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis."

Here we report that local application of glutamate or glutamine synthetase inhibitors induces astrocytic release of glutamate, which activates a slowly decaying transient inward current (SIC) in CA1 pyramidal neurons and a transient inward current in astrocytes in hippocampal slices. The occurrence of SICs was accompanied by an appearance of large vesicles around the puffing pipette. The frequency of SICs was positively correlated with [glutamate]o. EM imaging of anti-glial fibrillary acid protein-labeled astrocytes showed glutamate-induced large astrocytic vesicles. Imaging of FM 1-43 fluorescence using two-photon laser scanning microscopy detected glutamate-induced formation and fusion of large vesicles identified as FM 1-43-negative structures. Fusion of large vesicles, monitored by collapse of vesicles with a high intensity FM 1-43 stain in the vesicular membrane, coincided with SICs. Glutamate induced two types of large vesicles with high and low intravesicular [Ca2+]. The high [Ca2+] vesicle plays a major role in astrocytic release of glutamate. Vesicular fusion was blocked by infusing the Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, or the SNARE blocker, tetanus toxin, suggesting Ca2+- and SNARE-dependent fusion. Infusion of the vesicular glutamate transport inhibitor, Rose Bengal, reduced astrocytic glutamate release, suggesting the involvement of vesicular glutamate transports in vesicular transport of glutamate. Our results demonstrate that local [glutamate]o increases induce formation and exocytotic fusion of glutamate-containing large astrocytic vesicles.

Besides transient astrocytic glutamate release (∼1 s), a long lasting release of glutamate (several 10 s) from astrocytes has also been reported (7Angulo M.C. Kozlov A.S. Charpak S. Audinat E. J.

Transient astrocytic glutamate release could play important roles in modulating neuronal activities under both physiological and pathological conditions (26Kang N. Xu J. Xu Q. Nedergaard M. Kang J. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Carmignoto G. Fellin T. J. Physiol. (Paris). 2006; 99: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Tian G.F.

In a previous study, we reported that either bath application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or infusion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) together with high [glutamate] into astrocytes induced SICs, which were caused by fusion of a high [Ca2+] large vesicle in astrocytes (26Kang N. Xu J. Xu Q. Nedergaard M. Kang J. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this study, we further demonstrate that local increases in [glutamate]o also induce spontaneous SICs and that SICs are activated by astrocytic release of glutamate through fusion of a large vesicle. Slice Preparation—Brain slices were prepared as described previously (9Kang J. Jiang L. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14–20-day-old (P14–P20) Sprague-Dawley rats of either sex were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (55 mg/kg) and then decapitated. Transverse brain slices of 300 μm thickness were cut with a vibratome (TPI, St. Louis, MO) in a cutting solution containing the following (in mm): 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO3, and 230 sucrose. Slices containing the hippocampus were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 for 1–4 h and then transferred to a recording chamber (1.5 ml) that was perfused continually (3 ml/min) with ACSF gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 at room temperature (23–24 °C) for recording. ACSF contained the following (in mm): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 26 NaHCO3 (pH 7.4 when gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2). Whole-cell Patch Clamp Recording—Cells were visualized with a ×60/0.90 water immersion lens on an Olympus BX51 upright microscope (Olympus Optical Co., New York) equipped with IR differential inference contrast (DIC) optics. Patch electrodes with resistances of 5–10 MΩ were pulled from KG-33 glass capillaries (inner diameter 1.0 mm, outer diameter. 1.5 mm; Garner Glass Co., Claremont, CA) using a P-97 electrode puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 pyramidal layer and astrocytes in stratum radiatum were identified by their distinct DIC morphology and electrophysiological properties as described previously (9Kang J. Jiang L. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Pyramidal neurons were voltage-clamped at -60 mV or current-clamped without holding currents (for measuring Vm), and astrocytes were voltage-clamped at -80 mV. Cells with a seal resistance <5 gigaohms, a holding current of more than -200 pA, or changes in the series resistance >10% of control were rejected from further analysis. The pipette filling solution for neuronal whole-cell recording contained the following (in mm): 123 potassium gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 0.01 CaCl2, 1 ATP, 0.2 GTP, and 4 glucose (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). The pipette solution for whole-cell recording in astrocytes contained the following (in mm): 123 potassium gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 ATP, 0.2 GTP, and 4 glucose (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Recorded signals were filtered through an 8-pole Bessel low pass filter with 2-kHz cut-off frequency and sampled using the PCLAMP 9.0 acquisition program (Axon Instruments Inc.) with an analog-digital point sample interval of 200 μs. Fluorescence Imaging—A customized two-photon laser scanning Olympus BX61WI microscope with a ×60/0.90 water immersion lens was used to detect fluorescence signals. A Mai-Tai™ laser (Solid-State Laser Co., Mountain View, CA) tuned to 830 or 890 nm was used for excitation. Image acquisition was controlled by Olympus Fluoview FV300 software (Olympus America INC, Melville, NY). In the transfluorescence pathway, a 565 nm dichroic mirror was used to separate green and red fluorescence. HQ525/50 and HQ605/50 or HQ525/50 and 710 nm high pass filters were placed in the “green” and “red” pathways, respectively, to eliminate transmitted or reflected excitation light (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Fluorescence images were scanned in the X-Y-T or X-Y-Z mode with intervals of 2 or 4 s. Alexa Fluor-594 or FM 1-43 fluorescence was detected via the red pathway with the HQ605/50 filter. FM 4-64 was detected via the red pathway with the 710 nm filter. Fluo-4 fluorescence was detected using the green pathway. Base-line fluorescence (F0) was the average of four images during control, and ΔF/F was calculated as (ΔF/F)(t) = (F(t) - F0)/F0. The position shift in the X-Y section during 5 min of scanning was 0.5 ± 0.3 μm (mean ± S.D., n = 30 cells). Electron Microscopy—Slices (300 μm) were moved from normal ACSF into ACSF containing 50 mm [glutamate] five times for 5 s at 2-min intervals, with washes in normal ACSF inbetween. Slices were then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight, and then re-sliced into 100-μm sections with the vibratome. Sections were pretreated with 10% normal goat serum for 4 h at 4°C. Slices were incubated in the identical solution containing anti-GFAP antibody (1:2000, purified anti-mouse monoclonal GFAP, 2E1; BD Biosciences) for 24 h at 4 °C, and then incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200, Histostain-Plus Bulk kit, mouse IgG; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 24 h at 4 °C, and with avidin-biotin complex overnight at 4 °C. Immunoperoxidase labeling was visualized by incubating slices with chromogen (DAB-H2O2) in 1% OsO4 for 1 h at room temperature. Slices were dehydrated and embedded in Epon 812. Finally, ultra-thin sections (70 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl I acetate and lead citrate and then observed under a transmission electron microscope (HT 7100, Hitachi, Japan). Local Application—Glass pipettes with resistances of 10–14 MΩ were used to rapidly pressure-eject (puff) glutamate or MSO dissolved in ACSF. Puffing pressure (3–5 p.s.i.) and puffing duration (100 ms) were controlled by a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin Co., Cleveland, OH), and intervals (60–120 s) were controlled by a Master-8 stimulator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel). Puffing pipettes were placed in stratum radiatum of the CA1 area 50–80 μm below the slice surface. To control for osmotic effects, the same concentration of NaCl (50 mm) was added to ACSF as the osmolarity-control puff solution. Data Analysis and Chemicals—Data were analyzed using Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.), Origin 6.0 (OriginLab Co., Northampton, MA), and CorelDraw 9.0 (Corel Co. Ontario, Canada) programs. Statistical data are presented as means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Fluo-4-AM, Fluo-4 potassium, FM 1-43, FM 4-64, and Alexa Fluor-594 were purchased from Molecular Probes. dl-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), 6-cyano-2,3-dihydroxy-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX), and dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) were purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Ellisville, MI). Tetanus toxin (TeNT) was purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Tetrodotoxin (TTX), BAPTA, MSO, Rose Bengal, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Local Application of Glutamate Induces SICs in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons—To study glutamate-induced astrocytic glutamate release, we locally applied glutamate in stratum radiatum of the CA1 area in hippocampal slices through a puffing pipette. Whole-cell recording in pyramidal neurons was performed to detect SICs that are iGluR-mediated currents activated by transient astrocytic glutamate release (7Angulo M.C. Kozlov A.S. Charpak S. Audinat E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6920-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in the presence of TTX (1 μm) to block neuronal action potential (AP)-dependent synaptic release. Glutamate was puffed every 1–2 min into the region near apical dendrites of the recorded pyramidal neuron (Fig. 1B, p2). During a control period before placing puffing pipettes into slices, virtually no spontaneous SICs were observed, and after placing puffing pipettes, SICs were detected occasionally, suggesting little leakage of glutamate from puffing pipettes. Puffing glutamate (50 mm) directly evoked an inward current in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig. 1A, Ipuff). After 3–5 puffs, spontaneous SICs began to appear (Fig. 1A). Puffing glutamate induced an increase in SICs in 64 of 64 tested pyramidal neurons. SICs were blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist APV (50 μm) plus the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (20 μm) (Fig. 1A, APV/CNQX), confirming that glutamate-induced SICs are iGluR-mediated currents. The decay constant (mean ± S.D., 394 ± 21 ms, n = 101 events) and the amplitude (105 ± 19 pA) of spontaneous SICs were similar to SICs reported previously (7Angulo M.C. Kozlov A.S. Charpak S. Audinat E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6920-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8Fellin T. Pascual O. Gobbo S. Pozzan T. Haydon P.G. Carmignoto G. Neuron. 2004; 43: 729-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 26Kang N. Xu J. Xu Q. Nedergaard M. Kang J. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). When SICs occurred in pyramidal neurons, we always (64/64 neurons) observed, under DIC optics, an appearance of blebs around the puffing pipette tip (Fig. 1B, panel ii, >). Eight puffs of glutamate did not change neuronal resting membrane potential (RMP, -62.6 ± 1.0 mV, n = 10 cells) and ability to fire overshooting action potentials (Fig. 1C, Vm). SICs were not a result of high osmolarity of the glutamate solution, because a glutamate-free puff solution with similar osmolarity (ACSF added with 50 mm NaCl) did not induce SICs (Fig. 1D, ACSF + NaCl). Blebs and SICs induced by puffing glutamate were reversible if five or less puffs had been applied. After removing the puffing pipette from the extracellular space, SICs and blebs gradually disappeared (Fig. 1, E and F, panels iii and iv), suggesting that glutamate-induced SICs and blebs are reversible if there are not too many applied puffs. When stopping puffs but keeping the puff pipette in slices, SICs continued to occur with low frequency, probably resulting from leaking of glutamate from the puff pipette. Repetitively puffing 5 mm [glutamate] induced only a few SICs (Fig. 2A), whereas 2 mm [glutamate] did not induce SICs (Fig. 2A, 2 mm Glut). The frequency of SICs was calculated from a 10-min recording period (SICs during which the Ipuffs were excluded), starting at the fifth puff, and was positively correlated with the concentration of glutamate in the puffing pipette (Fig. 2B, [glutamate]o, •). The concentration of glutamate for the half-maximal frequency of SICs (EC50) is 17 mm. The frequency of SICs before puffing 50 mm [glutamate] (Fig. 2B, 50 mm, ○) was higher than that before puffing 2 mm [glutamate] (Fig. 2B, 2 mm, ○, p < 0.05, Student’s t test). This higher base line was probably because of leaking of high [glutamate] from the puffing pipette.FIGURE 2SICs depend on [glutamate]o. A, puffing 5 mm [glutamate] induced few SICs in a representative pyramidal neuron. Puffing 2 mm [glutamate] did not induce SICs (2 mm Glut). B, the mean frequency (SIC Freq, •) and amplitude (SIC Amp, ▪) of SICs were plotted against glutamate concentrations in the puffing pipette ([glutamate]o). Data were fitted by the Boltzmann equation, and r2 is 0.99 and 0.96 for frequency and amplitude, respectively. Open circles and squares are the frequency (○) and amplitude (□) of SICs during control periods.

Astrocytic aTCs were fully blocked by combination of glutamate transporter inhibitor, TBOA (200 μm), and iGluR blockers CNQX (20 μm) and APV (50 μm)(TBOA/CNQX/APV). Puffing 2 mm [glutamate] did not induce aTCs (2 mm Glut). D, frequency (aTC Freq, •) and amplitude (aTC Amp, ▪) of aTCs were plotted against concentrations of puffed glutamate ([glutamate]o).

Xu J. Xu Q. Nedergaard M. Kang J. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we found that astrocytic glutamate release also activates a transient inward current in astrocytes (aTC), which synchronizes with neuronal SICs. Here we tested whether puffing glutamate also induces aTCs in astrocytes. Astrocytes near the puffing pipette were patched with the pipette solution without glutamate. As before, experiments were performed in the presence of TTX. Puffing 50 mm [glutamate] directly evoked an inward current (Fig. 2C, Ipuff) and induced an increase in spontaneous aTCs in astrocytes (Fig. 2C, 2). The decay constant of aTCs (442 ± 93 ms, mean ± S.D., n = 60 events) was similar to the decay of SICs (394 ± 21 ms). In the passive type of astrocytes (30Kressin K. Kuprijanova E. Jabs R. Seifert G. Steinhauser C. Glia. 1995; 15: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Matthias K. Kirchhoff F. Seifert G. Huttmann K. Matyash M. Kettenmann H. Steinhauser C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aTCs may be composed of glutamate transport currents and iGluR-mediated currents (32Lalo U. Pankratov Y. Kirchhoff F. North R.A. Verkhratsky A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). After repeated puffing of glutamate and appearance of aTCs, perfusion of slices with the glutamate transporter inhibitor, TBOA (200 μm), the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (20 μm), and the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist APV (50 μm) blocked aTCs (Fig. 2, C and E, TBOA/CNQX/APV), supporting the conclusion that aTCs are glutamate-activated currents in astrocytes. Similar puffing of 2 mm [glutamate] did not induce aTCs (Fig. 2C, 2 mm Glut). Pooled data showed that the aTC-[glutamate]o relationship (Fig. 2D) was similar to the neuronal SIC-[glutamate]o dose-response curve (Fig. 2B, EC50 is 17 and 18 mm for SICs and aTCs, respectively). However, the mean amplitude of neuronal SICs (Fig. 2B, SIC Amp, ▪) was about four times the amplitude of aTCs (Fig. 2D, aTC Amp, ▪; 50 mm, p < 0.01, Student’s t test). These results indicate that ≥5 mm [glutamate]o induces transient astrocytic glutamate release and that aTCs can be used as an indicator for astrocytic glutamate release. Glutamate Induces Large Vesicles in Astrocytes—To understand the nature of glutamate-induced blebs, we used transmission EM to examine the ultrastructure of glutamate-induced blebs. Slices were transiently exposed five times to ACSF containing 50 mm [glutamate] for 5 s at intervals of 2 min. Astrocytes were identified by anti-glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) antibody staining. Large vesicles were observed in GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig. 3, A–E, v) in glutamate-treated slices. Vesicles were identified by their single layer membrane without internal structures, different from mitochondria that were double layers of membrane with cristae (Fig. 3, A and B, m). Astrocytes in untreated control slices showed small vesicles (Fig. 3F). Vesicles were present in 80% (20/25) of glutamate-treated astrocytes (Fig. 3G, left panel, Glut) and 58% (23/40) of control astrocytes (Fig. 3G, left panel, Con). The mean size (diameter) of vesicles in glutamate-treated astrocytes (Fig. 3G, Size, Glut) was significantly larger than in control astrocytes (Fig. 3G, Size, Con, p < 0.001, Student’s t test). Cumulative distribution curve of the vesicle diameter (Fig. 3G, right panel) indicated that glutamate treatment (Fig. 3G, right panel, solid line) increased the number of large vesicles in astrocytes. These results suggest that glutamate induces large vesicles in astrocytes. Major cellular structures around the puffing pipette in CA1 stratum radiatum (Fig. 1B) are apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, processes of astrocytes, interneurons, and Shaffer collateral fibers. To exclude the occurrence of large vesicles in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, we loaded multiple pyramidal neurons with Alexa Flu- or-594 by extracellular electroporation through a pipette containing 5 mm Alexa Fluor-594 in the pyramidal layer (33Haas K. Sin W.C. Javaherian A. Li Z. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After five positive pulses of 15 V, 30-ms duration, stimuli at intervals of 2 s, multiple pyramidal neurons and their dendrites were loaded with Alexa Fluor-594 (Fig. 3H, Con). Whole-cell recording in Alexa Fluor-594-loaded neurons showed a normal range of resting membrane potentials (-56 to -62 mV, n = 4 neurons) and were able to fire action potentials. Glutamate (50 mm) was puffed through a puffing pipette placed among labeled dendrites. After 5–10 puffs, Alexa Fluor-594-negative large vesicles appeared (Fig. 3H, Puff, panels i, ii, and v). X-Y-Z projection images showed that dendrites of pyramidal neurons after puffing glutamate (Fig. 3H, Puff, panel iii) were similar to those before puffing (Fig. 3H, Con). No remarkable enlargement of dendrites was found during or after puffing, suggesting that glutamate does not induce the large vesicle in dendrites of pyramidal neurons. To furt"
https://openalex.org/W1982998313,"Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα, SHPS-1) is a plasma membrane receptor for CD47 and a key regulator of phagocytosis, growth factor signaling, and migration. Phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in its cytoplasmic tail is essential for the functional effects of SIRPα, at least in part, because the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs recruit Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases. Ligation by CD47 and integrin engagement both have been thought to regulate SIRPα phosphorylation. However, their distinct contributions have not been distinguished. Here, we show that the importance of CD47 varies with cell type, since ligation of CD47 is not necessary for SIRPα phosphorylation in myeloid cells, whereas it is required in endothelial cells. In contrast, integrin-mediated adhesion is required for SIRPα phosphorylation in both cell types. This shows that SIRPα phosphorylation is dually regulated and demonstrates a new mechanism for functional cooperation between integrins and the integrin-associated protein CD47.

Cell adhesion is an important modulator of phenotype, as contact with extracellular matrix and with adjacent cells modulates responses to proliferative, apoptotic, migratory, phagocytic, and other fundamental cues. Often, these adhesion signals result from ligation of the heterodimeric integrin family of cell surface receptors (1Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Juliano R.L.

These phosphatases often counteract the effects of tyrosine kinases activated by growth factors, resulting in negative regulation of the proliferative signal (7Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Similarly, recruitment of SHP-1 to the SIRPα cytoplasmic tail negatively regulates phagocytosis initiated by Fcγ receptor signaling through the tyrosine kinase Syk in macrophages and other immune cells (15Okazawa H.

In smooth muscle cells, phosphorylation of SIRPα and subsequent recruitment of SHP-2 in response to IGF-1 is enhanced by its ligand, CD47, but this step promotes rather than dampens IGF-1 signaling (9Maile L.A.

Thus, the mechanisms for regulation of SIRPα phosphorylation are of considerable interest, since they regulate potent signaling pathways in a variety of cells. Integrin-mediated adhesion has been shown to promote SIRPα phosphorylation (12Oh E.S. Gu H. Saxton T.M. Timms J.F. Hausdorff S. Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Pawson T. Neel B.G. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell.

Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). One major caveat to these studies is that CD47 and integrins regulate each other’s signaling (25Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 26Oldenborg P.A. Leuk.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since CD47 is ubiquitously expressed and was present on all cells used in the previous studies, it is not possible to distinguish the specific contribution of integrin signaling from integrin-CD47 cooperative signaling or even to determine whether integrin ligation simply led to SIRPα-CD47 interactions in these previous reports. Indeed, other studies with antibodies and in mice and cells lacking CD47 have led to the hypothesis that interaction with CD47 is required for SIRPα phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases (9Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3519-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). In this work, we have used cells genetically deficient in CD47 to dissect the contributions of integrin ligation and interaction with CD47 for SIRPα phosphorylation in leukocytes and endothelial cells. We show that in leukocytes, integrin ligation is necessary and sufficient for SIRPα phosphorylation, which is substantial, even in the complete absence of CD47 expression. CD47 ligation of SIRPα amplifies the signal, but is not required. In endothelial cells, integrin-mediated adhesion also is necessary, but amplification by CD47-SIRPα interaction has a much more dramatic effect on SIRPα phosphorylation and phosphatase recruitment than in leukocytes. Indeed, in these cells, in contrast to leukocytes, SIRPα phosphorylation is almost undetectable without ligation by CD47. Thus, SIRPα phosphorylation requires integrin signaling in all cell types, whereas CD47 appears to be a costimulator of SIRPα phosphorylation whose importance depends upon cell type. Reagents and Antibodies—Human fibronectin was obtained from Invitrogen, human vitronectin was from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (La Jolla, CA), collagen I (“Purecol”) was from Inamed Biomaterials (Fremont, CA), and the poly(RGD) substrate was obtained from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA) (“ProNectin F”) or from Sigma (“fibronectin-like engineered protein polymer”).

For integrin blocking experiments, anti-β1 (clone Ha2/5), anti-αv (clone H9.2B8), and appropriate isotype controls were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Anti-β2 (clone 5C6) was purchased from AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Rat antibodies to intracellular cell adhesion molecule 2 (clone 3C4(IC2/4)), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (clones MEC13.3 and 390), and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) (clone 11D4.1) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule clone 390 also was the generous gift of S. M. Albelda (University of Pennsylvania Medical Center). Hybridomas for the antibodies MECA32 and endoglin were purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). The antibody to JAM-A (clone BV11) was the kind gift of E. Dejana (Milan, Italy). Antibodies used for Western blotting included anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the cytoplasmic tail of SIRPα, both obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA), as well as mouse anti-SHP-2 (clone 79) purchased from BD Biosciences. Antibodies to α-, β-, and γ-catenin were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Secondary antibodies used for blotting were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA) and Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The appropriate anti-rat, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse Alexa-488- and Alexa-594-coupled secondary antibodies along with Alexa-647-coupled phalloidin were purchased from Invitrogen for immunofluorescence microscopy experiments. The inhibitory cyclic peptide cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val) along with a control peptide, cyclo(Arg-Ala-Asp-d-Phe-Val), were purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY) and used at 100 μm to assess αv integrin function in some experiments. Plating onto Mouse CD47-Fc—The mouse CD47-Fc chimera was made using conventional methods by replacing the human IgV domain of CD47 in plasmid pIAP412 (31Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with a PCR fragment containing the murine IgV domain (piap369). The resulting construct contains the human leader sequence and the first 13 amino acids of the mature human CD47 protein, the Cys at position 14 mutated to Ser, followed by 102 amino acids in the murine IgV domain and the hinge and constant regions of human IgG1 heavy chain. This soluble protein was purified with Gammabind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) from the supernatant of 293 cells transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The concentration of mouse CD47-Fc was determined using a Pierce BCA™ protein assay. Murine CD47-Fc bound to murine SIRPα on BMDM, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and shown previously by others (32Sato R. Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H. Kiuchi D. Hayashi A. Kaneko Y. Honma N. Okazawa H.

Tissue culture dishes were incubated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and coated with mouse CD47-Fc or human IgG essentially as described (33Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), following which they were incubated with mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for various times, and SIRPα phosphorylation was quantitated as described below. Macrophages—Macrophages were derived from the bone marrow of CD47+/- and CD47-/- mice (31Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as well as mice lacking the SIRPα cytoplasmic domain (11Inagaki K. Yamao T. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Takada T.

Brown E.J. Thomas M.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1035-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mice were bred for at least 10 generations onto the C57Bl/6 background. SIRP CT-/- bones were the kind gift of Mary Nakamura (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Macrophages were differentiated and maintained in macrophage complete medium (Dulbecco’s modified medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, South Logan, UT), 10 mm HEPES with 10% conditioned medium from CMG cells (35Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) as a source of M-CSF) and grown on bacteriologic plastic (Kord-Valmark, Brampton, Ontario, Canada). For experiments to determine the effect of cell density on SIRPα phosphorylation, macrophages were plated at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish (“high density”), 106 cells/10-cm dish (“medium density”), or 0.3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish (“low density”) in complete medium on bacteriologic plastic and allowed to grow for 3 days before doing the experiment. Macrophages were plated at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish for all other experiments except those with anti-integrin antibodies, where they were plated at 2 × 106 cells/dish. For some experiments, complete medium was removed, the cells were rinsed with PBS, and serum-free medium (Dulbecco’s modified medium, 10 mm HEPES, 0.11 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) was added back for the indicated amount of time. For suspension and readhesion experiments, macrophages were harvested with 10 mm EDTA/PBS, washed once with serum-free or complete medium, and then resuspended and replated in the same medium. For experiments to examine integrins, macrophages were starved in serum-free medium overnight. As indicated, cells were harvested, pelleted, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h 30 min before adding the indicated antibodies at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, resuspending, and plating onto bacteriologic plastic or onto bacteriologic plastic coated with 10 μg/ml FN. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 or 2 h, as indicated, at 37 °C before processing for immunoprecipitation. For these experiments, cells treated with anti-β2 (5C6) did not spread on the bacteriologic dishes regardless of genotype, and cells treated with anti-β1 (Ha2/5) did not attach to FN-coated dishes. Bone Marrow Neutrophils—Neutrophils were isolated from the bone marrow of CD47+/- and CD47-/- C57Bl/6 mice exactly as described in Ref. 36Mocsai A. Zhang H. Jakus Z. Kitaura J. Kawakami T. Lowell C.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 4155-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar. The neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.5% FBS, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (“HBSS++”) to a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml. To assess basal levels of SIRPα phosphorylation in nonadherent, nonactivated neutrophils, 1 ml of CD47+ or CD47- neutrophils (10 × 106 cells) was rotated at 6 rpm at room temperature for 30 min before processing for immunoprecipitation as described below. For adhesion experiments, 1 ml of each genotype of neutrophils was added to poly(RGD)-coated dishes and allowed to settle onto the surface for 10 min before the addition of 10 μm formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (Sigma) in HBSS++, following which neutrophils were allowed to adhere for an additional 20 min prior to processing for immunoprecipitation. Without additional stimulation, the neutrophils remained round and nonadherent on this surface. Murine Brain Endothelial Cells—For some experiments, murine brain-derived, polyoma middle T antigen-transformed endothelial cells, bEND.3 (37Montesano R. Pepper M.S. Mohle-Steinlein U. Risau W. Wagner E.F. Orci L. Cell. 1990; 62: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), were used. These cells, the kind gift of W. A. Frazier (Washington University, St. Louis, MO), were grown in Dulbecco’s modified medium (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 10% FBS, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a humidified 37 °C tissue culture incubator with 95% air, 5% CO2. For experiments to examine cell density effects on SIRPα phosphorylation, bEND.3 cells were plated at 0.1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish (low density), 0.3 × 106 cells/dish (medium density), or 106 cells/dish (high density). MLEC Line Isolation and Culture—An immortalizing transgene carried by the ImmortoMouse® (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) was bred into Sv129 CD47+/+ and CD47-/- mice to facilitate establishment of endothelial cell lines. This immortalizing transgene consists of a temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen under the control of the major histocompatibility complex class I H-2Kb promoter (38Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were isolated from the lungs of transgene-positive CD47+ and CD47- mice using a protocol generously provided by J. Lively and R. O. Hynes (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) (39Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Polyclonal cultures of CD47+ and CD47- MLEC were sorted for high and equivalent expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 2. Cell lines were maintained at 32.5 °C in “Lively medium” composed of Dulbecco’s modified medium/Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen), 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), 0.1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma), 20 units/ml interferon-γ (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). Cells were passaged every 2–3 days using trypsin/EDTA and always plated onto tissue culture plastic that had been coated with 0.1% gelatin/PBS for at least 30 min at 37 °C and rinsed once with PBS. High and consistent expression of endothelial markers and morphology is maintained for several months under these conditions. Expression of six antigens found predominantly on endothelial cells, including intercellular cell adhesion molecule 2, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, VE-cadherin, JAM-A, MECA32, and endoglin, was equivalent on CD47+ and CD47- MLEC (supplemental Fig. 1). Both CD47+ and CD47- MLEC have polygonal cell bodies and form cobblestone-like monolayers characteristic of endothelial cells (data not shown). In addition, MLEC of both genotypes were contact-inhibited and able to maintain confluent monolayers for several days (data not shown). For all experiments, cells were plated at 0.3 × 106 cells/10-cm tissue culture dish (low density), 106 cells/10-cm dish (medium density), or 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish (high density) in Lively medium. Two days after plating the cells, dishes were rinsed with PBS and Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen), 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (Assay Medium) without any FBS or antibiotics was added back to each. Cells were returned to 32.5 °C and allowed to grow for an additional 48 h prior to the experiment. For some experiments, various antibodies, at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, were added to cells and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with occasional mixing by inversion prior to plating. Additional antibodies were added on each subsequent day to ensure that the concentration of antibody was maintained at 10 μg/ml. In preparation for experiments to assess the rate of induction of SIRPα phosphorylation, cells were plated at low density. On the day of the experiment, cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, followed by neutralization with a serum-free trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and pelleted (233 × g, 5 min, room temperature) before resuspending in assay medium to the appropriate volume. Samples were rotated gently at 6 rpm with or without the indicated antibodies, cyclic peptides, 3 mm EDTA, or 1 mm MnCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. Following the rotation, three dishes of cells initially plated at low density were replated into one dish and placed back into a 32.5 °C tissue culture incubator for 2 h. For these experiments, tissue culture dishes were coated with 0.1% gelatin, collagen I at 20 μg/ml, or vitronectin at 10 μg/ml, as indicated. For experiments to examine the effects of cell-cell contact in the absence of adhesion to a substratum by pelleting the cells, MLEC were plated at low density, harvested, and combined as described above. Some cells were then replated at higher density, whereas others were pelleted (233 × g, 5 min, room temperature). As indicated, some pelleted cells were lysed immediately, whereas others were incubated for an additional 60 min at 32.5 °C in the presence or absence of EDTA or MnCl2 before lysis and processing for immunoprecipitation. For experiments in which CD47- MLEC were mixed with SIRP CT-/- BMDM, CD47- MLEC were initially plated at low density and subsequently incubated with SIRP CT-/- BMDM to achieve a total cell density equal to the MLEC plated at high density, as described above. As controls, MLEC of both genotypes were harvested and replated at high density, as described above. Cells were allowed to readhere for 2 h before lysis and processing for immunoprecipitation. To examine components of the adherens junction (AJ), cells were plated at the indicated densities. Twenty minutes prior to lysis, cells were treated with 0.5 μm pervanadate to preserve phosphorylation levels of VE-cadherin and the α-, β-, and γ-catenins (40Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—The expression of a variety of cell surface molecules on CD47+ and CD47- MLEC, BMDM, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). For each marker assessed, 2 × 105 MLEC or 1 × 105 BMDM were incubated with primary antibody at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (for purified antibodies) or in hybridoma supernatant for 30–60 min on ice, washed, and analyzed. For BMDM, 1 mg/ml human IgG was included in the incubation buffer to block FcγR binding of the monoclonal antibodies. Incubation with a rat monoclonal antibody anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, KLHR2A, was used to assess nonspecific binding. Binding of mouse CD47-Fc to BMDM was assessed by flow cytometry as described above. 20 μg/ml anti-FcγRII/III 2.4G2 was used to inhibit FcγR binding of the construct, and nonspecific binding was assessed using human IgG rather than CD47-Fc. Immunoprecipitations—For all immunoprecipitations, antibodies (5–10 μg/sample) were precoupled to resin (20–30 μl/sample of 50% slurry) by incubating with Gammabind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C with rotation in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, followed by cross-linking with 10 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). For all endothelial cell experiments, MLEC were transferred to medium lacking serum and added growth factors for 48 h prior to lysis. Cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Applied Science), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate (Sigma) and 0.5 μm pervanadate). After removing nuclei and debris by centrifugation, the protein concentration of each sample was assessed using a Pierce BCA™ protein assay. For each experiment, equal amounts of protein in each lysate were used for each immunoprecipitation. After incubating at 4 °C with rotation overnight, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 0.75 ml of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μm pervanadate) before adding reducing sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed according to standard procedures. Western blot band densities were quantified using CCD detection of emitted light during blot development with chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) using the Fluorochem8000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The extent of SIRPα tyrosine phosphorylation in each sample was determined by dividing the intensity of the SIRPα phosphotyrosine signal by the intensity of the band detected with an antibody recognizing SIRPα in a separate aliquot of the same sample. Values were expressed as percentages of the indicated reference sample. Graphs of relative phosphotyrosine content represent at least three independent experiments. One-sample t tests were used for statistical analysis where indicated. Microscopy—To visualize CD47 and SIRPα expressed on the surface of MLEC, cells were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips and then stained with a control antibody (KLHRA2), anti-CD47 (miap301), or anti-SIRPα (P84) before fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde.

Molecular mechanisms by which Runx3 controls distinct neurotrophin receptors are largely unknown. Here, we show that RUNX3 abolished mRNA induction of TRKB expression, and concomitantly altered the neurotrophin response in a differentiating neuroblastoma cell line. In contrast, RUNX3 did not play a significant role in TRKC regulation even under the relevant BMP signaling pathway. We identified putative regulatory elements of Ntrk2/NTRK2 (a gene that codes for TrkB) using an unbiased computational approach. One of these elements was a highly conserved intronic sequence that contains a cluster of Runx binding sites. In a primary culture of DRG neurons, endogenous Runx3 bound to the consensus cluster, which had repressor activity against the Ntrk2 promoter under the control of NT-3 signaling. Consistent with these findings, Runx3-deficient embryos showed an increased number of trkB+ DRG neurons and failed to maintain trkC expression. Taken together, Runx3 determines TrkC positive sensory neuron identities through the transcriptional repression of TrkB when Trk-BTrkC double positive neurons differentiate into TrkC single positive neurons.

Trk receptors are specifically expressed in functionally distinct neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). TrkA is expressed in both nociceptive and thermoceptive sensory neurons, and TrkB and TrkC are expressed in a subset of mechano-receptive and proprioceptive neurons, respectively (4Snider W.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The significance of neurotrophin signaling goes far beyond classical cell survival function of trophic factors. For example, it plays an important role in the control of axonal projections (5Patel T.D. Jackman A. Rice F.L. Kucera J. Snider W.D. Neuron. 2000; 25: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 6Patel T.D. Kramer I. Kucera J. Niederkofler V. Jessell T.M. Arber S. Snider W.D.

Martin-Zanca D. Wright D.E. Reichardt L.F. Patapoutian A. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, for distinct sensory neurons to acquire appropriate neuronal traits, expression of Ntrk genes must be tightly regulated. Several studies have revealed that Ntrk genes are transcriptionally regulated during embryonic development. In the absence of the Brn-3a POU domain transcription factor, all Ntrk genes are deregulated in the trigeminal ganglion (9Huang E.J. Zang K. Schmidt A. Saulys A. Xiang M. Reichardt L.F. Development. 1999; 126: 2869-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parada and colleagues (10Ma L. Merenmies J. Parada L.F. Development. 2000; 127: 3777-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lei L.

However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of Ntrk2 (TrkB) and Ntrk3 (TrkC), probably because of the large sizes of their genomic loci.Runt domain transcription factors, Runxs, are known to act as tissue-specific transcription factors. Runx1 and Runx2 control the formation of hematopoietic stem cells and maturation of osteoblasts, respectively (14Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R.

They are also important as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in various cancers (16Blyth K. Cameron E.R. Neil J.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We generated a Runx3 knock-out mouse and described the causal relationship between RUNX3 and gastric cancer (17Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C. Fukamachi H. Inoue K. Chi X.Z. Lee K.Y. Nomura S. Lee C.W.

Arber and colleagues (20Kramer I. Sigrist M. de Nooij J.C. Taniuchi I. Jessell T.M. Arber S. Neuron. 2006; 49: 379-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) recently clarified the genetic interaction between Ntrk2 and Runx3. Other groups also described the positive/negative regulation of TrkA by Runx1 (21Marmigere F. Montelius A. Wegner M. Groner Y. Reichardt L.F. Ernfors P. Nat.

Neuron. 2006; 49: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Here we investigated potential roles for Runx3 in the transcriptional regulation of TrkB and TrkC. In cultured neuroblastoma cells, RUNX3 per se abrogated TRKB induction and desensitized cells to trophic factors for survival. In contrast, the contribution of RUNX3 to the regulation of TRKC appeared to be minimal. We identified one of the putative cis-regulatory elements of the gene of TrkB as an element for the mediation of Runx3 repression. These results clarified the molecular mechanism for previously described genetic interaction between Runx3 and Ntrk2 and suggest that lineage-specific transcription factors control neuronal fate by transcriptional repression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—DRGs were dissected from rat embryos at E15.5 (corresponds to mouse E13.5). 0.125% trypsin/versene was added to the ganglions and incubated at 37 °C for 8 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 200 × g and 4 °C for 3 min. Cells were re-suspended in L-15 (10% fetal bovine serum, 400 units of DNase I) and triturated with micropipette until the solution was homogeneous. To enrich for neuronal cells, the cell suspension was pre-cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 2 h. Subsequently non-adhering cells were plated on poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated dishes (BD Biosciences). Primary DRG cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen), which was supplemented with ITS media supplement (Sigma) and GlutaMax (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10–100 ng/ml NGF (Chemicon), NT-3 (Sigma), or BDNF (Peprotech). The neuroblastoma cell lines TGW (JCRB0618, Health Science Research Resources Bank), SK-N-DZ (CRL-2149, ATCC), and LA-N-2 (RCB0484, RIKEN Bioresource Center) were grown in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and GlutaMax (Invitrogen). SK-N-FI (CRL-2142, ATCC) was grown in minimal essential medium α (Invitrogen). Cells were plated on collagen I-coated dishes (Asahi Techno Glass). Differentiated TGW cells were maintained in similar conditions to those of DRG cells in a serum depletion assay. All-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in absolute ethanol, stored in -80 °C, and used within 2 weeks. Medium was refreshed for every 2 days during the differentiation assay.Plasmids—pcDNA3-driven FLAG-tagged human RUNX3 was described elsewhere (23Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol.

A point mutation (R178Q) was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis according to the instructions in the QuikChange XL manual (Stratagene). Although this mutation has not been found in human disease, the corresponding point mutation R174Q in the conserved Runt domain was reported for both RUNX1 and RUNX2 in patients with leukemia (24Michaud J. Wu F. Osato M. Cottles G.M. Yanagida M. Asou N. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Benson K.F. Raskind W.H. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Israels S. McNicol A. Weiss H. Horwitz M. Scott H.S.

Each RUNX3 insert was cloned into pIRES2-enhanced green fluorescent protein to gate enhanced green fluorescent protein positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The plasmids pRK-SK-Brn-3a (from Dr. Huang, University of California) and pcDNA-Alk3 (constitutive active or kinase negative form, from Dr. Miyazono, University of Tokyo) were obtained as indicated. An expression vector for human KLF7 (IMAGE: 4509200) was purchased from an IMAGE distributor (Geneservice). Mouse Ntrk2 promoter (5′ flanking to exon2) or the conserved sequence of intron 7 was amplified by PCR from a BAC clone (RP23–467E1, BACPAC Resources Center). Primer sequences were: 5′-GCGGGCAGTTGGATGACTATTCTTATGTC-3′ and 5′-ATAGAGCTCGCCCTCTTGCTGCTTGGTGC-3′ for the Ntrk2 promoter or 5′-ACTGGATCCTCTTTTCTGTCTCACAGTC-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCGACTTTGCAGAATGACACACTTG-3′ for the Ntrk2 intron 7. The PCR fragment of the Ntrk2 promoter was inserted into the KpnI-SacI sites of pGL3-basic (Promega) and Ntrk2 intron 7 was inserted into the BamHI-SalI sites. Point mutations of Runx binding sites were introduced by using Pfu-Ultra (Stratagene).Transient Transfection by Nucleofector—Gene delivery by electroporation was carried out using Nucleofector (AMAXA). Experimental conditions were optimized for rat primary DRG (program O-03), TGW (T-16), SK-N-DZ (T-16), LA-N-2 (X-05), or SK-N-FI (X-05). The efficiencies of gene delivery were 30–50 and 70–90% for DRG and neuroblastoma cells, respectively.Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was purified from cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Because cells that did not express transgenes remaining in the experimental cell population, the results critically depended on transfection efficiency. Random-primed cDNA was synthesized at 37 °C from 1.5 μg of total RNA with Omniscript (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Mx3000P (Stratagene) was used for the real-time PCR analysis. The mRNA level of each gene was normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference. Gene-specific fluorescent probes (Applied Biosystems) were generated from the following genes: human RUNX3 (Hs 00231709_m1), human TRKB (Hs 00178811_m1), human TRKC (Hs 00176797_m1), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Hs 99999905_m1).Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cell death was quantified by flow cytometry (LSRII; BD Biosciences) using the Annexin V PE-detection Kit I (BD Biosciences).Bioinformatics—The Enhancer Element Locator (EEL) program was obtained (from www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/kpalin/EEL) and installed onto a Personal Computer running Linux. Sequences used for the analysis were obtained from Ensembl (26Birney E. Andrews T.D. Bevan P. Caccamo M. Chen Y. Clarke L. Coates G. Cuff J. Curwen V. Cutts T. Down T. Eyras E. Fernandez-Suarez X.M.

The entire genomic sequence including the Ntrk2/NTRK2 or Ntrk3/NTRK3 gene coding regions and covering 100 kb upstream and downstream of each gene region was used for the analysis. The EEL program was run with the following parameters to return the top 500 cis modules: λ2.0, μ0.12, ν200, ξ200, and 10.4 nucleotides per rotation. The cutoff used for the binding site detection phase was an absolute score of 8.8, which was chosen to include some of the transcriptional factors of interest. All mammalian transcriptional factor binding sites in the JASPAR data base (mordor.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/jaspar2005/jaspar_db.pl) were included in the analysis. In addition to the information from JASPAR, the binding site for Brn-3 (POU-homeodomain) was also included (27Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a score cutoff of 200 was applied to the cis modules, and only cis modules having scores greater than or equal to 200 were used for later analysis. A summary of the final EEL results is provided in the supplementary materials.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—pcDNA Myc-RUNX3 was transfected to the TGW cell line by electroporation. After 1 day of treatment with retinoic acid, formaldehyde was added to the culture medium (final conc. 1%) for 10 min followed by quenching with 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. For carrier ChIP, dissociated DRGs from E15.5 rat embryos were cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml NT-3. Sf9 insect cells were mixed together with a smaller amount of DRG cells and harvested for formalin cross-link as above. DNA was sheared by sonication to generate fragments with a mean length of around 500 bp. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the following antibodies: 1 μg of normal rabbit or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz), 2 μg of polyclonal anti-c-Myc (A-14; Santa Cruz), 2 μg of monoclonal anti-RUNX3 (R3–3F12; see supplemental materials Fig. S), or 1 μl of polyclonal anti-RUNX3 (from Dr. Groner, The Weizmann Institute of Science) and the immune complexes including the target chromatin were pulled down with protein A-agarose beads (Upstate). After the washing and elution steps, the protein-chromatin complex was reverse cross-linked by incubating it with sodium chloride at 65 °C for 8 h, and subsequently treating it with RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and proteinase K at 45 °C for 2 h. DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and amplified by PCR. The enrichment of the target sequence was quantified using SYBR Green (Qiagen) for TGW cells. Primer sequences for the detection of the genomic locus are human NTRK2 promoter, 5′-TTCCCCGTTCTCTTTTAAATGACTGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGGGGTCTCACTAGGGACAA-3′; human NTRK2 intron 7, 5′-GGGATACTTGGAGGCGATCA-3′ and 5′-CATAGACTCTGCCTGGCATTAACC-3′; human NTRK2 intron 14-1, 5′-TAACTACCATGCACCATCGGAATG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCCACGATTTACCTATCAG-3′; human NTRK2 intron 14-2, 5′-GTGTTGACCACCTCCGGTTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGTCTAAGCATTTTCATCCGAATAA-3′; human NTRK2 3′ flank, 5′-ACTATTGCTCCCTGCGTTCT-3′ and 5′-GGGTCTTAGTAAAGCAATGGACCT-3′; human NTRK3 promoter, 5′-GCGATCAGATGCAAAATCCTT-3′ and 5′-GGTGGGACTTGGTGACTTTAGC-3′; human NTRK3 intron 13, 5′-TTCCCCTTCAGTTCATCTTGACC-3′ and 5′-CTTAGATCTGCAGTTCCGACAAGC-3′; rat Ntrk2 intron 7, 5′-CCCCATGAAACTCACAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCTGGGCTCCTAAGTACTACAGTG-3′. Optimized PCR conditions and primer concentrations are available on request.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—DRGs were dissected from rat embryos (E15.5) and Dounce homogenized. The nuclear extract was purified using the NE-PER (Pierce) for EMSA. The EMSA was performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, binding reactions on ice were performed for 20 min before adding the antibodies (Runx3; R3-3F12). 4–7 μl of the reaction mixture was electrophoresed and transferred to a Nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). Biotin-labeled DNA was detected by chemiluminescence. Sequences of the Biotin end-labeled or unlabeled double-stranded DNA are as follows: R1, 5′-AGTCTACCATGACCACATTCC-3′; R2, 5′-CAGTCAGAAAACCACAGGAGTAAAT-3′; R3, 5′-CTTAAGTATTGTGGTTAGTGCTAGG-3′; R4, 5′-TTTACCCCCTGTGGTTTTTGTTTTC-3′.Reporter Assay—Dissociated rat DRG cells from E15.5 embryos were transfected by electroporation with 50 ng of phRL-SV40 (Promega) luciferase, as an internal control, and 5 μg of each of the designated Firefly reporter plasmid containing the sequence of interest. Cells were split into 24-well plates and cultured with or without different neurotrophins. Luciferase activities were measured 24–48 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with respect to that of hRenilla.Animals—Animal studies were done in accordance with guidelines set by National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR). Runx3+/- mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were mated in the evening and the next morning was considered embryonic day 0.5. Pregnant animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide and embryos were removed by Cesarean section. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS from 4 h to overnight at 4 °C and were rinsed in PBS, cryoprotected in 10–30% sucrose/PBS overnight, and embedded in OCT (Sakura).In Situ Hybridization—Samples were cryosectioned with a thickness of 16 μm. Slides were rehydrated and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, briefly rinsed twice in PBS, and immersed in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate/PBS at room temperature for 15 min. Slides were dehydrated by passing them through a succession of chambers increasing ethanol concentration, and subsequently incubated with riboprobe in mRNA in situ hybridization buffer (DAKO). To synthesize DIG riboprobes, we used a rat trkC cDNA-(1–311) and a rat trkB cDNA-(632–1048) (from Dr. Matsumoto, University of Tokyo). Hybridization was carried out for 40 h at 63 °C. After hybridization, slides were washed twice in 60% formamide, 2× SSC, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 63 °C, and then treated with RNase A (4 μg/ml) in 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were washed twice in 60% formamide, 2× SSC, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 15 min and twice in 0.1× SSC containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 15 min. Detection procedures were performed with a DIG system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche), except that 10% polyvinyl alcohol was also included in the alkaline phosphatase reaction mixture.Immunohistochemistry—Slides were prepared as described above, rehydrated in PBS for 5 min, placed in target retrieval solution (pH 6.0, DAKO) and heated for 1 min at 105 °C. A rabbit antibody raised against mouse ER81 (1:8000, from Dr. Jessell, Columbia University) was used and visualized with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400, Chemicon).RESULTSRUNX3 Abolishes TRKB Induction during Retinoic Acid-induced Differentiation of a Neuroblastoma Cell Line—Recently, Kramer et al. (20Kramer I. Sigrist M. de Nooij J.C. Taniuchi I. Jessell T.M. Arber S. Neuron. 2006; 49: 379-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) used a battery of mouse strains to investigate the function of Runx1/Runx3 in DRG neurons. Genetic evidence clearly showed that Runx3 contributes to selective repression of TrkB synthesis within TrkC-positive sensory neurons (20Kramer I. Sigrist M. de Nooij J.C. Taniuchi I. Jessell T.M. Arber S. Neuron. 2006; 49: 379-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To investigate this phenomenon further, we first used an accessible in vitro model. Retinoic acid (RA) induces both TRKB expression and differentiation in neuroblastoma cell lines (28Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 29Lucarelli E. Kaplan D.R. Thiele C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24725-24731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We observed that the neuroblastoma cell line TGW responded to RA and changed morphology 24 h following treatment (Fig. 1A). TGW lacked endogenous RUNX3 and its expression was not increased after differentiation (data not shown). We monitored the relative expression level of TRKB and TRKC in the presence or absence of RUNX3. In the mock control (green fluorescent protein transfection), TRKB expression was dramatically enhanced by RA, whereas the expression of TRKC did not change (Fig. 1B). However, transient transfection with RUNX3 inhibited the induction of TRKB and slightly enhanced TRKC (Fig. 1B). Taking into account the transfection efficiency (around 70%, see “Experimental Procedures”), TRKB induction was completely inhibited in cells that received the expression vector. Unlike wild-type RUNX3, the point mutant R178Q did not prevent TRKB induction (Fig. 1B). Because R178Q is predicted to disrupt DNA binding activity (see “Experimental Procedures”), the data suggest that TRKB repression is regulated through direct DNA binding by RUNX3. We next confirmed the functional status of neurotrophin receptors in a cell survival assay. The TGW cell line required culture serum for survival because the cells started to die soon after serum depletion (data not shown). Sufficient TrkB or TrkC protein should protect cells from serum-depleted cell death in the presence of their preferred ligands, BDNF or NT-3, respectively. In the mock control (green fluorescent protein was transiently expressed), BDNF supported the survival of RA-treated cells (apoptotic cells; Annexin V + 7AAD- in Fig. 1, C and D), which was consistent with the high level of induced TRKB expression. We observed that NT-3 was also sufficient to protect the mock transfectant from cell death (Fig. 1D), presumably because NT-3 binds to TrkB, albeit with less affinity compared with BDNF (2Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). In contrast, few of the RUNX3 transfectants survived in the presence of BDNF or NT-3 (Fig. 1, C and D). The point mutation R178Q completely eliminated the effect of wild-type RUNX3 (Fig. 1D), indicating that the massive cell death was not a consequence of excessive protein synthesis following transient expression. Cells transfected with mock plasmid, RUNX3, or R178Q survived in continuous culture with 10% serum (Fig. 1D). Despite the drastic change in neurotrophin receptor status, similar neurite extensions were observed in RUNX3 transfectant (data not shown). Although RUNX3 increased TRKC expression slightly (Fig. 1B), we observed cell death even in the presence of NT-3 (Fig. 1D). This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the induction of TRKC was not high enough to support cell survival in the RUNX3 transfectant (see below). Taken together, RUNX3 alone is sufficient to repress TRKB expression in vitro, whereas the regulatory mechanism of TRKC expression needs further investigation.RUNX3 Fails to Enhance TRKC under the Control of BMP, a Potential Upstream Signaling Pathway—Because the effect of RUNX3 on TRKC induction was not so prominent, it seemed possible that an upstream signal of RUNX3 might have been missing in the experimental setting of Fig. 1. One possible candidate is the BMP signaling pathway. The RUNX protein is a nuclear target of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily signaling pathways (23Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol.

Therefore, we compared the effect of RUNX3 on TRKC expression with or without BMP signaling. For this purpose, a constitutive active BMP receptor (Alk3-CA) (33Brederlau A. Faigle R. Elmi M.

To see the immediate early effects by exogenous protein synthesis, we harvested cells 12–16 h after transfection. The basal level of TRKC was varied among the different cell lines; TGW and SK-N-DZ neuroblastoma cells had a lower level of TRKC expression than the other two cell lines, LA-N-2 and SK-N-FI (Fig. 2A). However, none of these cell lines synthesized a detectable level of RUNX1 or RUNX3 (data not shown). This suggests that transcription regulators other than RUNX determine the basal level of TRKC. Similar to the results of the RA assay, RUNX3 slightly increased TRKC expression in both TGW and SK-N-DZ cells with either Alk3-CA or Alk3-KN BMP recept"

Among the ING family members, p33(ING1b) is the most intensively studied and plays an important role in the cellular stress response to DNA damage. Here we demonstrate that there is basal phosphorylation of p33(ING1b) at Ser-126 in normal physiological conditions and that this phosphorylation is increased on DNA damage. The mutation of Ser-126 to alanine dramatically shortened the half-life of p33(ING1b). Furthermore, we found that both Chk1 and Cdk1 can phosphorylate this residue. Interestingly, while Cdk1 can phosphorylate p33(ING1b) at Ser-126 in nonstress conditions, Chk1 predominantly phosphorylates this residue on DNA damage, which suggests that p33(ING1b) is a downstream target of the ATM/ATR response cascade to genotoxic stress. More importantly, our data indicate that the Ser-126 residue plays a key role in regulating the expression of cyclin B1 and proliferation of melanoma cells."

It remains unclear, however, how the MEK5-ERK5 pathway is regulated in Xenopus neural development. As SoxD is a transcription factor, we hypothesized that some growth factor should be induced by SoxD and activate the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. As the expression level of fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) is increased by SoxD, we analyzed the function of FGF13 in neural development.

As SoxD is a transcription factor, it is unlikely that SoxD directly regulates the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. It has been reported in other systems that the MEK5-ERK5 pathway is activated by a number of growth factors (11Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Therefore, we speculated that SoxD should induce enhanced expression of a growth factor that could activate the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. Our preliminary screening identified FGF13 as a possible candidate; an expression level of FGF13 could be increased by SoxD (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). FGF13 was initially termed fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 (FHF-2) and constitutes an FGF subfamily with FGF11, FGF12, and FGF14 (15Goldfarb M.

Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 409-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither knock-out nor knockdown experiments have been reported. Thus, the role of FGF13 in embryonic development has been unknown. In this study, we have shown that Xenopus FGF13 (xFGF13) regulates neural differentiation. FGF13 MOs inhibit SoxD-induced Xngnr1 expression, indicating that xFGF13 lies downstream of SoxD and upstream of Xngnr1 in a signaling pathway regulating neural differentiation. In addition, xFGF13 is shown to be involved in the activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway, which also lies downstream of SoxD and upstream of Xngnr1. We further show that FGF13 MOs inhibit expression of neural marker genes induced by Xngnr1. Molecular Cloning and Plasmid Construction—One of the isoforms of Xenopus FGF13 (xFGF13-VY) was already isolated (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number BC076721). Therefore, we designed primers based on the sequence. We performed PCR with cDNAs isolated from embryos at stage 25 and obtained a novel isoform of xFGF13, xFGF13-V. We also found a sequence in Xenopus laevis EST data base (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number BI314017) that is homologous to another isoform of FGF13 in Xenopus tropicalis. We designed primers based on the sequence of BI314017 and isolated xFGF13-S. Expression plasmids were constructed as described (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Embryonic Manipulation, LacZ Staining, Whole-mount in Situ Hybridization, and RT-PCR—In vitro fertilization, injection, LacZ staining, whole-mount in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR were performed as described (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Embryos subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization were sectioned on a cryostat Microm (Zeiss). The sequences of primer pairs used in semiquantitative RT-PCR were follows: xFGF13-VY and xFGF13-V, forward (f), 5′-CCTAAAGAGGAAAAGGATGC-3′, and reverse (r), 5′-ACGCTTCTGCTTTTTGTTGGA-3′; xFGF13-S f, 5′-TCAAACTATTTGGCTCAAAG-3′, and r, 5′-ACGCTTCTGCTTTTTGTTGGA-3′; xFGF13 (all isoforms) f, 5′-ACCTCAACTCAAAGGAATAG-3′, and r, 5′-TAATCTCGGAGTTGTGCATCTTG-3′. In real time RT-PCR, Xenopus embryonic ornithine decarboxylase (XeODC) was used as a loading control, and all values were normalized to the XeODC level.

Morpholino-oligonucleotides—Antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Tools Inc. The morpholino-oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: FGF13 MO1, 5′-TAGGCTTGATCACCTTTCCACTCAT3′; FGF13 MO2, 5′-AGAGAGCTGGCAATGGCCGCAGCCA-3′; FGF13 MO1 mis5, 5′-TACGCTTCATCACGTTTCGACTGAT-3′; FGF13 MO2 mis5, 5′-AGACAGCTCGCAATGGCGGCAGGCA-3′; ERK5 MO, 5′-CTTGCTCCTTCCTTGGCTCCGCCAT-3′;a standard control oligo (control MO), 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. Sequences complementary to the predicted start codon are underlined. Although we designed FGF13 MO2 against X. tropicalis FGF13-S (one base (the 21st base) is mismatched to X. laevis FGF13-S), we confirmed that FGF13 MO2 inhibits the translation of X. laevis FGF13-S efficiently (Fig. 4A). Oligonucleotides were resuspended in sterile filtered water and injected. Immunoblotting—Embryos were lysed in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.25 m sucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then centrifuged. The supernatant was used for immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. Kinase Assays—Animal caps were crushed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Myc-tagged xERK5 was immunoprecipitated and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 20 μg of myelin basic protein in a buffer (15 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 17 mm MgCl2 and 50 μm ATP (3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Cloning and Expression of xFGF13—We analyzed the effect of SoxD on FGF13 expression in detail. Forced expression of SoxD in animal caps increased an expression level of FGF13 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Induction of FGF13 by SoxD was not observed at stage 10, but was first observed at stage 13, and maximally at stage 16 (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that FGF13 expression is up-regulated by SoxD. We then isolated complementary DNAs encoding Xenopus FGF13 (xFGF13), and named xFGF13 isoforms after the names in murine FGF13 isoforms (20Munoz-Sanjuan I. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2589-2597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One of the isoforms of xFGF13 was already isolated (xFGF13-VY), and we isolated two novel isoforms (xFGF13-V and xFGF13-S) (Fig. 2). The temporal and special expression pattern of xFGF13 was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, A and B) and whole-mount in situ hybridization (Fig. 3C). By using a sequence conserved among all isoforms, we analyzed the temporal expression pattern of xFGF13 by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). xFGF13 was expressed maternally, and zygotic expression was observed at neurula and tailbud stages. The expression patterns of each isoform were then analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). Although maternal expression of xFGF13-VY was weak, its strong expression was observed at the tailbud stage. Strong expression of xFGF13-V was observed both maternally and at the tailbud stage. xFGF13-S expression was observed weakly at neurula stages and strongly at the tailbud stage. The analysis with a primer pair that recognizes all of the three isoforms gave a result similar to that obtained with real time PCR. Whole-mount in situ hybridization using a sequence conserved among all isoforms revealed that xFGF was expressed widely in the presumptive ectoderm during blastula, and in the dorsal structures during neurula and tailbud stages (Fig. 3C). At tailbud stages, strong expression was observed in the ventral region of neural tube (Fig. 3C, bottom).FIGURE 3Expression pattern of xFGF13. A, total RNA was isolated from embryos at the indicated stages, and expression of xFGF13 was analyzed by real time PCR.

To determine the loss-of-function phenotypes, we designed two antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides (MOs) against xFGF13 as follows: FGF13 MO1 for xFGF-VY and xFGF13-V and FGF13 MO2 for xFGF13-S. We also designed five-base mismatched MOs as follows: FGF13 MO1 mis5 for FGF13 MO1 and FGF13 MO2 mis5 for FGF13 MO2. Injection of FGF13 MOs with Myc-tagged xFGF13 mRNAs showed that FGF13 MO1 dramatically reduced the protein level of xFGF13-VY and xFGF13-V, but not xFGF13-S; FGF13 MO2 dramatically reduced the protein level of xFGF13-S, but not xFGF13-VY or xFGF13-V; and control MO, MO1 mis5, and MO2 mis5 did not reduce corresponding xFGF13 proteins (Fig. 4A and data not shown). In addition, any MOs did not affect the protein level of xERK2 (Fig. 4A). These results indicate the specificity of FGF13 MOs. We then injected control MO, FGF13 MO1 plus MO2 (FGF13 MO), or FGF13 MO1 mis5 plus MO2 mis5 (FGF13 mis-MO) into the dorsal animal blastomere on the right side. Although embryos injected with control MO or FGF13 mis-MO were normal, embryos injected with FGF13 MO on the right side showed the reduced head structure and the loss of eyes on the right side but not on the left side (Fig. 4B). These defects observed in xFGF13 morphants were very similar to those observed in xERK5 or xMEK5 morphants (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Embryos injected with FGF13 MOs and other MOs were classified into four groups according to the eye size as follows: class 1, normal or only slightly smaller; class 2, smaller; class 3, much smaller; class 4, none (Fig. 4C, left). About 80% of embryos injected with FGF13 MO showed definite defects and were classified into class 2, 3, or 4, whereas only 20 and 6% of the embryos injected with control MO and FGF13 mis-MO, respectively, showed defects (Fig. 4C, right). To further confirm the specificity of FGF13 MO, we performed rescue experiments by using xFGF13-S (rMO), in which mutations were introduced in the FGF13 MO2 target sequence. The protein level of xFGF13-S (rMO) was not reduced by FGF13 MO2 (Fig. 4A, right). The effects of FGF13 MO were rescued, although only partially, by co-injecting xFGF13-S (rMO) (Fig. 4D). These results taken together demonstrate clearly that xFGF13 plays an essential role in head development. FGF13 Regulates Neural Differentiation—To investigate the role of xFGF13 in neural development in more detail, we examined the expression of marker genes. FGF13 MO was injected into right blastomeres, and the embryos were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Although N-tubulin, a terminal neural marker gene, was expressed normally on the uninjected left side, its expression on the right side was suppressed (Fig. 5A). Nuclear localization signal sequence-fused β-galactosidase was used as a tracer. Expression of myoD, a mesodermal marker gene, was unchanged in the presence of FGF13 MO (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that xFGF13 is required for neural development. In Xenopus neural development, following neural induction, transcription factors such as SoxD and Sox2 are induced (6Mizuseki K. Kishi M. Matsui M. Nakanishi S. Sasai Y. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 579-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mizuseki K. Kishi M. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Sasai Y. Neuron. 1998; 21: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The proneural genes such as xngnr1 and neuroD are induced in this order (8Lee J.E. Hollenberg S.M. Snider L. Turner D.L. Lipnick N. Weintraub H. Science. 1995; 268: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 9Ma Q. Kintner C. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). As N-tubulin is a terminal neural marker gene, we next examined whether FGF13 MO affects early steps of neural development, such as neural induction. FGF13 MO had no effect on the expression of soxD and sox2 (Fig. 5A), indicating that xFGF13 is not required for neural induction. We further examined the effect of FGF13 MO on neural induction by animal cap assay. We used a dominant-negative form of BMP receptor (dnBMPR), whose expression mimics the activity of neural inducers. Animal caps injected with dnBMPR mRNA expressed early neural marker genes, such as soxD, zic2, zic3, zicr1, and sox2 (Fig. 5B). FGF13 MO did not suppress the dnBMPR-induced expression of soxD, zic2, zic3, and zicr1 but weakly suppressed the sox2 expression (Fig. 5B), confirming that xFGF13 is not involved in neural induction. As an expression level of xFGF13 was significantly increased by SoxD (Fig. 1, A and B), we next examined whether xFGF13 functions downstream of SoxD. As reported previously (7Mizuseki K. Kishi M. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Sasai Y. Neuron. 1998; 21: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), forced expression of SoxD resulted in the induction of neural marker genes, such as xngnr1, neuroD, N-tubulin, and NCAM (Fig. 6A). FGF13 MO as well as ERK5 MO suppressed the induction of these marker genes by SoxD (Fig. 6A). Therefore, it is likely that xFGF13 functions downstream of SoxD and upstream of Xngnr1. As the MEK5-ERK5 pathway also lies downstream of SoxD and upstream of Xngnr1 (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is possible that xFGF13 is the regulator of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway in neural differentiation. Therefore, we tested whether xFGF13 is involved in the activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. As we have shown before, the ERK5 activity was activated in the presence of dnBMPR (Fig. 6B). When FGF13 MO was injected, the dnBMPR-induced activation of ERK5 was inhibited (Fig. 6B), suggesting that xFGF13 functions as an activator of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway during neural development. FGF13 Also Functions Downstream of Xngnr1—We next examined the effect of FGF13 MO on the induction of neural tissue caused by Xngnr1, a proneural gene. As Xngnr1 promotes neuronal differentiation, expression of Xngnr1 results in the induction of NeuroD and N-tubulin (9Ma Q. Kintner C. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In addition, Xngnr1 promotes neuralization that is marked by expression of NCAM (9Ma Q. Kintner C. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). We thought that FGF13 MO would not inhibit Xngnr1-induced promotion of neural differentiation, as the results described so far indicated that xFGF13 functions upstream of Xngnr1 in a pathway regulating neural differentiation. Unexpectedly, however, FGF13 MO suppressed the Xngnr1-induced expression of these marker genes in animal caps (Fig. 7A) and in embryos (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that xFGF13 is necessary for Xngnr1-promoted neuronal differentiation and neuralization. As we have previously shown that ERK5 MO does not inhibit Xngnr1-induced expression of neural marker genes (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the function of xFGF13 downstream of Xngnr1 may not be mediated through the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. We then tested the possibility that xFGF13 is regulated by Xngnr1. In animal caps, ectopic expression of Xngnr1 induced a large increase in the expression level of xFGF13 mRNA (Fig. 7C), indicating that Xngnr1 is able to induce xFGF13 expression. Our results show the essential role of FGF13 in Xenopus neural differentiation. FGF13 MOs inhibited both the SoxD-induced Xngnr1 expression and the Xngnr1-induced NeuroD expression. The simplest model to understand these results is that xFGF13 may function at two points during neural differentiation, upstream of Xngnr1 and downstream of Xngnr1 in a signaling pathway regulating neural differentiation. In contrast, the MEK5-ERK5 pathway regulates the neural differentiation upstream of Xngnr1 but not downstream of Xngnr1 (10Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As xFGF13 is involved in the activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway, it is likely that xFGF13 functions upstream of Xngnr1 by regulating the MEK5-ERK5 pathway and functions downstream of Xngnr1 independently of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. It is also possible that other growth factors are also involved in the activation of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway upstream of Xngnr1, as ERK5 MO suppressed neural differentiation more effectively than FGF13 MO (Fig. 6A). So far, it is still unclear how the MEK5-ERK5 pathway is activated by xFGF13. As some of MAPKKKs, such as MEKK2 and MEKK3, have been shown to activate the MEK5-ERK5 pathway (21Chao T.H. Hayashi M.

A signaling pathway from xFGF13 to MEK5 should be elucidated in future studies. It also remains to be determined whether SoxD and Xngnr1 induce expression of xFGF13 mRNA directly or indirectly. FGF13 constitutes an FGF subfamily with FGF11, FGF12, and FGF14 (17Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although many studies have been reported for the biological functions of FGFs, little is known about the function of this subfamily (15Goldfarb M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). So far, FGF12-deficient mice, FGF14-deficient mice, and mice lacking both genes have been generated (15Goldfarb M.

Therefore, the importance of this FGF subfamily in embryonic development has not been understood, and our study is the first to demonstrate its essential role in neural development. As FGF13 is abundant in neural tissues in mice and chick embryos (17Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 409-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the essential role of FGF13 in neural development is conserved in vertebrates. The function of FGF13 in other species should be elucidated in future studies. We thank members of our laboratory for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2054686639,"Glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporter (EAATs)) are critical for normal excitatory signaling and maintaining subtoxic glutamate concentrations in mammalian central nervous system. Recently, a crystal structure for a homologous transporter in bacteria was reported. Still, little is understood regarding the mechanism of substrate uptake. In transmembrane domain 4, the mammalian EAATs contain a stretch of over 50 amino acids (4B-4C loop) that are absent in the bacterial protein. These residues have been suggested to be located in the large extracellular vestibule seen in the crystal structure. State-dependent trypsin-cleavage sites have been reported in this region, suggesting that the 4B-4C loop undergoes significant conformational changes. Here we employed substituted cysteine accessibility, voltage clamp fluorometry, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer on oocytes expressing mutant EAAT3 transporters to determine the location and functionality of the 4B-4C loop. We find that this loop extends from near the center of the protein and that the majority of the residues are positioned on the outer perimeter of the protein, rather than inside the vestibule. Our fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements demonstrated that these residues do not undergo large scale motions during glutamate uptake. However, our voltage clamp fluorometry studies indicate that these residues report on Na+ and glutamate binding-induced conformational changes, including a previously un-described voltage-independent component of Na+ binding to the transporter. The finding that residues far from the glutamate-binding site report on several different types of binding events suggests that the series of small conformational changes that accomplish glutamate uptake extend throughout the transporter structure.

Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Extracellular glutamate concentrations are tightly regulated by high affinity, sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) 2The abbreviations used are: EAATexcitatory amino acid transporterTMtransmembrane domainVCFvoltage clamp fluorometryFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferTMR-MTS(2(5(6) tetramethylrhodamine)-carboxylamido)-ethyl methanethiosulfonateMTSET[2-(trimethyl-ammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide)TBOAthreo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid located at or near the synapse. EAATs are involved in regulating glutamatergic signaling, transmitter recycling, and maintaining subtoxic extracellular glutamate levels. Five members of the glutamate transporter family (EAAT1–5) have been cloned, which are localized in both glial cells and neurons (for review see Ref. 1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3800) Google Scholar). Glutamate transport is coupled to and driven by the co-transport of sodium, proton, and potassium ions down their electrochemical gradients (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Little is understood, however, regarding conformational changes that occur during the transport process. excitatory amino acid transporter transmembrane domain voltage clamp fluorometry fluorescence resonance energy transfer (2(5(6) tetramethylrhodamine)-carboxylamido)-ethyl methanethiosulfonate [2-(trimethyl-ammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide) threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid A crystal structure for a glutamate transporter homologue, GltPH, found in Pyrococcus horikoshii has been reported (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure has provided invaluable information for studying EAAT structure and function, it is a static picture and does not provide the necessary information for determining the mechanism of glutamate transport. The classical model for transporter function is an alternating access scheme, in which two gates at opposite ends of a diffusion channel alternately open and close. This allows the substrate alternating access to binding sites in the transporter and thereby prevents an open channel state. To date, however, there is no specific structural evidence for intracellular and extracellular gates or for a diffusion pore for substrates. Our previous results demonstrated that mammalian and bacterial glutamate transporters are similar in structure (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both transporters appear to assemble into a trimer with a bowl-shaped external vestibule. Each subunit has its own substrate-binding site and can mediate glutamate transport independently from the other subunits (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Grewer C. Balani P. Weidenfeller C. Bartusel T. Tao Z. Rauen T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11913-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Despite these structural similarities, however, bacterial and mammalian transporters share less than 40% sequence homology. One particular region of discrepancy is found in transmembrane domain (TM) 4. This domain includes three separate helices as follows: 4A, 4B, and 4C (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In mammalian EAATs, a span of over 50 amino acids (hereby called the 4B-4C loop), which is absent from the bacterial sequence, extends from between TM 4B and TM 4C (Fig. 1A). The juncture of these two helices is located very close to the bottom center of the vestibule (Fig. 1B). It is unclear, however, where these 50 extra residues are located within the context of the bacterial crystal structure, i.e. it is unknown whether they fill the vestibule or whether they reside outside the perimeter of the crystallized transporter protein. State-dependent trypsin cleavage sites have been identified in this region, indicating that significant conformational changes may occur here during glutamate transport (6Grunewald M. Kanner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study we use substituted cysteine accessibility, voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) on EAAT3 transporters expressed in oocytes to determine the location and functionality of the 4B-4C loop. Expression of EAAT3 Transporters—The human EAAT3 isoform was used for this study. Site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro synthesis of RNA, and RNA injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes were performed as described previously (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, stage IV–V oocytes were defolliculated via collagenase treatment, followed by injection with 50 ng of RNA and incubation at 8 °C in sodium Ringer's solution (in mm: 98.5 NaCl, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.5). Oocytes were moved to 15 °C 12–15 h before experiments began. Experiments were performed 3–5 days after injection. Electrophysiology—Currents were measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described previously (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Glutamate-induced currents were calculated by subtracting the current measured in sodium Ringer's solution from the current measured in sodium Ringer's solution containing 1 mm glutamate. In experiments where reversal potential was measured, we assumed intracellular values of [Na+]i = 10 mm, [K+]i = 70 mm, pHi = 7.3, and [excitatory amino acid]i = 12 mm (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Calculation of the transport-voltage relationship was performed using Equation 1 for membrane potential (Ψ) at equilibrium, ψ=(RT/F(nNa+nH−nK−nGlu))In(([Nao]/[Nai])nNa×([Gluo]/[Glui])nGlu([Ho]/[Hi])nH([Ki]/[Ko])nK)(2)Eq. 1 Cells were first dialyzed for 12 h in Cl–-free Ringer (in mm:98 sodium gluconate, 1.8 calcium gluconate, 1 magnesium gluconate, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5). Shifts of the transporter reversal potential in response to varying external concentrations of Na+ or l-glutamate were then determined from the current blocked by 100 μm dl-TBOA (Tocris) (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). When reversal potential shifts in response to varying glutamate (10, 30, or 100 μm) were measured, solutions contained the following (in mm): 60 sodium gluconate, 40 potassium gluconate, 1.8 calcium gluconate, 1 magnesium gluconate, and 5 HEPES. When reversal potential shifts in response to varying Na+ (20, 60, or 120 mm) were measured, solutions contained the following (in mm): 40 potassium gluconate, 1.8 calcium gluconate, 1 magnesium gluconate, and 5 HEPES; sodium gluconate was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine-gluconate to maintain osmolarity. FRET Measurements—Intersubunit FRET was measured as described previously (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, we first measured the labeling kinetics for each residue with donor fluorophore (AlexaFluor-488-C5-maleimide: Molecular Probes) (Table 1). The time constant τ was determined from the following equation: L(t) = 1 – e–t/τ, where L = labeling and t = time. Oocytes expressing the individual mutant transporters were then labeled to 10% of maximum fluorescence with AlexaFluor-488 in sodium Ringer's solution, which resulted in the majority of transporters having one subunit labeled with donor fluorophore. Next, the fluorescence spectrum from the donor-labeled oocyte was measured on a Zeiss laser scanning 510 confocal microscope, using the Zeiss META detector and exciting with a 488 nm argon laser. The oocyte was then labeled to saturation with tetramethylrhodamine-MTS (TMR-MTS; Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada), and the fluorescence spectrum was measured again after the nonbound rhodamine was washed out.TABLE 1FRET efficiencies and distance estimates in the 4B-4C loopResidueτ1rdraERLΔRμm·minÅÅÅE152C628 ± 98 (2)0.027 ± 0.009 (4)0.035 ± 0.004 (4)0.325 ± 0.024 (23)63.0 ± 1.436.4 ± 0.80.5 ± 0.2 (6)Y162C400 ± 44 (2)0.015 ± 0.007 (4)0.026 ± 0.009 (4)0.782 ± 0.024 (12)45.1 ± 0.226.0 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1 (6)S173C1216 ± 145 (2)0.022 ± 0.006 (4)0.027 ± 0.003 (4)0.174 ± 0.023 (14)74.2 ± 0.942.8 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.2 (5)S183C450 ± 62 (2)0.035 ± 0.007 (4)0.018 ± 0.006 (4)0.180 ± 0.031 (16)74.8 ± 3.243.2 ± 1.80.4 ± 0.4 (5)S193C999 ± 114 (2)0.039 ± 0.008 (4)0.028 ± 0.008 (4)0.171 ± 0.020 (11)74.3 ± 1.842.9 ± 1.00.5 ± 0.6 (5)M205C821 ± 73 (3)0.021 ± 0.003 (4)0.028 ± 0.006 (4)0.187 ± 0.012 (19)72.8 ± 1.142.0 ± 0.6-1.5 ± 1.0 (6) Open table in a new tab To measure intersubunit movement, spectra were measured in a sodium-free solution (98.5 mm choline-Cl, 5 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) and a sodium Ringer's solution with 1 mm glutamate, before and after the TMR-MTS application. FRET efficiencies were measured as the decrease of the donor (AlexaFluor-488) fluorescence was caused by the acceptor fluorophores (TMR-MTS). Donor fluorescence was measured at 520 nm. To estimate intersubunit FRET distances, Equation 2 was used, E=kFRET/(1/τD+kFRET)Eq.2 where kFRET = 2/τD × (R0/R)6; where kFRET is the energy transfer rate; the Förster distance R0 is given by R0 = 0.211(κ2n–4QDJ(λ))1/6, where κ is the orientation factor; n is the refractive index of the solvent; Q is the quantum yield; and J(λ) is the spectral overlap between the donor emission and acceptor absorption. R0 was estimated for AlexaFluor-488 and TMR to be 50 Å, and κ2 was assumed to be 2/3. Equation 1 assumes that there are two equidistant acceptors for each donor (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Uncertainties in the κ2 and n can lead to errors in the estimates of R0. We have here assumed that the refractive index n between the donor and acceptor is that of water (n = 1.33). It is possible that part of the protein is between the donor and the acceptor. However, the refractive index of protein (n = 1.36–1.55 (8Voros J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 553-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar)) is very similar to that of water. In addition, R0 is proportional to the 6th root of 1/n4. Therefore, protein between the donor and the acceptor can only cause a maximal error in the estimated distance R between the donor and the acceptor by <11%. We measured the anisotropy to estimate the possible range of values for κ2 for all residues (see below and Table 1). The range of possible κ2 was within 0.5–1.2 for all residues. This range corresponds to a worst case error in R0 of 5 Å. Most likely the errors are much smaller because the estimates of κ2 do not take into consideration the depolarization attributable to the FRET process itself (9Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York1999: 291-318Crossref Google Scholar). Anisotropy and κ2 Range—Anisotropy was measured as described previously (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, anisotropy was measured from oocytes labeled with only AlexaFluor-488 (donor anisotropy, rd) or TMR-MTS (acceptor anisotropy, ra). The collimated emission signal was split into parallel and perpendicular components by using a polarizing cube beam splitter, and the two components were measured simultaneously. Equation 3 for anisotropy (r) was used. r=I∥−I⊥/I∥+2I⊥Eq. 3 where I∥ is the parallel and I∥ is the perpendicular emitted light with respect to the polarized excitation light. The error bound in the distance measurements was calculated by setting the upper and lower limits for κ2 by using anisotropy values for the donor (rd) and acceptor (ra) as shown in Equation 4, κmax2=2/3(1+Frd+Fra+3FrdFra)κmin2=2/3(1−(Frd+Fra)/2)Eq. 4 where Frd and Fra are defined as (rd/r0)0.5 and (ra/r0)0.5, respectively. r0 is the fundamental anisotropy (9Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York1999: 291-318Crossref Google Scholar). Voltage Clamp Fluorometry—VCF experiments were performed as described previously (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Oocytes were labeled for 60 min with 10 μm AlexaFluor-546-C5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) in sodium Ringer's solution. Fluorescence changes were recorded under voltage clamp using an upright microscope (Leica) with a ×20 quartz objective and a photo-diode (pin-020A, UDT Sensors, Inc.). The objective was focused on the animal pole, and fluorescence was monitored through a rhodamine filter cube: exciter, HQ545/×30; dichroic, Q570LP; and emitter, HQ620/60m. Fluorescence signals were low pass-filtered at 200–500 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz. Fluorescence traces were monitored with Clampex 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The amino acid residues between TM 4B and TM 4C, i.e. the 4B-4C loop, which are present in the mammalian EAATs but not in the bacterial homologues, have been postulated previously to be accessible to the extracellular milieu (10Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To determine the location of the 4B-4C loop in relation to the rest of the protein structure, as well as to determine whether conformational changes occur in this region during substrate transport, we introduced cysteine residues at ∼10 residues apart, from Glu-152 to Met-205 (human EAAT3 numbering). Expression and current-voltage relationships (I/V) for these mutants were very similar to those of wild-type EAAT3 (data not shown). Modification of the introduced cysteine residues with 1 mm MTSET for 5 min had only a small or modest (<25%), if any, effect on the uptake currents (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, fluorescent maleimide probes (AlexaFluor-546) could be attached to each of the cysteine residues. Labeling with 10 μm AlexaFluor-546 for 60 min resulted in a minimum of 5-fold greater fluorescence labeling over wild-type EAAT3 for each of the cysteine mutants (data not shown). The I/Vs for glutamate-induced currents in the fluorophore-labeled mutants were similar to those of unlabeled mutants and wild-type EAAT3 (Fig. 2B). To characterize the relative position of the 4B-4C loop as well as the nature of the conformational changes that may occur in this region, we used FRET on the mutant transporters expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We have successfully used FRET on human EAATs in the past, and we found that our distance measurements align with those within the crystal structure of the bacterial homologue GltPH (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We first measured the kinetics for labeling each of the cysteine mutations with AlexaFluor-488 (donor fluorophore; Table 1). Interestingly, the cysteine residues introduced in the 4B-4C loop had relatively fast labeling time constants compared with those of the introduced residues in other regions of the protein (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This suggests that the 4B-4C loop is located in a region that is readily accessible to the extracellular solution. Similar to our previous methodology (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we used the labeling time constant to calculate the amount of donor fluorophore needed to label 10% of the introduced cysteines. This amount of labeling corresponded to ∼90% of the donor-labeled EAAT3 multimers having only one of three labeled subunits (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After measuring the fluorescence from the donor-labeled cells, we labeled with a saturating dose of acceptor fluorophore (TMR-MTS). We used the subsequent percentage of decrease in donor fluorophore, which is directly related to the FRET efficiency (E), to calculate the distance between fluorophores (13Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Our distance calculations were based on a trimeric architecture for EAAT3, with one donor fluorophore and two equidistant acceptors. Table 1 shows the FRET efficiencies and corresponding intersubunit distances for the cysteine residues introduced into the 4B-4C loop of EAAT3. All of the intersubunit distances, except for Y162C, were in the range of measurements that we previously designated to be on the outer rim of the protein. We also showed previously that residue Met-207 is close to the center of the vestibule (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the bulk of the 4B-4C loop lies on the outer perimeter of the transport protein, forming a loop that stretches outward from Tyr-162 and then back toward the center again between Met-205 and Ser-207. In Fig. 3, we propose a model for the position of the 4B-4C loop. We next tested whether the 4B-4C loop undergoes large conformational changes during glutamate uptake. We measured the intersubunit FRET in both sodium-free Ringer's solution (100 mm extracellular choline+) and sodium Ringer (100 mm extracellular Na+) containing 1 mm glutamate, conditions that favor extracellular- and intracellular-facing glutamate-binding sites, respectively (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the application of 1 mm glutamate induced currents in each of the fluorophore-labeled mutants, suggesting that the transporters function normally. However, as shown in Table 1, the application of glutamate did not significantly change FRET efficiencies between the residues in the 4B-4C loop. This indicates that if conformational changes do indeed occur in this region during glutamate uptake, they are too small to be detected by FRET measurements. We further tested the functionality of the 4B-4C loop by simultaneously recording currents and fluorescence emissions from AlexaFluor-546-labeled mutant transporters by using VCF. The addition of 1 mm glutamate induced a current that was accompanied by a fluorescence change in each of the mutant transporters (Fig. 4). We have previously demonstrated that similar fluorescence changes in fluorophore-labeled EAATs are due to substrate-induced conformational rearrangements in the transporter (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this work, fluorescence changes were also seen in all but one of the mutants (E152C) when extracellular Na+ was replaced with choline (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that the 4B-4C loop reports on conformational changes in the protein, changes that are due to sodium and glutamate binding and/or translocation. Interestingly, exceptionally large fluorescence changes were measured from M205C (>30%) compared with fluorescence changes seen from A430C (∼5%) in our previous work (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Na+-dependent transient currents occur in EAATs as a result of changes in membrane voltage, and that these transient currents are the result of binding and unbinding of Na+ ions to sites within the membrane electric field (14Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 15Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested that in the absence of glutamate and at voltages above 100 mV, glutamate transporters should primarily be in a Na+-unbound state. Consistent with these results, our previous work on fluorophore-labeled EAAT3 A430C showed that at more negative potentials Na+-dependent conformational changes are observed in response to changes in the membrane potential even in the absence of glutamate, and these conformational changes are not observed above 100 mV (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, fluorescence changes were seen in all but one of the mutants (E152C) when extracellular Na+ was replaced with choline. Three of the residues (Y162C, S173C, and S193C) showed voltage-dependent fluorescent changes similar to A430C, i.e. no fluorescence changes were seen above 100 mV. Interestingly, two of the residues within the 4B-4C loop, S183C and M205C, do report florescence changes at voltages above 100 mV in response to changes in Na+ concentration while in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 5, A–C). The mutant transporters were labeled with AlexaFluor-546, and voltage steps between −160 and +160 mV were applied; the concentration of Na+ was varied from 0 to 200 mm while no glutamate was present. The different fluorescence intensities seen in the various sodium concentrations in Fig. 5A are presumably what cause the fluorescence changes for S183C and M205C observed at −80 mV in response to the removal of Na+ (Fig. 4). At +160 mV, the Km for Na+ binding was 66.2 ± 12 mm with a Hill coefficient (nH) of 2.4 ± 0.4 (n = 3) for S183C, and Km = 84.6 ± 8 mm with nH = 2.8 ± 0.3 (n = 5) for M205C (Fig. 5, B and C). For S183C at −160 mV, the Km for Na+ binding was 65.9 ± 2 mm with nH = 2.1 ± 0.2, similar to the values at +160 mV. The Km value for Na+ binding reported by M205C also did not change significantly over the range of voltages tested (Km = 85.8 ± 10 mm at −160 mV). To determine whether S183C and M205C transport glutamate with the same stoichiometry as wild type, we examined the effect of varying the ionic concentrations on the glutamate transport reversal potential. Reversal potential shifts in S183C (Fig. 5, D and E) and M205C (data not shown) in response to varying external Na+ and glutamate concentrations were similar to what has been previously reported for wild-type EAATs (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 16Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these mutations transport glutamate with a stoichiometry similar to that of wild-type EAAT3, i.e. 3Na+:1 glutamate. Furthermore, both S183C and M205C have voltage-dependent Na+ transient currents, and these transient currents can be blocked by the addition of the EAAT blocker TBOA (Fig. 5F). This demonstrates that S183C and M205C also have a voltage-dependent component for Na+ binding. Maximal fluorescence changes between 0 Na+ and 200 mm Na+ were up to 4% for S183C and 30% for M205C (Fig. 5, B and C). These fluorescence changes were also saturable and are thus unlikely to be the result of direct effects of the membrane voltage on the fluorophore. Because glutamate was not present in the experiments, it appears that S183C and M205C report on voltage-independent Na+ binding to EAAT3 transporters, and that this voltage-independent Na+-binding event precedes the binding of glutamate. It was postulated previously that the 4B-4C loop may be accommodated within the extracellular vestibule of eukaryotic EAATs (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Our intersubunit distance measurements, however, indicate that the majority of the 4B-4C loop is located on the outer perimeter of the transporter protein, suggesting that it forms a loop that stretches from inside the vestibule to the outer edge of the protein and back toward the center again. It is possible that the 4B-4C loop extends out between TM 4A and the long extracellular loop that connects TM 3 and TM 4, and then fills the prominent intersubunit “crevices” described by the crystal structure of the bacterial transporter, GltPH (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The location of the 4B-4C loop at the periphery of the EAATs may explain the difference in shape and volume when EM images of mammalian EAAT transporters are compared with the crystal structure of bacterial GltPH (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17Raunser S. Haase W. Bostina M. Parcej D.N. Kuhlbrandt W. J. Mol.

A. 2000; 97: 8641-8646Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, mutant EAAT3 transporters function normally when residues in the 4B-4C loop are covalently modified, suggesting that this region is not critical for substrate binding or for the translocation process. In addition, our FRET measurements do not indicate significant changes in the intersubunit distances during substrate binding and/or transport. In our VCF experiments, on the other hand, we detect changes in single fluorophore emissions from the 4B-4C loop in response to substrate application to the transporter. This demonstrates that these residues do indeed report on Na+ and glutamate binding, and potentially glutamate uptake as well. Taking into account both the FRET and VCF data, it appears that the 4B-4C loop undergoes only very small conformational changes, changes that are too small to be detected with FRET measurements. This is consistent with our previous results that suggest that small local conformational changes, rather than large global ones, mediate glutamate uptake in EAATs (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is possible that some of the fluorescence changes observed in the 4B-4C loop are caused by the movement of another domain of the transporter relative to the 4B-4C loop and the fluorophore. For example, hairpin loop 2 (HP-2) has been postulated to be an important component of the glutamate-binding site and a potential external gate for the transporter (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 19Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). HP-2 lies directly above the beginning and end of the 4B-4C loop, which are near the center of the vestibule (Fig. 3). Thus, it is conceivable that the large fluorescence changes observed from M205C, for example, could be attributable to HP-2 moving relative to M205C during substrate binding and/or uptake. Previous work has shown that EAAT-specific transient currents occur in response to voltage steps in the presence of Na+, and that these transient currents reflect voltage-dependent binding and un-binding of Na+ ions to sites within the membrane electric field (20Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Our current studies using VCF demonstrate that the 4B-4C loop reports on an additional, voltage-independent sodium-binding event. This binding event was recorded in the absence of glutamate, suggesting that this voltage-independent binding of Na+ precedes glutamate binding in the transport cycle. The simplest explanation for this finding is that there are at least two independent Na+-binding sites in each subunit of the transporter, one to which binding is voltage-dependent and the other to which binding is voltage-independent (Fig. 6). It has been shown in wild-type EAATs that the uptake of one glutamate is coupled to the uptake of three Na+ ions (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 16Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where at least one Na+ binds to the transporter after glutamate (21Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, a maximum of two Na+ are thought to bind before each glutamate. At least one of these two Na+ binds in a voltage-dependent manner (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

This is also true for the EAAT3 mutations S183C and M205C (Fig. 5F). Interestingly, we find that the Hill coefficient for voltage-independent Na+ binding in the absence of glutamate is between 2 and 3 (Fig. 5, B and C). This leads to the following paradox: Even though there are at most two coupled Na+ ions that bind before glutamate, and one of these two Na+ ions binds in a voltage-dependent manner, the Hill coefficient for the fluorescence suggests that there is a voltage-independent binding of 2 or more Na+ ions. This would suggest that there are more than 2 Na+ ions (at least one voltage-dependent and two or more voltage-independent) that bind before glutamate. So where do the additional Na+ ions come from? Cooperativity between the individual subunits of glutamate transporters for the binding of Na+ would provide an explanation of all the data. In other words, the Hill coefficient of >2 may reflect cooperativity between the three subunits of the glutamate transporter for the voltage-independent binding of one Na+ to each subunit. Because TM 4, and presumably the 4B-4C loop, is located directly between subunits, these regions could potentially transmit and report on cooperative conformational changes induced by Na+ binding. The cooperativity between subunits suggested here does not necessarily contradict earlier work, including our own, which demonstrated that glutamate transporter subunits could independently mediate glutamate-activated currents (4Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Grewer C. Balani P. Weidenfeller C. Bartusel T. Tao Z. Rauen T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11913-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Koch H.P. Brown R.L. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2943-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These studies measured two separate events; in the present study, we suggest a cooperative effort between subunits for the binding of Na+, whereas the previous work showed that glutamate can activate a current in each independent subunit of an EAAT multimer. An alternative explanation for our results is that S183C reports on the binding of additional Na+ ions that are not stoichiometrically coupled to glutamate transport, and that the binding sites for these ions are located outside of the membrane electric field. The role of these ions could potentially be for allosteric modification of the protein or for the creation of a binding site for another molecule. However, the voltage-independent Na+ ions could very likely belong to the stoichiometrically coupled Na+ ions, because the Km value for the voltage-independent binding of Na+ is in a similar physiological range as that of the stoichiometrically coupled Na+ ion(s) which precedes glutamate binding (7Larsson H.P. Tzingounis A.V. Koch H.P. Kavanaugh M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In addition, the increased Hill coefficient that we find for voltage-independent Na+ binding is not unusual and does not necessarily reflect uncoupled ions, as previous studies have also measured high Hill coefficients (>3) for the binding of Na+ ions required for glutamate uptake (21Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Klockner U. Storck T. Conradt M. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14594-14596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the 4B-4C loop is as follows: 1) it is not crucial to binding or transport, and 2) it is located on the outer perimeter of the protein away from the glutamate-binding sites located in the center of the subunits (3Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar); yet, 3) the 4B-4C loop still reports on substrate-induced conformational changes, including that of a previously undetected voltage-independent Na+-binding event. The fact that regions far from the glutamate-binding site report on substrate binding suggests that the glutamate transporter is a dynamic and flexible molecule, where changes in one region of the protein can extend to more distal domains. In agreement with this, we have not yet found a single residue in the protein that does not report on fluorescence changes during either Na+ or glutamate binding. 3H. P. Koch and H. P. Larsson, unpublished observations. The fact that different types of fluorescence changes are induced by binding of the different substrates suggests that substrate uptake may be accomplished by a series of small conformational changes in the binding site(s); these conformational changes may be extended to or “felt” in regions that are further away, such as the 4B-4C loop. The role of the 4B-4C loop in glutamate transport is as yet unknown. In the bacterial crystal structure, it can be seen that TM 4 forms intersubunit contacts. Thus, this entire domain itself or specifically the 4B-4C loop may be important in stabilizing these intersubunit contacts and the oligomeric structure of the transporter. In light of our recent findings, it may also be that this region is important for coordinating the cooperativity of the three subunits for the binding of Na+ ions.

So far, TATA and INR are the only core promoter elements known to be sufficient to direct accurate RNAP II transcription initiation in the absence of other core promoter elements. TATA-directed RNAP II transcription has been studied in great detail and is well understood. At TATA-containing promoters, PIC assembly is initiated by stable binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID to the TATA DNA sequence, which creates a platform for the recruitment of the remaining GTFs and RNAP II (11Bushnell D.A.

At complex core promoters, TATA box function is modulated by additional core promoter elements such as BREs and the INR. BREs can be found immediately up-(BREu) and/or downstream (BREd)of the TATA box sequence and can either stimulate or repress TATA-directed transcription (15Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TATA/INR cooperativity dramatically increases basal promoter activity compared with the presence of either TATA or INR alone (18Smale S.T.

Up to date the vast majority of studies into the basic mechanisms underlying RNAP II transcription initiation were carried out with TATA-containing model promoters and little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying INR-directed transcription initiation. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that only a minority (<20%) of RNAP II promoters in the human genome contain a TATA element. In contrast, about half of the RNAP II promoters were found to contain an INR consensus sequence (4Suzuki Y. Tsunoda T. Sese J. Taira H. Mizushima-Sugano J. Hata H. Ota T. Isogai T. Tanaka T.

Importantly, the basal RNAP II transcription machinery, which has been biochemically defined as the minimal set of protein factors necessary and sufficient to direct basal levels of accurate RNAP II transcription initiation at TATA-containing model promoters (TBP, TFIIB, -E, -F, -H, RNAP II; Roeder (14Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar)) is not sufficient to support INR-directed transcription initiation (23Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.-X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). INR-dependent TATA-less transcription as well as stimulation of TATA-dependent transcription by the INR requires in addition TAF subunits within TFIID, TFIIA, and so-called TAF- and INR-dependent cofactor activity (TICs) (21Kaufmann J.

So far, reconstitution of INR-mediated transcription initiation with purified factors has not been achieved and INR function can only be studied in crude nuclear extracts (NE) or in reconstituted systems supplemented with partially purified TIC activity (2Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 23Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.-X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In nuclear extracts, which provide a complement of nuclear factors at ratios close to the physiological situation, basal promoter strength is determined by a complex interplay between positive and negative cofactors that affect the activity of the basal RNAP II transcription machinery (26Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Roeder R.G. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Among these, negative cofactor 2 (NC2; aka Dr1/DRAP1) has been well characterized as a potent repressor of basal transcription from TATA-containing promoters. NC2 is a heterodimer composed of NC2α and NC2β subunits, which interact through H2A/H2B-type histone-fold motifs. NC2 can repress basal promoter activity by binding to the TBP/TATA complex intermediate, which prevents recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB and, hence, PIC assembly (26Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G.

Remarkably, stimulation of TATA-dependent transcription by the INR resembles an activator-dependent mechanism: INR stimulation strongly enhances recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB and, at the same time, inhibits NC2 binding during PIC assembly. These findings suggest that activators and the INR element stimulate basal promoter activity through similar or related mechanisms. Promoter Constructs—All promoter constructs used in this study are pGEM7Zf (Promega) derivatives. pECHIV-1(−111/+80) and pTOHIV(−33/+80) contain HIV-1 LTR promoter sequences from −111 to +80 and from −33 to +80, respectively (34Castanño E. Gross P. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Oelgeschläger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pPGTdT(TATA/+59) contains within an ApaI/BamHI insert mTdT core promoter sequences from −41 to +59 with a consensus TATA box at position −30 (22Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) in front of 5 GAL4 binding sites. pPGTdT(TATAΔINR/+59) is a derivative of pPGTdT(TATA/+59) containing six point mutations which eliminate INR function without affecting start site selection (22Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). pTOG5HSP(−49/+38) contains the human hsp70 core promoter from −49 to +38 (35Oelgeschläger T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). pPGG5HSP(TdTINR) is a derivative of pTOG5HSP(−49/+38) in which hsHSP70 core promoter sequences from −4to +5 were substituted by the corresponding mTdT promoter sequence containing the INR element. “L” variants (–L, Fig. 1) of mTdT and hsHSP70 promoter constructs contain additional 26 bp of pGEM7Zf polylinker sequence downstream of the core promoter region, which do not affect core promoter activity and which allow to analyze transcripts originating from different core promoter variants in parallel by primer extension using the same radioactive primer. Antibodies—To generate antibodies for NC2α and NC2β, rabbits were immunized with peptides SAPDEEDEEDYDS (amino acid residues 193–205 in human NC2α) and SAS-NQAGSSQDEEDDDDI (amino acid residues 159–176 in human NC2β), respectively. Antibodies specific for the NC2α and NC2β epitopes were affinity-purified from selected rabbit antisera. Rabbit polyclonal anti-TFIIB (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal anti-RNAP II CTD antibody (8WG16; Covance Research Products) are commercially available. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for human TBP, TAF5, TFIIEα, TFIIAα/β, TFIIH p62, and human Srb7 (MED21) were kindly provided by R. G. Roeder (Rockefeller University). J. Kaufmann (Silence Therapetics) provided rabbit polyclonal antibody for human TAF2 and A. Hoffmann (University of California, San Diego) rabbit polyclonal antibody for human TAF12. Nuclear Extracts and Proteins—Extracts and proteins were stored in BC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) containing 100 mm KCl. NE were prepared as described (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). NE lacking NC2 (NE[ΔNC2]) was obtained by chromatography over protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Biosciences) resin covalently cross-linked to rabbit polyclonal antibody for human NC2α in BC buffer containing 500 mm KCl and 0.1% IGEPAL-CA-630 (Sigma). Depletion of TBP and TFIID TAFs from HeLa NE or NE[ΔNC2] to generate NE lacking TFIID (NE[ΔD] or NE[ΔDΔNC2]) was carried out as described (35Oelgeschläger T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purification of GTFs and RNAP II for the reconstituted in vitro transcription is described in the supplemental information. Purification of Recombinant Human NC2 Complex (6His:NC2α/f:NC2β)—Human 6His:tagged NC2α and FLAG epitope:tagged NC2β subunits were co-expressed in Escherichia coli (see supplemental information) and rNC2 complex was purified by sequential affinity purification on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) in BC-buffer containing 500 mm KCl and on anti-FLAG (M2) antibody agarose (Sigma) in BC-buffer containing 250 mm KCl and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma). In Vitro Transcription and Primer Extension Analysis—In vitro transcription and primer extension analysis was carried out as described previously (34Castanño E. Gross P. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Oelgeschläger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Template Recruitment Assays—DNA fragments containing promoter sequences of interest (HIV-1 core: 334 bp, transcription start site (TSS) at position 228; HIV1-activated: 373 bp, TSS at position 226, mTdT-TATA and mTdT-TATA/INR: 424 bp, TSS at position 222) with a 5′-Biotin link at the downstream end were generated by PCR, gel-purified, and immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assemble PICs, 200 fmol of immobilized promoter templates were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract protein and/or purified factors for 60 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of transcription buffer (35Oelgeschläger T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) containing 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630, 100 ng pGEM7Zf vector as a competitor DNA, and 0.1 mg/ml human insulin or bovine serum albumin. PICs were separated from unbound material on a magnetic separator and were washed once with transcription buffer containing 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630. One-half of the purified PICs was analyzed by in vitro transcription, the other half by immunoblotting. Positive- and Negative-acting Factors Contribute to INR-selective Transcription in HeLa Nuclear Extracts—To investigate INR-mediated stimulation of basal transcription at TATA-containing promoters we compared the activity of simple model core promoters containing only a consensus TATA box (TATA) with variants containing both a consensus TATA box and an INR element (TATA/INR, Fig. 1). The well characterized murine terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase promoter (mTdT) is a natural TATA-less promoter with a prototypical INR element as the only essential core promoter element (18Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). A mTdT-TATA/INR variant was obtained by introducing a consensus TATA box between positions −31 and −25 using site-directed mutagenesis (22Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A mTdT-TATA core promoter variant with a TATA box as the only essential core promoter element was generated by introducing six nucleotide substitutions in the INR of mTdT-TATA/INR. These point mutations were previously shown to eliminate INR function without affecting transcription start site selection (22Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The human heat shock protein 70 gene core promoter (hsHSP70-TATA) contains a consensus TATA element 30 bp upstream of the transcription start and lacks an INR element (37Drabent B. Genthe A. Benecke B.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8933-8948Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A hsHSP70 variant containing both TATA box and INR elements (hsHSP70-TATA/INR) was constructed by introducing the mTdT INR element at the hsHSP70 start site region using site-directed mutagenesis. We used two-template in vitro transcription assays to determine the relative activity of corresponding TATA and TATA/INR promoter variants. Equimolar amounts of TATA-only and TATA/INR core promoter variants were transcribed in parallel and RNA products were analyzed quantitatively by primer extension analysis with the same radiolabeled primer (Fig. 1). Consistent with results of earlier studies (18Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 20Zenzie-Gregory B. O'Shea-Greenfield A.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Martinez E. Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), insertion of an INR element strongly stimulated the activity of TATA-only promoters in standard in vitro transcription assays containing NE protein at a concentration of 2 mg/ml or above (Fig. 1, lane 4). However, titration experiments revealed that enhanced transcription activity of TATA/INR templates relative to TATA-only templates was strongly dependent on the NE protein concentration in the assay. At a 10-fold lower nuclear extract concentration (0.2 mg/ml) compared with standard conditions mTdT-TATA and mTdT-TATA/INR variants are transcribed with similar activity (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Titrating increasing amounts of NE protein leads to dramatic stimulation of transcription from the mTdT-TATA/INR template but enhances transcription from the mTdT-TATA promoter only very moderately (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–4). At an NE protein concentration of 1.8 mg/ml, the mTdT-TATA/INR promoter is transcribed with ∼100-fold higher activity than the mTdT-TATA variant lacking an INR element (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Similarly, strongly enhanced transcription activity of the hsHSP70-TATA/INR promoter relative to the corresponding hsHSP70-TATA variant could only be observed at NE protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml and above (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, at an intermediate NE protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml (Fig. 1B, lane 2) the hsHSP70-TATA promoter is transcribed with 5-fold higher activity than its INR-containing counterpart HSP70-TATA/INR. We point out that we observed similar results when we assayed the activity of TATA and TATA/INR promoter variants at varying NE protein concentrations site-by-site in separate reactions (data not shown). Thus the differences in the relative transcription activity of TATA/INR and TATA-only core promoters in response to increasing NE protein concentrations do not simply result from competition between these two promoters for a common limiting factor in our two-template transcription assays. We infer from the results of the NE titration experiments shown in Fig. 1 the following. First, low amounts of NE protein fail to support stimulation of basal promoter activity by the INR. This situation is reminiscent of in vitro systems reconstituted with purified GTFs and RNAP II, which do not support INR function (23Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.-X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and Fig. 4C). An INR-specific cofactor activity appears to be limiting in our HeLa nuclear extracts. It seems likely that this activity corresponds to a TAF- and INR-specific cofactor (TIC) described previously (23Martinez E. Ge H. Tao Y. Yuan C.-X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, this remains to be established. Second, transcription from TATA-only promoters appears to be selectively repressed at higher NE protein concentrations. This is particularly evident from data obtained with hsHSP70 promoter variants (Fig. 1B), but can also be inferred from the fact that mTdT-TATA transcription is not significantly stimulated with increasing NE (Fig. 1A). A selective repression of transcription from promoter templates containing only a TATA box with increasing NE concentration was also noted in a previous study, in which the activity of TATA- and TATA/INR-containing promoter templates was compared in NE titration experiments (20Zenzie-Gregory B. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2823-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of titration experiments suggest that INR-enhanced basal transcription activity from TATA-containing promoters in human NE results from (i) a selective stimulation of basal transcription in the presence of the INR element and INR-specific cofactor activity (i.e. TIC) and, at the same time, (ii) a selective repression of transcription from TATA-containing promoters lacking an INR. INR-stimulated TATA-dependent Basal Transcription Is Resistant to NC2 Repression—It was reported earlier that the NC2 (Dr1/DRAP1) complex, a ubiquitous repressor of TATA-dependent transcription (28Mermelstein F. Yeung K. Cao J. Inostroza J.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Eagelson K. Landsman D. Levitt P. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Goppelt A. Stelzer G. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), inhibits basal transcription from diverse TATA-containing core promoters with varying efficiency (38Kim J. Parvin J.D. Shykind B.M. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18405-18412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, specific core promoter elements affecting differential repression by NC2 had not been identified. To test if NC2 repression is affected by the presence of an INR, we depleted NC2 from HeLa NE using a polyclonal antibody raised against the NC2α subunit. Depletion of NC2α was quantitative and resulted in co-depletion of ∼90% of the NC2β subunit (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We found previously that an antibody for the NC2β subunit selectively depleted the CTD-phosphorylated RNAP IIO form along with NC2 (34Castanño E. Gross P. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Oelgeschläger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, RNAP II levels were not detectably affected when HeLa NE was depleted with our antibody raised against the NC2α subunit (Fig. 1C). It is possible that our NC2α antibody disrupts interactions between the RNAP IIO form and NC2. Comparative analysis of untreated NE and NC2-depleted NE (NE[ΔNC2]) in titration experiments revealed that at low NE protein concentrations, which do not support INR function, NC2 depletion caused a similar de-repression of TATA-only and TATA/INR promoter variants (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 5; Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, at higher NE protein concentrations supporting INR stimulation of basal transcription levels, depletion of NC2 selectively increased transcription from TATA-only promoter templates, but had comparatively little effect on the activity of the corresponding TATA/INR variants (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2–4 with lanes 6–8; Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7; Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). A selective de-repression of the TATA-only variant upon NC2 depletion was particularly evident at the minimal NE protein concentration at which INR function could be observed: in the presence of 0.6 mg/ml NE protein the mTdT-TATA/INR promoter has 8–10fold higher activity than the mTdT-TATA promoter variant (Figs. 1A, lane 2 and 2A, lane 6). Under these conditions NC2 depletion increases mTdT-TATA promoter activity 12–16-fold, but increases mTdT-TATA/INR promoter activity only 1.5–2-fold (compare Figs. 1A, lanes 2 and 6 and 2A, lanes 6 and 7). As a result, INR-se"

Notably, both vesicular and nonvesicular transport mechanisms have been proposed. The initial trafficking of H-Ras to the plasma membrane was therefore examined in more detail. In untreated cells, H-Ras appeared at the plasma membrane more rapidly than a protein carried by the conventional exocytic pathway, and no H-Ras was visible on Golgi membranes in >80% of the cells. H-Ras was still able to reach the plasma membrane when COP II-directed transport was disrupted by two different mutant forms of Sar1, when COP I-mediated vesicular traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi was inhibited with brefeldin A, or when microtubules were disrupted by nocodazole. Although some H-Ras was present in the secretory pathway, protein that reached the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment was unable to move further in the presence of nocodozale. These results identify an alternative mechanism for H-Ras trafficking that circumvents conventional COPI-, COPII-, and microtubule-dependent vesicular transport. Thus, H-Ras has two simultaneous but distinct means of transport and need not depend on vesicular trafficking for its delivery to the plasma membrane.

In neural cells, calcium signals cause calmodulin to bind to plasma membrane-bound K-Ras4B and trigger its internalization through a protein-mediated, cytoplasmic shuttle mechanism (11Fivaz M.

For H-Ras, N-Ras, and yeast Ras2, a second lipid modification can occur, in which a palmitoyl lipid is attached to additional cysteines near the farnesylated C terminus. A two-subunit protein acyltransferase enzyme that attaches palmitates to H-Ras and N-Ras in mammalian cells has only recently been identified and may be located on ER and Golgi membranes (12Smotrys J.E.

Another mammalian acyltransferase, Huntington interacting protein-14 (HIP-14), is distributed on ER/Golgi membranes and has been reported to enhance vesicular trafficking of multiple acylated proteins (16Huang K.

Additional palmitoyltransferase enzymes are likely to be located in the plasma membrane, because mutant yeast and mammalian Ras proteins that reach the plasma membrane without associating with ER or Golgi membranes can be palmitoylated (18Booden M.A. Baker T.L.

Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6574-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The movement of H-Ras from the cytosolic surface of the vast ER membrane network is the first step in its journey to the plasma membrane. Two recent reports have laid the framework of this path. These studies propose that nonpalmitoylated (but farnesylated) H-Ras distributes rapidly between cytosolic and transient, nonspecific membrane-bound phases. Wherever H-Ras encounters an acyltransferase and is palmitoylated, it becomes “kinetically trapped” on the membranes (20Sang S.L. Silvius J.R. J. Pept. Res. 2005; 66: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and, as a result, can then be retained on vesicles and moved onward via traditional vesicular means (21Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I.H. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 22Goodwin J.S. Drake K.R. Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Proteins that control vesicular trafficking at the sites where acyltransferases are found thus become relevant for H-Ras transport. However, the model currently does not address whether a farnesylated H-Ras will need a partner protein to mask its lipid group during its cytosolic phase. These possibilities give importance to understanding the steps that H-Ras takes as it makes its way from the ER to the plasma membrane. A great deal is known about vesicular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi. Formation of vesicles on the ER begins with assembly of a COP II complex of proteins around the site, termed an ER exit site (ERES), at which the newly cargo-loaded vesicle will form (23Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 24Aridor M. Fish K.N. Bannykh S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein that initiates this event is the GTPase, Sar1. GTP-binding mutants of Sar1 disrupt this cycle, and inhibit COP II-mediated vesicle transport from the ER to Golgi (26Liu W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the COP II vesicles that are released from the widely dispersed ERES then seem to merge into a perinuclear vesiculo-tubular center sometimes termed the ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment (ERGIC). From here, some vesicles move onward to the Golgi, whereas others return to the ER (27McMahon H.T. Mills I.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). COP I-coated vesicles mediate anterograde transport from the ERGIC to Golgi and retrograde traffic from Golgi membranes to the ER (28Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C.S. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 29Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The fungal product brefeldin A (BFA) prevents the COP I complex from binding to membranes. This causes collapse of the Golgi stacks, as the membranes and proteins of the Golgi rapidly drain backwards into the ER, and also impairs anterograde trafficking beyond the ERGIC (30Bannykh S.I. Plutner H. Matteson J. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2005; 6: 803-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, BFA inhibits vesicular transport at a separate point and by a mechanism distinct from that of Sar1 mutants. BFA has been reported to partially inhibit transport of a chimeric GFP protein with a lipidated C terminus derived from H-Ras (3Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, another study reported continued transport of both H-Ras and another GTPase, TC10, to the plasma membrane in BFA-treated cells (31Watson R.T. Furukawa M. Chiang S-H. Boeglin D. Kanzaki M. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unresolved to what extent BFA-sensitive, conventional vesicular trafficking contributes to H-Ras transport. The yeast Ras2 protein (which is modified by both farnesyl isoprenoid and palmitoyl lipids) has been reported to use a nonconventional pathway for trafficking (19Dong S. Mitchell D.A. Lobo S. Zhao L. Bartels D.J. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6574-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These precedents prompted us to examine the mechanisms by which mammalian H-Ras accesses the plasma membrane, with particular attention to the initial steps at its release from the ER. The results indicate that two distinct routes for H-Ras transport operate simultaneously, and that a nonconventional, COP I- and COP II-independent mechanism moves the bulk of H-Ras to the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, when traditional vesicular trafficking is blocked, H-Ras that has entered that pathway appears unable to switch to the nonconventional pathway. This suggests that the choice of pathway, and the mechanism of transport, is determined prior to ER disengagement. Mutants, Plasmids, and Antibodies—H-Raswt, H-RasQ61L, and GFP-H-Ras were expressed from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for YFP-GT46 and the monomeric GFP (mGFP) (32Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D.

Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) were gifts from Anne Kenworthy (Vanderbilt University), with permission of Roger Tsien (University of California, San Diego). The cDNAs for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Sar1T39N-HA and Sar1H79G-HA were gifts from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). Anti-Ras rat monoclonal antibody 238 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Covance), anti-Giantin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Covance), anti-ERGIC-53 mouse monoclonal antibody (Alexis), and AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probe) were used for immunofluorescence. The anti-Ras rat monoclonal antibody was detected with a rat-specific secondary antibody. YFP-GT46 is composed of a signal sequence, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein as an ectodomain, a sequence to direct N-glycosylation, the transmembrane domain of the human low density lipoprotein receptor, and the cytoplasmic tail of CD46 (33Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E-L. Simons K. Horber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH 3T3 cells and COS-7 cells were cultured at 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Twenty four hours before DNA transfection, cells were plated on pre-washed glass coverslips (Corning) in 12-well tissue culture plates at a density about 105-106 cells per well. Transfection was performed using Effectene reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For sequential DNA transfection, only Sar1 DNA was used for the first transfection, and after 18 h a second round of transfection, with DNA for H-Ras, was performed. For Sar1 co-transfection, a DNA ratio of 2:1 (Sar1/other DNAs; w/w) was used. For all other co-transfections a 1:1 DNA ratio (w/w) was used. Counting Cells—NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs for YFP-GT46 and H-Ras, as indicated. After 18 h, cells were fixed and viewed by epifluorescence (for GFP constructs) or immunostained with antibody for H-Ras or Giantin. One hundred cells with YFP-GT46 (or Giantin) visible in the perinuclear area were then counted, and the number of cells in which H-Ras was present only on plasma membrane or coincident with the perinuclear marker protein was noted. Two separate experiments were performed for each H-Ras form, and the data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software program. Brefeldin A, Nocodazole, and Cycloheximide Treatment—At 6 h after transfection, brefeldin A (BFA, 5 μg/ml) was applied to the cells in regular medium. Cells were fixed and visualized by immunofluorescence at 30, 60, and 90 min after BFA treatment. Where indicated, cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) immediately after the transfection. After 6 h the cycloheximide was washed out, and fresh medium with either BFA or nocodazole (20 μg/ml) was added. After 1.5 h, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence. For one experiment, cells were transfected, treated with cycloheximide for 6 h, and then were rinsed to wash out the cycloheximide, and nocodazole was applied for 4 h. Then nocodazole was washed out, and cycloheximide was added to the medium again. After 2 more hours, cells were fixed and stained for immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence Imaging—NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice for 5 min and treated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked using 1% fat-free milk in PBS for 15 min, followed by primary antibody for 1 h and secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with VECTASHIELD, and images were captured with a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope (model DIMER2) or Leica confocal TCS NT microscope system equipped with separate argon-UV, argon, and krypton lasers and the appropriate filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas Red, and TRITC imaging. The contrast and signal strength of images were balanced, and images were deconvolved and merged as indicated, using Improvision OpenLab and Adobe Photoshop software. Supplemental Movie—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured and transfected with GFP-H-Ras cDNA as described before. Cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) immediately after the transfection. After 6 h the cycloheximide was washed out, and fresh medium with BFA (5 μg/ml) and HEPES (20 μg/ml, pH 7.4) was added. Cells were thereafter kept at 37 °C in a warmed chamber. After 30 min of BFA treatment, images of a selected cell were taken at 90-s intervals for about 1 h with a Leica inverted fluorescence microscope (model DIMER2). Movies were created by Improvision OpenLab software. H-Ras Proteins Often Show Little Accumulation in the Golgi—Although previous reports clearly documented the presence of H-Ras on the ER and Golgi, most of those studies used GFP-H-Ras fusion proteins to produce bright signals when localized to a small area (1Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 3Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). When a nontagged version of H-Ras was imaged, using an H-Ras antibody, many transfected NIH 3T3 cells showed H-Ras protein only on the plasma membrane, with no protein detectable on perinuclear membranes. This visual impression was quantified by determining the proportion of cells that showed H-Ras immunofluorescence on Golgi membranes. To verify the location of the Golgi apparatus, a co-expressed YFP-GT46 protein, which traffics through the conventional exocytic pathway (34Kenworthy A.K. Nichols B.J. Remmert C.L. Hendrix G.M. Kumar M. Zimmerberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), or Giantin, a resident cis-Golgi protein, were also imaged. At 18 h after transfection, H-Ras was strongly visible on the plasma membrane in >95% of all transfected cells. YFP-GT46 was detectable at the plasma membrane, and also in an organized perinuclear area in >90% of the transfected cells (Table 1). One hundred cells that showed YFP-GT46 in the perinuclear area were then counted, and the presence and abundance of H-Ras on membranes that were coincident with the perinuclear YFP-GT46 were noted in each. The results verified the preliminary impression that H-Ras was frequently absent from internal membranes (Golgi or recycling center (35Gomez G.A. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34997-35010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), as ∼85% of the transfected cells showed no H-Ras on organized internal membrane structures that were also marked by YFP-GT46. Roughly 10% of the cells showed some modest amount of internal H-Ras, whereas about 5% showed strong co-localization with perinuclear membranes containing YFP-GT46. The same experiment was performed using COS-7 cells, with similar results (Table 1). Thus, in both cell types, only a few of the transfected cells showed a strong H-Ras signal on internal membranes.TABLE 1H-Ras perinuclear distribution is distinct from the pattern of a protein in the traditional vesicular trafficking pathwayDNA typeCell typeNIH 3T3COS-7+++None+++NoneYFP-GT4692 ± 94 ± 35 ± 594 ± 32 ± 13 ± 2H-Raswt6 ± 510 ± 683 ± 14 ± 13 ± 293 ± 3H-RasQ61L1 ± 15 ± 494 ± 47 ± 49 ± 483 ± 8GFP-H-Raswt45 ± 1423 ± 232 ± 1550 ± 217 ± 333 ± 1GFP-H-RasQ61L59 ± 56 ± 836 ± 359 ± 1214 ± 428 ± 8mGFP-H-RasQ61L23 ± 223 ± 251 ± 5NDNDND Open table in a new tab To see if a GTP-bound, oncogenic form of H-Ras behaved similarly, an activated version, H-RasQ61L was expressed. Once more, in 85-95% of the transfected cells, there was very little H-RasQ61L that co-localized with YFP-GT46 in the perinuclear area, although the plasma membrane was illuminated (Fig. 1A; Table 1). Thus, both the native form and an oncogenic form of H-Ras displayed limited accumulation on internal membranes. To look more specifically at the Golgi, the experiment was repeated, using COS-7 cells and staining of the endogenous protein, Giantin, to mark the cis-Golgi. Again, a large majority of the cells showed almost no H-RasQ61L on Golgi membranes (Fig. 1B; Table 1). A similar limitation in Golgi localization of H-Ras has been reported in CHO-K1 cells. In contrast, when GFP-H-Ras fusion proteins were examined, a larger portion (∼70%) of transfected cells showed the GFP-H-Ras fusion proteins on Golgi membranes, and only ∼30% of the cells lacked any accumulation of H-Ras in the Golgi area (Table 1). This significant amount of GFP-H-Ras on Golgi membranes agrees with previous work using GFP-H-Ras proteins (1Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). To learn if this apparent influence of GFP on H-Ras localization might arise because of the tendency for the original versions of GFP to dimerize, a monomeric form of GFP was attached to H-RasQ61L, and the steady-state distribution of this mGFP-H-RasQ61L was examined. In roughly half of the cells, mGFP-H-RasQ61L was visible on perinuclear membranes, compared with ∼65% for the original GFP version. Meanwhile, the portion of cells in which no perinuclear fluorescence of mGFP-H-Ras was visible increased moderately, from ∼35% for the original GFP-tagged version to about 50% with the monomeric GFP version (Table 1). However, the mGFP-H-RasQ61L was still clearly different in its distribution from that of the untagged H-RasQ61L, in which <5% of the cells showed perinuclear fluorescence and >90% did not. These results suggest that, although GFP-H-Ras (or mGFP-H-Ras) proteins may be useful for documenting the presence of H-Ras at internal locations, they may not fully replicate normal usage of the transport pathways. Nascent H-Ras Moves Much Faster than YFP-GT46 to the Plasma Membrane—These results suggested two possibilities as follows: (a) in 85% of the cells the amount of H-Ras on Golgi membranes was low because vesicular transport was particularly efficient; or (b) a significant amount of H-Ras might be able to access the plasma membrane without utilizing the exocytic pathway through the Golgi. To study trafficking efficiency, the initial movement of H-Ras was examined at early time points after the protein was synthesized. This avoided the complexity of possible deacylation-based recycling of previously synthesized H-Ras between plasma and internal membranes (21Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I.H. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). For this, cells were co-transfected with cDNAs for H-RasQ61L and YFP-GT46 and then were placed immediately in medium containing cycloheximide for 6 h to allow the cDNAs to be transcribed and the RNA for H-Ras to accumulate, but to prevent translation. Cycloheximide was then removed to produce a synchronous wave of H-Ras protein synthesis and trafficking. At various time points after cycloheximide removal, cells were fixed and imaged. Using this approach, both H-Ras and YFP-GT46 had been translated and accumulated in amounts sufficient to be visible within 50 min of removal of cycloheximide. At that time, both proteins were present only on the ER (Fig. 2, 50′). Twenty minutes later (70 min after cycloheximide removal), a strong signal of YFP-GT46 was present on well organized perinuclear membranes in ∼90% of the transfected cells (Fig. 2, GT46, 70′). Importantly, no visible YFP-GT46 had yet reached the plasma membrane. In contrast, H-Ras was already detectable on the cell surface, well ahead of YFP-GT46 (Fig. 2, H-Ras, 70′). By 90 min after cycloheximide removal, YFP-GT46 was present in the Golgi and, in some cells, on vesicles that appeared to be exiting the Golgi but were not yet at the cell surface (Fig. 2, GT46, 90′). At this time point, H-Ras was now easily visible at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, H-Ras, 90′), although no H-Ras-containing vesicles were detected and fewer than half of the cells showed any H-Ras in the perinuclear area. After another 20 min (110 min after cycloheximide removal), exocytic vesicles containing YFP-GT46 could be seen in most transfected cells. In some cells, these GT46-containing vesicles had reached the cell surface, and the outline of these cells could now be barely seen (Fig. 2, GT46, 110′). H-Ras was now present on the plasma membrane and on both perinuclear membranes and individual “granules” inside the cell (Fig. 2, H-Ras, 110′). When the images were merged, many of the vesicles containing YFP-GT46 did not have H-Ras on them (Fig. 2, merge, 110′). This result suggested that much of the H-Ras was not using YFP-GT46-containing vesicles for transportation to the plasma membrane. By 140 min after cycloheximide removal, large amounts of YFP-GT46 had reached the plasma membrane, and many YFP-GT46-containing vesicles en route were obvious. Merged images of H-Ras and GT46 showed some vesicles that contained both H-Ras and YFP-GT46, although again, many contained only one of the proteins (Fig. 2, merge, 140′). The co-localization of YFP-GT46 and H-Ras agrees with previous reports that (some) H-Ras can traffic from the Golgi to the plasma membrane on vesicles (1Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M.

These results clearly showed that nascent H-Ras could reach the plasma membrane more rapidly than a protein carried on the traditional vesicular pathway, Furthermore, in many cells, there was no evidence that H-Ras transited internal membranes. This led us to test whether H-Ras could reach the plasma membrane if conventional vesicular transport was prevented. Neither Brefeldin A nor Dominant Negative Sar1 Prevents H-Ras Movement to the Plasma Membrane—To test if H-Ras plasma membrane traffic required the presence or organization of the Golgi apparatus, brefeldin A was used to inhibit COP I-mediated vesicular transport and cause Golgi collapse. Cells were transfected with cDNAs for H-RasQ61L and YFP-GT46 and were immediately treated with cycloheximide. After allowing 6 h for RNA synthesis, the cycloheximide was washed out to permit protein synthesis, but BFA was also added. After an additional 90 min, the cells were fixed and imaged. As expected for a transmembrane protein in the secretory pathway, YFP-GT46 was found in the ER after BFA treatment and clearly outlined the ER membranes around the nucleus (Fig. 3A). No other internal membranes contained YFP-GT46, confirming that vesicular traffic had halted, and the Golgi apparatus had been absorbed into the ER. In contrast, H-RasQ61L continued to illuminate the plasma membrane in the presence of BFA (Fig. 3A). No organized perinuclear structures that contained H-RasQ61L were visible, and the protein did not accumulate on the nuclear envelope. To determine whether the activation state of the protein influenced whether H-Ras transport was BFA-insensitive, the experiments were repeated using the inactive, cellular form of H-Ras (H-Raswt). The results were similar to those with the activated form. BFA had no inhibitory effect on movement of H-Raswt to the plasma membrane (data not"

The yeast G protein α-subunit Gpa2p controls a signaling pathway that promotes rapid cell growth, inhibits stress responses, and induces filamentous growth under conditions of nutrient limitation. The effect of this pathway on cell growth appears to be due, at least in part, to an increase in the rates of ribosome biogenesis and protein translation that is mediated by Gpa2p (1Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guöldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: 610-622Google Scholar, 2Tamaki H. Yun C.W. Mizutani T. Tsuzuki T. Takagi Y. Shinozaki M. Kodama Y. Shirahige K. Kumagai H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of Gpa2p causes an increase in invasive and pseudohyphal growth, as well as a decrease in stress responses such as heat shock resistance, sporulation efficiency, and accumulation of storage carbohydrates (3Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Peeters T. Louwet W.

Consistent with these findings, cells carrying a gpa2Δ mutation display a defect in filamentous growth and an increase in stress resistance (3Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kuöbler E. Moösch H-U. Rupp S. Lisanti M.P J. Biol.

Gorwa M-F. Colavizza D. Thevelein J.M EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3326-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). gpa2Δ mutants also display an increase in replicative life span, which is the number of mitotic divisions completed by a cell prior to senescence (8Lin S-J. Defossez P.-A Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 9Kaeberlein M. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K.

The effect of the Gpa2p pathway on life span could be due either to its role in promoting cell growth or to its role in inhibiting stress responses. The way in which signals are transmitted through the Gpa2p pathway is not completely understood. The most well established component of this pathway is the receptor that couples to Gpa2p, which is called Gpr1p (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Yun C-W. Tamaki H. Nakayama R. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Gpr1p receptor is also required for pseudohyphal and invasive growth, and this requirement can be overcome by constitutive activation of Gpa2p, as would be expected for a G protein that acts downstream of its coupled receptor (13Tamaki H. Miwa T. Shinozaki M. Saito M. Yun C-W. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Lorenz M.C. Pan X. Harashima T. Cardenas M.E. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. Heitman J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 609-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gpr1p is present on the cell surface, indicating that it detects an extracellular signal (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Gpr1p is a low affinity glucose receptor that responds to high concentrations of glucose in the extracellular environment (15Welton R.M. Hoffman C.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 513-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rolland F. de Winde J.H. Lemaire K. Boles E. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Other components of the Gpa2p pathway are still in the process of being characterized. A functional survey of the yeast genome has failed to reveal candidate genes encoding β- and γ-subunits that could form a classical G protein heterotrimer with the Gpa2p α-subunit (3Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, some progress has been made in identifying potential downstream effectors by characterizing proteins that display genetic or physical interactions with Gpa2p. At least one component of Gpa2p signaling appears to involve stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by Gpa2p, resulting in production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). 4The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; RT, reverse transcription. Although it was originally reported that a gpa2Δ mutation does not affect the increase in cAMP that occurs upon addition of glucose to starved cells (17Nakafuku M. Obara T. Kaibuchi K. Miyajima I. Miyajima A. Itoh H. Nakamura S. Arai K. Matsumoto K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), subsequent studies have shown that under certain conditions a gpa2Δ mutation does cause a decrease in the glucose-induced cAMP spike (7Colombo S. Ma P. Cauwenberg L. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Teunissen A. Nauwelaers D. de Winde J.H. Gorwa M-F. Colavizza D. Thevelein J.M EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3326-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Kraakman L. Lemaire K. Ma P. Teunissen A.W. Donaton M.C. Van Dijck P. Winderickx J. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Lorenz M.C. Pan X. Harashima T. Cardenas M.E. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. Heitman J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 609-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that adenylyl cyclase binds to Gpa2p in a manner that is highly specific for the GTP-bound form of the α-subunit (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that adenylyl cyclase functions as a downstream effector of Gpa2p. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activates the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA, and genetic evidence indicates that Gpa2p functions as a positive regulator of PKA signaling. Deletion of TPK2, which encodes the PKA catalytic subunit required for filamentous growth, eliminates the effect of constitutively active Gpa2p on expression of FLO11, which encodes a cell surface flocculin required for filamentous growth (18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similarly, the effects of Gpa2p activation on its transcriptional targets are eliminated in a strain containing a variant form of PKA that has a very low level of unregulated kinase activity (1Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guöldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. Plos Biol. 2004; 2: 610-622Google Scholar). Some effects of Gpa2p activation cannot be explained by stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, a number of studies have attempted to identify additional effectors of Gpa2p. Other potential effectors that could transmit signals from Gpa2p include phospholipase C (19Ansari K. Martin S. Farkasovsky M. Ehbrecht I-M. Kuöntzel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30052-30058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the Ras GTPase-activating proteins Ira1p and Ira2p (20Harashima T. Anderson S. Yates J.R. II I Heitman J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the kelch repeat proteins Krh1p and Krh2p (also called Gpb2p and Gpb1p, respectively) (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y.

Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The KRH1 (for kelch repeat homolog) gene was identified in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with Gpa2p; KRH2 encodes a protein that is 35% identical to Krh1p (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J.

Krh1p and Krh2p do not display any obvious sequence identity to other known proteins, but they do contain seven kelch repeats, segments of about 50 amino acids that contain a characteristic double glycine motif (22Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Cells containing krh1Δ krh2Δ mutations display phenotypes indicative of a high level of PKA activity, including increased pseudohyphal growth, increased FLO11 expression, decreased heat shock resistance, and decreased storage of reserve carbohydrates (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that Krh1p and Krh2p function as negative regulators of PKA signaling. Moreover, deletion of KRH1 and KRH2 causes increased phosphorylation of PKA substrates (23Lu A. Hirsch J.P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), confirming that Krh1p and Krh2p negatively regulate PKA kinase activity. Some evidence indicates that the effect of Krh1p and Krh2p on PKA is not through the regulation of cAMP levels. For example, in cells that lack all adenylyl cyclase function, deletion of KRH1 and KRH2 lowers the concentration of cAMP required to maintain viability (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Lu A. Hirsch J.P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, krh1Δ krh2Δ mutations have effects in cells that lack either the high affinity or low affinity cAMP phosphodiesterases (23Lu A. Hirsch J.P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given that adenylyl cyclase and the cAMP phosphodiesterases control the synthesis and degradation of cAMP, these results appear to indicate that Krh1p and Krh2p inhibit PKA by a process that does not involve regulating the intracellular cAMP concentration. Consistent with this idea, two-hybrid assays performed in krh1Δ krh2Δ strains reveal a decrease in binding between the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA, which would be expected to produce an increase in PKA activity (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that krh1Δ krh2Δ strains are defective in their ability to generate a glucose-induced cAMP spike (5Peeters T. Louwet W. Gelade R. Nauwelaers D. Thevelein J.M. Versele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This result can be interpreted to mean either that the kelch repeat proteins act upstream of adenylyl cyclase or that the high level of PKA activity in these strains results in feedback inhibition of cAMP synthesis (24Nikawa J. Cameron S. Toda T. Ferguson K.M. Wigler M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is still not clear precisely how Krh1p and Krh2p function in the Gpa2p signaling pathway. Here we show that substitution of certain amino acids in the region of Gpa2p that couples receptor binding to guanine nucleotide exchange eliminates its ability to bind Krh1p. Changes at these positions resulted in phenotypes associated with an increase in the amount of activated Gpa2p. These results indicate that the kelch repeat proteins bind to Gpa2p in a manner that does not resemble that of other Gα-binding proteins. Instead, this study suggests that the interaction between the kelch repeat proteins and the G protein α-subunit represents a novel functional relationship. Strains and Media—Yeast cells were grown on YEPD (2% glucose), and strains under selection were grown on synthetic dropout media, as described (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Strains used for two-hybrid assays were PJ69-4A (25James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HF7c (Clontech). Strain SKY762 has the genotype MATa ura3-52 trp1::hisG leu2::hisG his3::hisG, and strain HS188-5D is a derivative of SKY762 that contains a gpa2::TRP1 allele, which was constructed as described (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on plasmid pT7-LG-GPA2, which consists of a 1.6-kb BamHI fragment containing the GPA2 gene cloned into the BamHI site of pT7-blue (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A to G substitutions were introduced at positions 1273, 1274, and 1256 (numbers refer to nucleotide positions in the GPA2 coding sequence) to produce plasmids pG21273-T7, pG21274-T7, and pG21256-T7, respectively. Construction of plasmid pGBT9-GPA2 has been described previously (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To construct plasmids pG21273G-T9.1, pG21274G-T9.1, and pG21256G-T9.1, the KpnI-PstI fragment in pGBT9-GPA2 was replaced with the corresponding KpnI-PstI fragments from pG21273-T7, pG21274-T7, and pG21256-T7, respectively. To construct a version of GPA2 containing a nuclear localization sequence at the N terminus, first an NcoI site was introduced at the start codon of GPA2 by performing site-directed mutagenesis on pT7-LG-GPA2 to produce pGPA2NC-T7.1. Then oligonucleotides NLS1F (5′-CATGCCAAAGAAGAAGAGAAAGGTCATGCATGC-3′) and NLS2R (5′-CATGGCATGCATGACCTTTCTCTTCTTCTTTGG-3′) were annealed, and the double-stranded fragment was cloned into the NcoI site of pGPA2NC-T7.1 to produce pNLSGPA2-T7.2. The 1.6-kb BamHI fragment from pNLSGPA2-T7.2 was cloned into the BamHI site of YEp352 to produce pNLSGPA2-352.1. To construct plasmids pNLSG2ND-352.11, pNLSG2NS-352.10, and pNLSG2QR-33.26, the 0.35-kb BssHII-SacI fragment in pNLSGPA2–352.1 was replaced with the corresponding 0.35-kb BssHII-SacI fragments containing A to G substitutions at positions 1273, 1274, and 1256, respectively. Construction of plasmid pGPA2-33.1 has been described previously (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To construct plasmids pG2ND-33.11, pG2NS-33.10, and pG2QR-33.9, the 1.6-kb BamHI fragments from pG21273-T7, pG21274-T7, and pG21256-T7, respectively, were cloned into the BamHI site of YCplac33. Construction of plasmid YEp181-FLKRH1 has been described previously (18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A NotI site was introduced after the start codon of the KRH1 gene by site-directed mutagenesis, and a 0.7-kb NotI fragment containing the green fluorescent gene was cloned into this NotI site to produce YEp181-GFP.FLKRH1. Mutagenic PCR and Two-hybrid Screen—Error-prone PCR was performed as described previously (26Kim J. Couve A. Hirsch J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 441-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using pGBT9-GPA2 as a template in 30 cycles of PCR with oligonucleotide primers T91F (5′-CCTCGAGAAGACCTTGACATGATT-3′) and T92R (5′-GGTAGAGGTGTGGTCAATAAGAGC-3′). Yeast strain PJ69-4A (25James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying plasmid TH14 (18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was cotransformed with the pool of PCR-generated mutagenized fragments and linearized vector pGBT9, which had been digested with BamHI and PstI, allowing recombination to occur in vivo. Transformants were replica-plated to synthetic medium plates containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (10 mm) without histidine, and colonies that did not grow were identified. Mutated versions of pGBT9-GPA2 from colonies that did not grow on selective medium were isolated, amplified in Escherichia coli, and transformed into strain PJ69-4A carrying either plasmid TH14 (KRH1) or TH1-1 (IME2). Versions of pGBT9-GPA2 that scored negatively for interaction with TH14 but positively for interaction with TH1-1 were sequenced. Nucleotide changes identified in the plasmids of interest were individually introduced into pGBT9-GPA2 by site-directed mutagenesis to identify the change that was responsible for the phenotype. RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR—Yeast RNA extraction was performed as described previously (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After ethanol precipitation, the RNA sample was incubated with 50 units of DNase I (10 units/μl; Roche Applied Science) in Buffer H (Roche Applied Science) at 30 °C for 60 min. Purified RNA was resuspended in 30 μl of TE; the A260 was measured, and the concentration was adjusted to 0.5 μg/μl. For real time RT-PCR, primers oFLO11.9 (5′-GTTATTACCACTGAGTCATCTGTTG-3′) and oFLO51 (5′-TGTTGTAGCTAGTTGGGATGTAG-3′) were used to amplify a 193-bp segment of FLO11. Primers oActin1 (5′-TCGTGCTGTCTTCCCATCTATC-3′) and oActin2 (5′-GTAGAAGGTATGATGCCAGATC-3′) were used to amplify a 191-bp segment of ACT1, and the relative RNA levels derived from this reaction were used to standardize the amount of mRNA in the samples. Standard curves were produced by serially diluting RNA samples. The reactions were performed using a LightCycler-RNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer with the following modifications: a 20-μl standard reaction contained 1.3 μl of 50 mm manganese acetate, 2 μl of primer mix (5 mm each), 7.5 μl of RNA Master SYBR Green 1 reaction mixture, and 1 μl of RNA sample (0.5 μg/μl). The cycling program consisted of 95 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 12 s, for 45 cycles. Real time RT-PCR was performed on a LightCycler version 3.5 instrument (Roche Applied Science), and the results were analyzed using LightCycler software. Yeast Methods—Yeast transformation and heat shock assays were performed as described previously (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) except that cells were incubated for 45 min at 50 °C for the heat shock assay. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using 30 ml of pelleted log phase cells resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100). Cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing, and reaction mixtures contained 1.3 mg of 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Units were calculated as 1000 × A420/time(min) × protein concentration (mg). Microscopy—Microscopy was performed with live cells in culture medium at room temperature. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a ×63 objective and an fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (Chroma Technology). Screen for Gpa2p Variants Defective for Krh1p Binding Identifies Two Critical Residues—The kelch repeat-containing proteins Krh1p and Krh2p (also called Gbp2p and Gbp1p, respectively) are negative regulators of yeast PKA signaling that bind to the G protein α-subunit Gpa2p (18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To explore further the functional relationship between the kelch repeat proteins and the Gα subunit, a two-hybrid screen was performed to isolate alleles of GPA2 that encode products that are defective for Krh1p binding. The strategy for this screen was to isolate GPA2 alleles that produce a negative result in a two-hybrid assay with a KRH1 plasmid as well as a positive result with a plasmid encoding another Gpa2p-interacting protein. This strategy ensured that the isolated GPA2 mutant alleles encode stable proteins that retain at least one function. Mutant alleles of GPA2 were generated by error-prone PCR followed by gap repair using a plasmid with GPA2 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (4Xue Y. Batlle M. Hirsch J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1996-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Mutagenized GPA2 plasmids were tested in a two-hybrid reporter strain containing a plasmid with a portion of KRH1 fused to the GAL4 activation domain (18Batlle M. Lu A. Green D.A. Xue Y. Hirsch J.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GPA2 plasmids that tested negative in this assay (His-, Ade-) were isolated and re-transformed into strains containing either the KRH1 construct or another GAL4-AD fusion plasmid that encodes a different Gpa2p-interacting protein, Ime2p (27Donzeau M. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6110-6119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GPA2 alleles of interest score negatively for interacting with Krh1p but positively for interacting with Ime2p. Several GPA2 alleles fulfilling these criteria were isolated. Mutant GPA2 alleles specifically defective for the interaction with Krh1p were sequenced to identify the changes that cause decreased binding. In general, these alleles contained multiple mutations. Therefore, individual mutations in GPA2 were made by site-directed mutagenesis and tested for their contribution to the phenotype by growth on medium lacking histidine (Fig. 1A). This procedure identified changes at positions 1256, 1273, and 1274 in the GPA2 coding sequence as being responsible for the defect in Krh1p binding. The change at position 1256 converts the amino acid at position 419 from a glutamine to an arginine. The changes at positions 1273 and 1274 are independent mutations that affect the same codon. The change at position 1273 converts the amino acid at position 425 from an asparagine to an aspartic acid, and the change at position 1274 converts the same amino acid to a serine. To quantify the degree of interaction observed in the two-hybrid assays, β-galactosidase liquid assays were performed. The level of interaction of wild type Gpa2p with Krh1p was approximately equal to its level of interaction with Ime2p (Fig. 1B). The Gpa2p variants Gpa2pQ419R, Gpa2pN425D, and Gpa2pN425S retained about 60% of their ability to interact with Ime2p but displayed no detectable interaction with Krh1p. These results indicate that, in a two-hybrid assay, alterations at residues 419 and 425 specifically affect the interaction of Gpa2p with Krh1p. Gpa2p Variants with Changes at Amino Acids 419 and 425 Are Defective for Krh1p Binding in Vivo—To assess whether the changes in Gpa2p identified by the two-hybrid screen affect its binding to full-length wild type Krh1p, an assay that determines binding in vivo was used. It was shown previously that overexpression of a version of Gpa2p that contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) causes a change in the subcellular distribution of Krh1p from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (28Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4557-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This change in localization is thought to be due to direct binding of Krh1p to nuclear Gpa2p. Therefore, this assay was used to study the interaction of Krh1p with the Gpa2p variants identified in the two-hybrid screen. As described previously (28Harashima T. Heitman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4557-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), GFP-Krh1p localizes to the cytoplasm in cells overexpressing empty vector, but redistributes to the nucleus in cells overexpressing NLS-Gpa2p (Fig. 2, top panels). However, in cells overexpressing the N425D, N425S, and Q419R versions of NLS-Gpa2p, GFP-Krh1p localizes to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, middle and bottom panels). These results demonstrate that the identified changes at residues 419 and 425 in Gpa2p cause a defect in its ability to bind wild type Krh1p in live cells. Gpa2p Variants That Do Not Bind Krh1p Are Constitutively Active—Activation of Gpa2p results in phenotypes associated with an increase in intracellular cAMP, including decreased heat shock resistance, decreased sporulation efficiency, and increased invasive and pseudohyphal growth (3Lorenz M.C.

To determine whether changes in Gpa2p that impair Krh1p binding have an effect on Gpa2p function, low copy plasmids carrying the GPA2 mutant alleles under the GPA2 promoter were transformed into a gpa2Δ strain. These strains were then tested for phenotypes known to be affected by Gpa2p function. Cells carrying either empty vector or a wild type GPA2 plasmid displayed a survival rate of ∼15% after heat shock (Fig. 3A). Expression of wild type Gpa2p has no effect on heat shock resistance because the activity of the normal protein is likely to be at a low level in stationary phase, the condition under which these assays are carried out. In contrast, cells carrying a GPA2N425S plasmid displayed a 2-fold decrease in survival rate, and cells carrying a GPA2Q419R plasmid displayed a 3.6-fold decrease in survival rate. The effect of GPA2N425D on the heat shock survival rate was not significantly different from that of wild type GPA2. A decrease in heat shock resistance is associated with mutational activation of the Gpa2p α-subunit. For example, an alteration th"

We have analyzed the properties of SQ bound at center N of the yeast bc1 complex. The EPR-detectable signal, which reports SQ bound in the vicinity of reduced bH heme, was abolished by the center N inhibitors antimycin, funiculosin, and ilicicolin H, but was unchanged by the center P inhibitors myxothiazol and stigmatellin. After correcting for the EPR-silent SQ bound close to oxidized bH, we calculated a midpoint redox potential (Em) of ∼90 mV for all bound SQ. Considering the Em values for bH and free Q, this result indicates that center N preferentially stabilizes SQ·bH3+ complexes. This favors recycling of the electron coming from center P and also implies a >2.5-fold higher affinity for QH2 than for Q at center N, which would potentially inhibit bH oxidation by Q. Using pre-steady-state kinetics, we show that Q does not inhibit the initial rate of bH reduction by QH2 through center N, but does decrease the extent of reduction, indicating that Q binds only when bH is reduced, whereas QH2 binds when bH is oxidized. Kinetic modeling of these results suggests that formation of SQ at one center N in the dimer allows stabilization of SQ in the other monomer by Q reduction after intradimer electron transfer. This model allows maximum SQ·bH3+ formation without inhibition of Q binding by QH2.

This is achieved by having two QH2/Q-binding sites (center P and center N) in cytochrome b close to opposite sides of the membrane, as is clearly seen in crystallographic structures (1Xia D. Yu C.A.

The bifurcated mechanism of QH2 oxidation at center P in the protonmotive Q cycle results in one of the electrons from the substrate being transferred to the bL heme and then to the bH heme, which is in close proximity to the center N-binding pocket. This electron is used to reduce Q, producing an SQ intermediate, which is further reduced to QH2 after a second oxidation event at center P. For proton translocation to occur, these two sites must function in opposite directions, so protons from QH2 oxidation at center P are released to the positive side of the membrane, whereas Q reduction at center N results in proton uptake from the negative side. However, the bH heme group responsible for Q reduction at center N has a midpoint redox potential at pH 7 (Em7) of 50–100 mV (5Dutton P.L. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6T'sai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Rich P.R. Jeal A.E.

This implies that the bH heme should oxidize QH2 as easily as it can reduce Q. When electrons are prevented from flowing out of cytochrome b through center N, QH2 oxidation at center P is inhibited and results in detrimental side reactions, such as superoxide formation (10Kramer D.M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have recently provided evidence indicating fast electron equilibration between bH hemes in the bc1 complex dimer and suggested that this minimizes formation of inhibitory SQ·bH2+ complexes at center N (12Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, potentiometric studies of SQ bound at center N (13Ohnishi T.

Nevertheless, this introduces another difficulty for optimal center N function because QH2 would prevent binding of Q to center N, especially at high QH2/Q ratios. We have analyzed the thermodynamic properties of bound SQ and the pre-steady-state kinetics of bH reduction through center N of the yeast bc1 complex. Our results point to a mechanism in which center N sites in the dimer selectively bind QH2 or Q depending on the redox state of the bH heme as well as on the occupancy of the other monomer. We discuss how this model maximizes SQ·bH3+ complex formation while preventing QH2 from interfering with Q binding. Materials—Dodecyl maltoside was obtained from Anatrace. Antimycin, myxothiazol, DBQ, and redox mediators were purchased from Sigma, except for menaquinone, which was synthesized in the laboratory. Funiculosin was a gift from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland), and ilicicolin H was from the Merck sample repository. DBH2 was prepared as described previously (16Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All inhibitors and DBH2 were quantified by UV spectroscopy (17Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J.

Purification of Cytochrome bc1 Complex—Wild-type cytochrome bc1 complex was isolated from Red Star cake yeast as described previously (21Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Quantification of the bc1 complex was performed as reported previously (22Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using extinction coefficients of 17.5 mm-1 cm-1 at 553–539 nm for cytochrome c1 (23Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1012-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 25.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 562–579 nm for the average absorbance of the bH and bL hemes in cytochrome b (24Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The amount of endogenous Q copurified with the bc1 complex was determined as described previously (12Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and varied between different preparations in the range of 0.8–1.2 molecules/bc1 monomer. Semiquinone Redox Titration—Purified bc1 complex was diluted with 100 mm Tris and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 24–30 μm (based on Rieske iron-sulfur cluster concentration as measured by EPR spectroscopy; see below). Upon addition of 33 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Em7 =+270 mV) and 33 μm phenazine ethosulfate (Em7 = +55 mV) as redox mediators, the solution was transferred into an anaerobic vessel continuously flushed with argon. The appearance of additional artificial radical signals was avoided by using only two mediator dyes, one having its Em in the range of the expected value of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster and the other in the range of the expected Em of SQ. The sample was stirred at a constant temperature of 298 K and poised at desired potential values by adding small aliquots of 50 mm sodium dithionite solution. The potential was monitored by a redox microelectrode (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Gieβen, Germany), and at appropriate values, 100 μl of the solution were transferred into argon-flushed EPR tubes (4-mm diameter), frozen in a cold isopentane/methyl cyclohexane mixture (5:1, ∼120 K), and stored in liquid nitrogen until EPR measurements were taken. Usually, titrations started at potentials of +350 mV and were followed down to -120 mV. X-band EPR spectra were obtained with a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard HP 53159A frequency counter, a Bruker ER 035M NMR gaussmeter, and an Oxford Instruments liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. The degree of reduction of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster was followed by recording EPR spectra at 20 K (microwave frequency, 9.47 GHz; microwave power, 2 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 0.64 milliteslas (mT); and sweep width, 100 mT). The appearance of SQ signals was detected at 50 K (microwave frequency, 9.47 GHz; microwave power, 0.01 milliwatt; modulation amplitude, 0.2 mT; and sweep width, 5 mT). A Q-free bc1 preparation (25Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was titrated in the same manner as the other samples to analyze the occurrence of any artificial radical signals or base-line drifts derived from mediator dyes or any other component in the solution. Although showing normal titration behavior of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster, no EPR signal in the range of SQ radicals was detectable in this sample. For data analysis, all signal intensities of SQ radicals were normalized to the maximum intensity of the signal in the control titration, in the absence of any inhibitor. Quantitation of maximum SQ concentrations was achieved by accumulation of spectra at 50 K, subtraction of the spectrum of the Q-free sample, double integration, and comparison with spectra from galvinoxyl-free radical (Sigma) at known concentrations. For power saturation measurements, the modulation amplitude was decreased to 0.1 mT to avoid signal broadening, and the sweep time was doubled from 42 to 84 s. Saturation curves were fitted to a standard equation describing the behavior of one paramagnetic species (26Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b Redox Titration—Optical potentiometric titrations were performed at 24 °C in a 3.5-ml quartz cuvette as described previously (27Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The potential was measured with a platinum-Ag/AgCl (3M) microelectrode (MI-80414-6, Microelectrodes, Inc.). All values are expressed with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. The electrode was calibrated against a pH 7 standard solution of quinhydrone (Em =+296 mV). The purified bc1 complex was diluted to 2 μm in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside. Redox equilibration between the protein and the electrode was achieved by a mixture of the following dyes (with their Em7 values): 70 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (+270 mV), 25 μm 1,2-naphthoquinone (+144 mV), 25 μm phenazine methosulfate (+80 mV), 25 μm phenazine ethosulfate (+55 mV), 50 μm duroquinone (+5 mV), 30 μm menaquinone (-76 mV), 50 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (-145 mV), 30 μm anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate (-184 mV), and 30 μm anthraquinone 2-sulfonate (-225 mV). A 10 or 100 mm solution of dithionite and ferricyanide was used for the reductive and oxidative titrations, respectively. The UV-visible spectra were recorded between 500 and 600 nm in an Aminco DW-2 dual-wavelength spectrophotometer in the split beam mode. The absorbance at 562 minus 578 nm was plotted against the potential (Eh) of the system. The reductive and oxidative titrations were averaged, and the resulting graph was fitted in the ORIGIN 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.) to the following n = 1 Nernst equation (Equation 1) with two components to obtain the redox potential for the bH Em(bH) and bL (Em(bL) hemes as well as the relative contribution of the bH heme to the total absorbance (b), ΔA(562−578 nm)=Cɛp(bnFeRT(Em(bH)−Eh)1+nFeRT(Em(bH)−Eh)+(1−b)nFeRT(Em(bL)−Eh)1+nFeRT(Em(bL)−Eh))1 where C is the concentration of bc1 complex monomers (in this case, 2 μm), ɛ is the added extinction coefficient of both b hemes (51.2 mm-1 cm-1), and p is the light path length (in this case, 1 cm). The temperature of the assay was maintained at 24 °C. The Nernst plots for both oxidative and reductive titrations were essentially identical, indicating full reversibility in the titration and confirming that the system was in equilibrium. Pre-steady-state Reduction of Cytochrome b through Center N—Pre-steady-state reduction of cytochrome b was followed at 24 °C by stopped-flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS rapid scanning monochromator as described previously (22Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 3 μm enzyme (expressed as monomers of the bc1 complex) in assay buffer containing 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, and, where indicated, 1.2 eq of stigmatellin or myxothiazol/bc1 complex monomer and varying concentrations of DBQ against an equal volume of the same buffer (without enzyme and inhibitors) containing 48 μm DBH2. For each experiment, 12–16 data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted. The time course of the absorbance change at 562 and 578 nm was extracted using software from OLIS. Using the ORIGIN program, the difference between the two wavelengths was plotted and fitted to a second- or third-order exponential, and the fitted curve was then used as the basis for an iterative smoothing procedure to decrease the noise levels of the kinetic traces. In this procedure, the difference between each data point and the corresponding value of the fitted curve at the same time point was calculated and decreased by half. Kinetic Modeling—The DynaFit program (BioKin, Ltd.), which allows fitting to reaction mechanisms described as a series of individual reaction steps (28Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), was used to fit the time-dependent bH reduction through center N. An extinction coefficient of 36 mm-1 cm-1 was used for this heme group (12Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation of DBH2, DBQ, QH2, and Q were included together with the corresponding electron transfer reactions into single steps, thereby reducing the number of intermediate species. SQ species formed from partial reduction or oxidation of DBH2 or endogenous Q were assumed not to dissociate from the enzyme. Electron equilibration between the two bH hemes in the dimer through the bL hemes (12Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was described as a single step. For bH reduction in the myxothiazol-inhibited enzyme, the two models used assumed that all ligands were able to bind and react with both bH hemes in the dimer with identical rate constants. One of the models considered only one center N to be accessible initially, with the second center N being rapidly activated by SQ formation at the first site. When stigmatellin was present, the model used to fit the reduction kinetics assumed different kinetic parameters in one of the two center N sites in the dimer from the outset. The complete DynaFit script files are available as supplemental material. EPR Spectra of Semiquinone Bound at Center N—The purified yeast cytochrome bc1 complex has been reported to exhibit an EPR signal centered at g = 2 attributed to an SQ radical (6T'sai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, that putative SQ signal was significantly different from SQ signals reported in other bc1 complexes (13Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14De Vries S. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Robertson D.E.

Chem. 1984; 259: 1758-1763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that it had a much smaller intensity (only 5% of the Q content), yielded an Em for SQ that was ∼100 mV higher than in other organisms, and was pH-independent. No evidence was provided to demonstrate that such an EPR signal came from a center N radical. As shown in Fig. 1, we have now obtained an EPR signal (g = 2.004 and line width = 0.9 mT) that clearly corresponds to SQ bound at center N, as judged by its sensitivity to three different center N inhibitors (antimycin, funiculosin, and ilicicolin H) and by its absence in bc1 complex lacking Q. The maximum intensity of this SQ signal at a microwave power of 0.01 milliwatt varied between 0.06 and 0.27/bc1 complex monomer, depending on the Q content of the enzyme preparation, and occurred at an Em of 50–60 mV at pH 7.4, in agreement with what has been observed in other bc1 complexes (13Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14De Vries S. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Robertson D.E. Prince R.C. Bowyer J.R. Matsuura K. Dutton P.L. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1758-1763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously shown experimentally (30Siedow J.N. Power S. De la Rosa F.F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2392-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31De la Rosa F.F. Palmer G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 163: 140-143Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and confirmed theoretically (7Rich P.R. Jeal A.E. Madgwick S.A. Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that the SQ bound at center N is anti-ferromagnetically coupled to the oxidized bH heme. Thus, to determine the true concentration and Em of SQ bound at center N, a correction needs to be made for the portion of the SQ that is EPR-silent due to this coupling. Because the reported Em of yeast cytochrome b using either circular dichroism or EPR spectroscopy was found to be dependent on the type of detergent present (6T'sai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we performed a spectrophotometric redox titration of the b hemes in the presence of dodecyl maltoside in the same buffer as that used for our EPR experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, at pH 7.4, the bH heme has an Em of ∼60 mV. Using this value, we calculated the total percentage (relative to bc1 monomers) of SQ bound at all center N sites at different redox potential values SQtotEh from the g = 2.0 EPR signal, which reflects only SQ bound in the vicinity of bH2+ heme complexes SQbHEh2+, expressed as a percentage relative to bc1 monomers) by applying Equation 2. SQtotEh(&percnt;)=SQbH2+Eh(&percnt;)1−bH3+(&percnt;)1002 This equation implies that, for instance, when the bH heme is half-reduced (at Eh = 61 mV), if the EPR-detectable SQbH2+ amounts to 15%/bc1 monomer, an additional 15% of the EPR-invisible SQ is expected to be bound to center N sites in which the bH heme is oxidized. Therefore, SQ can be estimated to occupy 30% of the total center N sites, half of which have bH2+ and the other half bH3+. At a higher Eh of 120 mV, detecting 3% of SQ/bc1 monomer by EPR implies that, because only 10% of center N sites have bH2+, SQ is present in 30% of all center N sites, 90% of which have bH3+, preventing EPR detection of SQ bound to them. An important assumption made in Equation 2 is that center N binds SQ with equal affinity irrespective of the redox state of the bH hemes, which is supported by redox titrations in the bovine bc1 complex that suggest a constant Em of the bH heme in the presence or absence of SQ (7Rich P.R. Jeal A.E. Madgwick S.A. Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the total SQ obtained using Equation 2 yielded a maximum of 40% total SQ/bc1 monomer at ∼90 mV. Because the EPR-observable SQ was zero beyond ∼150 mV, the total SQ could not be calculated at higher Eh values, as is evident from Equation 2. The Nernst equation shows that it is thermodynamically impossible to have a redox couple in which the oxidized or reduced species reaches a concentration of exactly 100%. Therefore, the denominator in Equation 2 will never reach a value of exactly zero, which would result in a mathematical indeterminacy. Also, because by definition SQbHEh2+ cannot be larger than the percentage of center N sites that have bH2+, the SQtotEh value will always be <100% of the total center N sites, even at high Eh values. For example, even at an Eh at which the bH heme is 99% oxidized, SQbH2+ will be ≤1% simply because only 1% of all the center N sites have a reduced bH heme that allows EPR detection of a bound SQ. Therefore, applying Equation 2 in this case would yield values of 1 or less in the numerator and 0.01 in the denominator, resulting in an SQtotEh value of ≤100%. The Em values of the QH2/SQ and SQ/Q couples were calculated by fitting the experimental data points SQbHEh2+ as well as the predicted SQtotEh concentrations to the following Nernst equation (Equation 3), SQEh(&percnt;)=(C)(nFeRT(Em(SQ/Q)−Eh)1+nFeRT(Em(SQ/Q)−Eh)−nFeRT(Em(QH2/SQ)−Eh)1+nFeRT(Em(QH2/SQ)−Eh))3 where C corresponds to the theoretical concentration of SQ/monomer (as a percentage) that could be achieved if the Em(SQ/Q) and Em(QH2/SQ) values were separated enough to allow maximum accumulation. Its value was ∼35% for the EPR-detectable SQ and ∼55% for the total SQ calculated from Equation 2. The fitted Eh at which maximum SQ occurred, which is the mean of the two individual Em values with their respective deviation, yielded values of 44.8 ± 7.6 mV for SQbH2+ and 86.8 ± 5.3 mV for SQtot. Therefore, the peak in total bound SQ occurred when the bH heme was 75% oxidized, implying that, at pH 7.4, SQ stabilization favors the formation of SQ·bH3+ complexes compared with SQ·bH2+ by a factor of 3. Considering that the Q pool in membranes has an Em7 reported to be between 60 (6T'sai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and 90 (9Takamiya K.I. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) mV and that this value changes by -60 mV/pH unit, SQ bound at center N showed an Em 24–54 mV higher than unbound Q at pH 7.4. This implies that QH2 binds to center N between 2.5- and 8.3-fold tighter than Q. Reduction Kinetics of Heme bH through Center N in the Presence of DBQ—When DBH2 is added to center P-inhibited bc1 complex, electrons equilibrate with the bH hemes only by entry through center N (12Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, addition of increasing concentrations of DBQ resulted in a progressively smaller decrease in the extent of bH reduction. Interestingly, this oxidation of cytochrome b by DBQ was only partial, reaching a limit of ∼40% (with myxothiazol) or ∼60% (with stigmatellin) of the total extent observed without added DBQ. As reported previously (32Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30925-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), bH reduction by DBH2 through center N showed biphasic kinetics when center P was inhibited with myxothiazol (Fig. 3A), whereas the presence of stigmatellin resulted in an additional re-oxidation phase that was abolished when DBQ was added (Fig. 3B). Myxothiazol and stigmatellin affected differently the way in which DBQ decreased the extent of the two kinetic components of bH reduction (Fig. 4). Only the fast phase of bH reduction was decreased in its magnitude in the presence of myxothiazol (Fig. 4A), with an estimated Km for DBQ oxidation of 12 μm. This contrasted with what was observed with stigmatellin, where the extent of reduction during the slower phase was greatly decreased by low concentrations of DBQ (Km = 1.4 μm), and the fast reduction showed a modest decrease in its extent only above 30 μm DBQ (Fig. 4B). The slower reduction phase in the presence of stigmatellin contributed much more to the total extent of reduction (45%) than that in the presence of myxothiazol (13%), although this contribution became less as DBQ was added. The rate of the fast phase of bH reduction was insensitive to DBQ concentration, irrespective of the center P inhibitor present (Fig. 5). This is a surprising result, considering that the bH oxidation effect of DBQ shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates that DBQ can bind efficiently to center N. If DBQ is assumed to bind to center N in the oxidized bc1 complex with the same affinity as that calculated from the oxidation of the bH heme, a significant decrease in the rate of reduction by DBH2 should have been expected (as simulated by the dashed lines in Fig. 5). This result indicates that DBQ does not compete with DBH2 for binding to center N when the bH heme is oxidized. DBQ decreased the rate of the slower phase of bH reduction in the presence of stigmatellin to a value similar to that observed with myxothiazol, which was unaffected by DBQ. A Km of 2.7 μm was calculated for DBQ based on this decrease in the slow rate. EPR Spectra of the Center N Semiquinone in the Presence of Center P Inhibitors—To determine the cause of the different bH reduction kinetics observed in the presence of myxothiazol and stigmatellin, we examined the properties of the EPR-detectable SQ in the absence and presence of these inhibitors (Fig. 6). The intensities and Em values of SQ in the uninhibited and myxothiazol- and stigmatellin-bound bc1 complexes were very similar, within experimental error (Fig. 6A), indicating that the center P ligand had no effect on the stability of SQ at center N. The power saturation behavior of the SQ signal was also the same under the three conditions (Fig. 6B), implying that the relaxation properties that report the electronic environment of the unpaired electron in SQ are also independent of the center P inhibitors. These results suggest that changes in center N that are responsible for differences in bH reduction kinetics when stigmatellin is present are"
https://openalex.org/W2013211507,"The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are clinically distinct but share some common features. Difficult to treat and typified by a poor prognosis, their pathogenesis is unknown. Recent findings that some patients with the erythroblastopenia Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) have mutations in ribosomal proteins have led to the idea that this and perhaps other bone marrow failure disorders result from an inadequate supply of normally functioning ribosomes. According to this hypothesis, an insufficiency of the protein synthetic capacity limits the replicative potential of cells, with the DBA disease phenotype in particular arising from a block of one or more of the two to four critical, temporally compressed cell divisions in the differentiation program of the erythroid lineage in the fetal liver and the postnatal bone marrow. Here I propose an alternative (but not mutually exclusive) hypothesis centered on nucleoli: the specialized intranuclear domains within which ribosomes are assembled. It was recently discovered that the nucleoli contain cell cycle machinery in close proximity to nascent ribosomes. Although mutations in ribosomal proteins might be expected to negatively influence the cell's protein synthetic capacity, I suggest it is also possible that the DBA mutations directly affect the nucleolus to destabilize or otherwise deregulate the coresident cell cycle machinery. This hypothesis envisions that the ribosomal protein mutations discovered in DBA act upstream from ribosome assembly by interfering with the staging of cell cycle progression machinery in the nucleolus, in a pretranslational mode of pathogenesis."

Potassium channels are central to a wide range of biological processes, including electrical signaling, electrolyte homeostasis, and cell volume regulation (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2001; (, 3rd Ed., Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA)Google Scholar). The activation states of several types of potassium channels and their relatives can be modulated by cytoplasmic ligands, such as G-proteins, calmodulin, or cyclic nucleotides; some of these ligands bind to modular domains that show remarkable sequence conservation across phyla. One such ligand-binding domain is the RCK 2The abbreviations used are: RCK, regulator of conductance of potassium; MthK, M. thermoautotrophicum potassium channel; TvoK, T. volcanium potassium channel.

Another class of RCK domain, however, contains no apparent nucleotide binding motif but instead contains a Ca2+ binding site. So far, the only two channels that have been demonstrated to contain a Ca2+-binding RCK domain are the BK channel and the prokaryotic channel MthK (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum potassium channel) (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 3Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

X-ray and biochemical studies have suggested that the cytoplasmic ligand binding region of MthK is formed by an octameric ring of RCK domains, with four “tethered” RCK domains that are directly connected to the transmembrane pore and four “soluble” RCK domains (without transmembrane segments) that are docked onto the tethered RCKs (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 12Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An alternating arrangement of tethered and soluble RCK domains gives rise to an octameric ring assembly, called the “gating ring” because of its role in Ca2+-dependent gating of the MthK pore (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 12Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The soluble MthK RCK domain arises from an alternative AUG start codon within the MthK gene, just upstream from the RCK domain coding sequence. Mutation of this second start codon eliminates heterologous overexpression of the MthK RCK domain in E. coli while permitting overexpression of full-length subunits with tethered RCK domains (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). However, many RCK-containing K+ channels do not contain an AUG codon upstream from the RCK domain and eliminating the internal start codon does not necessarily abolish channel function in vivo (13Kuo M.M. Saimi Y. Kung C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4049-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, it has not been entirely clear whether the octameric RCK domain architecture observed with MthK is generally applicable or whether alternative mechanisms exist to generate this architecture. The presence of an apparent RCK domain within the BK channel C terminus has prompted the use of MthK as a limited structural template for BK channels (Fig. 1) (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 3Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

This in turn has provided insight toward potential ligand activation mechanisms for BK channels. However, the correspondence between the Ca2+ binding site of MthK and those of BK channels is not clear. For example, BK channels contain multiple Ca2+ binding sites that operate in low (millimolar) and high (micromolar) affinity ranges (14Xia X.M. Zeng X. Lingle C.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 15Zhang X. Solaro C.R. Lingle C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 607-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Zeng X.H. Xia X.M. Lingle C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MthK displays millimolar affinity activation by Ca2+ at room temperature (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 3Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

However, the low affinity site of the BK channel also imparts activation by Mg2+, whereas MthK has been shown to be insensitive to Mg2+ (10Zadek B. Nimigean C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 418: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is possible that the Ca2+ binding site of MthK does not correspond to the BK channel site. Alternatively, it is possible that these Ca2+ binding sites are homologous structures, although structural elements that impart Mg2+ sensitivity are absent from the MthK site. During a survey of prokaryotic RCK-containing proteins, we identified and cloned a putative potassium channel from Thermoplasma volcanium. This putative channel, TvoK, lacks an AUG start codon in the region preceding the RCK domain, so we wondered whether this protein might form a channel with a non-octameric architecture or whether the TvoK gene might generate a soluble RCK domain without the AUG start codon. In addition, the RCK domain of TvoK contained structural features that were in common with BK channels but absent from MthK (e.g. residues between αA and βB and between βD and αD; Fig. 1). It would ultimately be of interest to resolve whether these structural elements contribute to ligand binding or ligand selectivity in the RCK domain. In this report we describe the molecular architecture and function of TvoK. Although the gene does not contain a second AUG start codon preceding its RCK domain, it does contain an unconventional UUG start codon that results in efficient translation of a soluble TvoK RCK domain. The soluble RCK domain co-purifies with full-length subunits, consistent with a heterooctameric channel assembly. Using single channel recording in planar lipid bilayers, we found that reconstituted TvoK channels are activated not only by Ca2+ but also by Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+, in contrast to MthK, which is activated only by Ca2+. In chimeric channels containing the MthK pore domain, activation by Mg2+ can be imparted by the TvoK RCK domain, suggesting that the RCK domain contains the Mg2+ activation site and that the RCK domain is modular in the sense that ligand binding to this domain can yield the opening of an otherwise different K+ channel pore. Finally, kinetic modeling suggests that activation of TvoK by Ca2+ or Mg2+ is energetically roughly equivalent and either Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding contributes ∼5 kcal/mol toward stabilization of the open state. Channel Constructs—The TvoK gene was PCR-cloned from T. volcanium genomic DNA (ATCC) using primers that added an SphI restriction site to the 5′-end of the gene, the cDNA code for a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site, and a BamHI site to the 3′-end. The PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the pCR-Blunt vector. After removal of an internal SphI site in the coding region by silent mutagenesis, the TvoK gene was subcloned into a modified pQE-82L vector (Qiagen) (11Parfenova L.V. Crane B.M. Rothberg B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21131-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) between the SphI and BamHI sites to generate a thrombin-cleavable hexahistidine-tagged fusion construct. The TvoK wild-type protein could not practically be overexpressed in E. coli at levels sufficient for our biochemical or functional studies. We fortuitously generated a well expressing construct by deleting a region of seven residues near the outer mouth of the putative pore region (residues Leu-39 to Lys-45) after discovering that the analogous stretch of residues is apparently absent from MthK. Several other deletions in the region bounded by residues 39-45 were tested, but none could be consistently overexpressed as well as TvoKΔ-(39-45). This construct was used in all of our subsequent biochemical and functional studies of the full-length channel. Protein Purification—TvoKΔ-(39-45) was overexpressed overnight in E. coli (XL1-Blue; Stratagene) upon induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended, and lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 10% v/v glycerol, pH 8.5, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (1 tablet/50 ml lysate; Roche Applied Science) and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, at 4 °C. Membranes were solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h in 50 mm decyl maltoside (Anatrace). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 rpm, 45 min), and the supernatant was collected. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 8.5, and the supernatant was loaded onto a CoCl2-activated nitrilotriacetic acid-HiTrap column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm decyl maltoside, pH 8.5) followed by 10 volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein was eluted with buffer A containing 400 mm imidazole. The hexahistidine tag was removed by thrombin digestion for 2 h at room temperature. The digest was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using an Amicon-Ultra centrifugal concentrator (molecular weight cutoff 50,000), and the oligomeric channel assembly was further isolated in buffer A by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions that were eluted from the Superdex-200 column between ∼9.5 and 11 ml were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an Amicon concentrator (Millipore). Expression and purification of MthK wild type or MthK-TvoK chimeric channel were performed as described previously for MthK channels (11Parfenova L.V. Crane B.M. Rothberg B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21131-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—The purified TvoKΔ-(39-45) assembly was reconstituted into liposomes composed of E. coli lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described previously (18Heginbotham L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The concentration of protein per lipid in the case of TvoKΔ-(39-45) and MthK-TvoK chimeric channel was 50 μg/mg and for MthK wild type 5 to 10 μg/mg. Single channel recordings were obtained using planar lipid bilayers of POPE:POPG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]) (3:1) lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a horizontal bilayer apparatus. Solutions in both the cis and trans chambers contained 200 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with the addition of either CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, or NiCl2 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 25 mm. We estimated the concentration of contaminating Ca2+ in our solutions to be ∼10 μm, as measured with Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Orion Research). Because of the relatively high concentrations of divalent cations used, no divalent cation buffers were included in the recording solutions. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22-24 °C). Orientation of channels in the bilayer membrane was identified using the intrinsic inward rectification property of the channel, which is similar to MthK (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). TvoKΔ-(39-45) displayed a form of voltage-dependent inactivation or blockade, such that observing channel activity required intermittent hyperpolarizing steps. We have not yet characterized this phenomenon in detail, except to note that it was observed at different ligand concentrations and in the presence of each of the different divalent cations used in these studies. A similar phenomenon has been observed in recordings of MthK in spheroplast membranes (19Kuo M.M. Baker K.A. Wong L. Choe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2151-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices) and are expressed as mean ± S.E. from three to seven different experiments for each data point. Channel activity was quantified as N × Po, and this value was in all cases divided by the number of active channels in the bilayer (N) to estimate the mean open probability (Po). At low divalent ion concentrations that produced low levels of channel activation (Po < 0.25), N was estimated at the end of the experiment by maximally activating the channels using 10 mm Ca2+ added to the apparent cytoplasmic side. To find potentially novel putative K+ channels containing RCK-like cytoplasmic domains, we performed a BLASTp search of archaeal genes using the putative mouse BK channel RCK domain (mslo1, residues His-344 through Cys-619) as the template sequence (2Jiang Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2994-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Our search revealed, among others, a significant result that contained a K+ channel selectivity filter sequence (TVGYG) and at least two putative transmembrane (TM) segments. This was a 348-amino acid putative K+ transport protein from T. volcanium (GenBank™ accession number NP111507), which we called TvoK. Surprisingly, MthK was not returned as a significant result under our search parameters. The search statistics revealed remarkable similarity (40%) and identity (20%) between mslo1 and TvoK within the search region, illustrated in Fig. 1. Comparison of the protein sequences of the full-length TvoK subunit and MthK are consistent with an orthologous relation between these two proteins (48% similarity, 25% identity). Overexpression and Purification of TvoK—In our initial studies, we observed poor expression of the TvoK wild-type protein in E. coli combined with a decrease in culture density, indicating a toxic effect of this protein on E. coli. In an effort to generate a better expressing construct, we performed a comparative alignment of TvoK and MthK pore regions and found that TvoK contains seven additional amino acids in the loop between the putative TM1 and pore helix. When we deleted this short segment, from residues Leu-39 to Lys-45 (Fig. 1), we observed decreased apparent toxicity and greater protein expression. Fig. 2A illustrates that the TvoKΔ-(39-45) expression products (visualized via anti-penta-His antibody) migrate on SDS-PAGE primarily in two bands, with apparent molecular masses of 38 and 26 kDa. These are consistent with the predicted masses of the full-length construct and the ∼250-residue C-terminal fragment of this construct. The TvoKΔ-(39-45) expression products were purified by metal affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. The decyl maltoside-solubilized protein elutes with a peak at ∼10.5 ml on a Superdex-200 10/300 column, consistent with a ∼250 kDa assembly, estimated by comparison to elution of protein standards using this column (Fig. 2B). The apparent 250-kDa assembly is consistent with a hetero-octamer comprised of four full-length subunits and four RCK domains, as was hypothesized for MthK (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothetical architecture, the purified TvoK assembly partially dissociates in SDS-containing sample buffer and migrates with apparent molecular masses of ∼200, 38, and 26 kDa (Fig. 2B, right). Each of these bands was identified by in-gel tryptic digest followed by mass spectrometry of the tryptic fragments, and the mass fingerprints are consistent with TvoKΔ-(39-45) (identified in the ∼200- and 38-kDa bands) and the TvoK RCK domain (identified in the 26-kDa band). Mechanism Underlying Generation of the Soluble TvoK RCK Domain—Interestingly, the TvoK gene contains no secondary AUG start codon in its TM2-RCK linker region, as is the case with MthK; thus, we were puzzled by the appearance of the soluble TvoK RCK domain. Although GUG also occasionally serves as a start codon in prokaryotes (in 14% of E. coli genes) (22Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. II I Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar), the TvoK gene contains no GUG in this region either. Because of the importance of the soluble RCK domain in determining the molecular architecture of these channels, we explored two possibilities for the generation of this protein. One possibility is the existence of a protease-vulnerable cleavage site at the amino end of the RCK domain. We reasoned that any (or several) of the basic residues in this region could be vulnerable to cleavage by endogenous E. coli proteases. To narrow down the array of possible cleavage sites, we first estimated the molecular mass of the purified RCK domain by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The estimated mass was 26,230 Da, consistent with the mass of the TvoK RCK domain starting from Leu-115 and ending at the thrombin cleavage site (with the putative last ten residues being EEAIKGLVPR). This result suggested a possible cleavage site at the carboxyl side of Lys-114, possibly due to activity of the Lys-C protease, for example. To test for the presence of one or more protease-vulnerable cleavage sites near this residue, we generated site-specific mutants of Lys → Asn or Arg → Asn at positions Arg-111, Lys-114, and Lys-117, overexpressed the mutants in E. coli, and probed the lysate for hexahistidine-tagged proteins by Western blot. If any of these residues were important for recognition or cleavage by a Lys or Arg protease, then mutation to Asn should eliminate or reduce cleavage and thus result in a reduction in the 26-kDa band. We observed that neither the K114N nor the K117N mutations reduce the relative intensity of the 26-kDa band compared with wild type (not shown). However, R111N did reduce the relative intensity of the 26-kDa band (Fig. 2). If this were due to a reduction of proteolytic cleavage at this site, however, then one would have expected the mass of the wild-type RCK fragment to be significantly larger than the estimated 26,230 Da. We therefore considered an alternative possibility, that the TvoK gene contains a second start codon that is neither AUG nor GUG, but UUG, which is rarely used as a start codon in many prokaryotes (23Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5656-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Files J.G. Weber K. Coulondre C. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 95: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such a UUG codon (normally translated as Leu) does exist at the 3′-side of the codon for Lys-114, consistent with the presumed N terminus of the soluble RCK domain. This codon is preceded by an optimal Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence (AGGAGG) that overlaps with the codons for Arg-111 and Arg-112; thus, the reduction of the 26-kDa band observed with the R111N mutation is consistent with reduced translation efficiency due to disruption of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. To test the hypothesis that TvoK uses the rare UUG start codon, we constructed the mutants L115N (TTG → AAT) and L115L (TTG → CTG). Each of these mutants eliminates the putative UUG start codon, and L115L does so without changing the amino acid sequence. The results (Fig. 2A, right) illustrate that each of these mutants specifically abolishes the 26-kDa band without reducing the 38-kDa band. Together, these results indicate that UUG is a start codon for translation of the soluble TvoK RCK domain. TvoKΔ-(39-45) Can Be Activated by Ca2+ or Mg2+—Many RCK domains contain a consensus nucleotide binding motif (GXGXXG), whereas the only known examples of RCK domains that bind Ca2+ are MthK and the mammalian BK channel. A sequence comparison between TvoK and MthK indicated that the acidic Ca2+-coordinating side chains in MthK may also be present at the proper locations in the TvoK RCK domain, whereas the consensus GXGXXG motif found in nucleotide-binding RCK domains is absent from TvoK (Fig. 1). To determine the activation mechanism of the putative TvoK channel, purified TvoKΔ-(39-45) was reconstituted in liposomes, which in turn were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers to obtain single channel recordings. We observed little consistent channel activity in solutions containing only 200 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, at both sides of the membrane. However, we observed that channel activity consistently increased when CaCl2 was included in the recording solutions (Fig. 3A). Using recordings obtained under bi-ionic conditions (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm KCl cis:200 mm KCl trans, with 5 mm CaCl2 on both sides), we found that TvoKΔ-(39-45) is selective for K+ over Na+ by a ratio of at least 100:1, as determined by the shift of the reversal potential to EK (not shown). In symmetrical 200 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, TvoK displays inward rectification similar to that observed with the closely related MthK, with a chord conductance of 160 ± 9.0 pS at -200 mV (Fig. 3C). We quantified the relation between Po and [Ca2+ the binding of at least two Ca2+ ions/channel to promote opening. If TvoK assumes the same molecular architecture as MthK with eight RCK domains containing one Ca2+ binding site each, then the Hill coefficient of 1.7 would be consistent with a relatively weak positive cooperativity among subunits to stabilize the open state. Although both MthK and the mammalian BK channel display low affinity activation by Ca2+, Ca2+ activation in MthK appears to be relatively selective, i.e. Mg2+ does not activate MthK, and biochemical assays suggest that Mg2+ does not stabilize the MthK RCK gating ring (10Zadek B.

To determine whether ligand activation of TvoK shows the same selectivity as MthK and thus (possibly) a single binding site of roughly the same properties, we tested the activation properties of the channel in the presence of other divalent cations. We found that TvoK is activated by Mg2+ in the millimolar range (Fig. 3, B and D). We then quantified the relation between Po and [Mg2+] and found that Mg2+, similar to Ca2+, activates the channel with an EC50 of 2.0 mm and a Hill coefficient of 2.2.
