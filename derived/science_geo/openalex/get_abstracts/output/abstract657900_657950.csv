https://openalex.org/W3070527583,"In radiomics studies, researchers usually need to develop a supervised machine learning model to map image features onto the clinical conclusion. A classical machine learning pipeline consists of several steps, including normalization, feature selection, and classification. It is often tedious to find an optimal pipeline with appropriate combinations. We designed an open-source software package named FeAture Explorer (FAE). It was programmed with Python and used NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learning modules. FAE can be used to extract image features, preprocess the feature matrix, develop different models automatically, and evaluate them with common clinical statistics. FAE features a user-friendly graphical user interface that can be used by radiologists and researchers to build many different pipelines, and to compare their results visually. To prove the effectiveness of FAE, we developed a candidate model to classify the clinical-significant prostate cancer (CS PCa) and non-CS PCa using the PROSTATEx dataset. We used FAE to try out different combinations of feature selectors and classifiers, compare the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of different models on the validation dataset, and evaluate the model using independent test data. The final model with the analysis of variance as the feature selector and linear discriminate analysis as the classifier was selected and evaluated conveniently by FAE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on the training, validation, and test dataset achieved results of 0.838, 0.814, and 0.824, respectively. FAE allows researchers to build radiomics models and evaluate them using an independent testing dataset. It also provides easy model comparison and result visualization. We believe FAE can be a convenient tool for radiomics studies and other medical studies involving supervised machine learning."

The spectrum of relationships between plastics and bacteria, however, is little understood. The first objective of this study was to examine plastics as substrates for communities of Bacteria in estuarine surface waters. We used next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize communities from plastics collected in the field, and over the course of two colonization experiments, from biofilms that developed on plastic (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene) and glass substrates placed in the environment. Both field sampling and colonization experiments were conducted in estuarine tributaries of the lower Chesapeake Bay. As a second objective, we concomitantly analyzed biofilms on plastic substrates to ascertain the presence and abundance of Vibrio spp. bacteria, then isolated three human pathogens, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus, and determined their antibiotic-resistant profiles. In both components of this study, we compared our results with analyses conducted on paired samples of estuarine water. This research adds to a nascent literature that suggests environmental factors govern the development of bacterial communities on plastics, more so than the characteristics of the plastic substrates themselves. In addition, this study is the first to culture three pathogenic vibrios from plastics in estuaries, reinforcing and expanding upon earlier reports of plastic pollution as a habitat for Vibrio species. The antibiotic resistance detected among the isolates, coupled with the longevity of plastics in the aqueous environment, suggests biofilms on plastics have potential to persist and serve as focal points of potential pathogens and horizontal gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W3076873470,"WRKY transcription factors regulate diverse biological processes in plants, including abiotic and biotic stress responses, and constitute one of the largest transcription factor families in higher plants. Although the past decade has seen significant progress towards identifying and functionally characterizing WRKY genes in diverse species, little is known about the WRKY family in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) moench). Here we report the comprehensive identification of 94 putative WRKY transcription factors (SbWRKYs). The SbWRKYs were divided into three groups (I, II, and III), with those in group II further classified into five subgroups (IIa–IIe), based on their conserved domains and zinc finger motif types. WRKYs from the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were used for the phylogenetic analysis of all SbWRKY genes. Motif analysis showed that all SbWRKYs contained either one or two WRKY domains and that SbWRKYs within the same group had similar motif compositions. SbWRKY genes were located on all 10 sorghum chromosomes, and some gene clusters and two tandem duplications were detected. SbWRKY gene structure analysis showed that they contained 0–7 introns, with most SbWRKY genes consisting of two introns and three exons. Gene ontology (GO) annotation functionally categorized SbWRKYs under cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes. A cis-element analysis showed that all SbWRKYs contain at least one stress response-related cis-element. We exploited publicly available microarray datasets to analyze the expression profiles of 78 SbWRKY genes at different growth stages and in different tissues. The induction of SbWRKYs by different abiotic stresses hinted at their potential involvement in stress responses. qRT-PCR analysis revealed different expression patterns for SbWRKYs during drought stress. Functionally characterized WRKY genes in Arabidopsis and other species will provide clues for the functional characterization of putative orthologs in sorghum. Thus, the present study delivers a solid foundation for future functional studies of SbWRKY genes and their roles in the response to critical stresses such as drought."
https://openalex.org/W3049571246,"The child mortality rate is an essential measurement of socioeconomic growth and the quality of life in Ethiopia which is one among the six countries that account for half of the global under-five deaths. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the potential risk factors for child mortality in Ethiopia. Data for the study was drawn from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data conducted in 2016. A two-part random effects regression model was employed to identify the associated predictors of child mortality. The study found that 53.3% of mothers did not face any child death, while 46.7% lost at least one. Vaccinated child (IRR = 0.735, 95%CI: 0.647, 0.834), were currently using contraceptive (IRR = 0.885, 95%CI: 0.814, 0.962), who had antenatal care visit four or more times visit (IRR = 0.841, 95%CI: 0.737,0.960), fathers whose level of education is secondary or above(IRR = 0.695, 95%CI: 0.594, 0.814), mothers who completed their primary school(IRR = 0.785, 95%CI: 0.713, 0.864), mothers who have birth interval greater than 36 months (IRR = 0.728, 95%CI: 0.676, 0.783), where the age of the mother at first birth is greater than 16 years(IRR = 0.711, 95%CI: 0.674, 0.750) associated with the small number of child death. While multiple births (IRR = 1.355, 95%CI: 1.249, 1.471, four and above birth order (IRR = 1.487, 95%CI: 1.373, 1.612) and had working father (IRR = 1.125, 95%CI: 1.049, 1.206) associated with a higher number of child death. The variance components for the random effects showed significant variation of child mortality between enumeration areas. Policies and programs aimed at addressing enumeration area variations in child mortality need to be formulated and their implementation must be strongly pursued. Efforts are also needed to extend educational programmers aimed at educating mothers on the benefits of the antenatal checkup before first birth, spacing their birth interval, having their child vaccinated, and selecting a safe place of delivery to reduce child mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3049666838,"In the present work, a series of magnetically separable Fe3O4/g-C3N4/MoO3 nanocomposite catalysts were prepared. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, EDX, TEM, FT-IR, UV-Vis DRS, TGA, PL, BET and VSM. The photocatalytic activity of photocatalytic materials was evaluated by catalytic degradation of tetracycline solution under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the influences of weight percent of MoO3 and scavengers of the reactive species on the degradation activity were investigated. The results showed that the Fe3O4/g-C3N4/MoO3 (30%) nanocomposites exhibited highest removal ability for TC, 94% TC was removed during the treatment. Photocatalytic activity of Fe3O4/g-C3N4/MoO3 (30%) was about 6.9, 5, and 19.9-fold higher than those of the MoO3, g-C3N4, and Fe3O4/g-C3N4 samples, respectively. The excellent photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the Z-scheme structure formed between MoO3 and g-C3N4, which enhanced the efficient separation of the electron-hole and sufficient utilization charge carriers for generating active radials. The highly improved activity was also partially beneficial from the increase in adsorption of the photocatalysts in visible range due to the combinaion of Fe3O4. Superoxide ions (·O2−) was the primary reactive species for the photocatalytic degradation of TC, as degradation rate were decreased to 6% in solution containing benzoquinone (BQ). Data indicate that the novel Fe3O4/g-C3N4/MoO3 was favorable for the degradation of high concentrations of tetracycline in water."
https://openalex.org/W3067698579,"Genome editing is now widely used in plant science for both basic research and molecular crop breeding. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, through its precision, high efficiency and versatility, allows for editing of many sites in plant genomes. This system has been highly successful to produce knock-out mutants through the introduction of frameshift mutations due to error-prone repair pathways. Nevertheless, recent new CRISPR-based technologies such as base editing and prime editing can generate precise and on demand nucleotide conversion, allowing for fine-tuning of protein function and generating gain-of-function mutants. However, genome editing through CRISPR systems still have some drawbacks and limitations, such as the PAM restriction and the need for more diversity in CRISPR tools to mediate different simultaneous catalytic activities. In this study, we successfully used the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) for the introduction of frameshift mutations in the tetraploid genome of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum). We also developed a S. aureus-cytosine base editor that mediate nucleotide conversions, allowing for precise modification of specific residues or regulatory elements in potato. Our proof-of-concept in potato expand the plant dicot CRISPR toolbox for biotechnology and precision breeding applications."
https://openalex.org/W3058533866,"Dearth of genomic resources particularly, microsatellite markers in nutritionally and commercially important fruit crop, guava necessitate the development of the novel genomic SSR markers through the library enrichment techniques. Three types of 3’ -biotinylated oligonucleotide probes [(CT)14, (GT)12, and (AAC)8] were used to develop microsatellite enriched libraries. A total of 153 transformed colonies were screened of which 111 positive colonies were subjected for Sanger sequencing. The clones having more than five motif repeats were selected for primer designing and a total of 38 novel genomic simple sequence repeats could be identified. The g-SSRs had the motif groups ranging from monomer to pentamer out of which dimer group occurred the most (89.47%). Out of 38 g-SSRs markers developed, 26 were found polymorphic, which showed substantial genetic diversity among the guava genotypes including wild species. The average number of alleles per locus, major allele frequency, gene diversity, expected heterozygosity and polymorphic information content of 26 SSRs were 3.46, 0.56, 0.53, 0.29 and 0.46, respectively. The rate of cross-species transferability of the developed g-SSR loci varied from 38.46 to 80.77% among the studied wild Psidium species. Generation of N-J tree based on 26 SSRs grouped the 40 guava genotypes into six clades with two out-groups, the wild guava species showed genetic distinctness from cultivated genotypes. Furthermore, population structure analysis grouped the guava genotypes into three genetic groups, which were partly supported by PCoA and N-J tree. Further, AMOVA and PCoA deciphered high genetic diversity among the present set of guava genotypes including wild species. Thus, the developed novel g-SSRs were found efficient and informative for diversity and population structure analyses of the guava genotypes. These developed novel g-SSR loci would add to the new genomic resource in guava, which may be utilized in genomic-assisted guava breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3049217745,"The mechanistic basis of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer remains poorly understood. We previously reported that the sclerostin domain containing-1 (SOSTDC1) protein is overexpressed in the secretome of metastatic colorectal cancer cells and can inhibit liver homing. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of SOSTDC1 for promoting invasiveness and progression of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. SOSTDC1 inhibition of BMP4 maintains the expression of cancer stem cell traits, including SOX2 and NANOG. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses reveal the association of SOSTDC1 with ALCAM/CD166, which was confirmed by confocal microscopy and competition ELISA. Interaction with ALCAM is mediated by the N-terminal region of SOSTDC1, which contains a sequence similar to the ALCAM-binding motif used by CD6. Knocking down either SOSTDC1 or ALCAM expression, or using blocking antibodies, reduces the invasive activity by inhibiting Src and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In addition, ALCAM interacts with the α2ß1 and α1ß1 integrins, providing a possible link to Src activation. Finally, inoculation of SOSTDC1-silenced metastatic cells increases mouse survival by inhibiting liver metastasis. In conclusion, SOSTDC1 promotes invasion and liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, by overcoming BMP4-specific antimetastatic signals and inducing ALCAM-mediated Src and PI3K/AKT activation. These experiments underscore the potential of SOSTDC1 as a therapeutic target in metastatic colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3056099444,"Oligomycins are macrolide antibiotics, produced by Streptomyces spp. that show antagonistic effects against several microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes and the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. Conidiogenesis, germination of conidia and formation of appressoria are determining factors pertaining to pathogenicity and successful diseases cycles of filamentous fungal phytopathogens. The goal of this research was to evaluate the in vitro suppressive effects of two oligomycins, oligomycin B and F along with a commercial fungicide Nativo® 75WG on hyphal growth, conidiogenesis, conidial germination, and appressorial formation of the wheat blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum (MoT) pathotype. We also determined the efficacy of these two oligomycins and the fungicide product in vivo in suppressing wheat blast with a detached leaf assay. Both oligomycins suppressed the growth of MoT mycelium in a dose dependent manner. Between the two natural products, oligomycin F provided higher inhibition of MoT hyphal growth compared to oligomycin B with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.005 and 0.05 μg/disk, respectively. The application of the compounds completely halted conidial formation of the MoT mycelium in agar medium. Further bioassays showed that these compounds significantly inhibited MoT conidia germination and induced lysis. The compounds also caused abnormal germ tube formation and suppressed appressorial formation of germinated spores. Interestingly, the application of these macrolides significantly inhibited wheat blast on detached leaves of wheat. This is the first report on the inhibition of mycelial growth, conidiogenesis, germination of conidia, deleterious morphological changes in germinated conidia, and suppression of blast disease of wheat by oligomycins from Streptomyces spp. Further study is needed to unravel the precise mode of action of these natural compounds and consider them as biopesticides for controlling wheat blast."
https://openalex.org/W3048976742,"NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is the most abundant NOX isoform in the kidney; however, its importance for renal function has only recently emerged. The NOX4-dependent pathway regulates many factors essential for proper sodium handling in the distal nephron. However, the functional significance of this pathway in the control of sodium reabsorption during the initiation of chronic kidney disease is not established. The goal of this study was to test Nox4-dependent ENaC regulation in two models: SS hypertension and STZ-induced type 1 diabetes. First, we showed that genetic ablation of Nox4 in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat attenuated a high-salt (HS)-induced increase in epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity in the cortical collecting duct. We also found that H2 O2 upregulated ENaC activity, and H2 O2 production was reduced in both the renal cortex and medulla in SSNox4-/- rats fed an HS diet. Second, in the streptozotocin model of hyperglycemia-induced renal injury ENaC activity in hyperglycemic animals was elevated in SS but not SSNox4-/- rats. NaCl cotransporter (NCC) expression was increased compared to healthy controls, while expression values between SS and SSNox4-/- groups were similar. These data emphasize a critical contribution of the NOX4-mediated pathway in maladaptive upregulation of ENaC-mediated sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron in the conditions of HS- and hyperglycemia-induced kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W3051898124,"It is widely believed that conspiracy theory beliefs are the product of perceived lack of control. However, to date there is mixed evidence, at best, to support this claim. We consider the reasons why conspiracy theory beliefs do not appear to be based in any straightforward way on control beliefs, interrogating existing findings and presenting new data that call the relationship into question. Across six studies conducted online using MTurk samples, we observed no effect of control manipulations on conspiracy theory beliefs, while replicating previously reported correlational evidence of their association. The results suggest that conspiracy beliefs are not suitable for compensating for threats to control. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between experimental and correlational effects and examine the limitations of the studies."
https://openalex.org/W3052302092,"Region-specific local landraces represent a germplasm diversity adapted and acclimatized to local conditions, and are ideal to breed for targeted market niches while maintaining the variability of heirloom traits. A collection of 180 pepper accessions, collected from 62 diverse locations across six Balkan countries, were characterized and evaluated for phenotypic and biochemical variation during a multi-year environment. An assortment of 32 agro-morphological, fruit quality, and virus resistance traits were evaluated, and the top 10% accessions were identified. A wide range of trait variation concerning plant architecture, inflorescence and fruit traits, yield and fruit quality was observed, and appreciable variation was noticed. According to hierarchical clustering, six distinct clusters were established based on pre-defined varietal groups. Divergence among accessions for phenotypic and fruit compositional variability was analyzed, and eight principal components were identified that contributed ~71% of the variation, with fruit shape, width, wall thickness, weight, and fruit quality traits being the most discriminant. Evaluation of the response to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and pepper mild mottle mosaic virus (PMMoV) showed that 24 and 1 accession were resistant, respectively while no tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) resistance was found. Considerable diversity for agro-bio-morphological traits indicates the Balkan pepper collection as good gene sources for pre-breeding and cultivar development that are locally adapted."
https://openalex.org/W3067046549,"Biological control (biocontrol) as a component of pest management strategies reduces reliance on synthetic chemicals, and seemingly offers a natural approach that minimizes environmental impact. However, introducing a new organism to new environments as a classical biocontrol agent can have broad and unanticipated biodiversity effects and conservation consequences. Nematodes are currently used in a variety of commercial biocontrol applications, including the use of Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita as an agent targeting pest slug and snail species. This species was originally discovered in Germany, and is generally thought to have European origins. P. hermaphrodita is sold under the trade name Nemaslug®, and is available only in European markets. However, this nematode species was discovered in New Zealand and the western United States, though its specific origins remained unclear. In this study, we analyzed 45 nematode strains representing eight different Phasmarhabditis species, collected from nine countries around the world. A segment of nematode mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Our mtDNA phylogenies were overall consistent with previous analyses based on nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) loci. The recently discovered P. hermaphrodita strains in New Zealand and the United States had mtDNA haplotypes nearly identical to that of Nemaslug®, and these were placed together in an intraspecific monophyletic clade with high support in maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. We also examined bacteria that co-cultured with the nematode strains isolated in Oregon, USA, by analyzing 16S rRNA sequences. Eight different bacterial genera were found to associate with these nematodes, though Moraxella osloensis, the bacteria species used in the Nemaslug® formulation, was not detected. This study provided evidence that nematodes deriving from the Nemaslug® biocontrol product have invaded countries where its use is prohibited by regulatory agencies and not commercially available."
https://openalex.org/W3049578885,"To examine the influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) on axial ocular elongation, we intraocularly injected an EGF antibody and an EGFR antibody into young guinea pigs with lens-induced axial elongation (myopization). Mean axial elongation was reduced in the eyes injected with the EGF/EGFR-antibody compared with the contralateral control eyes injected with PBS (phosphate-buffered solution) (0.43 ± 0.13 mm vs 0.53 ± 0.13 mm; P < .001). The intereye difference in axial length increased (P = .005) as the doses of the EGF antibody and EGFR antibody increased. As a corollary, the thickness of the retina at the posterior pole was dose-dependently increased in the injected eyes compared to the contralateral control eyes. Immunohistochemical staining for EGF and the relative mRNA expression of EGF and EGFR were the highest in eyes not injected with the EGF antibody or EGFR antibody and decreased (P < .05) as the dose of EGF antibody or EGFR antibody increased. In an in vitro study, EGF had a stimulating effect and the EGF antibody had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and migration of RPE cells. The findings showed that the intravitreal application of an EGF antibody and EGFR antibody is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in lens-induced axial elongation in young guinea pigs. The EGFR family may play a role in axial elongation of the eye and in the development of myopia."
https://openalex.org/W3049727055,"The characterization of the microbial population of many niches of the organism, as the gastrointestinal tract, is now possible thanks to the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing technique. Several studies in the companion animals field already investigated faecal microbiome in healthy or affected subjects, although the methodologies used in the different laboratories and the limited number of animals recruited in each experiment does not allow a straight comparison among published results. In the present study, we report data collected from several in house researches carried out in healthy dogs, with the aim to seek for a variability of microbial taxa in the faeces, caused by factors such as diet and sex. The database contains 340 samples from 132 dogs, collected serially during dietary intervention studies. The procedure of samples collection, storage, DNA extraction and sequencing, bioinformatic and statistical analysis followed a standardized pipeline. Microbial profiles of faecal samples have been analyzed applying dimensional reduction discriminant analysis followed by random forest analysis to the relative abundances of genera in the feces as variables. The results supported the responsiveness of microbiota at a genera taxonomic level to dietary factor and allowed to cluster dogs according this factor with high accuracy. Also sex factor clustered dogs, with castrated males and spayed females forming a separated group in comparison to intact dogs, strengthening the hypothesis of a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and endocrine status of the host. The findings of the present analysis are promising for a better comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate the connection of the microorganisms living the gastrointestinal tract with the diet and the host. This preliminary study deserves further investigation for the identification of the factors affecting faecal microbiome in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3061993704,"Climate change, limited water resources and expected population increases would require crops which contribute toward more resilient, more productive, more sustainable and climate-smart food systems. The cactus pear is a drought-resistant and sustainable food source to humans and livestock alike. Cactus mucilage has multiple applications in the food and packaging industry. It is eco-friendly, economical, functional and has multiple health benefits. However, the researchers observed umpteen variations in extracted mucilage yield and viscosity every time the cladodes were harvested, making the standardisation of formulations troublesome. We aimed to examine the effect of weather conditions on the physicochemical characteristics of cactus pear cladodes and mucilage extracted over two seasons to understand these observed variations in mucilage characteristics. Forty cladodes, ten from each of Opuntia ficus-indica Algerian, Morado and Gymno-Carpo and Opuntia robusta Robusta were harvested every month from February to August in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Daily weather data were obtained, weight and moisture contents determined on cladodes and yield, viscosity, pH, conductivity and malic acid content determined on extracted mucilage. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the weather conditions, cladode properties, and mucilage properties. Contrary to common belief, neither increasing cladode weight as they grow, nor rainfall were the leading causes of mucilage inconsistencies. However, the correlations showed a relationship between environmental temperatures, cladode pH and conductivity, and mucilage viscosity and yields. In hot summer weather, the pH was lower, which led to an abundance of positive ions in cladodes. The H+ ions neutralise the negative charges along the outstretched mucilage molecule, causing it to coil up, reducing the viscosity of the mucilage. Thus, environmental temperatures rather than rainfall or cladode maturity influenced the physicochemical characteristics of mucilage. The findings should make an essential contribution in predicting the physicochemical characteristics of mucilage for specific food-related functions by observing the weather conditions."

This prediction was based on a computational model that quantified in the USA such structural-demographic forces for instability as popular immiseration, intraelite competition, and state weakness prior to 2010. Using these trends as inputs, the model calculated and projected forward in time the Political Stress Indicator, which in the past was strongly correlated with socio-political instability. Ortmans et al. Turchin P. 2010 conducted a similar structural-demographic study for the United Kingdom. Here we use the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive for the US, UK, and several major Western European countries to assess these structural-demographic predictions. We find that such measures of socio-political instability as anti-government demonstrations and riots increased dramatically during the 2010–2020 decade in all of these countries."
https://openalex.org/W3049218659,"An important economic reason for the loss of local breeds is that they tend to be less productive, and hence having less market value than commercial breeds. Nevertheless, local breeds often have irreplaceable values, genetically and sociologically. In the breeding programs with local breeds, it is crucial to balance the selection for genetic gain and the maintaining of genetic diversity. These two objectives are often conflicting, and finding the optimal point of the trade-off has been a challenge for breeders. Genomic selection (GS) provides a revolutionary tool for the genetic improvement of farm animals. At the same time, it can increase inbreeding and produce a more rapid depletion of genetic variability of the selected traits in future generations. Optimum-contribution selection (OCS) represents an approach to maximize genetic gain while constraining inbreeding within a targeted range. In the present study, 515 Ningxiang pigs were genotyped with the Illumina Porcine SNP60 array or the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler Porcine 50K array. The Ningxiang pigs were found to be highly inbred at the genomic level. Average locus-wise inbreeding coefficients were 0.41 and 0.37 for the two SNP arrays used, whereas genomic inbreeding coefficients based on runs of homozygosity were 0.24 and 0.25, respectively. Simulated phenotypic data were used to assess the utility of genomic OCS (GOCS) in comparison with GS without inbreeding control. GOCS was conducted under two scenarios, selecting sires only (GOCS_S) or selecting sires and dams (GOCS_SD), while kinships were constrained on selected parents. The genetic gain for average daily body weight gain (ADG) per generation was between 18.99 and 20.55 g with GOCS_S, and between 23.20 and 28.92 with GOCS_SD, and it varied from 25.38 to 48.38 g under GS without controlling inbreeding. While the rate of genetic gain per generation obtained using GS was substantially larger than that obtained by the two scenarios of genomic OCS in the beginning generations of selection, the difference in the genetic gain of ADG between GS and GOCS reduced quickly in latter generations. At generation ten, the difference in the realized rates of genetic gain between GS and GOCS_SD diminished and ended up with even a slightly higher genetic gain with GOCS_SD, due to the rapid loss of genetic variance with GS and fixation of causative genes. The rate of inbreeding was mostly maintained below 5% per generation with genomic OCS, whereas it increased to between 10.5% and 15.3% per generation with GS. Therefore, genomic OCS appears to be a sustainable strategy for the genetic improvement of local breeds such as Ningxiang pigs, but keeping mind that a variety of GOCS methods exist and the optimal forms remain to be exploited further."

In accordance with the importance of social factors in development, in this longitudinal study of 156 typically developing children, we investigated whether educational setting—classes containing children with disabilities (inclusive) or without such children (general education)—is associated with enhanced ToM development. ToM was measured with the ToM Scale, the Chocolate task and the Faux Pas Recognition Test. Analysis showed that ToM development was better among children educated in inclusive classes than among those educated in traditional classes. The results have implications for ToM development among children with and without disabilities as well as for educational practice."
https://openalex.org/W3057079790,"Berry firmness is one of the main selection criteria for table grape breeding. However, the underlying genetic determinants and mechanisms involved in gene expression during berry development are still poorly understood. In this study, eighteen libraries sampled from Vitis vinifera L. cv. 'Red Globe' and 'Muscat Hamburg' at three developmental stages (preveraison, veraison and maturation) were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The firmness of 'Red Globe' was significantly higher than that of 'Muscat Hamburg' at the three developmental stages. In total, a set of 4,559 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified between 'Red Globe' and 'Muscat Hamburg' in the preveraison (2,259), veraison (2030) and maturation stages (2682), including 302 transcription factors (TFs). Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that 23 TFs were predicted to be highly correlated with fruit firmness and propectin content. In addition, the differential expression of the PE, PL, PG, β-GAL, GATL, WAK, XTH and EXP genes might be the reason for the differences in firmness between 'Red Globe' and 'Muscat Hamburg'. The results will provide new information for analysis of grape berry firmness and softening."
https://openalex.org/W3058634330,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a serious public health problem. There is limited information regarding the genetics of MRSA strains among the native Iraqi and incoming Syrian refugee communities. We aimed to characterize the genotypes and different virulence factors of MRSA in strains isolated from these two communities. Frozen MRSA strains (125) isolated from the native Iraqi and Syrian refugee communities were used in this study. PCR (singleplex and multiplex) and agr typing was used for the genotypic analysis of different virulence genes. We tested for the presence of virulence genes including pvl, arcA, tst, lukE/lukD, hla, hlb, eta, etb and agr. Prevalence of arcA MRSA in the Iraqi community (56.58%) was significantly higher (p = 0.008) than that in the Syrian refugee community (32.66%). Prevalence of lukE-lukD was also significantly higher (p = 0.001) in the Iraqi (82.89%) compared to that in the Syrian refugee community (57.14%). Further, prevalence of hla MRSA in the Iraqi community was (93.4%) and in the Syrian refugee community was (71.4%); (p = 0.0008). No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of pvl, tst, eta, etb and hlb. The most dominant agr types in both Iraqi (76.1% and 10.5%) and Syrian refugee (44.9% and 18.37%) communities were I and III. To sum up, no significant differences were observed between the groups for a majority of virulence factors. This is the first investigation of MRSA genotypes and virulence in both these communities. These results could be useful for further studies that assess the genetic relatedness of strains in the region for epidemiological and monitoring purposes, which would be crucial to limiting the spread of MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W3048979625,"With desirable physical performances of impressive actuation strain, high energy density, high degree of electromechanical coupling and high mechanical compliance, dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely employed to actuate the soft robots. However, there are many challenges to establish the dynamic models for DEAs, such as their inherent nonlinearity, complex electromechanical coupling, and time-dependent viscoelastic behavior. Moreover, most previous studies concentrated on the planar DEAs, but the studies on DEAs with some other functional shapes are insufficient. In this paper, by investigating a conical DEA with the material of polydimethylsiloxane and considering the influence of inertia, we propose a dynamic model based on the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This dynamic model can describe the complex motion characteristics of the conical DEA. Based on the experimental data, the differential evolution algorithm is employed to identify the undetermined parameters of the developed dynamic model. The result of the model validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the model."
https://openalex.org/W3050470919,"Cardiometabolic syndrome has become a global health issue. Heart failure is a common comorbidity of cardiometabolic syndrome. Successful drug development to prevent cardiometabolic syndrome and associated comorbidities requires preclinical models predictive of human conditions. To characterize the heart failure component of cardiometabolic syndrome, cardiometabolic, metabolic, and renal biomarkers were evaluated in lean and obese ZSF1 19- to 32-week-old male rats. Histopathological assessment of kidneys and hearts was performed. Cardiac function, exercise capacity, and left ventricular gene expression were also analyzed. Obese ZSF1 rats exhibited multiple features of human cardiometabolic syndrome by pathological changes in systemic renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular disease circulating biomarkers. Hemodynamic assessment, echocardiography, and decreased exercise capacity confirmed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. RNA-seq results demonstrated changes in left ventricular gene expression associated with fatty acid and branched chain amino acid metabolism, cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. Twelve weeks of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) treatment significantly decreased body weight, food intake, blood glucose, and triglycerides and improved exercise capacity in obese ZSF1 males. Systemic cardiovascular injury markers were significantly lower in GDF15-treated obese ZSF1 rats. Obese ZSF1 male rats represent a preclinical model for human cardiometabolic syndrome with established heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. GDF15 treatment mediated dietary response and demonstrated a cardioprotective effect in obese ZSF1 rats."
https://openalex.org/W3060703051,"Background HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) poses a threat to the HIV epidemic control in Zambia especially in sub-populations such as the 15-24 years where there is poor virological suppression. Understanding the prevalence and patterns of HIVDR in this population (15-24 years) will contribute to defining effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, improving clinical decision making, and supporting behavioral change interventions needed to achieve HIV epidemic control. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of study enrollment data from the Project YES! Youth Engaging for Success randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were 15 to 24 years old, who knew their HIV status, and had been on ART for at least 6 months. All participants completed a survey and underwent viral load (VL) testing. Participants with viral failure (VL ≥1,000 copies/mL) underwent HIVDR testing which included analysis of mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes. Results A total of 99 out of 273 analyzed participants receiving ART had VL failure, of whom 77 had successful HIVDR amplification and analysis. Out of the 77, 75% (58) had at least one drug resistant mutation, among which 83% (48/58) required a drug change. Among the 58 with HIVDR mutations, the prevalence of at least one HIVDR mutation to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 81%, 65.5% and 1.7%. The mutation M184V which confers resistance to NRTI drugs of lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) was the most common (81%) among NRTI associated mutations followed by K65R (34.5%) which is associated with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) resistance. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) which confer resistance primarily to zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T) and other NRTIs were observed at 32.8%. Common TAMs were K70RTQNE (32.8%), K219QE (22.4%), D67N (17.2%) and T215IT (15.5%). The most common NNRTI associated mutation was the K103N (65.5%) which confers resistance to both efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). There was a relatively high occurrence of other NNRTI mutations V106A (36.2%), as well as Y188C (36.2%) and Y181C (36.2%) which confer resistance to etravirine. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of HIVDR including TAMs despite majority of these patients (90.48%) being on AZT or d4T sparing first line ART among the youth. Emergence of these mutations including the NNRTI associated mutations (Y181C and Y188C) may compromise future second- and third-line regimens in the absence of routine HIVDR testing. HIVDR monitoring at start of ART or at first-line failure can better inform clinical decision making and ART programing."
https://openalex.org/W3049299049,"Several congenital myopathies of slow skeletal muscles are associated with mutations in the tropomyosin (Tpm) TPM3 gene. Tropomyosin is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of muscle contraction. Two Tpm isoforms, γ (Tpm3.12) and β (Tpm2.2) are expressed in human slow skeletal muscles forming γγ-homodimers and γβ-heterodimers of Tpm molecules. We applied various methods to investigate how myopathy-causing mutations M9R, E151A, and K169E in the Tpm γ-chain modify the structure-functional properties of Tpm dimers, and how this affects the muscle functioning. The results show that the features of γγ-Tpm and γβ-Tpm with substitutions in the Tpm γ-chain vary significantly. The characteristics of the γγ-Tpm depend on whether these mutations located in only one or both γ-chains. The mechanism of the development of nemaline myopathy associated with the M9R mutation was revealed. At the molecular level, a cause-and-effect relationship has been established for the development of myopathy by the K169E mutation. Also, we described the structure-functional properties of the Tpm dimers with the E151A mutation, which explain muscle weakness linked to this substitution. The results demonstrate a diversity of the molecular mechanisms of myopathy pathogenesis induced by studied Tpm mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3049509523,"Cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many types of cancer, but the emergence of chemoresistance hinders its application. Thus, a better understanding of cisplatin-induced DNA damage response (DDR) would help to overcome this problem. Previously, we have identified a panel of microRNAs with altered expression after cisplatin treatment in HeLa cells. In the current study, we focused on one of them, miR-191, and investigated its function in cisplatin-induced DDR. We found that overexpression of miR-191 sensitized HeLa cells to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin, resulted in decreased viable cells. However, overexpression of miR-191 did not cause changes in apoptotic cell ratio but rather induced significant G2/M arrest in HeLa cell treated with cisplatin. Additionally, enhanced cisplatin-induced DNA damage was observed. Through bioinformatic analysis and verified by dual-luciferase assay, it was demonstrated that the chromosome condensation 2 regulator (RCC2) gene is a target for miR-191 regulation. Furthermore, the downregulation of RCC2 by siRNA mimics the effects of miR-191, in which greater DNA damage was observed upon cisplatin treatment. Taken together, our study indicates that miR-191 may be an important player in cisplatin-induced DDR, and it elicits its function, at least partially, through the regulation of RCC2."
https://openalex.org/W3057301083,"Identification and quantification of plant flavonoids are critical to pharmacokinetic study and pharmaceutical quality control due to their distinct pharmacological functions. Here we report on a novel plant flavonoid electrochemical sensor for sensitive and selective detection of dihydromyricetin (DMY) based on double- layered membranes consisting of gold nanoparticles (Au) anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Both rGO-Au and MIPs membranes were directly formed on GCE via in-situ electrochemical reduction and polymerization processes step by step. The compositions, morphologies, and electrochemical properties of membranes were investigated with X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) combined with various electrochemical methods. The fabricated electrochemical sensor labeled as GCE│rGO-Au/MIPs exhibited excellent performance in determining of DMY under optimal experimental conditions. A wide linear detection range (LDR) ranges from 2.0×10-8 to 1.0×10-4 M together with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2×10-8 M (S/N = 3) were achieved. Moreover, the electrochemical sensor was employed to determine DMY in real samples with satisfactory results."
https://openalex.org/W3065089658,"We studied avian development in 49 to 153 species of temperate and tropical New World passerine birds to determine how growth rates, and incubation and nestling periods, varied in relation to other life-history traits. We collected growth data and generated unbiased mass and tarsus growth rate estimates (mass n = 92 species, tarsus n = 49 species), and measured incubation period (n = 151) and nestling period (n = 153), which we analyzed with respect to region, egg mass, adult mass, clutch size, parental care type, nest type, daily nest predation rate (DMR), and nest height. We investigated covariation of life-history and natural-history attributes with the four development traits after controlling for phylogeny. Species in our lowland tropical sample grew 20% (incubation period), 25% (mass growth rate), and 26% (tarsus growth rate) more slowly than in our temperate sample. Nestling period did not vary with respect to latitude, which suggests that tropical songbirds fledge in a less well-developed state than temperate species. Suboscine species typically exhibited slower embryonic and post-embryonic growth than oscine passerines regardless of their breeding region. This pattern of slow development in tropical species could reflect phylogenetic effects based on unknown physiological attributes. Time-dependent nest mortality was unrelated to nestling mass growth rate, tarsus growth rate, and incubation period, but was significantly associated with nestling period. This suggests that nest predation, the predominant cause of nest loss in songbirds, does not exert strong selection on physiologically constrained traits, such as embryonic and post-embryonic growth, among our samples of temperate and lowland tropical songbird species. Nestling period, which is evolutionarily more labile than growth rate, was significantly shorter in birds exposed to higher rates of nest loss and nesting at lower heights, among other traits. Differences in life-history variation across latitudes provide insight into how unique ecological characteristics of each region influence physiological processes of passerines, and thus, how they can shape the evolution of life histories. While development traits clearly vary with respect to latitude, trait distributions overlap broadly. Life-history and natural history associations differ for each development trait, which suggests that unique selective pressures or constraints influence the evolution of each trait."
https://openalex.org/W3049369304,"Introduction Understanding the current epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Thailand will facilitate more effective national HIV prevention programs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection among young Thai men. Methods A total survey was conducted of Royal Thai Army new conscripts, participating in the national HIV surveillance in November 2010 and May 2011. Behavioral risk factors for HIV infection were determined using a standardized survey questionnaire in the total study population and men who have sex with men (MSM) subgroup. Results A total of 301 (0.5%) HIV infected young Thai men were identified from the total study population (63,667). Independent risk factors associated with HIV infection among the total study population included being single (adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1.6, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.1–2.2), having no formal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI 2.3–18.4) or a bachelor’s degree (AOR 1. 8, 95% CI 1.0–3.0), engaging in bisexual (AOR 3.7, 95% CI 2.4–5. 6) or exclusively homosexual activity (AOR 14.4, 95% CI 10.4–19.8), having a history of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6–3.3) and having sex in exchange for gifts/money (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1. 5–2.8). A total of 4,594 (7.9%) MSM were identified, of which 121 (2.6%) were HIV infected. The prevalence of HIV infection among MSM in urban (2.8%) and rural (2.4%) areas were relatively comparable (p-value = 0.44). Of the identified MSM, 82.5% reported having sexual desire with females only. Risk factors associated with HIV infection in the MSM subgroup included living in the western region (AOR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2–10.4), having a bachelor’s degree (AOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2–5.7), having a history of exclusive receptive (AOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6–7.7) or versatile anal sex (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 3.0–7.5) and history of having sex in exchange for gifts/money (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5–3.5). Conclusion The prevalence of HIV infection among young Thai men has continued to be below 0.5% in 2010 and 2011. High risk sexual activity, including MSM, played a major role in the HIV epidemic among this population. Effective HIV prevention programs should cover MSM who have heterosexual desire as well as having sex in exchange for gifts/money and be implemented in both urban and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3059437041,"Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by truncating variants in the paternal allele of MAGEL2, located in the Prader-Willi critical region, 15q11-q13. Although the phenotypes of SYS overlap those of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), including neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems, and developmental delay/intellectual disability, SYS patients show autism spectrum disorder and joint contractures, which are atypical phenotypes for PWS. Therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated Magel2 protein could potentially produce gain-of-function toxic effects. To test the hypothesis, we generated two engineered mouse models; one, an overexpression model that expressed the N-terminal region of Magel2 that was FLAG tagged with a strong ubiquitous promoter, and another, a genome-edited model that carried a truncating variant in Magel2 generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In the overexpression model, all transgenic mice died in the fetal or neonatal period indicating embryonic or neonatal lethality of the transgene. Therefore, overexpression of the truncated Magel2 could show toxic effects. In the genome-edited model, we generated a mouse model carrying a frameshift variant (c.1690_1924del; p(Glu564Serfs*130)) in Magel2. Model mice carrying the frameshift variant in the paternal or maternal allele of Magel2 were termed Magel2P:fs and Magel2M:fs, respectively. The imprinted expression and spatial distribution of truncating Magel2 transcripts in the brain were maintained. Although neonatal Magel2P:fs mice were lighter than wildtype littermates, Magel2P:fs males and females weighed the same as their wildtype littermates by eight and four weeks of age, respectively. Collectively, the overexpression mouse model may recapitulate fetal or neonatal death, which are the severest phenotypes for SYS. In contrast, the genome-edited mouse model maintains genomic imprinting and distribution of truncated Magel2 transcripts in the brain, but only partially recapitulates SYS phenotypes. Therefore, our results imply that simple gain-of-function toxic effects may not explain the patho-mechanism of SYS, but rather suggest a range of effects due to Magel2 variants as in human SYS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3064526946,"Molecular markers derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represent an accessible means of exploring the pathobiology of Huntington's disease (HD) in vivo. The endo-lysosomal/autophagy system is dysfunctional in HD, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis and representing a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Several endo-lysosomal proteins have shown promise as biomarkers in other neurodegenerative diseases; however, they have yet to be fully explored in HD. We performed parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry analysis (PRM-MS) of multiple endo-lysosomal proteins in the CSF of 60 HD mutation carriers and 20 healthy controls. Using generalised linear models controlling for age and CAG, none of the 18 proteins measured displayed significant differences in concentration between HD patients and controls. This was affirmed by principal component analysis, in which no significant difference across disease stage was found in any of the three components representing lysosomal hydrolases, binding/transfer proteins and innate immune system/peripheral proteins. However, several proteins were associated with measures of disease severity and cognition: most notably amyloid precursor protein, which displayed strong correlations with composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, UHDRS Total Functional Capacity, UHDRS Total Motor Score, Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Stroop Word Reading. We conclude that although endo-lysosomal proteins are unlikely to have value as disease state CSF biomarkers for Huntington's disease, several proteins demonstrate associations with clinical severity, thus warranting further, targeted exploration and validation in larger, longitudinal samples."
https://openalex.org/W3064585804,"Soil fertilization with dehydrated sewage sludge (DSS) accelerates the recovery process of degraded areas by improving nutrient concentration, and favors the development of trophic webs with pioneer plants such as Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Beth (Fabales: Fabaceae), phytophagous Hemiptera, predators, and protocooperanting ants. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of A. auriculiformis litter with or without dehydrated sewage sludge application and the ecological indices of sucking insects (Hemiptera), their predators and protocooperating ants, as bioindicators, in a degraded area for 24 months. Complete randomization was applied for two treatments (with or without application of dehydrated sewage sludge) in 24 replications (one repetition = one plant). We evaluated the number of leaves/branch and branches/plant, percentage of soil cover (litter), ecological indices of phytophagous Hemiptera, their predators, and protocooperating ants. The plants of A. auriculiformis, that were applied with dehydrated sewage sludge, had superior development when compared to plants where DSS were not applied. The highest abundance and richness of phytophagous Hemiptera species and Sternorrhyncha predators occurred on A. auriculiformis plants that were applied with dehydrated sewage sludge. The increase in richness of species of protocooperanting ants that established mutualistic relationships positively influenced the phytophagous Hemiptera. The use of A. auriculiformis, with application of dehydrated sewage sludge, can increase recovery of degraded areas due to its higher soil cover (e.g., litter) and results in higher ecological indices of phytophagous Hemiptera and their predators."
https://openalex.org/W3069449048,"The yeast MAP kinase Hog1 pathway activates transcription of several hundreds genes. Large-scale gene expression and DNA binding assays suggest that most Hog1-induced genes are regulated by the transcriptional activators Msn2/4, Hot1 and Sko1. These studies also revealed the target genes of each activator and the putative binding sites on their promoters. In a previous study we identified a group of genes, which we considered the bona fide targets of Hog1, because they were induced in response to expression of intrinsically active mutant of Hog1, in the absence of any stress. We previously analyzed the promoter of the most highly induced gene, STL1, and noticed that some promoter properties were different from those proposed by large-scale data. We therefore continue to study promoters individually and present here analyses of promoters of more Hog1’s targets, RTC3, HSP12, DAK1 and ALD3. We report that RTC3 and HSP12 promoters are robust and are induced, to different degrees, even in cells lacking all four activators. DAK1 and ALD3 promoters are not robust and fully depend on a single activator, DAK1 on Sko1 and ALD3 on Msn2/4. Most of these observations could not be inferred from the large-scale data. Msn2/4 are involved in regulating all four promoters. It was assumed, therefore, that the promoters are spontaneously active in ras2Δ cells, in which Msn2/4 are known to be de-repressed. Intriguingly, the promoters were not active in BY4741ras2Δ cells, but were de-repressed, as expected, in ras2Δ cells of other genetic backgrounds. This study describes two phenomena. One, some Hog1’s target promoters are most robust, backupped by many activators. Second, in contrast to most laboratory strains, the widely used BY4741 strain does not induce Msn2/4 activity when the Ras/cAMP cascade is downregulated."
https://openalex.org/W3069627384,"A strain of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus paracasei KW3110 (KW3110), activates M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory reactions and mitigates aging-related chronic inflammation and blue-light exposure-induced retinal inflammation in mice. However, the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of KW3110 remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of KW3110 using both mouse and human immune cells and evaluated the suppressive effect of KW3110 on the inflammatory reactions of the cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (LPS/ATP). KW3110 treatment induced anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 production in the supernatants of murine macrophage-like cells, J774A.1, and suppressed IL-1β production in the supernatants of LPS/ATP-stimulated cells. The influence of KW3110 on the production of these cytokines was inhibited by pre-treatment with phagocytosis blocker or transfection with siRNAs for IL-10 signaling components. KW3110 treatment also suppressed activation of caspase-1, an active component of inflammasome complexes, in LPS/ATP-stimulated J774A.1 cells, and its effect was inhibited by transfection with siRNAs for IL-10 signaling components. In addition to the effects of KW3110 on J774A.1 cells, KW3110 treatment induced IL-10 production in the supernatants of human monocytes, and KW3110 or IL-10 treatment suppressed caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production in the supernatants of LPS/ATP-stimulated cells. These results suggest that KW3110 suppresses LPS/ATP stimulation-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production by promoting IL-10 production in mouse and human immune cells. Our findings reveal a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of LAB and the effect of KW3110 on caspase-1 activation is expected to contribute to constructing future preventive strategies for inflammation-related disorders using food ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W3078576557,"The vertical distribution of radiocarbon (14C) was examined in the bottom sediment core, taken from Lake Drūkšiai, which has served as a cooling pond since 1983 for the 26 years of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP) operation using two RBMK-1500 reactors (Russian acronym for""Channelized Large Power Reactor""). 14C specific activity was measured in alkali-soluble and -insoluble fractions of the sediment layers. Complementary measurements of the 210Pb and 137Cs activity of the samples provided the possibility to evaluate the date of every layer formation, covering the 1947-2013 period. In addition, 14C distribution was examined in the scales of pelagic fish caught between 1980 and 2012. Our measurements reveal that, during the period 1947-1999, the radiocarbon specific activity in both fractions exhibits a parallel course with a difference of 5 ± 1 pMC (percent of modern carbon) being higher in alkali-soluble fraction, although 14C specific activity in both fractions increased by 11.4-13.6 pMC during the first 15 years of plant operation. However, during the 2000-2009 period, other than previously seen, a dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) → aquatic primary producers → sediments 14C incorporation pattern occurred, as the radiocarbon specific activity difference between alkali-soluble and -insoluble fractions reached 94, 25, and 20 pMC in 2000, 2006, and 2008, respectively. Measurements in different sediment fractions allowed us to identify the unexpected organic nature of 14C contained in liquid effluences from the INPP in 2000-2009. The discrepancy between 14C specific activity in fish scales samples and DIC after 2000 also confirmed the possibility of organic 14C contamination. Possible reasons for this phenomenon might be industrial processes introduced at the INPP, such as the start of operation of the cementation facility for spent ion exchange resins, decontamination procedures, and various maintenance activities of reactor aging systems and equipment."
https://openalex.org/W3056756189,"Background The insect predator Coccinella septempunctata can effectively control many types of pests, such as aphids, whiteflies, and small lepidopteran larvae. We previously found that C. septempunctata fed an artificial diet showed diminished biological properties(e.g. fecundity, egg hatching rate, survival rate, etc.) compared with those fed natural prey (Aphis craccivora), likely due to different nutritional characteristics of the diet. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing analysis to identify nutrition- and metabolism-related genes of C. septempunctata that were differentially expressed depending on diet. Methodology/Principal findings The Illumina HiSeq2000 was used to sequence 691,942,058 total clean reads from artificial diet-fed and A. craccivora-fed C. septempunctata libraries, and the clean reads were assembled using Trinity de novo software (Tabel 2). Comparison of transcriptome sequences revealed that expression of 38,315 genes was affected by the artificial diet, and 1,182 of these genes showed a significant change in expression levels (FDR ≤ 0.05,|log2FC|≥1, “FC” stands for “fold change”). These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were likely associated with the decreased egg laying capacity, hatching rate, longevity, and increased sex ratio (♀:♂) of adult C. septempunctata observed in the group fed the artificial diet. Furthermore, in the most DEGs metabolic pathways for C. septempunctata feeding on the artificial diet accumulated amino acid metabolic pathways, lipid metabolic pathways, and starch and glucose metabolism were down-regulated. Conclusions/Significance We found some differentially expressed genes and metabolic pathways are related to nutrition, from which a more informative feedback for diet formulation was obtained and the artificial diet could be more efficiently optimized."

Sub-categories and codes including information-seeking motivations (achieving physical health, physical appearance, social acceptability, self-confidence, family and friends' pressure) information resources (electronic information resources, social media, printed information resources, doctors and nutritionists, family and friends, traditional & Islamic medicine, radio and TV), information validation (asking the doctors and specialists, matching the information with scientific references, consulting with friends and relatives) and obstacles to seeking information (lack of time, high costs, distrust, access limitation). by increasing the students' informational and media literacy, providing authentic and low-cost online resources of information and specialized TV programs, the damages rooted in using invalid information resources concerning fitness can be substantially diminished."
https://openalex.org/W3049072301,"To understand better the total burden of interpersonal violence on society, it is useful to assess the prevalence of interpersonal violence among both, men and women. Exposure to multiple forms of interpersonal violence, referred to as polyvictimization, has been associated with more severe health consequences than exposure to any form separately. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of emotional, physical and sexual interpersonal violence in childhood, adulthood and at both childhood and adulthood among men and women in Estonia, analyze the patterns of interpersonal violence and socio-demographic correlates of polyvictimization in adulthood by gender.The analysis was based on two population-based, cross-sectional, self-administered surveys carried out among men and women in Estonia in 2014. In both surveys, the NorVold Abuse questionnaire was used to measure exposure to interpersonal violence. Men and women aged 18-44 were included to the analysis.Among men 66.6% and among women 54.2% had been exposed to at least one form of interpersonal violence during lifetime. Men had been more often exposed to isolated physical interpersonal violence, among women the distribution of different forms of interpersonal violence was more even and exposure to sexual violence was more common. The prevalence of polyvictimization in adulthood was two times higher among women compared to men and more socio-demographic correlates, were associated with it. Exposure to violence in childhood was associated with polyvictimization in adulthood across gender.The prevalence of interpersonal violence in Estonia is high among men and women. The most prevalent forms and patterns of interpersonal violence, however, differ by gender, as do the socio-demographic correlates. Screening for interpersonal violence, in childhood and adulthood, and gender-specific interventions are needed, especially for high-risk groups identified in this study. Primary prevention of childhood violence should be a priority, as it was associated with higher risk for exposure to violence later in life across gender."

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of MHC similarity between a mare and a foal on the incidence of retained fetal membranes (RFM) in post-partum mares. DNA was sampled from 43 draft mares and their foals. Mares which failed to expel fetal membranes within three hours after foal expulsion were considered the RFM group (n = 14) and mares that expelled fetal membranes during the above period were the control group (n = 29). Nine MHC microsatellites of MHC I and MHC II were amplified for all mares and foals. MHC compatibility and MHC genetic similarity between mares and their foals was determined based on MHC microsatellites. The inbreeding coefficient was also calculated for all horses. The incidence of RFM in the studied population was 33%. Compatibility in MHC I and MHC II did not increase the risk of RFM in the studied population of draft mares (P>0.05). Differences in MHC similarity at the genetic level were not observed between mare-foal pairs in RFM and control group (P>0.05). We suspect that RFM in draft mares may not be associated with MHC similarity between a foal and its dam. Despite the above, draft horses could be genetically predisposed to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3077475736,"K+ is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is responsible for many important physiological processes. K+ deficiency leads to crop yield losses, and overexpression of K+ transporter genes has been proven to be an effective way to resolve this problem. However, current research on the overexpression of K+ transporter genes is limited to plant sources. TrkH is a bacterial K+ transporter whose function generally depends on the regulation of TrkA. To date, whether TrkH can improve K+ uptake in eukaryotic organisms is still unknown. In this study, a novel MbtrkH gene was cloned from marine microbial metagenomic DNA. Functional complementation and K+-depletion analyses revealed that MbTrkH functions in K+ uptake in the K+-deficient yeast strain CY162. Moreover, K+-depletion assays revealed that MbtrkH overexpression improves plant K+ uptake. K+ hydroponic culture experiments showed that, compared with WT tobacco lines, MbtrkH transgenic tobacco lines had significantly greater fresh weights, dry weights and K+ contents. These results indicate that MbTrkH promotes K+ uptake independently of TrkA in eukaryotes and provide a new strategy for improving K+-use efficiency in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3079474195,"The mirid bug Lygus pratensis is an important pest of cotton, and is primarily managed through insecticide application. In this study, conducted in Xinjiang (China), we assessed the relative attractiveness of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) to L. pratensis adults in local cotton plots from 2015-2016 and quantified the associated contribution of inter-planted sunflower strips to suppress field-level L. pratensis populations from 2016-2017. Field-plot trials showed that among six combinations of two sunflower varieties (XKZ6 and SH363) and three planting dates (early-, middle- and late-planted), adult abundance of L. pratensis was highest on early-planted XKZ6 and attained 3.7-5.8 times higher levels than in neighboring cotton plots. In commercial cotton fields, the combined deployment of sunflower strips at field edges and the periodic application of insecticides directed to those strips was found to (1) reduce the mean abundance of L. pratensis population on cotton by 41.9-44.0%, (2) lower the rate of cotton leaf damage by 27.3-30.6% and boll damage by 44.8-46.0%, and (3) increase the number of mature bolls by 7.5%-8.0%. Our work emphasizes how sunflower can be an effective trap crop for L. pratensis and that the establishment of sunflower strips could contribute to its effective and environmentally-sound management in cotton crops."
https://openalex.org/W3051688803,"Do islands harbour less diverse disease communities than mainland? The island biogeography theory predicts more diverse communities on mainland than on islands due to more niches, more diverse habitats and availability of greater range of hosts. We compared bacteria prevalences of Campylobacter, Chlamydia and Salmonella in cloacal samples of a small shorebird, the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) between two island populations of Macaronesia and two mainland locations in the Iberian Peninsula. Bacteria were found in all populations but, contrary to the expectations, prevalences did not differ between islands and mainland. Females had higher prevalences than males for Salmonella and when three bacteria genera were pooled together. Bacteria infection was unrelated to bird's body condition but females from mainland were heavier than males and birds from mainland were heavier than those from islands. Abiotic variables consistent throughout breeding sites, like high salinity that is known to inhibit bacteria growth, could explain the lack of differences in the bacteria prevalence between areas. We argue about the possible drivers and implications of sex differences in bacteria prevalence in Kentish plovers."
https://openalex.org/W3059544187,"Modern magnetic resonance imaging systems are equipped with a large number of receive connectors in order to optimally support a large field-of-view and/or high acceleration in parallel imaging using high-channel count, phased array coils. Given that the MR system is equipped with a limited number of digitizing receivers and in order to support operation of multinuclear coil arrays, these connectors need to be flexibly routed to the receiver outside the RF shielded examination room. However, for a number of practical, economic and safety reasons, it is better to only route a subset of the connectors. This is usually accomplished with the use of switch matrices. These exist in a variety of topologies and differ in routing flexibility and technological implementation. A highly flexible implementation is a crossbar topology that allows to any one input to be routed to any one output and can use single PIN diodes as active elements. However, in this configuration, long open-ended transmission lines can potentially remain connected to the signal path leading to high transmission losses. Thus, especially for high-field systems compensation mechanisms are required to remove the effects of open-ended transmission line stubs. The selection of a limited number of lumped element reactance values to compensate for the for the effect of transmission line stubs in large-scale switch matrices capable of supporting multi-nuclear operation is non-trivial and is a combinatorial problem of high order. Here, we demonstrate the use of metaheuristic approaches to optimize the circuit design of these matrices that additionally carry out the optimization of distances between the parallel transmission lines. For a matrix with 128 inputs and 64 outputs a realization is proposed that displays a worst-case insertion loss of 3.8 dB."
https://openalex.org/W3070090456,"Background Worldwide, different traditions of symbolic statements in graveyards can be found. However, studies on sub-Saharan Africa are rare. For BaKongo cemeteries, it is only known that they traditionally do not exhibit plants for decoration purposes. Our study wanted to inspect the influence of Portuguese culture due to the long shared colonial past. Methods During 2015 and 2019, plant use in 87 graveyards in 13 municipalities of the province Uíge was documented. Five expert interviews with the village eldest in five municipalities completed the data collection. Results While 24% of the graveyards didn´t have any planting, 27 plant species were found in the remaining ones, including a high percentage of alien species (59%), mainly from the Americas. The most abundant plant species are Euphorbia tirucalli (23%) and Agave sisalana (22%). With increasing distance from the city Uíge (especially towards the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the utilization of living plants in cemeteries is decreasing except along the road. In most of the cases, just one plant species per gravesite was found. Conclusions This unexpected high number of plants might be interpreted as a strong evidence of outside influence. Cultural symbols of the BaKongo cosmology and Christianism appear to coexist or coalesce. Furthermore, plants are used as a marker for graveyards. Modern influences like the use of concrete in proximity to urban areas indicate a certain wealth."
https://openalex.org/W3075350891,"The completion of a meaningful, hands-on international experience is a critical and required component of the Master of International Agricultural degree Program (MIAP) at Oklahoma State University. Understanding the impacts of the international experience/internship is important in designing a curriculum that well-prepares students for their personal, social, academic, and future professional life. Hence, the objective of this study is to evaluate the MIAP students' international experiences and to determine the factors that impact international experience outcomes. The benefits of international experiences are divided into five outcome areas that include personal, interpersonal, academic, employment, and civic impacts. The data is collected through an online survey of MIAP students. The variance based partial least squares structural equation modeling is used to develop three separate models with the goal of statistically measuring academic, employment, and civic impacts. The results of this study show that interns believe that international experience had enhanced each of their abilities. The findings of all three models show that the Humphreys travel grant has a statistically significant effect on interpersonal impacts. Additionally, the length of internship has a statistically significant association with personal impact in all three models, while it has a statistically positive indirect impact on academic, employment, and civic impact models, which indicates the full mediation effect. In addition, the number of hours worked weekly during the internship is found to have a significant positive relationship with employment impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3068813707,"Phosphoinositides (PIPs) and their regulatory enzymes are key players in many cellular processes and are required for aspects of vertebrate development. Dysregulated PIP metabolism has been implicated in several human diseases, including a subset of skeletal myopathies that feature structural defects in the triad. The role of PIPs in skeletal muscle formation, and particularly triad biogenesis, has yet to be determined. CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT) catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol, which is the base of all PIP species. Loss of CDIPT should, in theory, result in the failure to produce PIPs, and thus provide a strategy for establishing the requirement for PIPs during embryogenesis. In this study, we generated cdipt mutant zebrafish and determined the impact on skeletal myogenesis. Analysis of cdipt mutant muscle revealed no apparent global effect on early muscle development. However, small but significant defects were observed in triad size, with T-tubule area, inter terminal cisternae distance and gap width being smaller in cdipt mutants. This was associated with a decrease in motor performance. Overall, these data suggest that myogenesis in zebrafish does not require de novo PIP synthesis but does implicate a role for CDIPT in triad formation."
https://openalex.org/W3070102727,"Background Switzerland lacks future general practitioners (GPs). Residents who wished to specialize as general practitioners were formerly trained solely in hospital settings. To better prepare and also attract more young doctors to become GPs, the canton of Bern (equivalent to a state) has implemented a partly state-funded vocational training program in GP practices. Our study examines the efficacy of this 10-year program, identifies factors that positively influence residents in their decision to become a GP and the distribution of new GPs in the canton of Bern, who had taken part in the traineeship. Methods This cross-sectional survey among all residents, who participated in a traineeship in general practice from 2008 to 2017 in the canton of Bern asked if residents had taken a subsequent career choice as a GP and if so in which region. Residents scored the importance of their traineeship and their mentor’s influence on becoming a GP. By using zip codes of work area of respondents already working as GPs and matching it with population census data, we could obtain the distribution of GPs on a per capita basis. Results Out of 165 residents who participated in a traineeship, 151 (92%) completed our survey. 81% had chosen a career as a GP or were on track to become a GP. Almost half of the participants became GPs in the offices of their mentors or in the area. Our respondents emphasized the importance of their mentors' influence as well as the training program in their decision-making to become a GP. Most mentioned benefits of being a GP were broad field of medical care (37%) and a fulfilling doctor-patient relationship (34%). We could show an increase in GP practices in the canton of Bern, not only in urban but also accordingly in rural areas. Conclusions Most residents continued subsequent careers as general practitioners after having completed a GP traineeship, with almost half of them in the region of their training. A vocational training program helped motivating young doctors to become GPs and underserved regions of the canton of Bern to gain new GPs."
https://openalex.org/W3049488357,"Pavement crack analysis, which deals with crack detection and crack growth detection, is a crucial task for modern Pavement Management Systems (PMS). This paper proposed a novel approach that uses historical crack data as reference for automatic pavement crack analysis. At first, a multi-scale localization method, which including GPS based coarse localization, image-level localization, and metric localization has been presented to establish image correspondences between historical and query crack images. Then historical crack pixels can be mapped onto the query crack image, and these mapped crack pixels are seen as high-quality seed points for crack analysis. Finally, crack analysis is accomplished by applying Region Growing Method (RGM) to further detect newly grown cracks. The proposed method has been tested with the actual pavement images collected in different time. The F-measure for crack growth is 88.9%, which demonstrates the proposed method has an ability to greatly simplify and enhances crack analysis result."
https://openalex.org/W3060880392,"To characterize changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and peripapillary vessel density (VD) at the site of disc hemorrhage (DH) in nonglaucomatous eyes.This retrospective cross-sectional study included nonglaucomatous eyes diagnosed with unilateral DH. The change of DH was recorded using disc photography. Both anatomical data and functional visual field (VF) data were collected using optical coherence tomography angiography and Humphrey VF examination.Sixteen patients were included with average follow-up duration of 95 months. Almost half of DH episodes was initially presented at the inferotemporal area of the optic disc. Pigment formation at the previous DH site after resolution was noted in 12.5% of eyes. Sectoral radial peripapillary VD at the DH site was significantly lower in DH eyes than in the control group; however, the sectoral RNFL thickness at the DH site was not significantly decreased. Progression of the VF defect corresponding to the DH site was found in 81.3% of eyes despite regular use of antiglaucoma agents. The mean change in the VF mean deviation was -0.64 dB/year in DH eyes.During long follow-up periods, decreased peripapillary VD at the DH site and progression of the VF defect corresponding to the DH site were detected in nonglaucomatous eyes. Retinal pigmentation with an RNFL defect is a clue for DH, although RNFL showed no significant change. Antiglaucoma treatment may not prevent the deterioration of visual function."
