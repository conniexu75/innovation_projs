https://openalex.org/W2168513163,"The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long--28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future."

https://openalex.org/W2084912121,"The ability to use environmental stimuli to predict impending harm is critical for survival. Such predictions should be available as early as they are reliable. In pavlovian conditioning, chains of successively earlier predictors are studied in terms of higher-order relationships, and have inspired computational theories such as temporal difference learning1. However, there is at present no adequate neurobiological account of how this learning occurs. Here, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of higher-order aversive conditioning, we describe a key computational strategy that humans use to learn predictions about pain. We show that neural activity in the ventral striatum and the anterior insula displays a marked correspondence to the signals for sequential learning predicted by temporal difference models. This result reveals a flexible aversive learning process ideally suited to the changing and uncertain nature of real-world environments. Taken with existing data on reward learning2, our results suggest a critical role for the ventral striatum in integrating complex appetitive and aversive predictions to coordinate behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2142713077,"The standard model of particle physics contains parameters—such as particle masses—whose origins are still unknown and which cannot be predicted, but whose values are constrained through their interactions. In particular, the masses of the top quark (Mt) and W boson (MW)1 constrain the mass of the long-hypothesized, but thus far not observed, Higgs boson. A precise measurement of Mt can therefore indicate where to look for the Higgs, and indeed whether the hypothesis of a standard model Higgs is consistent with experimental data. As top quarks are produced in pairs and decay in only about 10-24 s into various final states, reconstructing their masses from their decay products is very challenging. Here we report a technique that extracts more information from each top-quark event and yields a greatly improved precision (of ± 5.3 GeV/c2) when compared to previous measurements2. When our new result is combined with our published measurement in a complementary decay mode3 and with the only other measurements available2, the new world average for Mt becomes4 178.0 ± 4.3 GeV/c2. As a result, the most likely Higgs mass increases from the experimentally excluded5 value6 of 96 to 117 GeV/c2, which is beyond current experimental sensitivity. The upper limit on the Higgs mass at the 95% confidence level is raised from 219 to 251 GeV/c2."
https://openalex.org/W2039283984,"Many studies have illustrated that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is important for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling in response to diverse stimuli. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which are important regulators of signal transduction, are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition after generation of ROS, and reversible oxidation is becoming recognized as a general physiological mechanism for regulation of PTP function. Thus, production of ROS facilitates a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent cellular signaling response by transiently inactivating those PTPs that normally suppress the signal. In this study, we have explored the importance of reversible PTP oxidation in the signaling response to insulin. Using a modified ingel PTP assay, we show that stimulation of cells with insulin resulted in the rapid and transient oxidation and inhibition of two distinct PTPs, which we have identified as PTP1B and TC45, the 45-kDa spliced variant of the T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase. We investigated further the role of TC45 as a regulator of insulin signaling by combining RNA interference and the use of substrate-trapping mutants. We have shown that TC45 is an inhibitor of insulin signaling, recognizing the β-subunit of the insulin receptor as a substrate. The data also suggest that this strategy, using ligand-induced oxidation to tag specific PTPs and using interference RNA and substrate-trapping mutants to illustrate their role as regulators of particular signal transduction pathways, may be applied broadly across the PTP family to explore function."
https://openalex.org/W2133470303,"During 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction, the insulin-stimulated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor signal is responsible for the induction of adipocyte differentiation. Treatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, LY294002 or wortmannin, leads to the complete blockade of adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Of the three factors (1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin) inducing 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, only insulin was able to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt signal cascade. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, protein kinase B/Akt 1 RNA interference not only suppressed the expression of protein kinase B/Akt 1 but also blocked hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation. In these protein kinase B/Akt 1 RNA interference cells, the signal molecules upstream of protein kinase B/Akt 1, such as IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1, were normally activated by insulin stimulation, whereas insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), which is a downstream molecule of PKB/Akt 1, was blocked. Thus, protein kinase B/Akt 1 is an important signal mediator in IGF-1 receptor signal cascade for inducing adipocyte differentiation.

Thus, protein kinase B/Akt 1 is an important signal mediator in IGF-1 receptor signal cascade for inducing adipocyte differentiation. Most of our current understandings on the cellular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation regulation have come from the studies on established in vitro preadipocyte cell lines (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar, 2Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

These in vitro preadipocyte cell lines, e.g. 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A, and TA1, can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes by insulin or in combination with other hormones. Subsequent studies on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation induction indicate that the authentic hormone to induce the adipocyte differentiation is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PKB/Akt, protein kinase B; PI, phosphatidylinositol; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; FKHR, Forkhead transcription factor; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; RNAi, small double strand RNA-mediated interference; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; DEX, dexamethasone; MIX, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. and insulin acts through the IGF-1 receptor on the cell membrane to induce the differentiation (4Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, IGF-1 receptor signal initiates the adipocyte differentiation process. Immediately after the hormonal stimulation, post-confluent G0 3T3-L1 preadipocytes reenter the cell cycle and start the adipocyte differentiation program. It is clear that the IGF-1 receptor signal plays an irreplaceable role in inducing the adipocyte differentiation process in 3T3-L1 cells. The signaling pathways or networks involved in mediating IGF-1 receptor signal for adipocyte differentiation are not fully understood. Two kinase systems, MAP kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt, in 3T3-L1 cells can be activated by IGF-1 receptor signaling. The function of the MAP kinase system in IGF-1 receptor signal-induced 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis is not clear. It is further complicated by the different effects exhibited by p38 MAP kinase and ERK1/2 on 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis (5Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol.

More molecular studies are required in order to understand the relationship between MAP kinase system and 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis. PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt as an important intracellular signal cascade has been involved in the regulation of many cellular activities, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is also involved in IGF-1 receptor signal-regulated cell growth and anti-apoptosis in many types of cell (13Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

The ectopic expression of the constitutively active form of PKB/Akt will cause spontaneous adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells (18Magun R. Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Pardasani D. Lin Y.

The generation of 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols in response to the hormonal stimulation in 3T3-L1 cell is responsible for the activation of PKB/Akt and the induction of adipocyte differentiation (20Gagnon A.

Recently, the results from a gene knockout animal study have strongly supported the results of in vitro cell line studies. In mice with PKB/Akt 1 and 2 gene knockouts, the development of adipose tissue is impaired along with other abnormalities, including muscle, bone, and skin (22Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L.

Thus, the PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt signal system is important not only in the regulation of adipose tissue development but also in the development of other tissues originating from mesodermal cells.

In the present study, by using RNA interference we have demonstrated that PKB/Akt 1 is in a pivotal position for mediating the IGF-1 receptor signal during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Without PKB/Akt 1, neither the adipocyte differentiation process nor the downstream transcription factor can be activated by the receptor signal in 3T3-L1 cells. Materials—Anti-PKB/Akt 1, anti-pPKB/Akt (against the Ser-473-phosphorylated form of PKB/Akt 1 and also cross-reactive to the Ser-phosphorylated forms of PKB/Akt 2 and 3), anti-IGF-1 receptor β-subunit, anti-insulin receptor substrate-1, anti-ERK1/2, anti-pERK1/2 (against the critical Tyr-phosphorylated peptide), anti-FKHR, anti-p110α, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-PKB/Akt 2 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-pFKHR was from Cell signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin were from Sigma. PD98059, U0126, wortmannin, and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), protein A-agarose, transfection reagent LipofectAMINE, and G418 were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture, Differentiation Induction of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes, and Oil Red-O Staining—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured and induced to differentiate following the protocol described previously (23Mackall J.C.

Two-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and RNAi cells were induced with standard differentiation induction medium containing 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX), dexamethasone (DEX), and insulin for 2 days, followed by medium supplemented with insulin for additional 2 days. During differentiation induction, cell numbers were counted. By day 8, the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stained with Oil Red-O to show triglyceride droplets. For the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation induction, post-confluent cells were pretreated with individual inhibitor at the indicated concentration for 1 h and then induced to differentiate following the standard differentiation induction protocol. The inhibitor was supplemented in the differentiation induction medium during the first 4 days (i.e. 2 days of induction with MIX, DEX, and insulin and an additional 2 days with insulin) and removed after day 4. Cell numbers were counted during the differentiation process, and the cells were stained with Oil Red-O on day 8. Small Double Strand RNA-mediated Interference (RNAi)—The RNA interference experiment was carried out by using plasmid expressing small interfering RNA fragment (27Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Sequences for RNAi were selected from the PKB/Akt 1 cDNA coding region started with GGG and were analyzed by BLAST research to ensure that they did not have significant sequence homology with other genes. The sequence for PKB/Akt 1 RNAi was 5′-GGGCTGAAGAGATGGAGGTGT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 389–409 in the coding region (translation initiation site ATG as nucleotide 1). The following two pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized to construct the RNAi plasmid following the protocol described by Sui et al. (27Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The annealed Akt-i-1 double strand oligonucleotide was inserted into the U6 promoter Bluescript plasmid (27Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) between the ApaI (nuclease-blunted end) and the HindIII site to make the intermediate plasmid. The annealed Akt-i-2 oligonucleotide was then inserted into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the intermediate plasmid to make the PKB/Akt 1 RNAi plasmid. Thus, the constructed PKB/Akt 1 RNAi plasmid can express an RNA fragment, which will form a 21-bp double strand RNA hairpin with a 6-bp loop. The sequence of the 21-bp double strand RNA hairpin is corresponding to the PKB/Akt 1 RNAi sequence. As control, the corresponding shuffle sequence with the same nucleotide composition but different sequence was designed. The shuffle sequence for the PKB/Akt 1 RNAi sequence was 5′-GGGATCGGAGTGTAGAGGTGA-3′, and the two pairs of oligonucleotide for the construction of plasmid were Akt-Sh-1, 5′-GGATCGGAGTGTAGAGGTGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTTCACCTCTACACTCCGATCC-3′ (complement), and Akt-Sh-2, 5′-AGCTTTCACCTCTACACTCCGATCCCTTTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGATCGGAGTGTAGAGGTGAA-3′ (complement). The plasmids were constructed in the same way as the RNAi plasmids. To make stable cell lines expressing the small interfering RNA fragment, the cassette of the U6 promoter with RNAi sequence insertion was digested from the constructed plasmids and inserted into pcDNA3 plasmid with the cytomegalovirus promoter deleted. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte was transfected with the RNAi plasmids, and the stable cell lines were selected by the resistance to G418. Four plasmids (pAkt-i and pAkt-sh) were transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, respectively, and independent foci were selected and propagated. Cell Transfection—1 × 105 exponentially growing low passage 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated into a 60-mm culture dish and cultured in DMEM with 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with the desired plasmid by LipofectAMINE™ following the protocol provided by Invitrogen. 400 μg/ml G418 was added to the medium 24 h after the transfection. G418-resistant foci were generally formed in 3 weeks. Individual focus was selected and propagated for further analysis. Western Immunoblot—35-mm 3T3-L1 cell monolayers were lysed directly in 1× boiling Laemmli SDS sample buffer with 20 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk in 1× Tween/Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (0.05% Tween, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min. The targeted protein was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation—10-cm 3T3-L1 cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture 1 and 2 (28Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Kohanski R.A. Simpson T.L. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4566-y575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The cell lysate was homogenized and extracted at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant (1000 μg of protein) was mixed with 1 μg of primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed with lysis buffer four times, and resuspended in 1× Laemmli SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Analysis of PKB/Akt Activation by IGF-1 Receptor Signaling in 3T3-L1 Cell during Differentiation Induction—Two-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were fed with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h to minimize the serum effect. The cells were then induced with hormone mixture (MIX, DEX, and insulin) or each individual hormone. The hormonal concentrations are the same as used for the standard differentiation induction. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in 1× boiling Laemmli SDS sample buffer with 20 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. For kinetic analysis of PKB/Akt activation by insulin, cells were treated with 1 μm insulin and harvested at 1 and 2 min and up to 16 h after the insulin stimulation. For insulin concentration-dependent analysis, cells were treated with insulin at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 2) for 20 min and then harvested for Western blot analysis. Analysis of Inhibitor Effects on IGF-1 Receptor Autophosphorylation, IRS-1 Phosphorylation, and PKB/Akt Activation—After being fed with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h, post-confluent cells were pretreated or not with LY294002, PD98059, or U0126 for 1 h and then stimulated with 1 μm insulin. After the indicated times, the cells were harvested with SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis of PKB/Akt activation. After the inhibitor and insulin treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested with immunoprecipitation buffer for analysis of IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation and IRS-1 phosphorylation. After immunoprecipitation with the anti-IGF-1 receptor β-subunit antibody or anti-IRS-1 antibody, the samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Analysis of PI 3-Kinase Activity—Post-confluent cells were fed with DMEM containing 1% FBS overnight to reduce the serum effect and then were pretreated or not with 20 μm LY294002 for 1 h followed by 1 μm insulin stimulation for 10 min. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm PMSF, and 2 μl/ml protease inhibitors mixture 1 and 2 (28Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Kohanski R.A. Simpson T.L. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4566-y575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. 1 μg of primary antibody (anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-p110α PI 3-kinase) was added to the clarified cell lysate (500 μg of protein), incubated at 4 °C overnight, and precipitated with 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads. After washing twice with lysis buffer, once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium vanadate buffer, and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA buffer, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.2 mm adenosine, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 m HCl. The supernatant of the reaction mixture was extracted with 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and the chloroform/methanol extract was washed once with 80 μlof methanol, 100 mm HCl and 2 mm EDTA buffer (1:1). The washed extract was spotted on a TLC plate (Whatman, LK6) that was precoated in 1% potassium oxalate, 40% methanol, and 1.2 mm EDTA buffer for 30 min at room temperature and baked at 100 °C for 1 h. The chromatography was carried out with chloroform/methanol/NH4OH/water (45:35:1.5:8.5) buffer. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was revealed by Phosphor-Imager analysis. Analysis of PKB/Akt 1 RNAi Cells—The G418-resistant cells transfected with RNAi vector were analyzed for their protein expression of PKB/Akt 1 and 2. Stable RNAi cell lines and control cells (wild type 3T3-L1 cell and shuffle-sequence vector-transfected cell) were lysed in 1× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-PKB/Akt 1 and 2 antibodies, respectively. For analysis of the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt 1 and 2, the RNAi cells and control cells were treated with or without insulin and LY294002 as described in Fig. 4. PKB/Akt 1 and PKB/Akt 2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKB/Akt 1 antibody and anti-PKB/Akt 2 antibody, respectively. The immunoprecipitated samples were then analyzed by immunoblot with anti-phospho-PKB/Akt antibody. The analysis of PKB/Akt 1 activity in RNAi cells used the Akt kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., and followed the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, post-confluent RNAi cells and control cells were treated with 1 μm insulin. At the indicated times, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble material, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined. An equal amount of cell lysate (500 μg of protein) from each cell was mixed with 10 μl of immobilized PKB/Akt 1 antibody incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotating wheel. The antibody beads were collected, washed once with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2, and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) fusion protein. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated with 20 μlof3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-phospho-GSK-3 antibody. The analysis of adipocyte differentiation, activation of PKB/Akt 1 and ERK, and phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor and IRS-1 followed the procedures described above. For analysis of FKHR phosphorylation, PKB/Akt 1 RNAi cells were treated and harvested in the same way as for analysis of PKB/Akt 1 phosphorylation. The Western blot was carried out with FKHR and phospho-FKHR antibodies. Inhibition of 3T3-L1 Adipogenesis by the Treatment of PI 3-Kinase Inhibitors, LY294002 and Wortmannin—In post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the adipocyte differentiation process was induced by the combination of MIX, DEX, and insulin. Previous studies indicate (4Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the IGF-1 receptor signal activated by insulin plays a key role in inducing the adipocyte differentiation process. PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt is an important signal cascade for mediating IGF-1 receptor signal. By inhibiting PI 3-kinase with LY294002 or wortmannin, cellular events induced by PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt-mediated IGF-1 receptor signal will be blocked. As shown in Fig. 1, in 3T3-L1 cells treated with LY294002 or wortmannin, the combination of inducers could no longer induce the adipocyte differentiation process. No adipocyte differentiation was observed in the PI 3-kinase inhibitor-treated 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, the mitotic clonal expansion induced during the differentiation process was also inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (Fig. 1, B and C). The Activation of PI 3-Kinase-PKB/Akt by Insulin but Not by MIX and DEX—During differentiation induction with MIX, DEX, and insulin, insulin activated the IGF-1 receptor on the cell membrane and initiated the IGF-1 receptor signaling cascade (4Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although three hormones (MIX, DEX, and insulin) are used to initiate the 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation process, only insulin was capable of inducing mitotic clonal expansion (8Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 or wortmannin, to block the mitotic clonal expansion as well as adipocyte differentiation indicated the blocked IGF-1 receptor signaling cascade but not MIX and DEX signaling pathways by these inhibitors. To ascertain the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitor on the IGF-1 receptor signaling, signal molecules upstream of PI 3-kinase (IGF-1 receptor and IRS-1) and downstream of PI 3-kinase (PKB/Akt) were analyzed. The results indicated that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, had no inhibitory effect on the receptor itself. Neither ligand-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation nor the phosphorylation of IRS-1 (the direct downstream substrate of IGF-1 receptor kinase) by receptor tyrosine kinase was blocked by the treatment of LY294002 (Fig. 2, A and B). PD98059 that blocks the MEK-ERK signal but not the PI 3-kinase signal was used as an additional control. It appeared that these inhibitors had no adversarial effect on the receptor itself. In the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, insulin could still activate the IGF-1 receptor and initiate the IGF-1 receptor signaling cascade. As expected, LY294002 did not affect the signal molecules upstream of PI 3-kinase. However, the signal molecules downstream of PI 3-kinase and the kinase itself should be inhibited by the treatment with LY294002. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte insulin stimulation significantly activated the PI 3-kinase activity, as more phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was generated from phosphatidylinositol by PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitated from insulin-stimulated cells than control cells. In 3T3-L1 cells treated with LY294002, the activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin was completely inhibited. PI 3-kinase isolated from cells treated with both insulin and LY294002 exhibited little kinase activity by in vitro kinase activity analysis (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, the PI 3-kinase activity could also"

Loss of elasticity has been attributed to the degradation of the arterial elastin matrix. Cathepsins K and S are papain-like cysteine proteases with known elastolytic activities, and both enzymes have been identified in macrophages present in plaque areas of diseased blood vessels. Here we demonstrate that macrophages express a third elastolytic cysteine protease, cathepsin V, which exhibits the most potent elastase activity yet described among human proteases and that cathepsin V is present in atherosclerotic plaque specimens. Approximately 60% of the total elastolytic activity of macrophages can be attributed to cysteine proteases with cathepsins V, K, and S contributing equally. From this 60%, two-thirds occur extracellularly and one-third intracellularly with the latter credited to cathepsin V. Ubiquitously expressed glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as chondroitin sulfate specifically inhibit the elastolytic activities of cathepsins V and K via the formation of specific cathepsin-GAG complexes. In contrast, cathepsin S, which does not form complexes with chondroitin sulfate is not inhibited; thus suggesting a specific regulation of elastolytic activities of cathepsins by GAGs. Because the GAG content is reduced in atherosclerotic plaques, an increase of cathepsins V and K activities may accelerate the destruction of the elastin matrix in diseased arteries.

Elastin and collagen are the two major extracellular matrix components that provide elasticity and tensile strength to the arterial wall. The destruction of elastin and collagen causes a weakening and rupture of blood vessels (9Werb Z. Banda M.J. Jones P.A. J. Exp.

Among cysteine proteases, cathepsins S and K have been considered as the most potent elastolytic activities with cathepsin K exhibiting a slightly higher activity than cathepsin S (13Shi G.P.

However, cathepsin K-deficient human macrophages derived from patients with pycnodysostosis were shown to retain their high cysteine protease-dependent elastolytic activities (15Punturieri A. Filippov S. Allen E. Caras I. Murray R. Reddy V. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This finding implied that additional cathepsins may contribute to the overall elastolytic activity in human macrophages. We and others (16Bromme D. Li Z. Barnes M. Mehler E.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1624-1630PubMed Google Scholar) have identified and partially characterized a novel human cysteine protease closely related to cathepsin L that was named cathepsin V (also known as cathepsin L2). Cathepsin V shares 80% protein sequence identity with cathepsin L, but in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed cathepsin L, its expression is mostly confined to the thymus and testis. Recently, we found that recombinant cathepsin V has the ability to efficiently convert MHC/class II-associated invariant chain Ii into CLIP, suggesting that cathepsin V is the protease that controls the generation of antigen-presentable αβ-CLIP complexes in the human thymus (19Tolosa E.

No human cathepsin L was found in thymic antigen presenting cells, thus contrasting findings from studies using cathepsin L-deficient mice, which established a critical role for cathepsin L in thymic antigen presentation (20Nakagawa T.

Our data supported the hypothesis that human cathepsin V, but not human cathepsin L, is the functional equivalent of mouse cathepsin L (16Bromme D. Li Z. Barnes M. Mehler E.

Despite significant efforts to identify a mouse orthologue of human cathepsin V with a thymus-specific expression pattern, this protease has not been found. In this study, we determined the expression of cysteine-dependent cathepsins in atheroma tissue and MDMs and characterized their elastolytic activities. Besides the known elastolytic activities of cathepsins S and K in MDMs, we describe for the first time the expression of cathepsin V in those cells and demonstrate that this protease exhibits the highest elastolytic activity yet described among mammalian proteases and that it mostly contributes to the intracellular degradation of elastin. Moreover, we demonstrate, that the elastolytic activities of cathepsins are regulated by biologically relevant glycosaminoglycans. Reagents—Z-Phe-Arg-MCA was purchased from Bachem Feinchemikalien Inc. (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S), leukocyte elastase, dithiothreitol (DTT), and EDTA were obtained from Sigma. Pancreatic bovine elastase was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Human recombinant MMP-2 and mouse cathepsin L (isolated from NIH 3T3 cells) were kindly provided by Dr. Chris Overall (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) and Dr. Robert Mason (Alfred duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE), respectively. Macrophage Cell Culture—Mononuclear cells were separated from buffy coats obtained from healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. The cells were washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes were incubated at 37 °C and allowed to adhere for 45 min. Non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were washed with sterile PBS, harvested with a rubber policeman, and stained with monocyte-specific anti-CD14 mAb (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) to assess the purity of the preparation. Ninety percent of the isolated cells expressed CD14 (21Sperber K. Bauer J. Pizzimenti A. Najfeld V. Mayer L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 129: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 200 units/ml recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 12 days. Differentiation into macrophages was confirmed by staining with macrophage-specific anti-CD68 mAb (Chemicon). RT-PCR and Real Time-PCR—Cells were lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNA extracted following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was dissolved in water and stored at –70 °C. First strand cDNA (total 25 μl) was prepared from total RNA (1 μg) by reverse transcription using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the oligo(dT)12–18 primer. To test the product specificity, 1 μl of the reverse transcription product was amplified using the PCR method with specific primers for β-actin, cathepsins, and macrophage marker genes. Products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Gene expression was measured in the ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems. Foster City, CA). The sequences of the primers were as follows: cathepsin V, forward 5′-ATTTGGATACAAAGTGGTACC-3′, reverse 5′-TTCCAGGTGCGACCACTGTG-3′; cathepsin L, forward 5′-ACCAAGTGGAAGGCGATG-3′, reverse 5′-TTCCCTTCCCTGTATTCC TG-3′; cathepsin K, forward 5′-GGCCAACTCAAGAAGAAA-3′, reverse 5′-GTACCCTCTGCATTTAGC-3′; cathepsin S, forward 5′-GCACAGCTGAAGCTGAAA-3′, reverse 5′-CCCATTAAGATCACCATAG-3′; glycoprotein-39 (GP-39), forward 5′-CCAATATAAGCAACGATCACA-3′, reverse 5′-TCCAACACCAGTCTCAGAAG-3′; osteopontin, forward 5′-CAGAATCTCCTAGCCCCACA-3′, reverse 5′-AACTCCTCGCTTTCGTG-3′. As control, primers specific for β-actin were used: forward 5′-AAGATCACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGAGGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTT-3′. cDNA samples (5× diluted, 2.5 μl), 5 μl of QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 0.4 μl of primer mix (5.5 μm each), and 2.1 μl of deionized water were added separately into a 384-well plate. The cycle conditions were carried out as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Specificity of the amplification was determined by melting curve analysis. The data were expressed as ratio of the quantity of specific transcripts to the quantity of the β-actin gene. Recombinant Human Cathepsins—Human cathepsin V was expressed in Pichia pastoris using the expression vector pPIC-9K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described (16Bromme D. Li Z. Barnes M.

Recombinant human mature cathepsin B was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Menard (Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Cathepsins V, L, K, and S were activated by treatment with pepsin and purified on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as previously reported (14Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol.

DNA encoding the human rMMP-12 catalytic domain was prepared by PCR cloning from human placenta cDNA using the forward primer 5′-GATCTCCATATGTTCAGGGAAAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGATCCTTATCCATACAGGGACTGAAT-3′. The resulting 500-bp PCR product was subcloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega, Madison, WI), digested with NdeI/BamHI and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of the pET16b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The sequence of the final plasmid was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. BL21[DE3] cells transformed with MMP-12/pET16b were grown at 37 °CtoanOD600 of 1 and then induced with 1mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) and sonicated on ice. The washed pellet was resuspended in denaturing buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min by gently vortexing. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied on Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with the same buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Unbound proteins were washed out with washing buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 5.9, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea). MMP-12 was eluted with elution buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.5, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea) and diluted into folding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij 35, 2.5 mm l-glutathione-oxidized, 2.5 mm l-glutathione-reduced, and 20% glycerol) to a final concentration of 4 m urea. The refolding reaction was carried out at 4 °C overnight. The urea concentration was reduced to 2, 1, 0.5 and 0 m by dialysis against dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij35). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Western Blot Analysis—Atheroma tissue was kindly provided by Dr. Marin from the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY. The tissue was suspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT/EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). After sonication, the homogenate was placed on ice for 10 min, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE), and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Anti-human cathepsin V monoclonal antibody (1: 2000 dilution), anti-human cathepsin K polyclonal antibody (MS2, 1:5000 dilution), anti-human cathepsin S polyclonal antibody (PabSasha, 1: 2000 dilution), and anti-cathepsin L monoclonal antibody (Alexis Biochemicals, QBIOGENE, Carlsbad, CA; mAb33/1, 1:5000 dilution) were used for analysis. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibody, HRP activity was detected using the ECL system. The antihuman cathepsin V monoclonal antibody 3G11 was raised in a Balb/c mouse following common protocols using the pam3Cys-modified cathepsin V-specific peptide GFTVVAPGK. The selection of the specific clone was done with the same peptide without the pam3Cys-modification. The specificity of the mAb was confirmed by epitope mapping and detection of recombinant human cathepsin V by immunoblotting. The antibody showed no cross-reactivity with human cathepsins L, H, S, K, B, and W in ELISA and immunoblotting (data not shown). PabSasha and mAb33/1 have been previously characterized (19Tolosa E.

The preparation of the lysosomal fractions was performed with some modifications as described by Tournu et al. (34Tournu C. Obled A. Roux M.P. Deval C. Ferrara M. Bechet D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDMs (2 × 106) were homogenized in 0.25 m saccharose containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2 mm EDTA using a 26-gauge needle. Cellular homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 2.5 mm DTT/EDTA and incubated with inhibitors. Recombinant human cathepsins V, K, and S (0.3 ng each) were incubated with 1 nm and 1 μm Mu-Leu-Hph-VS-Ph or with 10 nm Mu-Np2-Hph-VS-2Np, respectively, in 10 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm DTT/EDTA at 37 °C for increasing time periods (0, 5, 30, 60 min) prior to the incubation with DCG-04. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were separated on 10% Tris-glycine gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/T-PBS, membranes were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. DCG-04 inhibited proteases were visualized using the ECL system. Elastin Congo Red Assay—The elastolytic activity of each enzyme was tested by a modification of the procedures of Rust et al. (35Caballero A.R. Moreau J.M. Engel L.S. Marquart M.E. Hill J.M. O'Callaghan R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 290: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Rust L. Messing C.R. Iglewski B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 10 mg of Congo Red elastin (Sigma) were suspended in 0.9 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 2.5 mm DTT and 2.5 mm EDTA (for cysteine protease), or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) with or without 5 mm CaCl2 (for metalloproteinases and serine proteases, respectively). The digest reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzymes (final concentration of 1 μm) and then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of 0.15% C4-S, C6-S, DS, or heparin (Sigma). Finally, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the OD490 of the supernatants was recorded. In Situ Activity Assays—To determine whether various inhibitors used to block the elastolytic activity of MDMs penetrate into the cells, the intracellular hydrolysis of a synthetic peptide substrate for cathepsin B (Z-Arg-Arg-4-MβNA, Bachem Inc., Bubendorf, Switzerland) was monitored. The assay using Z-Arg-Arg-4-MβNA was performed as previously described (37Hou W.S. Li Z. Gordon R.E. Chan K. Klein M.J. Levy R. Keysser M. Keyszer G. Bromme D. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2167-2177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12-day cultures of MDM were incubated for 24 h with either 1 μm Mu-Leu-Hph-VS-Ph, 1 μm Mu-Np2-Hph-VS-2Np, 1 μm E-64d, 1 μm E-64, or 100 μm E-64. Control experiments did not contain an inhibitory compound. Inhibitor treated or untreated cells were subsequently incubated with a mixture of 1 mg/ml of Z-Arg-Arg-MβNA, 1 mm 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde, 1 mm DTT, 2.7 mm l-cysteine, and 0.25 mm EDTA in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5). Protease-released 4-methoxy-β-naphthylamine forms an insoluble fluorescent complex with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde. The generation of the insoluble fluorescent product was detected by fluorescent microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (excitation 440–500 nm and emission above 510 nm). To determine whether insoluble elastin particles are taken up by cells, MDMs were seeded on the coverslides in a 6-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. 2 mg of rhodamine-conjugated elastin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) suspension in culture media per well were added and after 3 days of incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). Then cells were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Association Inc., Birmingham, AL), and the fluorescent signal was detected by fluorescent microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (emission 570 nm). 3H-labeled Elastin Degradation—3H-labeled elastin was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen J. Weiss (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Elastin-coated plates were prepared by drying 2 mg of 3H-labeled elastin on the entire surface of each well of 12-well plates. 12-day MDMs prepared from healthy donors were added and cultured in the presence or the absence of inhibitors, Mu-Leu-Hph-VS-Ph, Mu-Np2-Hph-VS-2Np, or Mu-Leu-Hph-VS-Ph plus GM6001 (Calbiochem), E-64 or E-64d at concentrations as indicated in Figs. 5 and 6. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and solubilized elastin was quantified by scintillation counting. Results are expressed as relative elastin degradation activities (in percent).Fig. 6Degradation of [3H]elastin by monocyte-derived macrophages. A, inhibition of [3H]elastin degradation by protease selective inhibitors. Cathepsin S was inhibited at 1 nm Mu-Leu-Hph-VS-Ph, cathepsins V and S at 10 nm Mu-Np2-Hph-VS-2Np, all cathepsins at 1 μm Mu-Leu-Hph-VS-Ph or Mu-Np2-Hph-VS-2Np and all MMPs at 10 μm GM6001. B, contribution of cathepsins to intra- and extracellular elastin degradation. 1 μm E-64d inhibited the intracellular activities, 1 μm E-64 inhibited the extracellular cathepsin activities and 100 μm E-64 inhibited both, extra- and intracellular activities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Substrate Assay using Z-Phe-Arg-MCA—Steady state kinetics were performed using the fluorogenic dipeptide substrate, Z-Phe-Arg-MCA as previously described (14Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was followed by monitoring the release of the fluorogenic leaving group, MCA, at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm using the Molecular Devices SpectraMax Gemini spectromicrofluorimeter. The kcat and Km values were determined using nonlinear regression analysis. Cathepsin V activities were assayed at 25 °C in the absence or the presence of C4-S and 300 mm NaCl at a fixed enzyme concentration (0.5 nm) and variable substrate concentrations (1–100 μm) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 2.5 mm DTT and 2.5 mm EDTA. Labeling of Cathepsins and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay— DCG-04, an epoxide inhibitor derivative of E-64 containing a tyrosine residue for iodination was used to label active cathepsins. The compound was iodinated as described previously (38Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). 50 ng of [125I]DCG-04 labeled cathepsins were preincubated in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 mm DTT/EDTA in the presence or the absence of 0.1% C4-S, respectively, for 20 min and then mixed at 37 °C with non-reducing protein loading buffer and preheated agarose gel. The sample was loaded into the well of a 0.5% agarose gel and separated at room temperature at 55V, 250 mA for 30 min in a running buffer containing 125 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 40 mm NaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS. After gel drying, [125I]DCG-04-labeled cathepsins were visualized on x-ray film. Expression of Cathepsins in Human Atheroma Tissue—Using specific antibodies, we determined the expression of cathepsin polypeptides in human atheroma by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the extract of human atheroma tissue obtained from a patient with atherosclerosis contained the precursor (42 kDa) and mature forms (28 kDa) of cathepsin K and mature forms of cathepsins S and L as previously described. Interestingly, immunoreactive bands with apparent molecular masses of 43 and 29 kDa for a novel tissue-specific cysteine proteinase, cathepsin V, were also detected. Cathepsin V protein has been previously described only in thymus (19Tolosa E. Li W. Yasuda Y. Wienhold W. Denzin L.K. Lautwein A. Driessen C. Schnorr"

Here, we show that S1P also induces phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling device. However, Smad phosphorylation occurred more slowly with a maximal effect after 20–30 min of S1P stimulation when compared with the rapid activation of the MAPKs. Interestingly, Smad phosphorylation is increased by pertussis toxin, which is in contrast to the complete inhibition of S1P-induced MAPK phosphorylation by pertussis toxin. TGF-β is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, which in mesangial cells attenuates the expression of (i) inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) caused by interleukin (IL)-1β, (ii) secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), and (iii) matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). These gene products are also down-regulated by S1P in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of connective tissue growth factor is enhanced by both TGF-β2 and S1P. These effects of S1P are not mediated by the MAPK cascade as neither pertussis toxin nor the MAPK cascade inhibitor U0126 are able to reverse this inhibition. Overexpression of the inhibitory Smad-7 or down-regulation of co-Smad-4 lead to a reversal of the blocking effect of S1P on IL-1β-induced NO release. Moreover, down-regulating the TGF-β receptor type II by the siRNA technique or antagonizing the S1P3 receptor subtype with suramin abrogates S1P-stimulated Smad phosphorylation. In summary, our data show that S1P trans-activates the TGF-β receptor and triggers activation of Smads followed by activation of connective tissue growth factor gene transcription and inhibition of IL-1β-induced expression of iNOS, sPLA2, and MMP-9.

They initiate these cellular responses by binding to the TGF-β receptor, which is a 70-kDa transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J.

Signaling events that are initiated by TGF-β are comprised of the phosphorylation and homotrimerization of Smad proteins, which then assemble with a distinct Smad homotrimer to a heterohexamer and translocate to the nucleus where gene transcription is either activated or suppressed (18Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4769) Google Scholar). In addition to the Smad pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades are also activated by TGF-β (19Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid signaling molecule generated from ceramide by the action of neutral ceramidase followed by sphingosine kinase (for review, see Refs. 21Spiegel S. J.

It has gained increasing attention, as S1P has mitogenic properties in many cell types (24Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J.

Cell surface receptors for S1P belong to the endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) family (26Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), which also includes the lysophosphatidic acid receptors. Recently, the Edg receptors have been renamed S1P receptors by the International Union of Pharmacology (27Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G. Pharmacol.

In renal mesangial cells, several S1P receptors are expressed, including the S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 (formerly known as Edg-1, -5, -3, -6, and -8 receptors) (28Katsuma S. Hada Y. Ueda T.

In this study, we show that S1P is able to cross-activate the TGF-β signaling pathway in renal mesangial cells and thereby can mimic TGF-β-induced cell responses including inhibition of proinflammatory gene induction such as the inducible NO synthase (iNOS), secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).

Full-length mouse Smad7 was kindly provided by Prof. C. H. Heldin, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden. Cell Culture—Rat renal mesangial cells were cultivated and characterized as described previously (29Pfeilschifter J. Kurtz A. Bauer C. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Passages 7–21 were used for the experiments in this study. Cell Stimulation and Western Blot Analysis—Confluent mesangial cells in 60-mm diameter dishes were stimulated with the indicated substances in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mg/ml of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Thereafter, the medium was withdrawn. The cells washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle fitted to a 1-ml syringe. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for protein determination. Cell extracts containing 50 μg of protein were prepared in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred on to nitrocellulose paper, and immunostaining was performed as described previously in detail (5Huwiler A. Stabel S. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer as indicated in the legends of the figures. Bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method as recommended by the manufacturer. Cross-linking Experiments—Lysates of unstimulated and stimulated cells in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2mm EGTA were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 mm cross-linker, which was dissolved as 50 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. Samples were quenched with 2 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 15 min. Thereafter, SDS buffer was added, and samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by Western blot analysis. Determination of NO Formation—Quiescent mesangial cells in 24-well plates were stimulated as indicated, and the supernatants were taken for nitrite determination using Griess reagent as described (30Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10736) Google Scholar). Determination of Secreted sPLA2 Activity—Supernatants of stimulated mesangial cells were subjected to sPLA2 activity assay exactly as described previously (31Pfeilschifter J. Pignat W. Vosbeck K. Märki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cell Transfections—Mesangial cells were plated in 30-mm diameter dishes and grown to 50% confluence and then transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfections 1 μg of either pcDNA 3.1 vector alone or pcDNA 3.1 vector containing full-length cDNA of mouse Smad-7 were used. 48 h post-transfection, cells were taken for stimulation. Gene silencing was performed using sequence-specific siRNA reagents of: rat Smad-4 (AAUACACCGACAAGCAAUGACdTdT and GUCAUUGCUUGUCGGUGUAUUdTdT) and rat TGFβR II (AAAGUCGGUUAACAGCGAUCUdTdT and AGAUCGCUGUUAACCGACUUUdTdT). Mesangial cells were transfected with a 200 nm concentration of the 21-nucleotide duplexes using OligofectAMINE as recommended by the manufacturer (Dharmacon). After 48 h cells were stimulated as indicated in the figure legends to Figs. 9 and 11. The silencing efficiency was detected by Western blot analyses using specific antibodies.Fig. 1Effect of S1P on the different MAPK cascades and PKB in renal mesangial cells. Quiescent mesangial cells were stimulated with either vehicle (Co, 10 min) or S1P (3 μm) for the indicated time periods. Aniso, anisomycin (100 ng/ml) treated for 20 min. Thereafter, cells were harvested, and Western blot analyses were performed using anti-phospho-specific antibodies against the different MAPKs and Ser473 of PKB, as well as against total MAPKs at a dilution of 1:1000 each. Bands were detected by the ECL method according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Data are representative of three independent experiments giving similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 11Involvement of the TGF-βR II and the S1P3 receptor in S1P-induced Smad phosphorylation.A, cells were transfected with either vehicle (–) or siRNA duplexes of rat TGF-βR II (+) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thereafter, cells were stimulated with either vehicle (Co, 15 min), S1P (10 μm, 15 min), or TGF-β2 (T; 20 ng/ml, 30 min). B, cells were pretreated for 20 min with the indicated concentrations of suramin (in mm) prior to stimulation with either vehicle (–) or S1P for 15 min. Thereafter, cells were harvested, and Western blot analyses were performed using a phospho-Smad-1 antibody (A, upper panel, and B) or a TGF-βR II antibody (A, lower panel) at a dilution of 1:1000 and 1:2000, respectively. Data in A are representative of two independent experiments giving similar results. Data in B show a representative triplicate experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using guanidinium isothiocyanate solution. 30 μg of RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and cross-linked by UV light. Blots were hybridized with a 470-bp reverse transcriptase-PCR product of rat iNOS (forward primer, CCT TTG CTA CTG AGA CAGG; reverse primer, GGG ATC TGA ATG CAA TGTT), with a 416-bp reverse transcriptase-PCR product of rat IIA-sPLA2 (forward primer, GGT CCT CCT GTT GCT AGC AG; reverse primer, CTT TGC AAA ACT TGT TGG GG), with a 700-bp probe of rat MMP-9 (32Eberhardt W.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and with a 357-bp reverse transcriptase-PCR product of rat CTGF (forward primer, GCC CTG TGA AGC TGA CCT AG; reverse primer, GAG TTC GTG TCC CTT ACT CCC). All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 20 h, and the membranes were exposed on an imaging system. To correct for variations in RNA amounts, blots were finally rehybridized with a 32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA probe. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni's post hoc test for multiple comparisons (GraphPad InStat Version 3.00 for Windows NT, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Activates the S1P Receptors and Leads to Increased MAPK Activities—Stimulation of mesangial cells with S1P leads to a rapid activation of all three major MAPK cascades. Activation of these cascades can be detected by measuring the phosphorylation of the different members of these cascades. As seen in Fig. 1, a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of the classical p42/p44-MAPKs occurs already after 2 min of S1P stimulation (Fig. 1A, upper panel), and this increase in the degree of phosphorylation is maintained for 10 min but declined rapidly thereafter. In contrast, the total p42/p44 protein levels did not change upon stimulation (Fig. 1A, lower panel). A similar rapid and transient increase in phosphorylation is seen for the stress-activated p38-MAPK (Fig. 1B), the stress-activated protein kinases SAPK/JNKs (Fig. 1C), and also for the protein kinase B (Fig. 1D). Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Cross-activates the TGF-β2 Receptor and Stimulates the Smad Signaling Cascade—In addition to the rapid activation of the three MAPK cascades, S1P also causes an enhanced phosphorylation of Smad proteins. As seen in Fig. 2A, upon S1P stimulation phosphorylation of Smad-2 at Ser465 and Ser467 is increased with a more delayed time course when compared with the MAPKs. Maximal phosphorylation occurs after 15–20 min of stimulation. As a positive control TGF-β2 was employed, which is a well known activator of Smads leading to increased phosphorylation of these transcription factors (13Mehra A. Wrana J.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 605-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). TGF-β2 causes a comparably delayed phosphorylation of Smad-2 as found for S1P (Fig. 2B). Smad-1 was also investigated, as Smad-1 is known to transduce signals from another member of the TGF-β receptor superfamily, the bone morphogenetic protein receptor (34Bhatia M. Bonnet D. Wu D. Murdoch B. Wrana J. Gallacher L. Dick J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Smad-1 causes an increase in phosphorylation at Ser463/465 upon S1P and TGF-β2 stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, Smad-3 is another important member of the Smad family that is activated by the TGF-β2 receptor (35Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether S1P also phosphorylates Smad-3, mesangial cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then subjected to stimulation with S1P and TGF-β2 followed by cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of Smad-3. Fig. 2C shows that both S1P and TGF-β2 induce phosphorylation of Smad-3 at 50 kDa. Surprisingly, two phosphorylated bands appear at ∼50 and 55 kDa. This strongly suggests that other Smad members like the 55-kDa Smad-1 or -2 are also recognized by the anti-Smad-3 antibody, although the antibody (FL-425) was raised against recombinant full-length Smad-3. The stimulating effect of S1P on Smad phosphorylation occurs in a concentration-dependent manner as seen in Fig. 3. However, only concentrations of 100 nm and above (for Smad-2) and 1 μm and above (for Smad-1) significantly increase Smad phosphorylation.Fig. 3Concentration dependence of S1P-induced Smad phosphorylation in mesangial cells. Cells were stimulated for 20 min with either vehicle (Co) or the indicated concentrations of S1P (in μm). Thereafter, cells were harvested, and Western blot analyses were performed using specific anti-phospho-Smad-1 and -2 antibodies and total Smad-2 antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000 each. Bands were detected by the ECL method. Data are representative of two independent experiments giving similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, the S1P-induced Smad-2 phosphorylation is not abolished by pertussis toxin an inhibitor of Gi/o proteins (36Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) but rather increased (Fig. 4, upper panel), while the activation of the p42/p44-MAPK cascade by S1P is dose-dependently blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig. 4, middle panel). Again, the total amount of MAPK does not change throughout the stimulation period (Fig. 4, lower panel). Pertussis toxin alone has no effect on Smad nor p42/44-MAPK phosphorylation. These data propose that the p42/p44-MAPK may have a negative effect on Smad activation, which has also been suggested by several other groups in different cell types (37Kretzschmar M. Doody J.

Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Stimulation Mimics TGF-β2-induced Cell Responses—We then investigated whether S1P is able to mimic TGF-β-mediated cell responses. In mesangial cells, TGF-β2 inhibits the formation of NO (40Pfeilschifter J. Vosbeck K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), prostaglandins (41Pfeilschifter J. Pignat W. Leighton J. Märki F. Vosbeck K. Alkan S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and extracellular matrix (42Marti H.P. Lee L. Kashgarian M. Lovett D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 82-94PubMed Google Scholar) caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines. As seen in Fig. 5A, IL-1β-induced nitrite formation, which reflects the inducible NO synthase activity, is blocked by TGF-β2. A similar reduction is seen with S1P, showing first significant reductions at 100 nm S1P and reaching approximately 90% inhibition at 10 μm S1P. The reduction of NO release is paralleled by a transcriptional down-regulation of IL-1β-induced iNOS mRNA as demonstrated by a Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5B). Moreover, S1P also reduces sPLA2 activity, which is considered to be the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin formation (Fig. 6A). Yet, the inhibitory effects of TGF-β2 and S1P were less pronounced as compared with NO release. Again, the reduced sPLA2 activity is due to reduced mRNA transcription of the group IIA sPLA2 (Fig. 6C) and also to reduced protein synthesis and secretion (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, MMP-9 mRNA expression is also blocked by S1P in a concentration-dependent manner as seen in a Northern blot analysis (Fig. 7A). Similar to the NO release, the reduction of MMP-9 mRNA expression by S1P is only detectable by concentrations of 100 nm and above (Fig. 7A). This reduction of IL-1β-triggered MMP-9 mRNA expression by S1P and TGF-β2 is also reflected on the amount of MMP-9 protein secreted into the supernatant (Fig. 7B). Stimulation of cells with S1P or TGF-β2 alone has no effect per se on either iNOS, sPLA2, or MMP-9 expression (data not shown).Fig. 6Effect of S1P and TGF-β2 on IL-1β-induced expression and activity of sPLA2 in mesangial cells. Quiescent mesangial cells were stimulated for 24 h with either vehicle (Co) or IL-1β (1 nm) in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of S1P (in μm) or TGF-β2 (in ng/ml). Thereafter, supernatants were collected and taken for sPLA2 activity assay (A) or used to precipitate proteins and subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-sPLA2 antibody at a dilution of 1:60 (B).

These monomers are thought to coassemble to form homo- or heterotetrameric channels, but the signals governing their assembly are unknown. Within the TRPV subgroup, TRPV5 and TRPV6 show exclusive calcium selectivity and play an important role in calcium uptake. To identify signals that mediate assembly of functional TRPV6, we screened domains for self-association using co-immunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, bacterial two-hybrid assays, and patch clamp analysis. Of the two identified interaction domains within the N-terminal region, we showed that the first domain encompassing the third ankyrin repeat is the stringent requirement for physical assembly of TRPV6 subunits and when transferred to an unrelated protein enables its interaction with TRPV6. Deletion of this repeat or mutation of critical residues within this repeat rendered nonfunctional channels that do not co-immunoprecipitate or form tetramers. Suppression of dominant-negative inhibitors of TRPV6-specific currents was achieved by deletion of ankyrin (ANK) 3. We propose that the third ANK repeat initiates a molecular zippering process that proceeds past the fifth ANK repeat and creates an intracellular anchor that is necessary for functional subunit assembly.

Members of the TRP family are involved in sensory processes such as invertebrate vision and temperature, pain, and gustatory sensation often restricted to specialized cells and in more ubiquitous processes such as sensing osmotic stress or regulating intracellular magnesium concentration (for reviews, see Refs. 1Montell C.

The general topology of a TRP subunit includes intracellular N- and C-terminal regions of variable length and six transmembrane-spanning domains with a pore loop between transmembrane domains 5 and 6. In analogy to voltage-gated potassium channels it is thought that four subunits need to assemble to form a functional channel. Tetramer formation has been shown for TRPV1 and TRPV5/6 (3Kedei N.

Although ANK repeats are common modular protein interaction motifs, not much is known regarding whether or not their specific sequence and/or number of repeats are required to form specialized interactions or about their role in the assembly of ion channels. Two members of the subgroup of TRPV channels, TRPV5 and TRPV6, show exquisite selectivity for calcium ions and are likely to be involved in epithelial calcium uptake (for a recent review, see Ref. 10den Dekker E. Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover it has been shown that expression of TRPV6 can act as an indicator for the malignancy and invasiveness of prostate cancer (11Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C.

Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Analyzing the structure responsible for physical and functional assembly of these channel proteins is essential for understanding their function and may facilitate designing potential drug targets.In this study we analyzed the domains within TRPV6 that are involved in assembling functional ion channels. We found that an N-terminal region (aa 116–191) is sufficient to enable self-interaction; a construct containing this region had a dominant-negative effect on TRPV6 currents. Moreover transfer of this region to a protein unrelated to TRPV proteins, the γ1 subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels, enabled this protein to physically interact with TRPV6. Conversely deletion of this region was able to suppress the dominant-negative phenotype of a mutant subunit with an altered ionic pore. The interacting region contains the third ANK repeat, and we could show that specific amino acids in the second helical segment of this ANK repeat are necessary for assembly of functional TRPV6 channels. This is particularly important as no data exist on the physiological function of the ANK repeats of TRP channels, and we may now be able to establish rules for subunit assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—All experiments were conducted using hTRPV6 (GenBank™ accession number NM_018646). To obtain the three TRPV6 deletion mutants, a MluI restriction site (ACGCGT) was introduced by PCR at nucleotide positions 333–335 resulting in replacement of serine at position 112 by an arginine. The mutation was introduced using a reverse PCR primer containing the downstream SacI site and the indicated base pairs and a PCR forward primer that included the SacI site of the pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP vector. The SacI-cut amplified fragment was ligated into SacI-cut pCAGGS-TRPV6 vector. Deletion constructs were made by PCR with different forward primers containing an MluI recognition site and a reverse primer covering a unique TRPV6 EcoRV restriction site. The MluI/EcoRV fragments were ligated into the MluI and EcoRV sites of TRPV6-pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP and for precipitation experiments were recloned into TRPV6-EGFP-pCDNA3. The D542A and 138AR139 to 138EA139 mutations were obtained by using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene). The template for this reaction was the EGFP-tagged full-length TRPV6. TRPV6 antisense construct was obtained by cloning the entire coding sequence of TRPV6 in antisense orientation into pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP vector. All amplified DNA used for expression constructs was sequenced.Recombinant Proteins—All C-terminal EGFP-tagged constructs were obtained by inserting PCR-amplified TRPV6 fragments including the consensus sequence for initiation of translation in vertebrates followed by a start ATG into pCDNA3 vector that was modified to include an in-frame EGFP coding sequence.Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings on single transfected HEK 293 or HEK-TRPV6 cells were performed 48–72 h after transfection as described previously (11Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol.

Pipette solution contained 140 mm aspartic acid, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Bath solution contained 115 mm triethylammonium chloride, 10 mm CsCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 30 mm CaCl2. After obtaining whole cell configuration, whole cell currents were recorded every 10 s by applying 100-ms voltage clamp ramps from –100 mV to +100 mV from a holding potential of +70 mV until currents at –80 mV reached maximum values. Currents (pA) were divided by the whole cell capacitance (pF). Data are given as mean ± S.E. Values were not corrected for liquid junction potentials.Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—TRPV6 stable HEK 293 (TRPV6s) cells were transfected with pCDNA3-TRPV6-EGFP expression constructs, cultured for 24–72 h depending on the condition and fluorescence of the cells, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with trypsin for 1 min, pooled after adding medium, centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 rpm (4 °C), washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 rpm, and resuspended depending on the size of the cell pellets in 1–2 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) with added protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin Aor1 μg/ml antipain, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine). Cells were lysed by sequential pipetting through three different gauge syringe needles (0.7, 0.55, and 0.4 inner diameters). After lysis, 50–100 μlofthe lysate were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and resuspended in loading buffer; the remaining lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with 2.2 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TRPV6 antibody (antibody 429) or 3 μg of anti-HA antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by an incubation with protein-A-Sepharose beads for 1–2 h. After four to five washes with RIPA buffer, beads were resuspended in an equal volume of loading buffer, treated for 3 min at 95 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot analysis.Cell Surface Biotinylation—Dishes with confluent transfected HEK cells were washed and treated exactly as described in Ref. 14Mery L. Strauss B. Dufour J.F. Krause K.H. Hoth M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3497-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Controls included monitoring the input of TRPV6 protein as well as stripping and reprobing the blot with an anti-GFP antibody to control that only the TRPV6-EGFP fusion protein (+5p2) but not the EGFP that is co-expressed from the pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP for TRPV6-wt or TRPV6-ΔANK 3 + 4 was precipitated by avidin-agarose.Sedimentation by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—HEK 293 cells transfected with TRPV6-EGFP or TRPV6-M5-EGFP were treated with trypsin 48 h after transfection, solubilized in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 30 min at 52,000 rpm (TLA100) to pellet undissolved material. Samples were loaded onto a continuous 10–20% sucrose gradient (in 20 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X-100, and protease inhibitors as above) and subjected to 50,000 rpm (NVT65) for 1 h and 30 min. 660-μl fractions were then collected, and 35 μl of each fraction were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. All markers were obtained from Sigma.Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal (antibody 429) and monoclonal anti-TRPV6 (26B3) antibodies were generated in our laboratory (15Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bodding M. Nastainczyk W. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-GFP and anti-HA antibodies were from Roche Applied Science, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody was from Jackson Laboratories.Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—Experiments were performed by using the Bacteriomatch two-hybrid system (Stratagene) with the following modifications. DNA encoding a bait or a target protein was cloned in-frame into pTRG or the modified pBT vector (pBTL) containing a (Gly4-Ser)3 linker. All constructs were sequenced. Electrocompetent bacteria (Bacteriomatch two-hybrid system reporter strain, Stratagene) were thawed on ice and electroporated in the presence of 50 ng of pTRG and 50 ng of pBTL (Bio-Rad; 2.5 kV, 200 ohms, 25 μF). After adding 1 ml of SOC (LB + 10 mm MgCl2 + 10 mm MgSO4 + 20 mm glucose) medium, cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking (225 rpm) for 1.5 h. 100 μl of each transformation were plated on CTCK-agar plates (600 μg/ml carbenicillin, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 20 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 4 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) were added to each plate shortly before plating the bacteria) and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Interactions were detected by growth and number of blue colonies.Stable Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions—HEK 293 (CRL-1573, ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and passaged by treatment with trypsin. An hTRPV6-containing pCDNA3 vector was transfected into the cells by using Super-Fect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Surviving cells were isolated, subcloned, and tested by Northern and Western blot for the presence of TRPV6 transcript and protein.Immunofluorescence of EGFP-tagged Constructs—HEK 293 cells or HEK 293 cells stably expressing TRPV6 were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected with different EGFP-tagged cDNA constructs using SuperFect. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted in phosphate-buffered saline on glass slides, and imaged in vivo using fluorescence microscopy (Nikon E600, PlanApo 60× A/1.40 oil with attached DN100 or Olympus BX-50, UPlanApo 100×/1.35 with attached imago camera (T.I.L.L. Photonics)) and analySIS aquisition software (Soft Imaging System). Mitochondria were made visible by prior incubation for 30 min with 0.1 μm Texas Red Mito-Tracker (Molecular Probes).RESULTSIdentification of N-terminal Interaction Domains—To identify regions within the TRPV6 protein that are required for homomultimeric subunit assembly, we investigated protein-protein interactions using bacterial two-hybrid interaction screens and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These approaches have the advantage of being able to investigate interactions both in a mammalian cell environment and in a system that allows a more rapid and independent dissection of binding sites.For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we made use of a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing TRPV6 (TRPV6s cells) into which we transiently transfected different EGFP-tagged constructs. We used a polyclonal TRPV6 antibody that is directed against an epitope localized at the very C terminus (antibody 429, see Ref. 15Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bodding M. Nastainczyk W. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to precipitate TRPV6 from TRPV6s cells but not from the parental HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Due to post-translational glycosylation, TRPV6 protein can be detected at molecular masses of around 75 up to 85–100 kDa in a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel (see Refs. 5Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar and 15Hirnet D. Olausson J. Fecher-Trost C. Bodding M. Nastainczyk W. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To avoid detecting the rabbit immunoglobulins used for the immunoprecipitation in the Western blot, we used a mouse monoclonal antibody (26B3) that detects a distinct epitope of TRPV6 further upstream of the 429 site (see “Experimental Procedures”) as a detection antibody. To determine whether we can co-immunoprecipitate individual TRPV6 subunits that are only transiently expressed in the stable cell line we transfected a C-terminally EGFP-tagged TRPV6 that lacks the last 32 amino acids (TRPV6-Δ-EGFP) and thus the epitope for antibody 429. This almost full-length construct with an estimated molecular mass of ∼ 110 kDa could be co-immunoprecipitated from TRPV6-expressing cells using antibody 429 as the precipitating antibody and either a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1B) or monoclonal anti-TRPV6 (26B3) as detection antibody. The very C-terminal 32 amino acid residues of TRPV6 (aa 694–725) that are critical for binding the regulatory calmodulin (16Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) thus do not contribute to TRPV6-TRPV6 interaction. No signal was detected if the EGFP-tagged construct was expressed in HEK 293 cells and antibody 429 was used as the precipitating antibody (Fig. 1B, right lane).As a separate control for the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we used a cell line that stably expresses HA-tagged TRPC3 protein and transiently expresses EGFP-tagged full-length TRPV6. As expected, the anti-HA antibody could precipitate TRPC3, but it did not co-immunoprecipitate the EGFP-tagged full-length TRPV6 construct (Fig. 1, C and D). Conversely the polyclonal antibody 429 did not co-immunoprecipitate hTRPC3 (Fig. 1D).Using the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody as precipitating antibody, we could also co-immunoprecipitate TRPV6 from the stable cell line transfected with interacting EGFP-tagged constructs (data not shown). However, because the monoclonal antibody was not as efficient in immunoprecipitating, we screened for interacting domains using antibody 429 as the precipitating antibody.To narrow down the protein domain within TRPV6 that is responsible for TRPV6-TRPV6 interaction, we repeated the experiment described above after transient transfection and expression of a series of EGFP-tagged fusion proteins encompassing different protein domains of TRPV6. First we focused on the intracellular C-terminal (aa 584–694) and the N-terminal regions (aa 1–328) that contains six rather than three ANK repeats (17Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Aligning the N-terminal TRPV6 sequence with both an idealized ANK repeat (18Mosavi L.K. Minor Jr., D.L. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16029-16034Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and an ANK repeat consensus (19Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) revealed these six ANK repeats (Fig. 2A) with the fifth ANK repeat being a somewhat atypical one that was not recognized as such using the protein prediction program SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/embl), which detected five ANK repeats. Subsequently we subdivided the N-terminal constructs using the ANK repeats as guideposts (Fig. 2B). The check marks in Fig. 2B indicate which constructs were subcloned with a C-terminal EGFP tag and which were subcloned into vectors used for bacterial two-hybrid analysis.Fig. 2A, structure and consensus of TRPV6 ANK repeats. Ank c1 shows the consensus sequence of a designed 33-amino acid repeat (18Mosavi L.K. Minor Jr., D.L. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16029-16034Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and Ank c2 shows the repeat consensus after Michaely et al. (19Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Dark gray boxes indicate identical residues, lighter gray boxes indicate conserved residues, framed amino acids indicate non-conserved sites, the + in c2 indicates a non-polar amino acid. Underlined amino acids are positions that face the convex surface of the three-dimensional ANK repeat structure (19Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cylinders indicate the position of the two helical segments within the ANK repeat. Subscript numbers indicate position of the repeats within the TRPV6 sequence (V6) and number pairs to the right indicate the length in amino acid residues of the predicted helical segments. B, schematic representation of N-terminal TRPV6 expression constructs; check marks to the right indicate which construct contains a C-terminal EGFP tag and which one was investigated with the bacterial two-hybrid system (B2H). Numbered boxes indicate the position of putative ANK repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we were able to detect interactions of the full-length TRPV6 with the N-terminal region (aa 1–328) but neither with the C-terminal region (aa 584–694) nor with the intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 4 and 5 (aa 466–493) (Fig. 3A). We therefore subdivided the N-terminal domain into shorter fragments and narrowed down one interaction domain to the region around amino acids 116–163 that contains the third ANK repeat. The EGFP-tagged fragment covering ANK 1 and ANK 2 (aa 1–115) was not immunoprecipitated, but the fragment covering in addition ANK 3 and part of the adjacent sequence (aa 1–163) showed positive interaction (Fig. 3A). Controls for a comparable amount of expressed construct included monitoring the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated input (Fig. 3A, bottom) and the immunoprecipitant-supernatant of the expressed fusion protein and the amount of precipitated TRPV6 wild-type protein (by stripping and reprobing blots with antibody 26B3). Due to weak expression of construct 192–328 (ANK 5 + 6), see Fig. 3A, **, we could not exclude a further binding site downstream of amino acid 163. Construct 158–328 (ANK 4–6) also showed a positive interaction albeit weaker than construct 1–191, indicating that a second interaction site exists downstream of the ANK 3 domain (Fig. 3A). A short construct containing ANK domains 3 and 4 (aa 116–191) that ought to contain the first N-terminal interaction site co-immunoprecipitated only very weakly (Fig. 3B), ANK 3 alone showed an even weaker interaction, and no interaction was seen for ANK 4 alone (Fig. 3B). As all constructs contain a C-terminal EGFP tag, we used fluorescence microscopy to monitor their expression and localization. Interestingly all three constructs shown in Fig. 3B were strongly expressed; however, ANK 3 + 4 (aa 116–191) and ANK 3 alone (aa 116–163) were targeted to mitochondria. Fig. 3C shows the fusion protein EGFP fluorescence of living transfected cells in the left panel and Texas Red fluorescently labeled mitochondria of the same cells in the right panel. The finding that most of the recombinant fusion proteins covering ANK 3 and ANK 3 + 4 reside primarily within the mitochondria might explain why only minor amounts are available close to TRPV6-containing membranes for interaction with full-length TRPV6. In addition, this finding may indicate that the interactions observed after immunoprecipitation are not due to an artificial association of overexpressed proteins or protein fragments during solubilization of cells.Fig. 3Identification of the interaction domain.A and B, co-immunoprecipitation of different TRPV6 domains each tagged with a C-terminal (C-Term) EGFP with TRPV6 from TRPV6s cells using 429 as precipitating antibody and anti-GFP as detecting antibody, *, see Fig. 1; **, weak input. C, in vivo co-localization of EGFP-tagged constructs with mitochondria. The left panel shows EGFP fluorescence, and the right panel shows fluorescence of mitochondria marked with Texas Red Mito-Tracker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analysis of 116–191—Is the TRPV6 region 116–191 including ANK 3 and 4 alone sufficient for subunit interaction, and can the interaction with full-length TRPV6 be restored by forcing the interaction domain construct out of the mitochondria? To answer these questions, a foreign protein, the four-transmembrane γ1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels was inserted between the ANK 3 + 4 (aa 116–191) fragment of TRPV6 and the EGFP tag (Fig. 4). γ1-EGFP alone, when expressed in TRPV6s cells, localized to the plasma membrane (data not shown) but could not be co-immunoprecipitated with TRPV6 (Fig. 4A). However, fusing the ANK 3 + 4 domain (aa 116–191) to the N terminus of γ1 indeed was sufficient to both restore plasma membrane localization of 116–191 and, more importantly, to enable an interaction between the γ subunit and TRPV6 channels as seen by co-immunoprecipitation of TRPV6 and ANK 3 + 4-γ1-EGFP (Fig. 4B). The ANK 3 + 4 region thus can act as a strong association signal when localized to TRPV6-expressing membranes.Fig. 4ANK 3 + 4 (aa 116–191) when fused to the calcium channel γ1 subunit is sufficient to enable interaction between the γ1 subunit and TRPV6.A, the γ1-EGFP fusion protein alone does not interact with TRPV6; no EGFP signal can be detected after immunoprecipitation of TRPV6 with antibody 429. B, adding ANK 3 + 4 to γ1-EGFP confers TRPV6 binding. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal anti-TRPV6 antibody (26B3) to assure equal amounts of immunoprecipitated TRPV6. C, ANK 3 + 4 is a multimerization domain. Cell extracts of transfected HEK 293 cells were either solubilized in loading buffer in the presence (+) or absence (–) of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.43 m β-mercaptoethanol and treatment for 3 min at 95 °C. Fusing ANK 3 + 4 to EGFP results in the formation of higher molecular mass complexes with apparent dimers and trimers visible (arrows). Expected molecular masses of ANK 3 + 4-GFP are as follows: monomer, 35.2 kDa; dimer, 70.4 kDa; trimer, 105.6 kDa.

https://openalex.org/W2143399447,"The stress-activated protein kinases c-Jun-activated kinase (JNK) and p38 are implicated in neuronal apoptosis. Early studies in cell lines suggested a requirement for both in the apoptosis induced by withdrawal of nerve growth factor. However, studies in neuronal cells typically implicate JNK but not p38 in apoptosis. In some cases, p38 is implicated, but the role of JNK is undefined. It remains unclear whether p38 and JNK have differing roles dependent on cell type, apoptotic stimulus, or mechanism of cell death or whether they are redundant and each sufficient to induce identical forms of cell death. We investigate the relative roles of these protein kinases in different death mechanisms in a single system, cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Apoptosis induced by withdrawal of trophic support and glutamate are mechanistically different in terms of caspase activation, DNA fragmentation profile, chromatin morphology, and dependence on de novo gene expression. Caspase-independent apoptosis induced by glutamate is accompanied by strong activation of p38, and dominant negatives and inhibitors of the p38 pathway prevent this apoptosis. In contrast, withdrawal of trophic support induces caspase-dependent death accompanied by JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun, and inhibition of JNK is sufficient to prevent the death induced by withdrawal of trophic support. Inhibition of p38 does not block withdrawal of trophic support-induced death, nor does inhibition of JNK block glutamate-induced death. We propose that mechanistically different forms of apoptosis have differing requirements for p38 and JNK activities in neurons and demonstrate that only inhibition of the appropriate kinase will prevent neurons from undergoing apoptosis."

Proteases have an essential role in modulating the environmental cues that ECM provides for tissue morphogenesis, homeostasis, and disease progression. Metalloproteases, especially matrix metalloproteases, have a conspicuous role in ECM degradation as well as in proteolysis of cell-surface and soluble proteins (1Somerville R.P. Oblander S.A.

Although progress in this field has been rapid, the properties and functions of the majority of the 19 ADAMTS proteases remain unknown, and we refer to these as orphan enzymes (i.e. without a cognate substrate). ADAMTS7 2Adamts7 and ADAMTS7 denote mouse and human genes, respectively. ADAMTS7B is the full-length protein product of these genes in both species.

In this work, we describe a longer form of ADAMTS7 (designated ADAMTS7B) that we believe is the authentic full-length version of this enzyme and that suggests that our previous characterization of the C terminus of ADAMTS7 may have been incomplete. The primary structure of ADAMTS7B presented here places this enzyme in a distinct phylogenetic clade with ADAMTS12 (19Cal S. Arguelles J.M. Fernandez P.L. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17932-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, we have undertaken a detailed characterization of ADAMTS7B with emphasis on its unusual post-translational modification. ADAMTS7B is shown to contain a mucin domain within which is attached one or more chondroitin sulfate chains. This suggests that ADAMTS7B may exist in some cells and tissues as a proteoglycan, with potentially important functional consequences. In addition, we have characterized the maturation of the ADAMTS7B zymogen, demonstrated that the zymogen and mature enzyme may be cell-associated through different mechanisms, and shown that the mature enzyme and possibly the zymogen are active proteases. Materials—Reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. cDNA Cloning of Mouse ADAMTS7B—A partial cDNA encoding the 290 C-terminal amino acids of ADAMTS7B along with ∼200 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence was isolated from an embryonic day 17 mouse cDNA library (Clontech). This fragment was used as a starting point to clone cDNAs encoding the entire 1641-amino acid open reading frame (ORF) using the original library plus 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends of RNA from 13- and 17-day-old mouse embryos and Sol8 mouse myotubes. All sequences were verified by isolation of independent duplicate clones. To confirm the continuity of the clones and to generate an expression plasmid, primers from the 5′- and 3′-ends were used to amplify the entire ORF using cDNA obtained from C2C12 mouse myotubes. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg/lane) from mouse embryos and adult human tissues (BD Biosciences) were hybridized to a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled Adamts7b probe, followed by autoradiographic exposure for 7 days. Human and Mouse ADAMTS7 Expression Plasmids—For PCR amplification of full-length mouse ADAMTS7B, we used the above mouse plasmid as template and oligonucleotide 5′-gaattccaccacattggtgtgcacc-3′ (with the EcoRI site underlined) as the forward primer and oligonucleotide 5′-gcggccgcccgtctggctaccccgctga-3′ (with the NotI site underlined) as the reverse primer. The fidelity of PCR amplification was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. For expression of mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His (encoding the signal peptide, prodomain, and catalytic domain, constituting residues 1–444 in mouse ADAMTS7B), PCR amplification was performed utilizing the same forward primer and the reverse primer 5′-gtcgacttgagtgcaatgacatccttgg-3′ (with the SalI site underlined). A critical P1 Arg residue within each of the two major furin cleavage sites in ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His was substituted with Ala (Arg60 → Ala and Arg220 → Ala) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). These cDNAs were all cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-Myc/HisB for expression in-frame with tandem Myc and His6 tags. The corresponding human catalytic domain construct (encoding residues 1–459) was made by excision from an IMAGE clone (expressed sequence tag N48032) using EcoRI and HindIII and cloning into the matching sites of pcDNA3.1(+)-Myc/HisB. cDNA encoding the mucin domain (mouse Pro980–Arg1366, named ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC) was amplified using mouse ADAMTS7B cDNA as a template with primers 5′-aaagcttcccatgtacatagtggaca-3′ (with the HindIII site underlined) and 5′-aggatcctcacctggcaggcagtggat-3′ (with the BamHI site underlined) and cloned into pCMV9–3XFLAG for expression with a preprotrypsin leader sequence and three tandem N-terminal FLAG tags. Transfection and Selection of Stable Cell lines—DNA for transfection was prepared using the Wizard™ purification system (Promega Corp.). 80% confluent HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 ng of ADAMTS7B, ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC, or human or mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the medium was changed and supplemented with 1 mg/ml active G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Discrete clones were isolated using cloning discs (PGC Scientifics, Frederick, MD) and expanded in 24-well plates. Western blotting with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was used to determine the level of protein expression in the media of these clones as appropriate for the plasmid used. The highest expressing clones were expanded to purify human or mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His, full-length mouse ADAMTS7B protein, or mouse ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC. Protein Purification and N-terminal Sequence Analysis—HEK293F cells expressing human or mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His were cultured in three-tier flasks (Nunc, Rochester, NY) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When cultures were 80% confluent, their medium was replaced with serum-free medium (293 SFM medium, Invitrogen) with subsequent culture at 37 °C in the presence of 8% CO2 for 5 days. The medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m. ProBond resin (Invitrogen) was prepared by washing with 1 bed volume of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8). The medium and resin were mixed overnight at 4 °C (100 μl of resin/100 ml of medium). The resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm and then washed five times with 10 volumes of binding buffer. Bound protein was eluted by sequential washes with binding buffer containing 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mm imidazole. The washes and eluted protein fractions were assayed for the presence and purity of protein by Coomassie Blue staining. Gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) for Western blotting. The recombinant protein was detected using anti-c-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody 9E10 or anti-pentahistidine antibody (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Purification and analysis of full-length mouse ADAMTS7B were essentially similar, except that the cell layer was first washed with 0.5 m NaCl to release the protein from the cell surface; this was pooled with the medium from these cultures and purified and analyzed as described above. Purification of full-length ADAMTS7B was challenging and provided extremely small amounts of substantially purified enzyme such that quantitation could not be done. Since most of the studies with this enzyme were qualitative in nature for determination of its intrinsic characteristics, most assays used sufficient enzyme to permit visualization on Western blots. ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC was isolated from the conditioned medium of stably transfected cells by affinity purification with anti-FLAG antibody M2-Sepharose beads, following which the beads were extracted in Laemmli sample buffer prior to electrophoresis. For N-terminal sequencing of human and mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His, purified protein was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and lightly stained with Simply Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). The 50- and 29-kDa major bands were excised for amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer in the Molecular Biotechnology Core Facility of the Lerner Research Institute. In all the subsequent studies, we used full-length mouse ADAMTS7B or mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His as indicated. No further studies with human ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His beyond the N-terminal sequencing described above were conducted. Analysis of N- and O-Glycosylation of ADAMTS7B—For enzymatic removal of N-linked carbohydrate with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), HEK293 cell lysate expressing ADAMTS7B or purified ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His was denatured in 0.5% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min and cooled to room temperature, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a concentration of 1% (v/v) to neutralize the PNGase F inhibitory effects of SDS. The reduced samples were incubated with 100 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (with antibody 9E10) were used to compare in-gel migration with an untreated sample. For ligand blot analysis, ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC was electrophoresed on denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated peanut agglutinin (from Arachis hypogaea) was incubated with the membrane, followed by washes with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and detection by ECL (20Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol.

Enzymatic removal of O-linked carbohydrate was done using a mixture of 10 milliunits of sialidase and 0.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody M2. Undigested ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC was used as a control. Glycosaminoglycan Analysis—ADAMTS7B and ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC were treated with 0.5 units of protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, East Falmouth, MA) in 100 mm Tris and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, for 2 h at 37 °C. HEK293F, COS-1, and CHO-K1 cell lysates obtained from transiently transfected cells expressing ADAMTS7B were treated with 2.0 units of chondroitinase ABC, 5 units each of keratanase I and II, or 2.5 units each of heparinase I and III in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h at 37 °C. The proteins from the digests were precipitated with acetone and electrophoresed on reducing 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. ADAMTS7B was detected by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies 9E10 (for ADAMTS7B) and M2 (for ADAMTS7BFLAG-MUC). Samples untreated with the respective enzymes were used as negative controls. The blots were subsequently stripped by treatment with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min. The membrane was reprobed using mouse anti-chondroitin 6-sulfate monoclonal antibody 2035 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), which specifically recognizes stubs with an unsaturated glucuronic acid terminus derived from chondroitin 6-sulfate in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans following chondroitinase digestion. These stubs are not present in the native undigested chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. To further verify the attachment of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) to the ADAMTS7B core protein, we transfected the ADAMTS7B expression plasmid into CHO-K1 cells with a null mutation in β-d-xylosyltransferase (CHO-K1 pgsA-745; American Type Culture Collection, CRL-2242) (22Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfected parental CHO-K1 cells (CCL-61) were analyzed in parallel as a control. The conditioned medium from HEK293F clones expressing full-length ADAMTS7B was batch-incubated overnight with heparin-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The resin was washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.2–0.5 m). Uneluted protein was removed by boiling the beads in Laemmli sample buffer. Unbound protein was precipitated with cold acetone. Aliquots of the medium before binding, unbound proteins, and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blotting with antibody 9E10. Biosynthesis of ADAMTS7B—QBI 293A cells (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) were maintained, transiently transfected with mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His using FuGENE 6, and metabolically labeled with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Expre35S35S, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) essentially as described previously (13Somerville R.P.

A 15-min label (pulse) was followed by incubation in complete nonradioactive medium (chase) for various times.

They were transfected with mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His alone (as a control) or in combination with plasmids encoding the proprotein convertases furin, PACE4, PC6B, and PC7. QBI 293A cells were transiently transfected with ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His, also as a control. Cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h, and immunoprecipitation and fluorography of the cell lysate and medium were performed as described (13Somerville R.P. Longpré J.-M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M.

Cell-surface Biotinylation—Stably transfected HEK293F cells expressing ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His were scraped from plates; washed six times with cold PBS, pH 8.0; and diluted to 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. As a control to eliminate all cell-surface proteins, an equal number of cells were treated with trypsin/EDTA for 15 min and washed once with medium containing serum to inactivate trypsin and then six times with cold PBS. 1 ml of each cell suspension was mixed with 0.5 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were pelleted and washed once with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and three times with PBS, pH 8.0. The cell pellet was lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged. The soluble portion of the lysate was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated overnight with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C with rotation. The streptavidin-agarose was pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and PBS. The supernatant was discarded, and the streptavidin-agarose was resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. The agarose was pelleted, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Western blotting with anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10. Pulse-Chase Analysis of Cell-surface Biotinylated Proteins— HEK293F monolayers expressing mouse ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His were biotinylated as described above for cell suspensions. The monolayers were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline to inactivate the biotinylation reagent. The monolayers were returned to 10 ml of 293 SFM medium and further cultured for 3 h. 1 ml of medium was taken for analysis at sequential time points, and biotinylated protein was purified from the medium using streptavidin-agarose, followed by Western blotting as described above. Cell lysates were taken at fixed time points to investigate the fate of surface-biotinylated proteins by Western blotting as described above. α2-Macroglobulin, Versican, and Aggrecan Processing Assays—To determine whether purified ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His and ADAMTS7B were catalytically active, 5 μl of purified full-length ADAMTS7B or ADAMTS7PRO-CAT-Myc/His was incubated with 5 μg of α2-macroglobulin (Calbiochem) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the sample was electrophoresed without heating on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blotting with antibody 9E10 to visualize ADAMTS7B. In similar digests, Coomassie Blue staining was used after reducing SDS-PAGE to visualize α2-macroglobulin. Processing of specific ADAMTS-susceptible peptide bonds in versican and aggrecan was analyzed using transfected HEK293F cells essentially as described previously (13Somerville R.P. Longpré J.-M.

Briefly, ADAMTS7B-transfected and ADAMTS4-transfected (as a positive control) cells were incubated in suspension culture with versican and aggrecan. Subsequently, aggrecan and versican were precipitated from the medium, deglycosylated, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-neoepitope antibodies specific for the cleaved Glu1771–Ala1772 and Glu441–Ala442 peptide bonds of aggrecan and versican, respectively (13Somerville R.P.

https://openalex.org/W1986305196,"Modular glycoside hydrolases that attack recalcitrant polymers generally contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which play a critical role in the action of these enzymes by localizing the appended catalytic domains onto the surface of insoluble polysaccharide substrates. Type B CBMs, which recognize single polysaccharide chains, display ligand specificities that are consistent with the substrates hydrolyzed by the associated catalytic domains. In enzymes that contain multiple catalytic domains with distinct substrate specificities, it is unclear how these different activities influence the evolution of the ligand recognition profile of the appended CBM. To address this issue, we have characterized the properties of a family 11 CBM (CtCBM11) in Clostridium thermocellum Lic26A-Cel5E, an enzyme that contains GH5 and GH26 catalytic domains that display β-1,4- and β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked endoglucanase activity, respectively. Here we show that CtCBM11 binds to both β-1,4- and β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked glucans, displaying Ka values of 1.9 × 105, 4.4 × 104, and 2 × 103m-1 for Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc, Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc, and Glc-β1,3-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc, respectively, demonstrating that CBMs can display a preference for mixed linked glucans. To determine whether these ligands are accommodated in the same or diverse sites in CtCBM11, the crystal structure of the protein was solved to a resolution of 1.98 Å. The protein displays a β-sandwich with a concave side that forms a potential binding cleft. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Tyr22, Tyr53, and Tyr129, located in the putative binding cleft, play a central role in the recognition of all the ligands recognized by the protein. We propose, therefore, that CtCBM11 contains a single ligand-binding site that displays affinity for both β-1,4- and β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked glucans.

The major plant cell wall polysaccharides, cellulose and hemicellulose, are hydrolyzed into soluble sugars by a consortium of microbial enzymes. In nature, these enzyme systems play a major role in recycling plant cell wall fixed carbon and are therefore of considerable biological and biotechnological importance. In general, glycoside hydrolases (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. that catalyze plant cell wall degradation contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that interact with polysaccharides (1Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Szabo L. Xie H. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J. Jamal S. Boraston A.B. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A. Teeri T.T. Svensson B. Gilbert H.J. Feizi T. Carbohydrate Bioengineering: Interdisciplinary Approaches. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2001: 89-98Google Scholar). Based on primary structure similarity, CBMs have been grouped into 39 different families (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY) (2Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.H. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). By mediating an intimate and prolonged association of the enzyme with its target substrate, CBMs enhance the activity of the catalytic module against insoluble polysaccharides (3Gill J. Rixon J.E.

Therefore, CBMs play a major role in potentiating the capacity of cellulases and hemicellulases to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides. Structural studies have revealed that the topology of the ligand-binding site of CBMs varies. CBMs that interact with the flat surfaces of crystalline polysaccharides contain a planar hydrophobic carbohydrate-binding site and are referred to as Type A CBMs (5Kraulis J. Clore G.M. Nilges M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6993-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, CBMs that bind to single polysaccharide chains accommodate these ligands in extended clefts and are defined as Type B CBMs (9Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J.

Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Type B CBMs have been described that bind to a diversity of ligands, with some modules displaying plasticity in their capacity to accommodate heterogeneity in the sugar backbone in terms of both the identity of the saccharides and the nature of the linkage. Thus, polar residues in CBM29 are able to hydrogen bond to the axial O2 in mannose and the equatorial O2 in glucose, enabling the protein to bind cellulose, glucomannan, and mannan (13Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabo L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Some CBMs from families 4 and 6 display affinity for the β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked glucans (barley β-glucan and lichenan) and β-1,4 glucans such as amorphous cellulose and cellohexaose (14Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Bornet O. Zamboni V. Darbon H. Smith N.L. Black G.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14679-14685Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear whether these proteins interact exclusively with the β-1,4 regions of the mixed linked polysaccharide or display specificity for sequences of glucose units that are linked by a mixture of β-1,3- and β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. In general the ligand specificity of Type B CBMs reflects the substrate hydrolyzed by the associated catalytic modules (1Gilbert H.J. Bolam D.N. Szabo L. Xie H. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J. Jamal S. Boraston A.B. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A. Teeri T.T. Svensson B. Gilbert H.J. Feizi T. Carbohydrate Bioengineering: Interdisciplinary Approaches. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2001: 89-98Google Scholar). In enzymes that contain multiple catalytic domains with distinct substrate specificities, however, it is unclear how these different activities influence the evolution of the ligand recognition profile of the appended CBM. To investigate whether CBMs can display enhanced affinity for mixed linked glucans and to interrogate the evolutionary pressure exerted on the ligand specificity of CBMs in enzymes that contain distinct catalytic modules, we have studied the structure and function of the family 11 CBM (CtCBM11) in Clostridium thermocellum Lic26A-Cel5E (16Yague E. Beguin P. Aubert J.P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This enzyme contains GH5 and GH26 catalytic domains that display β-1,4 and β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked endoglucanase activity, respectively. Here we show that CtCBM11 does indeed display a preference for specific β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked glucans, although the protein is able to bind to β-1,4-glucose polymers. The three-dimensional structure of CtCBM11 in harness with mutagenesis studies reveals that the protein contains a single ligand-binding cleft that can accommodate both β-1,3–1,4- and β-1,4-linked glucans. Protein Expression and Purification—To express CtCBM11 in Escherichia coli, the region of the Lic26A-Cel5A gene (lic26A-cel5A) encoding the internal family 11 CBM was amplified from C. thermocellum YS genomic DNA using the thermostable DNA polymerase pFU Turbo (Stratagene). The primers used, 5′-CTCGCTAGCGCTGTCGGTGAAAAAATG-3′ and 5′-CACCTCGAGAGCACCAATCAGCTTGAT-3′, incorporated NheI and XhoI restriction sites, which are depicted in bold. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega) and sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during the polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant pGEM T-easy derivative was digested with NheI and XhoI, and the excised CtCBM11 encoding gene was cloned into the similarly restricted expression vector pET21a to generate pAG1. CtCBM11 encoded by pAG1 contains a C-terminal His6 tag. E. coli BL21 harboring pAG1 was cultured in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A550 = 0.6), at which point isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for a further 5 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in a 50 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. For biochemical assays, recombinant CtCBM11 was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described previously (17Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Sources of Sugars Used—All soluble polysaccharides were purchased from Megazyme International, except oat spelt xylan and hydroxyethylcellulose, which were obtained from Sigma. Cello-oligosaccharides were from Seikagaku Corp. Avicel (PH101) was obtained from Serva, whereas acid-swollen cellulose was prepared as described previously (18Wood T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 160: 19-25Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The mixed linked gluco-oligosaccharides Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc and Glc-β1,3-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc were synthesized by the method of Faijes et al. (19Faijes M. Perez X. Perez O. Planas A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13304-13318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Affinity Gel Electrophoresis—The affinity of CtCBM11 for a range of soluble polysaccharides was determined by affinity gel electrophoresis. The method was essentially as described by Tomme et al. (20Tomme P. Boraston A. Kormos J.M. Warren A.J. Kilburn D.G. Enz. Microb. Technol. 2000; 27: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using the polysaccharide ligands at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v). Electrophoresis was carried out for 4 h in native polyacrylamide gels containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide. The nonbinding negative control was bovine serum albumin. Quantitative assessment of binding was carried out as described previously (21Takeo K. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 187-195Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding to Insoluble Polysaccharides—Qualitative assessment of CtCBM11 binding to Avicel and acid-swollen cellulose was carried out as follows: 30 μg of protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2 (Buffer A) were mixed with 1 mg of ligand in a final reaction volume of 200 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking, after which time the insoluble ligand was precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, comprising the unbound fraction, was removed, and the pellet was washed three times with 200 μl of Buffer A. The bound protein was eluted by boiling the polysaccharides in 200 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS containing 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 14% acrylamide gel. Controls containing protein but no polysaccharide were performed in parallel to ensure that no precipitation occurred. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were made at 25 °C for all ligands except lichenan, which was also measured at 60 °C to determine the ΔCp, following standard procedures (22Bolam D.N. Xie H. Pell G. Hogg D. Galbraith G. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22953-22963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. The proteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the ligand was dissolved in the same buffer to minimize heats of dilution. During a titration experiment the protein sample stirred at 300 rpm in a 1.4331-ml reaction cell was injected with 30 successive 10-μl aliquots of polysaccharide (1.5–5 mg ml-1) or oligosaccharide (1–10 mm) ligand at 200-s intervals. The molar concentration of CtCBM11-binding sites present in the polysaccharide ligands was determined as described previously (11Szabo L. Jamal S. Xie H. Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49061-49065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a single-site binding model (Microcal Origin, version 5.0). The fitted data yield the association constant (Ka), number of binding sites on the protein (n), and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation -RTln KA = ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Titrations were carried out in triplicate for most ligands, and the errors are the S.D. of the means of these replicates. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants of CtCBM11 were generated using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used to generate these mutants were as follows: TGGGGTTCAGCCTCCGGTGAAGGTGC and TGCACCTTCACCGGAGGCTGAACCCCA, Y22A; GGGACAACGGACGGCGCCTGGGGAACAGTATAC and GTATACTGTTCCCCAGGCGCCGTCCGTTGTCCC, Y53A; AGACTTGATGCTCAGCCGCCTGGACAG and CTGTCCAGGCGGCTGAGCATCAAGTCT, Y129A; and CAATTCACTTCATGGCTGCCAACAACAAGTCG and CGACTTGTTGTTGGCAGCCATGAAGTGAATTG, Y152A. The mutated DNA sequences were sequenced by MWG (Germany) to ensure that only the appropriate mutations had been incorporated into the nucleic acid. Production and Purification of Seleno-l-methionine Containing CtCBM11—The methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 (DE3), transformed with pAG1, was cultured at 37 °C in 1 liter of culture medium as described by Charnock et al. (9Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Expression of CtCBM11 was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when cells were at mid-exponential growth phase. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for a further 16 h, after which time they were collected, and the recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography as described above. For crystallization trials, gel filtration was included as a further purification step. The enzyme was buffer exchanged, using a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 M gel filtration columns (Amersham Biosciences), into 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl (Buffer A), concentrated to 20 mg/ml with Amicon 10-kDa molecular mass centrifugation membranes and subjected to gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) with protein eluted at 1 ml/min in Buffer A. Purified enzyme was concentrated, as described before and washed three times with 5 mm dithiothreitol using the same centrifugal membranes, and the final protein concentration was adjusted to 50 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of seleno-l-methionine-containing protein were grown by vapor phase diffusion using the hanging drop method with an equal volume (1 μl) of protein (50 mg/ml in water) and reservoir solution (20–24% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate). Crystals grew over a period of 3 days and were harvested in a buffer containing 30–35% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using 30% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant added to the harvesting solution. A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data set of one selenomethionine derivative crystal was collected on Beamline BM30 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The crystal was maintained at 110 K by using a nitrogen cryostream. The CtCBM11 crystal belonged to space group P21212 with cell constants a = 75.1 Å, b = 50.9 Å, and c = 40.9 Å, which corresponds to a calculated Matthews coefficient of 2.0 Å3 Da-1 and a solvent content of 36.5%. The data were processed with the HKL package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

This resulted in phases to 1.98 Å with a figure of merit of 0.62, which were further improved by solvent flattening with DM (25Cowtan K.

Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) generated a model with R = 37.4%. This initial model consisted of 163 of a total of 178 amino acid residues and did not include the CtCBM11 primary sequence. Iterative model building with TURBO (27Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO: Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar), together with refinement in REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and incorporation of the CtCBM11 primary sequence, resulted in a final model with R = 19.3% (Rfree = 23.2%). This final model includes 170 amino acid residues (five of which are selenomethionines), two calcium ions, two sulfate, and 182 water molecules. Residues Asp79, Gly80, and Ser81, belonging to a disordered loop, were not included in the final model, as well as Se-Met1 and Ala2 of the N terminus and three histidine residues of the C terminus, part of the His tag. Ligand Specificity of CtCBM11—The family 11 CBM of endoglucanase F of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 was previously shown to bind Avicel (29Malburg S.R.C. Malburg L.M. Liu T. Iyo A.H. Forsberg C.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2449-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was based on this observation that members of this family were classified as CBMs. To characterize the ligand binding specificity of CtCBM11, the protein module was expressed as a discrete entity in E. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The affinity of CtCBM11 for barley β-glucan, lichenan, glucomannan, and hydroxyethyl cellulose, and oat spelled xylan was determined by quantitative affinity gel electrophoresis. The data showed that CtCBM11 displays the highest affinity for β-1,3–1,4-glucans while exhibiting significantly weaker binding to hydroxyethyl cellulose, glucomannan and oat spelled xylan (see Table III). CtCBM11 did not associate with arabinan, galactomannan, laminarin, rhamnogalacturan, glucuronoxylan, or rye-arabinoxylan.Table IIIBinding of wild type CtCBM11 and its mutant derivatives to soluble polysaccharides quantified by affinity gel electrophoresisLigandKaaThe values are given as the ligand concentration (% w/v)Wild typeY22AY53AY129AY152Aβ-Glucan1194.915.574.256.21080.4Lichenan701.69.789.168.1690.1Hydroxyethyl cellulose24.4NBbNB, Ka below 2NBNB53.6Glucomannan25.9NBNBNB20.4Oat spelt xylan17.5NBNBNBNDcND, not determineda The values are given as the ligand concentration (% w/v)b NB, Ka below 2c ND, not determined Open table in a new tab To explore the ligand specificity of CtCBM11 in more detail, the binding of the protein to polysaccharides and oligosaccharides was evaluated using ITC. Example titrations, displayed in Fig. 1, reveal sigmoidal titration curves for β-1,3–1,4- and β-1,4-gluco-oligosaccharides as well as the mixed linked polysaccharides barley β-glucan and lichenan, enabling the Ka, ΔH, and stoichiometry of binding to be accurately determined for these ligands (Table II). The data show that CtCBM11 displays similar affinity for cellohexaose, cellopentaose, and cellotetraose. Although the protein retains significant affinity for cellotriose (Ka = 1.6 × 104), binding to cellobiose is too weak to accurately quantify by ITC (∼1.3 × 103). These data suggest that CtCBM11 contains at least four sugar-binding sites, which is consistent with the ligands accommodated by other Type B CBMs. Interestingly, the protein displays ∼4-fold higher affinity for the two β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked glucan polymers, indicating that the CBM displays a preference for a β-1,3-linked glucose in at least one sugar-binding site. To investigate this bond preference in more detail, the capacity of CtCBM11 to bind a range of oligosaccharides was assessed. The protein displayed no significant affinity for laminohexaose, a β-1,3-linked oligosaccharide of glucose, indicating that not all the sugar-binding sites in the CBM can accommodate β-1,3-linked glucose residues (data not shown). CtCBM11, however, bound to the mixed linkage tetraoligosaccharide Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc approximately four times more tightly than cellotetraose, supporting the view that the protein displays a preference for a β-1,3-linked glucose in at least one subsite. A second mixed linkage glucotetraoligosaccharide, Glc-β1,3-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc, bound only weakly to CtCBM11 (Ka = ∼2 × 103; affinity too low to accurately quantify by ITC), suggesting that the protein may only be able to accommodate a single β-1,3-linked glucose. The ligand specificity of CtCBM11 is consistent with the observation that natural glucose polymers containing mixed linkages of β1,4- and β1,3-glycosidic bonds, do not have the alternating substructure of Glc-β1,3-Glc-β1,4. Indeed lichenan and cereal β-glucans contain ∼2.3–3 β1,4 bonds for every β1,3 linkage, with fine structures comprising Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc, Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc, and even Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,4-Glc-β1,3-Glc that are linked by β1,4 bonds. Thus, the lack of specificity for alternating Glc-β1,3-Glc-β1,4-linkages is consistent with their absence from the target polysaccharides, of mixed linked β-glucans. The binding of CtCBM11 to its ligands is associated with negative enthalpy and entropy. The thermodynamics of the interaction of CtCBM11 with glucose polymers is typical of the binding of proteins to soluble saccharides, which is invariably enthalpically driven, with an unfavorable entropic contribution. The heat capacity of CtCBM11 for lichenan revealed a value of -74 cal mol-1 K-1. Negative values for ΔCp are often associated with the burial of significant apolar surfaces upon ligand binding. This is entirely consistent with the important role aromatic amino acids play in the interaction of CtCBM11 with all its ligands (Table III and see below).Table IIQuantitative assessment of CtCBM11 binding to oligosaccharides and polysaccharides as determined by ITCLigandTemperatureKa × 104ΔGΔHTΔSnan is the number of binding sites on the proteinKm-1kcal mol-1kcal mol-1kcal mol-1Lichenan298.1530.1 ± 0.4bThe values are given with the standard deviations of replicate titrations–7.5 ± 0.1–10.4 ± 0.2–2.9 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.0Lichenan333.155.3 ± 0.1–7.2 ± 0.0–13.0 ± 0.0–5.8 ± 0.01.1 ± 0.0β-Glucan298.1527.1 ± 0.5–7.4 ± 0.1–11.2 ± 0.3–3.8 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.0Cellohexaose298.157.8 ± 0.1–6.6 ± 0.0–9.5 ± 0.2–2.9 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.0Cellopentaose298.155.9 ± 0.3–6.5 ± 0.0–8.7 ± 0.3–2.2 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.0Cellotetraose298.154.4 ± 0.8–6.3 ± 0.1–9.8 ± 0.1–3.5 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.0G4G4G3GcMixed linkage glucotetraoligosaccharide: Glc-β-1,4-Glc-β-1,4-Glc-β-1,3-Glc298.1519.2 ± 1.5–7.2 ± 0.1–10.2 ± 0.1–3.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.0a n is the number of binding sites on the proteinb The values are given with the standard deviations of replicate titrationsc Mixed linkage glucotetraoligosaccharide: Glc-β-1,4-Glc-β-1,4-Glc-β-1,3-Glc Open table in a new tab The ligand specificity of CtCBM11 mirrors the substrate specificity of the cognate enzyme Lic26A-Cel5E, which displays both β-1,3–1,4-mixed linked and β-1,4-linked endoglucanase activity, mediated by the Lic26A and Cel5E catalytic modules, respectively. 2H.

Therefore, interpreting the properties of CtCBM11 exclusively within the context of the activities displayed by Lic26A-Cel5E may be naive, because the ligands accommodated by the module may potentiate glycosidic bond cleavage by other enzymes within the complex that display substrate specificities similar to Lic26A and Cel5E.

https://openalex.org/W2015882117,"Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1 or NR5A1), is a Ftz-F1 member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that plays essential roles in endocrine development, steroidogenesis, and gonad differentiation. We investigated modifications that control SF-1 function and found that SF-1 could be conjugated by SUMO-1 both in vitro and in vivo. SF-1 was modified predominantly at Lys194 and much less at Lys119 when free SUMO-1 was supplied. Mutations of Lys194 and Lys119 enhanced transcriptional activity of SF-1, although the DNA binding activity of SF-1 was not affected. Sequences around Lys194 and Lys119 both repressed transcription intrinsically. The Lys194 motif repressed transcription more efficiently than the Lys119 domain, consistent with its ability to be a better substrate for SUMO conjugation. Thus, SUMO modification of SF-1 correlates with transcriptional repression. Wild-type but not conjugation-deficient SF-1 was localized at the nuclear speckles together with SUMO-1. Thus, SUMO-1 conjugation could also target SF-1 into nuclear speckles. Collectively, these results suggest that SUMO modification at the repression domains targets SF-1 to nuclear speckles; this could be an important mechanism by which SF-1 is regulated.

In mice, it is expressed in the pituitary, hypothalamus, gonads, and adrenal glands, contributing to their development and differentiation (2Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar); in zebrafish, SF-1 also plays a role in the development of interrenal glands (3Hsu H.J. Lin G. Chung B.C. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SF-1 regulates the expression of steroidogenic genes such as CYP11A1, CYP19, Müllerian inhibitory substance, and α- and β-subunit of gonadotropins (2Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 4Hu M.C. Guo I.C. Lin J.H. Chung B.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, SF-1 possesses the ability to direct cultured embryonic stem cells toward to the steroidogenic cell lineage (5Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Due to its functional importance, the transcriptional regulation of SF-1 is of considerable interest. SF-1 contains an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain. The C-terminal region of its DNA-binding domain is a conserved 30-amino acid basic Ftz-F1 (Fushi-tarazu factor 1) box shared by all members of the NR5 (FTZ-F1) subfamily (6Ueda H. Sun G.C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Luo X. Ikeda Y. Schlosser D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1233-1239PubMed Google Scholar). An FP domain (aa 78-172), including the Ftz-F1 box and a proline-rich sequence, contains a nuclear localization signal and interacting regions for TFIIB and c-Jun and is important for the transactivation function of SF-1 (8Li L.A. Chiang E.F. Chen J.C. Hsu N.C. Chen Y.J. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Unlike other nuclear receptors, SF-1 lacks the N-terminal A/B region, which usually contains the ligand-independent transactivation AF-1 domain. Amino acids 180-265 in the hinge region of SF-1 may function as AF-1. In this domain, the single serine residue (Ser203) is phosphorylated and required for activation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (9Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of SF-1 at Ser203 does not respond to adrenocorticotropin and gonadotropin signals. The functional significance of this putative AF-1 domain remains unclear. Another activation domain, AF-2, is located at the C terminus of SF-1; this domain interacts with transcription co-activators such as steroid receptor co-activator 1 (10Ito M. Yu R.N. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (9Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L.

Lund J. Mellgren G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 757-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, SUMO-1 (also known as Pic1, Ubl1, hSmt3, and sentrin) conjugation (sumoylation) has been reported to play an important role in many cellular processes (12Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Sumoylation resembles ubiquitination, but the enzymes involved in these two processes are distinct. During sumoylation, four C-terminal amino acids of the precursor of SUMO-1 are removed to expose the conjugation site to the E1 activating enzyme. Subsequently, the activated SUMO-1 is transferred to the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9. Although E1 and E2 enzymes are sufficient to trigger sumoylation in vitro, SUMO-1 is conjugated to target proteins by E3 ligase in vivo. Analysis of sumoylated proteins has revealed that SUMO-1 is conjugated to substrate at the consensus sequence ψKXE (ψ is any hydrophobic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). Protein sumoylation has been reported to participate in protein targeting (13Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), and protein-protein interaction (16Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C.

A growing number of transcription factors have been found to be sumoylated, such as androgen receptor (18Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), ELK-1 (19Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but the outcome of transcription factor sumoylation is still not fully understood. In the present report, we show that SF-1 is sumoylated at Lys119 and Lys194. Mutations of sumoylation sites enhance the transcriptional activity of SF-1 but do not affect the DNA binding affinity of SF-1. The sumoylation sites of SF-1 function as intrinsic repression domains. Moreover, overexpression of SUMO-1 directs wild-type (WT) SF-1, but not sumoylation-deficient SF-1 mutant, to nuclear speckles. These results indicate that sumoylation at repression domains is an important posttranslational modification for the transcriptional activity of SF-1. Plasmids, Recombinant Proteins, and Antibody—The following constructs have been described previously: pcDNA3.1-SF-1-HA (21Monte D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4585-4591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), pGEX-TFIIB (8Li L.A. Chiang E.F. Chen J.C. Hsu N.C. Chen Y.J. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and pS2.3H-Luc (22Suzuki T. Kasahara M. Yoshioka H. Morohashi K.-i. Umesono K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Plasmids pCMV-tag2c-SUMO-1 and 5xGAL4-E1B-Luc were generously provided by Dr. H. M. Shih (National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan) and Dr. Y. S. Lin (Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan), respectively. SAE1/SAE2 (E1-activating enzyme), His-UBC9 (E2-conjugating enzyme), and His-SUMO-1 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Hwang (Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan). SF-1 mutants (K119R, K194R, and K119R/K194R) were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis in pcDNA3-SF-1-HA. SUMO-1 (aa 1-97) expression plasmids pEGFP-SUMO-1 WT, pEYFP-SUMO-1, and pD-sRed2-SUMO-1 WT were generated after PCR amplification from pCMV-tag2c-SUMO-1. To generate conjugation-deficient SUMO-1, the last Gly (the 97th Gly residue) or the last two Gly residues (the 96th and 97th Gly residues) were mutated to Ala by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to construct pEGFP-SUMO-1 GA or pDsRed2-SUMO-1 AA, respectively. The recombinant proteins GST-UBC9, GST-TFIIB, and SF-1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys and purified as described previously (23Hu M.C. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Anti-SF-1 antiserum was raised against full-length SF-1 in rabbit; protein overexpression, purification, and immunization procedures were performed as described previously (4Hu M.C. Guo I.C. Lin J.H. Chung B.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rat anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Transcriptional Activity Assay—For transfection into NIH-3T3 or Y1 cells in 24-well culture plates, 100 ng of SF-1 expression plasmid was co-transfected with 100 ng of pS2.3H-Luc or 5xGAL4-E1B-Luc, respectively. Luciferase activities were assayed 24 h after transfection. The firefly luciferase activities were normalized with Renilla luciferase activities from phRLuc, used as an internal control. The results are the average of three independent transfection experiments, with error bars representing standard deviations. In Vitro Protein Binding Assay—In vitro GST pull-down assays to measure protein binding were performed as described previously (8Li L.A. Chiang E.F. Chen J.C. Hsu N.C. Chen Y.J. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, in vitro transcribed/translated SF-1-FH(S) fragment or full-length SF-1 was incubated with 1 μg of purified GST, GST-UBC9, or GST-TFIIB in NENT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl). The protein complexes were then incubated with glutathione-coated beads. After extensive washing, the samples were separated by 12% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. In Vitro and in Vivo Sumoylation Assay—The substrate proteins, luciferase and SF-1-HA, were in vitro transcribed/translated to generate radiolabeled proteins. Two microliters of in vitro translation products were added to sumoylation buffer (4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) containing 100 ng of SAE1/SAE2 and 1 μg of His-SUMO-1 in the presence or absence of 1 μg of His-UBC9 at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction samples were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography for 24 h. To examine SF-1 sumoylation in cells, SF-1-HA was co-expressed with SUMO-1 in 293T cells as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide. Whole cell extracts were prepared in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture) containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. The anti-HA immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was analyzed by anti-HA immunoblotting, stripped, and then re-blotted with anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and visualized by chemiluminescence detection. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (24Guo I.C. Tsai H.M. Chung B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. SF-1-containing samples were prepared from in vitro synthesis/sumoylated assay without [35S]methionine and incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the SF-1 binding sequence on ice for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were separated by 5% native acrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. The intensity of each band was quantified using Image Gauge Version 3.2 software with a FujiFilm LAS-1000plus image reader. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Y1 cells were cultured on coverslips at a density of 1× 104 cells/well in 6-well plates. Expression plasmids were transfected into cells as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline (PBST), and blocked in 2% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, the cells were immunostained with an anti-SF-1 antiserum (1:100) in blocking buffer at 4 °C for 16 h. The cells were washed with PBST and stained with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBST and stained with 10 mg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 15 min. After three extensive washes, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides in 50% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescent cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. SF-1 Is Sumoylated in Vitro and in Vivo—To understand the components that regulate SF-1 action, we searched for SF-1-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening using the FH(S) fragment (aa 78-213) of SF-1 as bait. During this screening, UBC9 was identified as one of the many proteins that interacted with SF-1 (data not shown). An in vitro protein binding assay further confirmed this interaction (Fig. 1). Both the SF-1-FH(S) fragment and full-length SF-1 interacted with UBC9. SF-1-FH(S) and SF-1 also interacted with TFIIB (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 5), as demonstrated previously (8Li L.A. Chiang E.F. Chen J.C. Hsu N.C. Chen Y.J. Chung B.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1588-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They did not interact with GST (Fig. 1, lane 2), which was used as a negative control. The addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a proposed ligand for SF-1, did not affect the interaction between SF-1 and UBC9 (Fig. 1, lane 4). Because UBC9 is the single E2-conjugating enzyme for SUMO-1, and many sumoylation substrates interact with UBC9 (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), this result led us to investigate SF-1 conjugation by SUMO-1. To determine whether SF-1 can be conjugated by SUMO-1, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled SF-1-HA was incubated with SUMO-1 and the E1-activating enzyme in the presence or absence of UBC9. Luciferase (Fig. 2A, Luc), a negative control, was not modified, regardless of matter whether UBC9 was present or absent (lanes 1 and 2). Whereas SF-1 remained unmodified in the absence of UBC9 (Fig. 2A, lane 3), in the presence of UBC9 two slow-migrating bands of 73 and 90 kDa appeared in addition to SF-1-HA (lane 4). The slow-migrating bands indicated the presence of SUMO-1-conjugated SF-1. This result indicated that SF-1 was modified by SUMO-1 in vitro. To examine SUMO-1 conjugation of SF-1 in cells, SF-1-HA was co-expressed with GFP- or YFP-tagged SUMO-1 in 293T cells. After immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, the presence of SF-1-HA was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B, top panel). In the absence of SF-1-HA transfection, no band was detected, indicating the specificity of the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). The SF-1-HA band appeared when it was co-transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas an additional slow-migrating band besides SF-1-HA was detected in the presence of GFP- or YFP-tagged wild-type SUMO-1 (lanes 4 and 6). These slow-migrating bands were further confirmed as SUMO-SF-1 by anti-SUMO-1 immunoblotting (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). To verify the involvement of SUMO-1, Gly to Ala mutation was performed at the 97th Gly residue of SUMO-1, which is essential for the ability of SUMO-1 to conjugate to substrates (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). When the resulting GFP-SUMO-1 GA mutant was co-transfected instead of wild-type GFP-SUMO-1, no additional band was detected (Fig. 2B, lane 5). This indicated the specificity of SUMO-1 conjugation. Unlike the in vitro assay, only one slow-migrating band of SF-1 was detected in the in vivo analysis. These results indicated that although SF-1 can be conjugated by two SUMO-1 molecules in vitro, it is probably sumoylated at only one site in vivo. To map the site of SUMO conjugation, we analyzed SF-1 for the consensus sumoylation ψKXE sequence and found Lys119 in the sequence of FKLE and Lys194 in the sequence of IKSE of SF-1 to be potential sumoylation sites (Fig. 2C). To determine whether these two sites are indeed SUMO-conjugated, Lys to Arg mutagenesis was carried out at both sites to generate the K119R, K194R, and K119R/K194R mutants. The mutants were analyzed using both in vitro and in vivo sumoylation assays. In vitro sumoylation reactions revealed that whereas two slow-migrating SUMO-SF-1 bands were detected in the presence of wild-type SF-1 (Fig. 2D, lane 2), only one additional band was detected with K119R (lane 3), and no extra band besides the SF-1-HA band was visible in the presence of K194R and K119R/K194R (lanes 4 and 5). The absence of modification in the K194R mutant indicated that Lys194 of SF-1 is a major conjugation site. In the absence of SUMO-conjugated Lys194, Lys119 can not be conjugated. Therefore, Lys119 is a minor conjugation site, which may depend on prior conjugation at Lys194in vitro. Analysis of these mutants in 293T cells also revealed similar results, except that Lys119 was not used for SUMO conjugation in vivo (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results showed that SF-1 is sumoylated predominantly at Lys194in vitro and in vivo. Sumoylation Sites of SF-1 Are Intrinsic Repression Domains—To determine the effect of sumoylation on SF-1, we first checked whether sumoylation affects SF-1 DNA binding activity. WT and mutated SF-1-HA (K119R, K194R, and K119R/K194R) were synthesized and SUMO-conjugated in vitro before being subjected to DNA binding and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As calculated from the anti-HA immunoblot, about 70% of wild-type SF-1-HA and the K119R protein were modified in vitro (Fig. 3, top panel, lanes 4 and 6). However, the intensities of the DNA-protein complexes of sumoylated and non-sumoylated SF-1 were similar (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Therefore, sumoylation does not appear to affect the DNA binding activity of SF-1. To examine the effect of SUMO conjugation on SF-1 transcriptional activity, wild-type or sumoylation-deficient SF-1 mutants were co-transfected with a SF-1-dependent reporter gene in NIH-3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, wild-type SF-1 activated the expression of the reporter; however, all of the sumoylation-deficient mutants (K119R, K194R, and K119R/K194R) were even more active. Because SF-1 is not endogenous to NIH-3T3 cells, we examined the activity of mutant SF-1 in a physiologically relevant cell line, Y1. Because Y1 expresses abundant SF-1, to avoid interference of endogenous SF-1, we examined the ability of exogenous GAL4-SF-1 fusion proteins (GAL4-DBD fused to aa 110-462 from wild-type or sumoylation-deficient SF-1) to activate a GAL4-dependent reporter gene (Fig. 4B). The activity of wild-type GAL4-SF-1 (Fig. 4B, WT) was very low in Y1 cells. The activities of all the GAL4-SF-1 mutants were enhanced, and the K119R, K194R, and K119R/K194R mutants had activities 2-, 39-, and 12-fold greater than the WT activity, respectively. These results indicated that the regions surrounding Lys119 and Lys194 function as repression domains for SF-1. To investigate the SF-1 repression activity around its SUMO conjugation sequences, we inserted peptides with either wild-type or mutant sequences centered around Lys119 or Lys194 sites of SF-1 into a transcriptional activator composed of a DNA-binding domain from GAL4 and an activation domain from VP16 (Fig. 4C, left panel). The resulting P-119WT and P-194WT plasmids encoded proteins with the wild-type Lys119 and Lys194 motifs, respectively, whereas P-119R and P-194R contained the mutated sequences. After transfection, P-119WT and P-194WT repressed reporter gene expression by 15% and 48%, respectively (Fig. 4C, right panel). This repression was statistically significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, P-119R and P-194R had the same activity as the control. Thus, the mutants lost the ability to repress transcription. This result indicated that both Lys194 and Lys119 lie in intrinsic repression domains, and the repression domain at Lys194 is stronger than that at Lys119. SF-1 Is Co-localized with SUMO-1 in Nuclear Speckles—SUMO-1 conjugation affects the localization of some substrate proteins (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). To study whether sumoylation regulates the localization of SF-1, GFP-tagged SF-1 and RFP-tagged SUMO-1 were co-expressed in Y1 cells. Consistent with other reports, wild-type RFP-SUMO-1 formed many nuclear speckles in transfected cells (Fig. 5A). In about 60% of transfected cells, wild-type SF-1-GFP was located in nuclear speckles in the presence of wild-type SUMO-1 (Fig. 5A, top panels). In contrast to wild-type SUMO-1, the conjugation-deficient SUMO-1 mutant, RFP-SUMO-1 AA, did not form nuclear speckles, and the co-expressed SF-1 was found homogenously in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, middle panels). To ascertain that localization of SF-1 to the nuclear speckles is due to SUMO-1 conjugation, the SF-1 mutant K194R, which cannot be conjugated, was co-expressed with wild-type RFP-SUMO-1. This SF-1-GFP K194R was homogenously distributed in the nucleus of all examined transfected cells, whereas the co-transfected SUMO-1 still formed nuclear speckles (Fig. 5A, bottom panels). Thus, the lack of SUMO-1 conjugation renders SF-1-GFP unable to go into nuclear speckles. These data indicate that targeting of SF-1-GFP into nuclear speckles by SUMO-1 requires intact conjugation sites in both SUMO-1 and SF-1-GFP. Because the localization of exogenous SF-1-GFP is affected by SUMO-1 conjugation, we next examined whether the localization of endogenous SF-1 was also affected by SUMO-1. We transfected YFP-SUMO-1 into Y1 cells and then examined the location of SF-1 by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B). In some cells that expressed YFP-SUMO-1, nuclear speckles formed, and endogenous SF-1 was localized in these speckles (Fig. 5B, arrows). When YFP-SUMO-1 was absent, SF-1 was evenly distributed in the nucleus (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that overexpression of SUMO-1 can direct SF-1 to nuclear speckles formed by SUMO-1. In this report, we demonstrate that SF-1 is modified by SUMO-1 in vitro and in vivo. We detect two SUMO conjugation sites, Lys119 and Lys194, in SF-1. SUMO conjugation does not affect the DNA binding activity of SF-1 but is associated with transcriptional repression. In addition, SUMO-1 conjugation modulates the localization of SF-1 in the nucleus. These results suggest that SUMO modification at the repression domains is an important posttranslational regulation of SF-1 activity. SF-1 is Modified by SUMO-1—We investigated SF-1 sumoylation because SF-1 interacts with UBC9, and many UBC9-interacting proteins are sumoylated (12Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that SF-1 interacts with E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 in vitro and is a substrate for sumoylation in vitro and in vivo. The potential sumoylation sites in SF-1 are located at Lys119 and Lys194. Our data showed that Lys194 was efficiently conjugated by SUMO-1 in vitro and that Lys119 was poorly conjugated by SUMO-1 in vitro (Fig. 2D). In vivo, only Lys194 was sumoylated (Fig. 2E). This indicates that Lys119 is inefficiently sumoylated, although its sequence matches sumoylation consensus well. This suggests that regulation of SUMO conjugation depends on many factors in addition to pure substrate recognition. The large difference in the sumoylation efficiency of Lys194 and Lys119 could be of relevant importance to physiological condition. Similar results were also observed with c-Myb, which is also unequally sumoylated at two different sites (26Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielsen O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sumoylation Sites Are Intrinsic Repression Domains—The single SF-1 sumoylation site of Lys194 can repress transcription more efficiently than Lys119 (Fig. 4C). In our experiments, mutation of Lys194 enhanced the transcriptional activity of full-length SF-1 by 2-fold and of GAL4-SF-1 by 39-fold. Mutation of Lys119 also enhanced the transcriptional activity of SF-1, although at a much reduced level. One would expect that the K119R/K194R mutant would have an even higher activity than that of the single mutants, K119R and K194R, but our data showed that the activities of the double mutant were between those of the single mutants (Fig. 4, A and B). We do not know how to explain this because the mechanism of this repression is still unclear. The Lys194 sequence directly interacts with a DEAD box-containing protein, DP103, which represses the activity of SF-1 (27Ou Q. Mouillet J.F. Yan X. Dorn C. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to find out whether sumoylation of Lys194 is related to DP103 interaction or to recruitment of other co-repressor proteins. Furthermore, this SUMO conjugation motif also overlaps with the synergistic control motif, which has been suggested to modulate higher-order interactions among transcriptional regulators (28Subramanian L. Benson M.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9134-9141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These observations reveal that Lys194 could be an important and highly regulated domain involved in interactions among transcriptional regulators. SF-1 Is Localized to SUMO-1-formed Nuclear Speckles—It has been proposed that SUMO-1 conjugation targets proteins to different cellular localizations. For example, sumoylation directs RanGAP1 from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane (14Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 modification of promyelocytic leukemia and p53 also directs them into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (20Kwek S.S. Derry J. Tyner A.L. Shen Z. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Besides this, SUMO-1-conjugated homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 is concentrated in nuclear speckles, which are distinct from promyelocytic leukemia bodies (30Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Like most transcription factors, SF-1 is evenly distributed in the nucleus. Both endogenous and exogenous SF-1 can be directed into nuclear speckles in the presence of SUMO-1, but not in the presence of conjugation-deficient SUMO-1. The SF-1 SUMO conjugation-deficient mutant also cannot be directed into nuclear speckles (Fig. 5A). This re-localization of SF-1 may be associated with transcriptional repression. Therefore, we propose that sequestration of SF-1 from the nucleoplasm might be a mechanism regulating the transcriptional activity of SF-1. Based on our data, SUMO conjugation sites of SF-1 are transcriptional repression domains. Repression could be achieved by two separate means: (a) directly, probably through recruitment of co-repressor proteins to the transcriptional activation complex and/or disruption of the transcriptional activation complex; and (b) through the sequestration of SF-1 to nuclear speckles, thus removing it from transcriptionally active sites. Both possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and more experiments are needed to test these possibilities. Note Added in Proof—After this manuscript was accepted, there was one paper that appeared online that also showed SUMO conjugation of SF-1 (31Komatsu T. Mizusaki H. Mukai T. Ogawa H. Baba D.

The antigen 85 proteins (85A, 85B, and 85C) of M. tuberculosis help maintain the integrity of the cell wall 1) by catalyzing the transfer of mycolic acids to the cell wall arabinogalactan and 2) through the synthesis of trehalose dimycolate (cord factor). Additionally, these secreted proteins allow for rapid invasion of alveolar macrophages via direct interactions between the host immune system and the invading bacillus. Here we describe two crystal structures: the structure of antigen 85C co-crystallized with octylthioglucoside as substrate, resolved to 2.0 Å, and the crystal structure of antigen 85A, which was solved at a resolution of 2.7 Å. The structure of 85C with the substrate analog identifies residues directly involved in substrate binding. Elucidation of the antigen 85A structure, the last of the three antigen 85 homologs to be solved, shows that the active sites of the three antigen 85 proteins are virtually identical, indicating that these share the same substrate. However, in contrast to the high level of conservation within the substrate-binding site and the active site, surface residues disparate from the active site are quite variable, indicating that three antigen 85 enzymes are needed to evade the host immune system.

However, in contrast to the high level of conservation within the substrate-binding site and the active site, surface residues disparate from the active site are quite variable, indicating that three antigen 85 enzymes are needed to evade the host immune system. The antigen 85 proteins (85A, 85B, and 85C) from Mycobacteria are homologous proteins that share very high sequence identity (68–79%, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis). These secreted enzymes were shown to possess a mycolyltransferase activity that is pivotal for the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall and for the survival of mycobacteria (1Belisle J.T. Vissa V.D. Sievert T. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Science. 1997; 276: 1420-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis identified a carboxylesterase consensus sequence (GX-SXG), and mutation of the central serine to an alanine residue resulted in a loss of enzymatic function (1Belisle J.T. Vissa V.D. Sievert T. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Science. 1997; 276: 1420-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Subsequent x-ray crystallographic studies identified the fold of the enzyme resulting in placement of the antigen 85 proteins within the group of α/β hydrolases (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the antigen 85 proteins into this family confirmed the importance of the consensus sequence, because numerous mechanistic and structural studies of α/β hydrolases have implicated a conserved pentapeptide containing serine as the initiating nucleophile in a hydrolytic attack on the enzyme substrate. Extension of this from a hydrolytic to a transfer mechanism, in the case of antigen 85, is rather straightforward (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Whereas a hydrolytic mechanism would utilize a water molecule to hydrolyze the bond between the enzyme and the acyl chain, the transfer mechanism of the antigen 85 enzymes likely uses a hydroxyl group of a terminal arabinose on the mycobacterial cell wall. Targeted inhibition of the antigen 85 proteins in vivo in Mycobacterium aurum using a substrate analog, ADT, 1The abbreviations used are: ADT, 6-azido-6-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose; OSG, octylthioglucoside; MR, molecular replacement.1The abbreviations used are: ADT, 6-azido-6-deoxy-α,α′-trehalose; OSG, octylthioglucoside; MR, molecular replacement. showed a decrease in the level of production of trehalose monomycolate, trehalose dimycolate, and cell wall linked mycolic acids (1Belisle J.T. Vissa V.D. Sievert T. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Science. 1997; 276: 1420-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In a different study, an antigen 85C knockout strain of M. tuberculosis showed a 40% decrease in the amount of cell wall linked mycolic acid, whereas the ratio between the three types of mycolic acid (α-, methoxy-, and ketomycolates) bound covalently to the M. tuberculosis cell wall is the same as that found in the parent (H37Rv) strain (3Jackson M. Raynaud C. Laneelle M.A. Guilhot C. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This study also showed that knockouts of 85A and 85B resulted in no noticeable effect on the amount of cell wall attached mycolic acids, indicating that antigens 85A and 85B have minimal roles in mycobacterial survival or that 85C could compensate for the loss of 85A and 85B. In contrast, a subsequent study confirmed the importance of the antigen 85A and 85B proteins by showing that they are indeed directly involved in the covalent attachment of mycolic acids to the mycobacterial cell wall (4Puech V. Guilhot C. Perez E. Tropis M. Armitige L.Y. Gicquel B. Daffe M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1109-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a study utilizing antisense sequences to the antigen 85 genes (fbpA, B, and C2) demonstrated that inhibition of protein production by these three genes inhibits bacterial growth significantly better than inhibiting only antigen 85C production (5Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Tabatadze D. Zamecnik P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15614-15619Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although very important in determining the nature of the chemistry performed by the antigen 85 proteins, as well as the relative importance, these studies did not specifically identify the enzyme's substrate. Environmental factors also modulate the expression level of the different antigen 85 proteins (6Mariani F. Cappelli G. Riccardi G. Colizzi V. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using reverse transcriptase-PCR assays, mycobacteria grown in Sauton media were shown to produce mRNA from only the fbpB and fbpC2 genes, which encode for the antigen 85B and 85C proteins, respectively. Mycobacteria grown in resting macrophages showed transcription of the mRNA of the fbpA gene, which codes for antigen 85A. Gene expression studies of mycobacteria grown in activated macrophages showed production of only the fbpC2 gene. Thus differential expression of the antigen 85 proteins may be a very important mechanism utilized by M. tuberculosis to evade the human immune system or to persist in a chronic infection. Another study looked at bacterial viability after knocking out various antigen 85 genes (7Armitige L.Y. Jagannath C. Wanger A.R. Norris S.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the antigen 85B knockout, no apparent growth defects were observed in either synthetic media or “macrophage-like” cell lines, whereas an 85A knockout grew in rich media, but not in minimal media or macrophage-like cell lines. These data strengthen the hypothesis that differential expression of the antigen 85 genes may be a mechanism utilized by mycobacteria to confuse and evade the host immune system. M. tuberculosis also evades the immune system through interactions with human fibronectin (8Abou-Zeid C. Ratliff T.L. Wiker H.G. Harboe M. Bennedsen J. Rook G.A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although antigen 85 proteins possess a fibronectin-binding activity, the identity of the domain, or domains, to which antigen 85 binds is currently not clear. Different binding studies have implicated either the heparin and cellular-binding domains (9Naito M. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. Yamada T. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or the collagen-binding domain of fibronectin (10Peake P. Gooley A. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4828-4834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this activity. Regardless of which fibronectin domain interacts with the antigen 85 proteins, it seems clear that this is an important interaction. The interaction between the antigen 85 proteins and fibronectin stimulates monocyte-derived macrophages to phagocytose Mycobacterium leprae (11Schlesinger L.S. Horwitz M.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1983-1994PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of anti-antigen 85 antibodies to this assay decreased the amount of bacterial uptake. Similar strategies are utilized by other pathogens to ensure cellular attachment and promote the initiation of infection. Surface proteins from both Streptococcus pyogenes and Neisseria gonorrhoeae bind to fibronectin allowing for the efficient invasion of host cells (12Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 2: 521-535Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13van Putten J.P. Duensing T.D. Cole R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Studies on the Borrelia burgdorferi protein BBK32 showed that it also binds fibronectin and that antibodies to BBK32 promote protective immunity in mice (14Fikrig E. Feng W. Barthold S.W. Telford 3rd, S.R. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5344-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Considering this, it is possible that by inhibiting the interaction between the antigen 85 proteins and fibronectin, one of the pathways that M. tuberculosis utilizes to enter host cells, would potentially slow down infection. In an attempt to address some lingering questions concerning the roles of the different antigen 85 proteins, structural studies were extended to include antigen 85A and co-crystal structures with substrate analogs. The structure of antigen 85C with octylthioglucoside (OSG) was solved to gain information concerning substrate binding orientation and interactions important for this binding within the antigen 85 active site. The structure of antigen 85A was solved to allow for a thorough comparison of all three M. tuberculosis antigen 85 proteins. This comparison focuses on the substrate-binding site and the active site along with surface residue conformation, which leads to a better understanding of why the tubercle bacillus utilizes three different enzymes to perform the same function. Expression Construct Creation—The fbpA gene was amplified using the PCR from a plasmid containing the gene and inserted into pET30b (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) restriction sites. Sequencing of the plasmid indicated the presence of the fbpA gene and confirmed that the construct possessed the correct sequence. This plasmid (pDRA1) was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, and expression tests indicated the production of recombinant antigen 85A. Protein Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Determination— Both antigens 85A and 85C were purified as previously described (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the treatment of the diffraction data from antigens 85A and 85C are slightly different. Crystallization and crystallographic details for antigen 85A are as follows. Recombinant antigen 85A was crystallized in 100 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5), and 2.4 m sodium acetate. The antigen 85A crystals grew in a C2221 space group with unit cell dimensions a = 131.4 Å, b = 288.7 Å, c = 101.3 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. Addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 20% v/v was used as a cryoprotectant for data collection at beamline 14BM-C at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Labs. Crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K, and x-rays with a wavelength of 1 Å were utilized. The antigen 85A data were reduced using Denzo and Scalepack (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and converted to structure factors with CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) or TRUNCATE (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 CCP4 Suite: Programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Because these crystals were not isomorphous with any of the previous crystal structures for antigen 85B or 85C, molecular replacement was utilized to obtain phases for the antigen 85A structure. The molecular replacement protocol from AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) was used to obtain phases for the antigen 85A structure. A monomer of the apo form of antigen 85C (PDB accession 1DQZ) was used as a search model (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Calculation of the Matthews coefficient assuming 6 molecules within the asymmetric unit resulted in a Vm of 2.669 and an approximate solvent content of 53% (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Principals of Protein X-ray Crystallography. Springer-Verlag, New York1994: 71Google Scholar). However, only two molecular replacement (MR) solutions were obtained from the rotation and translation searches. Rigid body refinement in the program CNS was performed using these two solutions, resulting in an R-factor and Rfree of 38 and 44%, respectively. 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps were calculated from the refined model and viewed using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowtan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Both maps indicated that the two MR solutions were indeed correct (Molecules A and B). However, each of the maps indicated the presence of an additional protein molecule that had not been identified using the MR protocol. The third protein molecule (Molecule C) was manually positioned within the additional density. The model, now containing 3 protein molecules was again subjected to rigid body refinement to ensure proper fitting of the backbone atoms of the manually positioned molecule. The second rigid body refinement yielded an R-factor of 28% and an Rfree of 33%. Because the search model contained the sequence for antigen 85C, mutations were made to the three protein molecules using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowtan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), so the sequence of the model would match the M. tuberculosis antigen 85A sequence. The model was then subjected to the simulated annealing protocol in CNS with a starting temperature of 6000 K resulting in an R-factor of 26% and an Rfree of 30% (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Further manual and computational refinement reduced the R-factor to 22.4% and the Rfree to 25.6%. Water molecules were then added using the automated water pick protocol in CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) and manually through analysis of Fo – Fc maps. The final model includes 3 protein molecules containing residues 0–286 for molecules A and B, residues 8–284 of molecule C, and 54 water molecules. The model has good stereochemistry (Table I) with the Ramachandran plot showing 85.3% of the residues in the core allowed regions. As observed in all other α/β hydrolases, the active site serine, Ser-126, is found in the disallowed region.Table ICrystallographic and refinement dataResolutionCompleteness (total/highest)No. of reflections (total/unique)I/σIRsymaRsym = Σ|I — 〈I〉|/Σ〈I〉, where I is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.

Open table in a new tab The antigen 85C-OSG (octylthioglucoside) crystals were produced in a solution containing 100 mm imidazole buffer (pH 6.5), 1.2 m sodium acetate, and 9 mm OSG. Crystals were cryoprotected using 25% polyethylene glycol 400 and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode. The crystals grew in a C2 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 144.818 Å, b = 68.117 Å, c = 82.281 Å, and β = 119.601. Utilizing the apo structure of antigen 85C (PDB accession no. 1DQZ) as a search model for molecular replacement, the cross-rotation and translation protocols in CNS produced two clear molecular replacement solutions (16Brünger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). These solutions were subjected to rigid body refinement in CNS, where each monomer was treated as a separate rigid body (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Subsequent refinement included simulated annealing (starting temperature of 2500 K), energy minimization, and B-factor refinement using CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The resulting 2Fo – Fc maps were of high quality and matched well with the refined model, indicating that the model was accurate. Inspection of Fo – Fc electron density maps after initial refinement indicated the presence of 2 OSG molecules per molecule of antigen 85C for a total of four OSG molecules per asymmetric unit. The OSG molecules were included into the model for subsequent refinement. Water molecules were added automatically using the water pick protocol in CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

The final model of two antigen 85C molecules, 4 OSG molecules, and 262 water molecules, using data to a resolution of 2.02 Å, refined to an R-factor of 19.2% and an Rfree of 21.5% (Table I) with very good geometry. Only the active site serines, as seen in all other α/β hydrolase enzymes, were found within the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Antigen 85C/OSG Crystal Structure—We have crystallized antigen 85C in the presence of the detergent OSG (octylthioglucoside) and solved the crystal structure. Molecular replacement with the apo structure of antigen 85C utilized as the search model indicated two protein molecules per asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). Initial refinement and inspection of Fo – Fc electron density maps clearly indicated the presence of 2 OSG molecules per molecule of antigen 85C, or four OSG molecules per asymmetric unit (Fig. 1B). One molecule of OSG is located within the proposed substrate-binding site of each protein molecule (OSG1 and OSG3). The other two OSG molecules (OSG2 and OSG4) are found in the secondary carbohydrate-binding site corresponding to that observed in the trehalose-bound form of antigen 85B (22Anderson D.H. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). No obvious conformational changes were observed in antigen 85C upon binding of OSG. This was confirmed by superimposing, using the Cα atoms of residues 8–282, the apo form of antigen 85C (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (PDB accession 1DQZ) and the OSG-bound antigen 85C structures. 2J. A. Christopher, unpublished material. The resulting root mean square deviation of 0.29 Å indicates that these protein structures are nearly identical. This contrasts with the antigen 85C/DEP (diethyl phosphate) structure (PDB accession 1DQY), where a significant conformational change in helix α9 was proposed to result in the stabilization of the acyl-enzyme intermediate (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This helix forms a lid over the fatty acid bound within the active site to block the hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. It seems clear from the OSG structure that substrate binding does not induce movement of helix α9. The structure suggests that covalent bond formation between Ser-124 and substrate is the trigger for this conformational change. The affinity of antigen 85C for OSG seems to be due to its similarity to a portion of the natural substrate, trehalose monomycolate. Inspection of the active site in the OSG-bound structure reveals that both van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions contribute to analog binding (Fig. 2A). Hydrophobic residues within helices α5 and α9 form >70% of the van der Waals contacts between OSG1 (and OSG3) and the protein. Residues within helix α5 are highly conserved, where Trp-158, Leu-161, Ile-163, and Ala-165 form direct van der Waals contacts with the fatty acyl moiety of the substrate analog. Helix α9 forms the opposite side of the acyl binding pocket. Although few of the residues in helix α9 interact directly with the substrate analog, the high level of conservation of these surface hydrophobic side chains implies that they may be important for either “steering” the substrate into the active site or for interacting with a portion of substrate not seen in this structure, specifically the β-chain of the mycolic acid substrate. Other highly conserved residues involved in interactions between the acyl moiety and antigen 85C include Leu-40, Phe-150, Ile-162, and Leu-227 (Fig. 2B), where only residue 150 of antigen 85C (152 of 85A and 85B) differs between the three homologs. In 85C, this is a phenylalanine, whereas in 85A and 85B it is a leucine. Because both are hydrophobic and form a small portion of the “floor” of the acyl-binding site, the difference that seems most relevant is the potential π-stacking of phenylalanine side chains. Phe-150 (or Leu-152 in 85A and 85B) forms a portion of the acyl-binding site floor and interacts with substrate near the branch point of the mycolic acid moiety, which does not possess any unsaturated bonds. Thus, variation at this position seems to be of little consequence in substrate specificity, and the three antigen 85 proteins should have very similar affinities for the same substrate. Residues that form the active site carbohydrate binding pocket are 100% conserved in the M. tuberculosis antigen 85 proteins. The binding of OSG1 within the active site shows that side-chain and backbone atoms of residues Gly-39 and Arg-41 form direct hydrogen bonds with the glucose moiety, whereas side chains of residues Asp-38, Asn-52, and Trp-262 are all found within 4.5 Å of the OSG1 sugar moiety and likely interact with the second (distal) ring of the disaccharide of the antigen 85 substrate or product (Fig. 2B). When comparing the OSG-bound form of antigen 85C with the trehalose-bound antigen 85B structure (22Anderson D.H. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is observed that the sugar moiety of OSG1 and trehalose possess nearly identical hydrogen bonding interactions within the active sites of antigens 85B and 85C and that the O6-hydroxyl of trehalose is oriented in the same direction as that of the fatty acyl moiety of the OSG molecule. Because the mycolyl chains of trehalose dimycolate are attached at the O6 and O6′ positions of trehalose, this implies that the binding mode of the substrate within the active site of antigen 85B is the same as that seen for antigen 85C (Fig. 2C). The OSG2 (and OSG4)-binding site is in a similar location to that seen in the trehalose/antigen 85B crystal structure (22Anderson D.H. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, differences in the interactions at this site indicate that it is not the true substrate-binding site (Fig. 2D). The residues of antigen 85C that form direct interactions with the glucose moiety of OSG2 are slightly different than the 85B side chains interacting with trehalose. Asn-152, Asp-155, Trp-158, Asn-152, Thr-234, Thr-237, and Arg-233 of antigen 85C interact directly with OSG2. Although these residues are also involved in binding trehalose in the antigen 85B structure by virtue of the conserved fold, the nature of the residues in this region are not conserved between antigens 85B and 85C. Also, whereas the lipid moiety of OSG2 is well ordered, the protein/analog interactions are mediated by residues from both protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, indicating that a single molecule of antigen 85 would have weak affinity for a fatty acid at this secondary binding site. Additionally, the OSG2-binding site is only slightly electronegative (∼–10 eV).2 The carbohydrate binding pocket within the active site has a 6-fold stronger negative electrostatic potential (∼–60 eV).2 Although it seems unlikely this is a specific carbohydrate-binding pocket, the binding at this site seems relatively strong. Thus, the docking role hypothesized for this surface region by Anderson et al. (22Anderson D.H. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) cannot be ruled out. Enzymatic assays performed in vitro, or experiments in vivo with a form of antigen 85C containing mutations within this region could ascertain what role, if any, this surface region plays in catalysis or in proper orientation of the antigen 85 active site toward the cell wall surface. Antigen 85A Crystal Structure—To determine the structural conservation between the three antigen 85 proteins, the crystal structure of the secreted form of M. tuberculosis antigen 85A was solved using antigen 85C as the search model for molecular replacement and subsequent refinement to 2.7-Å resolution. Data collection and refinement statistics are detailed in Table I. Three protein molecules are observed in each asymmetric unit. Superposition of 85A with either 85B or 85C using the Cα atoms from residues 37–282 (35–280 in antigen 85C) results in root mean square deviation values of 0.34 and 0.95 Å, respectively. The catalytic triad required for enzymatic activity is intact within antigen 85A and superimposes well with that of the apo structures of 85B and 85C, and residues found within the substrate binding pocket are structurally conserved between the three antigen 85 proteins, indicating that these proteins do indeed bind the same substrate and catalyze the same mycolyl transfer reaction (Fig. 3A). As mentioned previously the substrate-binding site and active site of the antigen 85 proteins are highly conserved. As seen in the antigen 85C/OSG structure, the active site can be divided into two discrete sections (carbohydrate binding and fatty acid binding) with the serine nucleophile, Ser-124 (Ser-126 in 85A and 85B), marking the point of segregation between these regions. The surface residues forming the carbohydrate binding portion of the substrate-binding site are 100% conserved in all three antigen 85 proteins. In the mycolate-binding portion, Phe-150 and Trp-158 of 85C differ from the corresponding residues in 85A and 85B, leading to the conclusion that these differences in the acyl-binding portion of the substrate binding pocket may be enough to alter substrate specificity. However, as stated previously, this seems unlikely. Various studies have been carried out to try to determine which region of the antigen 85 proteins is responsible for the specific interaction with human fibronectin. The first research to address this question identified residues 71–90, 121–150, and 201–220 of antigen 85B as being responsible for the interaction with fibronectin (10Peake P. Gooley A. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4828-4834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second study found that residues 98–108 (FEWYYQSGLSI) of full-length antigen 85B (before signal sequence cleavage) were essential for binding of fibronectin (25Naito M. Ohara N. Matsumoto S. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2905-2909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Neither sequence resembled any previously characterized fibronectin-binding motif. Because these two studies do not agree and no other binding studies have been performed, the residues involved in binding fibronectin are still not known. We have previously hypothesized that a large, conserved surface patch, composed of residues 1–30, 39–66, and 98–111, is responsible for the interaction between antigen 85 proteins and human fibronectin (2Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This surface includes those residues identified by Naito and colleagues (25Naito M. Ohara N. Matsumoto S. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2905-2909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 56–66 (FEWYDQSGLSV) of the secreted form of antigen 85A, to be important for binding, which is located on an exposed surface loop connecting helix α2 and strand β4. The conserved patch encompasses about 3271 Å2, which is ∼28% of the total accessible surface area of the protein. Because fibronectin is a very large molecule, ∼250 kDa, it is probable that the entirety of this conserved patch is involved in direct interactions with fibronectin. Structures of all three antigen 85 proteins give support to this proposal, because backbone conformation is virtually identical in this region for all three enzymes. Additionally, when these side chain conformations of 85A, B, and C within this region are compared, one can see that only residues Tyr-10 and Lys-23 in the antigen 85A structure deviate from the conformation seen in 85B and 85C (Fig. 3B). This is simply a result of differences in torsion angles of these two residues in antigen 85A rather than a change in protein structure. In fact, only one of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit of the antigen 85A structure differs at these two positions. Residues Tyr-10 and Lys-23 of the other two antigen 85A molecules share the same conformation as that seen in the antigen 85B and 85C structures. Furthermore, residues Tyr-10 and Lys-23, which vary in their conformation, are at the interface of another molecule in the crystal lattice, suggesting that this difference is due to crystal contacts and that the change in conformation of these two residues is an artifact. Other differences on this surface are a result of sequence changes, although these changes result in the conservation of charge or hydrogen bonding potential. Specifically, residue Lys-111 (corresponding to position 113 in antigens 85A and 85B) is an arginine in 85A and 85B, thus the positive charge at this position is maintained. Also, in the region between 56 and 66, which was shown to be necessary for the interaction between the antigen 85 proteins and fibronectin, the W58E mutation in antigen 85C and the Y62D mutation in antigen 85A both allow for the formation of hydrogen bonds that may be important for binding fibronectin. Therefore, because the proposed fibronectin binding region has now been shown to have conserved topology and conserved electrostatics in all three antigen 85 proteins, it seems clear that these residues do represent the point of interaction with fibronectin. Of course, structural studies of an antigen 85/fibronectin complex are required to determine the exact nature of the interactions involved in this important interaction. Why Three Antigen 85 Enzymes?—Looking closely at the few differences between the antigen 85 proteins there seems to be a selective advantage for M. tuberculosis to possess redundant antigen 85 proteins. As mentioned previously, reverse-transcriptase PCR assays of the antigen 85 genes under different growth conditions indicate that mycobacteria adjust antigen 85 expression as a response to the environment (6Mariani F. Cappelli G. Riccardi G. Colizzi V. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specifically, antigens 85B and 85C were expressed when bacteria were grown in Sauton medium, but antigen 85A is only expressed when the bacteria are inside a macrophage. Furthermore, when macrophages were activated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ, expression of the antigen 85A was turned off while the 85C gene expression was turned on. To understand the importance of this fact, the slight differences between the antigen 85 proteins must be looked at carefully. For example, the spatial positions of residues 85–91 of the mature antigen 85C structure are noticeably different from the analogous residues conserved between antigens 85A and 85B. As a result, the structure of antigen 85C differs in this region from the structures of antigen 85A and 85B (Fig. 3C). Residues 86–95 of antigens 85A and 85B form a short surface-exposed turn between two anti-parallel β-strands. A disulfide bond between residues Cys-87 and Cys-92 forms the base of this short turn. As a result of the conformational restraints placed on this short turn by the presence of the disulfide bond, the backbone conformation is identical between antigens 85A and 85B. In contrast, antigen 85C does not possess a disulfide bond in this region, so no β-sheet is present and this turn contains a noticeable kink. Because this region of antigen 85B is a known T-cell epitope (26Roche P.W. Peake P.W. Billman-Jacobe H. Doran T. Britton W.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5319-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the differences seen here highlight the fact that residues not involved in catalysis or fibronectin binding are not conserved between the three antigen 85 proteins. To extend this hypothesis, it should be noted that the three antigens possess significant differences in surface-exposed residues within the C-terminal regions. In fact, it seems that almost every surface residue not directly involved in either substrate binding, fibronectin binding, or maintaining the three-dimensional structure (hydrogen bonding, forming salt bridges, etc.) has been mutated in at least one of the antigen 85 proteins. For example, in helix 10, all of the conserved residues face the interior of the protein while none of the solvent-exposed residues are conserved. A similar pattern is also seen in the C-terminal half of helix α9, which encompasses residues 234–248. Of these 15 residues, the conserved residues (Thr-234, Asn-235, Phe-238, and Tyr-242) face the protein interior while the solvent-exposed residues are variable. If a vaccine is to be based on the antigen 85 proteins (27Horwitz M.A. Lee B.W. Dillon B.J. Harth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it may be beneficial to utilize all three antigen 85 proteins, because the redundancy of the antigen 85 proteins promotes a selective advantage for M. tuberculosis, possibly through immune system evasion. As the number of people infected with M. tuberculosis increases, and the death toll due to tuberculosis continues to rise, research focused on the development of new therapeutics continues to be of utmost importance. The research presented here should further the study in areas of anti-tubercular therapeutics and vaccine design. The co-crystal structure of OSG bound in the active site of antigen 85C illustrates the binding mode of the substrate and extends the knowledge concerning specific protein/substrate interactions. This is the first step toward designing potent inhibitors to the mycolyltransferase activity of the antigen 85 enzymes. Although knowledge of specific protein/carbohydrate interactions was previously known from the antigen 85B trehalose structure (22Anderson D.H. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), information concerning the nature and dimensions of the van der Waals interactions between the protein and acyl chain should allow for the design of strongly binding inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1963784434,"Prior studies have demonstrated that the substrate for NO synthesis, l-arginine, can be regenerated from the NOS co-product l-citrulline. This requires the sequential action of two enzymes, argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL). AS activity has been shown to be rate-limiting for high output NO synthesis by immunostimulant-activated cells and represents a potential site for metabolic control of NO synthesis. We now demonstrate that NO mediates reversible S-nitrosylation and inactivation of AS in vitro and in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells and mice. Using a novel mass spectrometry-based method, we show that Cys-132 in human AS is the sole target for S-nitrosylation among five Cys residues. Mutagenesis studies confirm that S-nitrosylation of Cys-132 is both necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of AS by NO donors. S-nitroso-AS content is regulated by cellular glutathione levels and selectively influences NO production when citrulline is provided to cells as a protosubstrate of NOS but not when l-arginine is provided. A phylogenetic comparison of AS sequences suggests that Cys-132 evolved as a site for post-translational regulation of activity in the AS in NOS-expressing species, endowing NO with the capacity to limit its own synthesis by restricting arginine availability.

The mammalian genome encodes three distinct isoforms of NO synthase (NOS) that catalyze identical reactions-conversion of l-arginine (Arg) to NO and l-citrulline (Cit) (3Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The immunostimulant-induced isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) produces cytotoxic quantities of NO and NO-derived species that are used to fend off tumor cells and various invading organisms (4Shiloh M.U. Nathan C.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) at the expense of possible injury to itself (5Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Regulation of iNOS activity occurs principally at the level of transcription, endowing cells with a relatively slow means to adapt high output NO production to mammalian cell needs. Once iNOS protein is resident in a cell, however, the availability of substrate Arg is thought to be the key determinant of NO synthesis rate. Importantly, Arg is synthesized within NO-producing cells from the NOS co-product Cit (6Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) via the sequential action of two enzymes: argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL). AS catalyzes an ATP-dependent ligation of the NOS product Cit with Asp, yielding argininosuccinate, AMP, and pyrophosphate. Argininosuccinate is subsequently cleaved by argininosuccinate lyase (AL), yielding Arg and fumarate. Although AS and AL are generally considered in the context of their contribution to the urea cycle of the liver, where AS serves as the rate-limiting enzyme for ammonia detoxification (7Morris Jr., S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), these enzymes also endow iNOS-expressing cells with an Arg/Cit cycle for continuous regeneration of Arg from Cit, providing iNOS with a sustained supply of substrate. Although AL was found to be constitutively expressed in NO-producing cells, AS mRNA, protein and activity are synergistically induced (along with iNOS) by immunostimulants in a wide variety of cells and tissues (8Hattori Y.

Importantly, we previously demonstrated that AS activity is rate-limiting for immunostimulant-induced high output NO production in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (8Hattori Y. Campbell E.B. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Arg/Cit cycle provides the preferred source of Arg to iNOS (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, in transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress iNOS in a cardiac-specific manner, Arg/Cit recycling was found to profoundly limit iNOS activity (14Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of AS activity can dictate the quantity of substrate presented to iNOS and therefore represents a potential site for regulation of high output NO production. In the present study, we questioned whether AS activity is down-regulated by levels of NO produced by iNOS-expressing cells. If operative, such a system would confer NO with the capacity to limit its own synthesis. NO and NO-derived species can reversibly modulate protein activities by covalently adding to sulfur on critical Cys residues, a reaction termed S-nitrosylation (14Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). S-nitrosylation has been implicated in the physiological regulation of a broad spectrum of cellular and physiological activities, including regulation of blood flow (15Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P.

It was also demonstrated that NO donors inhibit the urea cycle in cultured hepatocytes (21Farghali H. Martinek J. Masek K. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999; 21: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and urea cycle activity can be increased when NOS is inhibited (22Yoon J.H. Lee H.S. Kim T.H. Woo G.H. Kim C.Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Induction of iNOS activity in immunostimulant-treated cells is associated with a substantial increase in the overall level of protein S-nitrosylation (23Gow A.J. Chen Q. Hess D.T. Day B.J. Ischiropoulos H. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9637-9640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although S-nitrosylation of AS is a potential mechanism for modulation of the urea cycle by NO donors and inhibitors, this possibility has not been previously considered. In the present study, we demonstrated that NO down-regulates AS activity via S-nitrosylation and molecularly defines the Cys residue that is responsible for regulation of AS activity by NO. This modification provides a regulatory mechanism that can limit NO overproduction by governing Arg availability to iNOS. AS Expression and Purification—Recombinant human AS was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, AS cDNA was cloned into pMAL-P2 (New England Biolabs) and expressed as a C-terminal fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP) in Escherichia coli. MBP-AS was purified by affinity chromatography using an amylose-agarose column. Free AS was prepared by cleavage of the MBP-AS protein using Factor Xa (1:200) and overnight incubation at 4 °C. AS was separated from MBP using an S-300 sephacryl gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and purified AS was kept at –20 °C in storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Cit and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) until use. Assay of S-Nitrosylation Stoichiometry in Studies with Purified AS— The maximal amount of S-nitrosothiol incorporated/mol of AS was determined using the Saville-Griess assay, as described by Hogg et al. (24Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of AS was incubated with increasing concentrations of NO donor at 37 °C for 30 min. Protein was precipitated by the addition of two volumes of iced acetone followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The protein was then resuspended in 90 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and NO was displaced as nitrite from S-nitrosothiols by the addition of 10 μl of 1 mm HgCl2 solution. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the released nitrite was measured using the Griess assay. Preparation of Tissue Extracts for Assay of S-Nitroso-Protein (SNO-Protein) Content—Male adult C57Bl6 mice (20–25 g) were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg LPS (E. coli serotype O111:B4) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). The mice were provided unlimited access to drinking water, which in some cases contained the NOS inhibitor Nω-methyl-l-arginine (NMA; 5 mm) for 48 h prior to and 6 h following LPS injection. The mice were sacrificed 6 h after LPS treatment by asphyxiation in an atmosphere of CO2. After sacrifice, the brain, heart, and liver were excised, rinsed with iced phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess blood, and flash-frozen on dry ice until subsequent extraction of SNO-proteins. Assay of S-Nitroso-AS (SNO-AS) in Extracts from Tissues and Cells—Processing of frozen mouse tissues was performed by mincing on ice in 10–20 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm pepstatin A) followed by homogenization on ice using a Tissue-Tearor at half-maximal speed. The cells in culture were washed twice with iced phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder in 10–20 volumes of lysis buffer. Tissue and cell homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellets were discarded. SNO-proteins were subjected to the biotin-swap method of Jaffrey et al. (25Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were added to two volumes of iced acetone, and the precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. The proteins were solubilized in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 2.5% SDS, 20 mmS-methyl-thiomethanesulfonate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm neocuproine) to give a final protein concentration of 0.8–1.0 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 50° C. The proteins were separated from S-methyl-thiomethanesulfonate by precipitation using 2 volumes of iced acetone, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in iced acetone, and then pelleted 2 additional times for efficient S-methyl-thiomethanesulfonate removal. Samples were solubilized in 5 ml of biotinylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% SDS, 4 mm ascorbate, and 2 mmN-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (Biotin-HPDP)) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were precipitated with iced acetone, pelleted, and then solubilized once again in 5 ml of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Streptavidin-agarose beads were added to the biotinylated protein-containing mixture, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Following repeated suspension and pelleting of beads with washing buffer (incubation buffer containing 600 mm NaCl), bound SNO-proteins were released from washed beads by boiling in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for 10 min. Western Blotting for SNO-AS—Total SNO-proteins were extracted from tissues and cells as above, resolved by gradient SDS-PAGE (4–16% cross-linked acrylamide), and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. SNO-AS was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection after Western blotting. The Western blot procedure utilized sequential incubation of membranes with rabbit anti-AS serum (1:1000; generated to MBP-AS fusion protein), biotinylated goat anti-IgG (1:3000), streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (1:3000), and the chemiluminescent substrate, 1,2-dioxytene. Assay of AS Activity—Two methods were used to quantify the enzymatic activity of AS. In the first method, AS activity was assessed based on accumulation of the product pyrophosphate (as inorganic phosphate, following cleavage with pyrophosphatase). AS protein (1 μg) was added to the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm Cit, 2 mm Asp, 6 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 0.2 units of pyrophosphatase) to give a final volume of 200 μl. The samples were incubated at 37 °C in 96-well microtiter plates, and the reactions were terminated after 30 min by the addition of an equal volume of molybdate buffer (10 mm ascorbate acid, 2.5 mm ammonium molybdate, 2% sulfuric acid). Accumulation of phosphate in the samples was determined spectrophotometrically at A650 by comparison with inorganic phosphate standards. The second method used to assay AS activity was based on the conversion of [3H]aspartate to [3H]argininosuccinate, as described previously (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained (final concentration): Asp (400 μm), [3H]Asp (250,000 counts/min), Cit (2 mm), Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.5), ATP (2 mm), MgCl2 (6 mm), KCl (20 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (1.5 mm), pyruvate kinase (4.5 units), myokinase (4 units), and pyrophosphatase (0.2 units) in a total volume of 150 μl. Reactions were incubated in glass test tubes and allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C before enzyme activity was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m acetic acid and heating for 30 min at 90 °C. Following this procedure, 800 μl of distilled H2O was added to the incubates, and the contents were applied to 0.5 × 4-cm columns of Dowex 1-X8 (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) that had been pre-equilibrated with 0.05 m acetic acid. The columns were washed twice with 1 ml of 0.05 m acetic acid, and the flow-through containing [3H]argininosuccinate was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry after the addition of In-Flow BD liquid scintillant (IN/US Systems Inc.). Culture and Buthionine Sulfoximine (BSO)/Glutathione Monoethylester (GSE) Treatment of Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells (RASMC)— Native RASMC were isolated from thoracic aorta explants of Fisher rats (26Gross S.S. Levi R. Madera A. Park K.H. Vane J. Hattori Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RASMC were grown to 70% confluence in T-75 culture flasks containing RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were studied at passages 8–12. To induce NO synthesis, the cells were treated for 12 h with a combination of 30 μg/ml LPS (E. coli stereotype O111:B4) and 50 ng/ml of murine interferon (IFN)-γ. After LPS/IFN treatment, the cells were washed three times with Arg- and Cit-free RPMI 1640 culture medium and then incubated with the same medium containing either 1 mm Arg or 1 mm Cit. To the medium were added either 100 μm BSO, a γ-glutamylcysteinyl synthase inhibitor to deplete cellular GSH, or 1 mm membrane-permeable GSE to increase the cellular GSH level. After 24 h of incubation, the culture media were harvested for quantification of NO release as nitrite, and the cells were scrape harvested for analysis of SNO-AS and GSH content. Assay of NO by the Griess Assay—NO accumulation in cell culture medium and content in SNO-AS solutions (following displacement of NO with mercuric ions) was quantified as nitrite using the Griess assay as described previously (26Gross S.S. Levi R. Madera A. Park K.H. Vane J. Hattori Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The samples (100 μl) were treated in a microtiter plate with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% and naphthalenediamine in 5% O-phosphoric acid), and the resulting azo dye product was analyzed within 5 min at A550 using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Nitrite concentration was quantified by comparison with sodium nitrite standards. Kinetics of NO Production by Ferroheme Myoglobin Capture Assay— Ferroheme myoglobin was employed to efficiently scavenge cell-derived NO and to quantify the rate of NO production. Quantification of NO production was based on the rate of progressive increase in A405, which results from oxidation of ferro- to ferriheme. Ferroheme myoglobin was prepared as described previously (27Gross S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6) buffer. A solution of 2 mm horse heart myoglobin was prepared in 2.5 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, and 0.5 mg of fresh sodium hydrosulfite (dithionite) was added to reduce ferri- to ferroheme. The reaction mixture was rapidly applied to the PD-10 column and ferromyoglobin was eluted in 3.5 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6). The eluted myoglobin was diluted in 50 mm Tris buffer to a final concentration of 400 μm and stored at –70 °C until use. RASMC were pretreated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, LPS, and rat INF-γ (30 mg/ml; 50 ng/ml) for 12 h followed by incubation in 100 μl of serum-free medium containing either 1 mm Arg or Cit for 24 h in the absence or presence of 3 mm NOS inhibitor NMA. Capture of cell-derived NO was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of the 400 μm ferroheme myoglobin to the Arg- or Cit-containing media, and after 5 min, the rate of NO production was monitored based on the rate of increase in A405 over a period of 10 min. GSH Assay—Cell lysates (20 μl) were prepared and added to 100 μl of GSH assay buffer containing 100 mm sodium-phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm NADPH, 5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, and 0.5 unit of glutathione reductase. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and A412 was monitored. The GSH content of the cell lysates were quantified by comparison with GSH standards. Neutral Loss Mass Spectrometry to Identify S-Nitrosylation Sites in AS Digests—Purified huAS protein (100 μg) was treated with 100 μmS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in AS storage buffer (excluding DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C. GSNO was removed, and the buffer was exchanged by 3 cycles of concentration-dilution into 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) using a microcentrifugal concentration device with a 10-kDa cutoff membrane (Centricon, Millipore). The protein was then digested at 37 °C for 4 h with trypsin (1:50). The peptide digest of AS was diluted with two volumes of 50:50:2 water:methanol:acetic acid and introduced into a triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer (Quattro II, Micromass) by infusion at 10 μl/min with a source temperature of 80 °C. Mass spectra were acquired in neutral loss mode with a cone voltage of 25 V and collision energy of 15 V. Site-directed Mutagenesis—An AS C132A mutant plasmid was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Wild type human AS cDNA in pMAL-P2 served as the template for mutagenesis with AS C132A mutant primers as follows: forward 33-mer, 5′-CGGTTTGAGCTCAGCGCCTACTCACTGGCCCCC-3′; reverse 33-mer, 5′-GGGGGCCAGTAGGCGCTGAGCTCAAACCG-3′. Confirmation of the desired mutation was obtained by DNA sequencing. Glutathione Depletion Selectively Attenuates NO Production from Cit—Treatment of RASMC with LPS/IFN results in iNOS induction and commencement of high output NO synthesis (28Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Arg is the sole physiological substrate for all mammalian NOS isoforms, Cit can be converted to Arg by the concerted action of AS and AL, allowing Cit to support high output NO synthesis. As shown in Fig. 1A, NO production by immunoactivated RASMC during a 24-h interval resulted in increased concentrations of nitrite in the cell culture medium. In the absence of Arg, Cit supported NO synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, although 10-fold more Cit, relative to Arg, was needed for a comparable rate of NO synthesis. Treatment of RASMC with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 100 μm, 24 h), a selective inhibitor of GSH synthesis (29Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), depleted GSH by 75–80%, but did not alter 24-h LPS/IFN-induced NO synthesis from Arg. In contrast, this level of GSH depletion was associated with a 50% decrease in NO production when Cit was provided as a precursor of Arg. Fig. 1B details the time course of NO production by LPS/IFN-treated RASMC provided with either Arg or Cit (1 mm) as a precursor. Results show a progressive decline over time in the efficacy of Cit utilization for NO synthesis relative to the use of Arg. Notably, GSH depletion did not influence the time course of NO synthesis from Arg, whereas it resulted in a decrease in the rate of NO synthesis from Cit (Fig. 1B). Together, these findings suggest that AS and/or AL are subject to inhibition in association with nitrosative stress and thiol depletion. Because AS (20Kumar S. Lennane J. Ratner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6745-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but not AL (30Rosenthal G.A. Naylor A.W. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), has been shown to contain a redoxsensitive thiol that inhibits activity when covalently modified, we considered whether this thiol may be a target for modification by NO. If so, we would predict that NO production from Cit would not fail in the presence of an efficient NO scavenger. The inset to Fig. 1B shows that following the addition of the efficient NO scavenger ferromyoglobin to the cells (24 h after treatment with LPS/IFN), the rate of NO production from Arg and Cit becomes identical. Moreover, in the presence of ferromyoglobin, BSO fails to suppress NO production from Cit. Notably, in this setting, NO production from Arg was not different from that detected by nitrite assay, whereas NO production from Cit was selectively accelerated by the NO scavenger. This finding indicates that NO production selectively impedes the generation of NO from the Arg precursor Cit. Nitric Oxide Reversibly Inactivates AS by S-Nitrosylation in Vitro—Purified AS was incubated for 30 min with NO donors over a range of concentrations and then assayed for AS activity. Three NO donors were tested: S-nitro-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and GSNO. None of the NO donors interfered with the assay used to measure AS activity (data not shown), however all elicited concentration-dependent inhibition of AS (Fig. 2A). The potency of tested NO donors for inhibiting AS activity followed the rank-order GSNO > SNAP > SNP, with IC50 values of 60, 120, and 800 μm, respectively. Once inhibited by GSNO treatment, AS was observed to undergo full and rapid reactivation upon the addition of 10 mm DTT (Fig. 2B). These observations are consistent with a mechanism whereby inhibition of AS is mediated by S-nitrosylation of one or more Cys residues, and reactivation occurs via denitrosylation of AS by NO group transfer to DTT (i.e. trans-nitrosylation). Chemical analysis confirmed that AS is indeed susceptible to S-nitrosylation by GSNO. The extent of SNO-AS formation was determined by mercuric displacement of S-NO as nitrite, followed by quantification of nitrite using the Griess colorimetric assay. Exposure of AS to progressively increasing concentrations of GSNO followed by repurification and analysis of SNO content showed that GSNO elicits saturable and concentration-dependent S-nitrosylation (Fig. 2C). The upper limit of NO incorporation into AS was observed to be slightly in excess of 1 NO/AS monomer; saturation was obtained with 1 mm GSNO. Thus, stable S-nitrosylation of only a single Cys residue appears to occur in AS, and this is associated with thiol-reversible inhibition of AS activity by NO. Having discerned that S-nitrosylation of a single thiol may inactivate AS, we tested whether AS substrates (ATP, Cit, or Asp) can protect against inactivation. Toward this end, AS was incubated in a buffer containing NO donor (GSNO or SNP) and various concentrations of only one of the three substrates. After 30 min, the remaining two substrates were added at a fixed concentration of 2 mm, and the product formation was assayed after 30 min of incubation. A plot of 1/velocity versus 1/[ATP] revealed that ATP competitively protects AS from inhibition (Fig. 2D). In contrast, Asp and Cit afforded noncompetitive and uncompetitive protection of AS from inhibition, respectively. To test whether ATP can protect AS from S-nitrosylation, AS was incubated with 100 μm GSNO in the presence or absence of various concentrations of ATP, and SNO content was quantified by Saville-Griess assay as described previously. As shown in Fig. 2E, increasing concentrations of ATP progressively reduce SNO-AS formation. These results suggest that S-nitrosylation of AS and occupancy by ATP are mutually exclusive. Moreover, the extent of AS inhibition by GSNO was observed to correlate closely with the extent of AS S-nitrosylation. Cys-132 Is the Only Site of Stable S-Nitrosylation on Human AS—To determine which of five cysteines in human AS is accessible to S-nitrosylation, we developed a novel “neutral loss” mass spectrometry-based method that selectively identifies SNO peptides in digests of GSNO-treated proteins. Following exposure of AS to GSNO, trypsinolysis was performed and peptides were analyzed using a triple quadrupole electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. Two quadrupole mass analyzers were used sequentially (designated M1 and M2, respectively), separated by an argon gas collision cell. The collision cell was set to impart sufficient energy to rupture the labile S–NO bond but not enough to fragment other more stable chemical bonds. The two mass analyzers were configured to monitor the neutral loss of NO; that is, to identify parental peptide ions that lose precisely the uncharged mass of NO following passage through the collision cell (30 and 15 Da for peptide ions with +1 and +2 charges, respectively). A single tryptic peptide could be detected by this technique in digests of GSNO-treated AS. This peptide corresponded to an m/z value of 746.3 fo"
https://openalex.org/W2081505383,"Corin is a type II transmembrane serine protease and functions as the proatrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) convertase in the heart. In the extracellular region of corin, there are two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains, eight low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) repeats, a macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain, and a trypsin-like protease domain at the C terminus. To examine the functional importance of the domain structures in the propeptide of corin for pro-ANP processing, we constructed a soluble corin, EKshortCorin, that consists of only the protease domain and contains an enterokinase (EK) recognition sequence at the conserved activation cleavage site. After being activated by EK, EKshortCorin exhibited catalytic activity toward chromogenic substrates but failed to cleave pro-ANP, indicating that certain domain structures in the propeptide are required for pro-ANP processing. We then constructed a series of corin deletion mutants and studied their functions in pro-ANP processing. Compared with that of the full-length corin, a corin mutant lacking frizzled 1 domain exhibited ∼40% activity, whereas corin mutants lacking single LDLR repeat 1, 2, 3, or 4 had ∼49, ∼12, ∼53, and ∼77% activity, respectively. We also made corin mutants with a single mutation at a conserved Asp residue that coordinates Ca2+-binding in LDLR repeats 1, 2, 3, or 4 (D300Y, D336Y, D373Y, and D410Y) and showed that these mutants had ∼25, ∼11, ∼16, and ∼82% pro-ANP processing activity, respectively.

These data indicate that corin is the pro-ANP convertase that had remained elusive for many years. Human corin is a polypeptide of 1042 amino acids that contains a short cytoplasmic tail at the N terminus followed by an integral transmembrane domain (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J.

In the extracellular region, there are two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains, eight LDLR class A repeats, a macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain, and a trypsin-like protease domain at the C terminus (see Fig. 1A).

The soluble corin converted human pro-ANP to biologically active ANP in a highly sequence-specific manner, indicating that the transmembrane domain of corin is not necessary for pro-ANP processing. It remained unknown, however, whether the other domains such as frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains and LDLR repeats contribute to the pro-ANP processing activity of corin. In this study, we assessed the functional importance of the domain structures in the propeptide of corin for pro-ANP processing. We showed that a soluble corin that consisted of only the serine protease domain retained the catalytic activity toward small peptide substrates but was inactive in processing pro-ANP. We further identified a region in the propeptide of corin comprising frizzled 1 domain and LDLR repeats 1–4 that is critical for pro-ANP processing.

Fetal bovine serum was from SeraCare Life Sciences, Inc. (Oceanside, CA). HEK 293 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by BIOSOURCE International Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Restriction enzymes and DNA polymerases were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA).

Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Protease inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Diagnostics. All other chemical reagents were from Sigma. Expression Vectors—The expression vector, pSECEKsolCorin, encoding a soluble corin (EKsolCorin) that consists of an Igκ signal peptide at the N terminus followed by a 919-amino acid sequence from the extracellular region of corin (residues 124–1042) and a viral V5 tag at the C terminus, was described previously (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In EKsolCorin, the conserved activation cleavage sequence (RMNKR) was replaced by an EK recognition sequence (DDDDK), which allows for the activation of corin by EK (see Fig. 1A). The plasmid pSECEKsolCorin was used as a template to construct the expression vector pSECEKshortCorin, encoding a protein (EKshortCorin) that consists of an Igκ signal peptide at the N terminus followed by the catalytic domain of human corin (residues 787–1042) and a viral V5 tag at the C terminus (see Fig. 1A). Like EKsolCorin, EKshortCorin contains the EK recognition sequence at the conserved activation cleavage site. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTT TAG GAG AAA GGT CTG GAT GTA AAT CTG-3′ and 5′-AAA CAA GAC TGT GGG CGC CG-3′ and Pfu polymerase were used in PCR to amplify a human corin cDNA fragment (2452–3222 bp) (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). After 30 cycles, 1 unit of Taq polymerase was added to the reaction and incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. This step allows adding an extra base of adenine at the 3′-end of PCR products, facilitating the cloning of DNA fragments into the pSecTag/FRT/V5-His-TOPO vector. To construct expression vectors encoding corin deletion mutants, a two-step PCR strategy was used. The full-length human corin cDNA was used as a template. The first step was to amplify a cDNA fragment flanked by an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and an XhoI site at the 3′ end. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the vector pcDNA4/HisMaxC (Invitrogen). The next step was to amplify a second cDNA fragment flanked by an XhoI site at the 5′ and an ApaI site at the 3′-end. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes XhoI and ApaI and cloned into the pcDNA4/HisMaxC vector that contained the first cDNA fragment. The segments derived from PCR in each expression plasmid were verified by DNA sequencing. Table I summarizes the corin cDNA sequences that were generated by PCR and the amino acids that were deleted in each mutant. All corin mutants in this series contain an Xpress tag at their N termini.Table ISummary of the PCR-based strategy to construct plasmids encoding corin deletion mutantsMutantPCR fragment 1 (bp of cDNA)PCR fragment 2 (bp of cDNA)Amino acids deletedΔFz194-462895-3222124-267ΔFz1R1-594-4621450-3222124-452ΔR1-594-8701450-3222260-452ΔFz1R194-4621006-3222124-304ΔFz1R1294-4621114-3222124-340ΔFz1R1-394-4621225-3222124-377ΔFz1R1-494-4621337-3222124-414ΔR194-8941006-3222268-304ΔR1294-8941114-3222268-340ΔR1-394-8941225-3222268-377ΔR1-494-8941337-3222268-414ΔR294-10051114-3222305-340ΔR394-11131225-3222341-377ΔR494-12241336-3222378-414 Open table in a new tab To construct plasmids expressing corin mutants D300Y, D336Y, D373Y, and D410Y, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a full-length corin cDNA as template. The following oligonucleotide primers were used, 5′-C TGT GAC GAC TGG AGT TAC GAG GCT CAT TGC AAC-3′ for mutant D300Y, 5′-GAC TGT GGG GAT TTG AGT TAT GAG CAA AAC TGT GAT TGC-3′ for mutant D336Y, 5′-GAC TGT GTG GAT AAG TCC TAC GAG GTC AAC TGC TCC-3′ for mutant D373Y, and 5′-GAC TGC AAG GAT GGG AGT TAT GAG GAG AAC TGC AG-3′ for mutant D410Y. Like the deletion mutants described above, these corin mutants also contain an Xpress tag at their N termini. Expression, Purification, and Activation of EKshortCorin—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with the expression vector pSECEKshortCorin and a plasmid expressing the neomycin resistance gene using LipofectAMINE 2000. Stable clones expressing EKshortCorin were selected in α-minimum essential medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Positive clones were identified by Western blotting and adapted for growth in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium. To purify EKshortCorin, the conditioned medium was collected, passed through a 0.2-μm filter, and dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) using a Dialyze Direct L module (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The medium was loaded onto a 23-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) that was subsequently washed with Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and eluted with a 10–250 mm imidazole linear gradient in Buffer A. Fractions containing the soluble corin were combined. The protein had a purity of >95%, as determined by SDS/PAGE followed by silver staining and Western blotting. To activate EKshortCorin, ∼50 μg of the purified protein was incubated with 15 units of recombinant EK in 5 ml of activation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2) at 25 °C for 2 h. EK was then removed using EKapture beads by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 10 min). As a control, an assay buffer without corin protein underwent the same EK activation and removal procedures. Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic constants were determined using two selected chromogenic substrates, S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide-HCl) and S-2403 (pyroGlu-Phe-Lys-p-nitroanilide-HCl), which were used previously for a full-length soluble corin (EKsolCorin) (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For each assay, 50 μl of substrates (final concentrations from 0.2 to 2 mm in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2) were mixed with 50 μl of activated EKshortCorin (final concentration of 40 nm) in a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C and read at 405 nm wavelength over 15 min at 20 s intervals in a plate reader (Spectra MAX 250, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). In these experiments, controls included purified EKshortCorin that was not activated by EK and an assay buffer that underwent the same EK treatment and removal procedures. Readings from these controls, which were minimal, were subtracted as the background. The Km and Vmax values were determined by a Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot. Each assay was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Effects of Protease Inhibitors—Effects of protease inhibitors on EKshortCorin and EKsolCorin were tested in an assay using the chromogenic substrate S-2403. In each experiment, 45 μl of activated EKshortCorin or EKsolCorin (final concentration of 50 nm) was mixed with 5 μl of an inhibitor (final concentrations ranging from 50 to 20 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The substrate S-2403 (final concentration of 500 μm) was added to the mixture, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm after 2 h. Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Pro-ANP Processing—HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either human pro-ANP or corin using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned medium containing recombinant human pro-ANP was collected after 16 h, added to cells expressing either the full-length or mutant corin, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Recombinant corin proteins in cell lysate and recombinant pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-Xpress- or anti-V5 antibody. To examine the pro-ANP processing activity of the soluble corins, EKshortCorin or EKsolCorin was first activated by EK and then added to the conditioned medium containing pro-ANP. Pro-ANP processing was analyzed by Western blotting. To quantify the conversion of pro-ANP to ANP, protein bands were analyzed using the ChemiImager 4400 instrument (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The optical density of the bands representing pro-ANP and ANP was measured, and the percentage of pro-ANP conversion was calculated. For each corin mutant, at least three independent experiments were performed. Detection of Corin Protein on the Cell Surface—HEK 293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either the full-length or mutant corin. As controls, a parental plasmid and plasmids for soluble corins were included. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using the ECL protein biotinylation module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were washed with saline and lysed in 1 ml of a lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and one tablet of protease inhibitors/15 ml). After the removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, recombinant corin proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Xpress- or anti-V5 antibody. To detect total corin proteins, cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Xpress or anti-V5 antibody. The membranes were then stripped with a glycine solution (100 mm, pH 3) and reprobed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin, which detects cell surface proteins. Processing Pro-ANP by EKshortCorin—To assess the importance of the propeptide of corin in pro-ANP processing, we expressed and purified a soluble form of corin, EKshortCorin, that consists of only the catalytic domain and contains an EK recognition sequence at the conserved activation cleavage site (Fig. 1A). EKshortCorin and a control full-length soluble corin, EKsolCorin (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were activated by recombinant EK and tested for their pro-ANP processing activity by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the zymogen forms of EKsolCorin (left panel) and EKshortCorin (right panel) migrated on SDS-PAGE as single bands of ∼150 and ∼38 kDa, respectively. The observed size of EKshortCorin was consistent with its calculated mass of ∼33 kDa. EKshortCorin also contains one putative N-linked glycosylation site (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When treated with increasing concentrations of EK, corin zymogens were converted to two-chain proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Because the V5 tag is located at the C termini of the proteins, the antibody detected only the C-terminal protease domain, which appeared as a band of ∼35 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1B). When activated EKsolCorin and EKshortCorin were added to the conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-ANP, only EKsolCorin, but not EKshortCorin, converted pro-ANP to ANP (Fig. 1B). Catalytic Activity of EKshortCorin—One possibility for the failure of EKshortCorin to cleave pro-ANP could be that the protein was not properly folded in the absence of the propeptide, making it catalytically inactive. We then compared enzyme kinetics of EKshortCorin and EKsolCorin, which is biologically active (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using the chromogenic substrates S-2366 and S-2403. The Km values for EKshortCorin were similar to those of EKsolCorin (3.63 ± 0.48 versus 3.29 ± 0.85 mm for S-2366 and 1.52 ± 0.20 versus 1.40 ± 0.38 mm for S-2403). Similar kcat values also were found for EKshortCorin and EKsolCorin (0.50 ± 0.06 versus 0.43 ± 0.14 s–1 for S-2403 and 0.46 ± 0.06 versus 0.51 ± 0.12 s–1 for S-2366). The results are consistent with the previously published data for EKsolCorin (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and show that EKshortCorin is catalytically active toward small peptide substrates. Effects of Protease Inhibitors—We next examined the effects of protease inhibitors on the catalytic activity of EKshortCorin and EKsolCorin in a chromogenic substrate-based assay. As summarized in Table II, the catalytic activity of EKshortCorin and EKsolCorin was inhibited similarly by trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors including benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor but not by metallo- and cysteine-protease inhibitors such as EDTA and pepstatin. The data show that the active center of EKshortCorin is properly formed consistent with the results from the kinetic studies described above. Together, these data indicate that the propeptide of corin is not necessary for its interactions with small peptide substrates and inhibitors but is required for its interaction with the physiological substrate pro-ANP.Table IIEffects of protease inhibitors on the hydrolytic activity of EKshortCorin and EKsolCorinInhibitorConcentrationInhibition EKshortCorinInhibition EKsolCorin%%EDTA20 mm00Pepstatin50 μm00Benzamidine5 mm92.9 ± 2.390.8 ± 0.650 μm42.9 ± 1.141.0 ± 1.6Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride4 mm92.2 ± 2.591.9 ± 2.150 μm5.3 ± 0.76.3 ± 0.6Leupeptin50 μm76.1 ± 2.875.0 ± 1.35 μm22.9 ± 3.122.0 ± 1.8Soybean trypsin inhibitor0.5 μm93.0 ± 2.193.5 ± 0.60.05 μm83.4 ± 0.881.8 ± 1.5 Open table in a new tab Membrane-bound Corin with Internal Domain Deletions—To understand how different extracellular domains of corin contribute to its activity in pro-ANP processing, we constructed a series of mutants by deleting increasing numbers of domains at the N terminus of the extracellular region (Fig. 2A). All of these mutants were designed to contain the transmembrane domain, allowing us to examine pro-ANP processing in cell-based assays. The plasmids encoding these mutants were transfected in HEK 293 cells. Expression of recombinant corin proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-ANP was incubated with the transfected cells, and pro-ANP processing was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Compared with the full-length corin, mutant corin ΔFz1, which lacks the frizzled 1 domain, exhibited a reduced (∼40%) activity in processing pro-ANP, whereas corin mutants lacking either frizzled 1 domain and LDLR repeats 1–5 (ΔFz1R1–5) or only LDLR repeats 1–5 (ΔR1–5) had no detectable activity of pro-ANP processing. Corin mutants with additional deletions that extend to include frizzled 2 domain, LDLR repeats 6–8, and the scavenger receptor repeat also lost their activities in pro-ANP processing (data not shown). These results indicate that the fragment containing frizzled 1 domain and LDLR repeats 1–5 is critical for the function of corin in pro-ANP processing. Expression of Corin Mutants on the Cell Surface—To exclude the possibility that the corin deletion mutants lost their activity because of the lack of cell surface expression, we examined the cell surface expression using a biotin-labeling method. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the full-length corin or corin mutants ΔFz1, ΔFz1R1–5, and ΔR1–5. Cell surface proteins were then labeled with biotin. Cells transfected with plasmids encoding soluble EKsolCorin and EKshortCorin or a parental vector were included as controls. Cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the full-length corin but that were not biotinylated were used as an additional control. By SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, we showed that the full-length corin and corin mutants ΔFz1, ΔFz1R1–5, ΔR1–5, EKsolCorin, and EKshortCorin proteins were present in cell lysate (Fig. 2C, upper panels). When the same blots were reprobed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, which binds to biotin-labeled cell surface proteins, the full-length corin and mutant corin ΔFz1, ΔFz1R1–5, and ΔR1–5 proteins, but not control soluble EKsolCorin and EKshortCorin, were detected (Fig. 2C, lower panels). No specific bands were detected in cells transfected with the plasmid encoding the full-length corin but not biotinylated or cells transfected with a control vector and biotinylated (Fig. 2C, lower panels). The results show that mutant corin ΔFz1, ΔFz1R1–5, and ΔR1–5 proteins were indeed present on the cell surface. Functional Importance of Individual LDLR Repeats—To determine the functional importance of each individual repeat within the fragment containing LDLR repeats 1–5, we first generated a series of plasmids expressing corin mutants lacking frizzled 1 domain and increasing numbers of LDLR repeats (ΔFz1R1, ΔFz1R12, ΔFz1R1–3, ΔFz1R1–4) (Fig. 3A). The plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and the expression of mutant corin proteins were confirmed by Western analysis of cell lysate (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-ANP was incubated with these cells and pro-ANP processing was analyzed by Western blotting. Consistent with data shown in Fig. 2B, mutant corin ΔFz1 had a reduced activity in pro-ANP processing (Fig. 3B, lower panel). No pro-ANP processing activity was detected in cells expressing corin mutants ΔFz1R1, ΔFz1R12, ΔFz1R1–3, and ΔFz1R1–4 (Fig. 3B, lower panel). These data show that in the absence of frizzled 1 domain deletion of LDLR repeat 1 alone or together with LDLR repeats 2–4 abolished the pro-ANP processing activity of corin. We then constructed a second series of corin mutants that retained frizzled 1 domain but lacking increasing numbers of LDLR repeats 1–4 (ΔR1, ΔR12, ΔR1–3, and ΔR1–4) (Fig. 4A) and expressed them in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4B, upper panel). As shown in pro-ANP processing assays, mutant corin ΔR1 had ∼49% activity, whereas mutant corin ΔR12 had ∼26% activity when compared with that of the full-length corin (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Mutants ΔR1–3 and ΔR1–4 had no detectable activity in pro-ANP processing (Fig. 4B, lower panel). These data show that in the presence of frizzled 1 domain amino acid sequence-spanning LDLR repeats 1–3 are important for corin-mediated pro-ANP processing. To examine the contribution of individual LDLR repeats, we constructed a third series of corin mutants lacking each LDLR repeat (ΔR2, ΔR3, and ΔR4) (Fig. 5A) and expressed them in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5B, upper panel). In pro-ANP processing assays, corin mutants ΔR2, ΔR3, and ΔR4 had ∼12, ∼52, and ∼77% activity, respectively, when compared with that of the full-length corin (Fig. 5B, lower panel). Together with the data from mutant corin ΔR1 (∼49% activity) (Fig. 4B, lower panel), these results show that LDLR repeats 1–4 each contributes to the function of pro-ANP processing with LDLR repeat 2 being the most important. Effect of Point Mutations in LDLR Repeats 1–4 —To further confirm the importance of each repeat in the LDLR1–4 fragment, we constructed a new series of corin mutants by replacing a highly conserved Asp residue with a Tyr residue in LDLR repeats 1, 2, 3, or 4 (D300Y, D336Y, D373Y, and D410Y) (Fig. 6, A and B). In the LDLR, the corresponding Asp residue has been shown to coordinate Ca2+ binding (14Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A), which is required to maintain the structural integrity of the protein. A point mutation at the Asp residue is expected to alter the conformation of individual LDLR repeats without causing structural perturbation to its neighboring repeats (16North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13127-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mutant corin proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6C, upper panel), and their pro-ANP processing activities were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 6C, lower panel) and quantified by densitometry. Corin mutants D300Y, D336Y, D373Y, and D410Y had ∼25, ∼11, ∼16, and ∼82% of pro-ANP processing activities, respectively, compared with that of the full-length corin. These results are consistent with data from corin mutants with single LDLR repeat deletions (Figs. 4 and 5) demonstrating the individual contribution of LDLR repeats 1–4 in pro-ANP processing. In this study, we examined the functional importance of the domain structures in the propeptide of corin for pro-ANP processing. We expressed a soluble corin, EKshortCorin, that consists of only the serine protease domain and contains an EK recognition sequence at the conserved activation cleavage site. We showed that EKshortCorin was activated by EK and retained the catalytic activity when examined in chromogenic substrate-based assays. Unlike the full-length soluble corin, EKsolCorin, which is biologically active (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), EKshortCorin failed to cleave pro-ANP indicating that certain domain structures in the propeptide are required for this activity of corin. We constructed a series of corin mutants by deleting increasing numbers of domain structures starting at the N terminus of the extracellular region. We showed that a deletion of frizzled 1 domain reduced the pro-ANP processing activity, whereas a deletion of LDLR repeats 1–5 abolished the activity. By analyzing additional corin mutants that either lacked individual LDLR repeats or contained point mutations at a conserved Ca2+ binding site in the LDLR repeats, we showed that a region spanning from frizzled 1 domain to LDLR repeat 4 is critical for the activity of corin in processing pro-ANP. Fig. 7 summarizes the corin mutants described in this study and their activities in pro-ANP processing. Corin is a mosaic protease that contains a transmembrane domain near the N terminus and several distinct domain structures in its C-terminal extracellular region. In a recent study, we showed that the transmembrane domain is not required for the activity of corin in pro-ANP processing (13Knappe S. Wu F. Masikat M.R. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52363-52370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the functional importance of other extracellular noncatalytic domains of corin was not determined. Previous studies have shown that noncatalytic domains in the extracellular region of other type II transmembrane serine proteases are important for their biological functions. For example, Lu et al. (17Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have reported that a soluble bovine EK consisting of only the protease domain is catalytically active toward small peptide substrates but fails to activate trypsinogen indicating that the propeptide of EK plays a role in recognizing trypsinogen. In this study, we showed that frizzled 1 domain and LDLR repeats 1–4 in the propeptide of corin are required for the processing of pro-ANP. To our knowledge, EK and corin are the only two members from the type II transmembrane serine protease family for which physiological substrates have been identified. These data suggest that the propeptide in other type II transmembrane serine proteases may also have an important function in interacting with their physiological substrates. It will be important to test this concept in future studies. The frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain, which is ∼120 amino acids in length and contains 10 conserved cysteine residues, was first discovered in members of the Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors for Wnt signaling proteins (18Vinson C.R. Conover S. Adler P.N. Nature. 1989; 338: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 19Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain also has been found in soluble Frizzled-related proteins that act as antagonists of Wnt signaling (20Rattner A. Hsieh J.C. Smallwood P.M.

Studies have shown that the frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain interacts directly with Wnt proteins (23Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), mouse collagen (XVIII) α1 chain (26Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol.

Yancopoulos G.D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xu Y.K. Nusse R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R405-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also contain frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains. A recent study (29Moeller C. Swindell E.C. Kispert A. Eichele G. Development. 2003; 130: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) has indicated that the frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain in chick carboxypeptidase Z binds to Wnt proteins and plays a role in the formation of skeleton. At this time, the functional significance of the frizzled-like domain in collagen (XVIII) α1 chain, muscle-specific kinase, and Smoothened is not known. In this study, we showed that the deletion of frizzled 1 domain reduced the activity of corin in pro-ANP processing by 60%, indicating that the frizzled 1 domain is involved in the interaction of corin with pro-ANP. Thus, our data suggest that frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains have a much broader role in protein-protein interactions. In the extracellular region of corin, there are eight LDLR class A repeats in two separate clusters. This type of repeat, which is ∼40 amino acids in length and contains six conserved cysteine residues, was first identified in the LDLR as lipoprotein binding sites (30Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations in the LDLR repeats alter the function of the receptor and cause familial hypercholesterolemia in patients (32Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that an individual repeat in the LDLR binds differentially to lipoproteins and has an additive effect on ligand binding (33Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In corin, however, the LDLR repeats are unlikely to interact with lipoproteins, because no binding of lipoproteins to mouse corin was detected in cell-based assays (35Tomita Y. Kim D.H. Magoori K. Fujino T. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, we showed that LDLR repeats 1–4 are important for corin to recognize pro-ANP. Corin mutants lacking single LDLR repeats 1–4(ΔR1, ΔR2, ΔR3, and ΔR4) exhibited ∼49, ∼12, ∼53, and ∼77% of pro-ANP processing activities, respectively, compared with that of the full-length corin. We also made corin mutants with a single mutation at a conserved Ca2+-binding Asp residue in LDLR repeats 1, 2, 3, or 4 (D300Y, D336Y, D373Y, and D410Y). The mutation is expected to affect only the function of the individual LDLR repeat in which it resides but not the overall protein structure. Unlike the deletion mutants, the mutants with a single amino acid substitution shall also maintain the distance between the cell membrane and individual LDLR repeats, which may be important for the binding of macromolecular substrates. In pro-ANP processing assays, mutants D300Y, D336Y, D373Y, and D410Y had ∼25, ∼11, ∼16, and ∼82% activities, respectively. The overall data are consistent with the results from corin mutants ΔR1, ΔR2, ΔR3, and ΔR4, showing that LDLR repeats 1–4 all contribute to the binding of pro-ANP and that among these LDLR repeats repeat 2 appears to be most critical, whereas repeat 4 is least important. Based on these results, we propose a model in which pro-ANP binds to corin by interacting with frizzled 1 domain and LDLR repeats 1–4 (Fig. 8). The binding of pro-ANP to this region of corin may allow the protease domain to cleave the substrate more efficiently. It is equally possible that the binding induces conformational changes in pro-ANP, making its activation cleavage site accessible to the protease domain of corin. This model may explain why pro-ANP is resistant to the cleavage by EKshortCorin, which contains only the catalytic domain. At this time, the specific amino acid residues in frizzled 1 domain and LDLR repeats 1–4 of corin that make contact with pro-ANP are not known. Further mutagenesis experiments shall help to verify and refine this model.

https://openalex.org/W2065105198,"A critical event determining the functional consequences of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) endocytosis is the molecular sorting of internalized receptors between divergent recycling and degradative membrane pathways. The D1 dopamine receptor recycles rapidly and efficiently to the plasma membrane after agonist-induced endocytosis and is remarkably resistant to proteolytic down-regulation. Whereas the mechanism mediating agonist-induced endocytosis of D1 receptors has been investigated in some detail, little is known about how receptors are sorted after endocytosis. We have identified a sequence present in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the human D1 dopamine receptor that is specifically required for the efficient recycling of endocytosed receptors back to the plasma membrane. This sequence is distinct from previously identified membrane trafficking signals and is located in a proximal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, in contrast to previously identified GPCR recycling signals present at the distal tip. Nevertheless, fusion of this sequence to the carboxyl terminus of a chimeric mutant δ opioid neuropeptide receptor is sufficient to re-route internalized receptors from lysosomal to recycling membrane pathways, defining this sequence as a bona fide endocytic recycling signal that can function in both proximal and distal locations. These results identify a novel sorting signal controlling the endocytic trafficking itinerary of a physiologically important dopamine receptor, provide the first example of such a sorting signal functioning in a proximal portion of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and suggest the existence of a diverse array of sorting signals in the GPCR superfamily that mediate subtype-specific regulation of receptors via endocytic membrane trafficking.

Dopaminergic signaling is highly regulated under normal physiological conditions, and disturbances in dopamine signaling have been postulated to play a major role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders (1Nestler E.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 578-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Barboi A.C. Goetz C.G. Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 22: 184-191PubMed Google Scholar). Dopamine exerts its biological effects through binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; DOR, δ opioid receptor; DADLE, [2-d-Ala, 5-d-Leu] enkephalin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

Res. 1993; 48: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One point at which dopaminergic signaling is regulated is by controlling the number or functional activity of dopamine receptors themselves, suggesting that mechanisms that regulate dopamine receptors are likely to be of fundamental physiological importance (5Sorkin A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that D1 dopamine receptors undergo rapid endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits after activation by dopamine or synthetic agonist (6Dumartin B. Caille I. Gonon F. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1650-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ariano M.A. Sortwell C.E. Ray M. Altemus K.L. Sibley D.R. Levine M.S.

Studies of other GPCRs indicate that internalized receptors can traverse multiple downstream membrane pathways and thereby meet diverse fates. For example, trafficking of internalized receptors to lysosomes promotes proteolytic down-regulation of receptors and a prolonged attenuation of cell signaling, whereas recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane typically facilitates recovery of cell responsiveness to a subsequent agonist challenge (9Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of D1 dopamine receptors, internalized receptors can recycle rapidly and efficiently to the plasma membrane both in native tissues (6Dumartin B. Caille I. Gonon F. Bloch B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1650-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in transfected cell models (8Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Chaar Z.Y. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9415-9421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the mechanism mediating agonist-induced endocytosis of receptors, the mechanism by which internalized receptors are efficiently recycled is not understood. Many integral membrane proteins recycle to the plasma membrane by “default” via bulk membrane flow (12Mayor S. Presley J. Maxfield F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 13Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). This is not the case for certain GPCRs, where a specific sequence present in a distal portion of the cytoplasmic tail is required to target receptors to a recycling rather than a degradative pathway (14Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 15Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, these previously identified recycling signals are not conserved in the D1 receptor. This raises two fundamental questions regarding the endocytic trafficking of this physiologically important GPCR. First, does the D1 receptor recycle by default, or is the highly efficient recycling characteristic of this GPCR mediated by a specific signal-mediated sorting event? Second, if D1 receptors recycle via a signal-dependent process, what are the structural determinants required, and how do they compare with recycling signals present in other GPCRs? In the present study, we demonstrate that efficient recycling of the D1 dopamine receptor requires a specific sequence present in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. This sequence is completely distinct from sequences required for efficient recycling of other GPCRs and occupies a novel location within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Nevertheless, the D1 receptor-derived sequence constitutes a bona fide recycling signal because it is both necessary for efficient recycling of the D1 receptor and sufficient to promote rapid recycling when fused to the cytoplasmic tail of a distinct GPCR. These observations indicate that whereas signal-mediated recycling is likely to be a rather general principle of GPCR regulation, the structural determinants mediating efficient recycling of specific GPCRs are remarkably divergent in both their primary structure and location within the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—The human D1 dopamine receptor (cDNA provided by Dr. David Grandy; Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) was epitope-tagged at the extracellular amino terminus with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, as described previously (8Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M.

The functional integrity of this epitope-tagged receptor has been demonstrated previously (8Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A FLAG-tagged version of the murine δ opioid receptor (DOR) (21Evans C.J. Keith D.J. Morrison H. Magendzo K. Edwards R.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1952-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) was described previously (20Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

FLAG-DOR-D1-(360–382), FLAG-DOR-D1-(370–375), and FLAG-DOR-D1-(372–380) tail fusion constructs were generated by insertion of synthetic linker-adapters (Operon Technologies) encoding the indicated regions of the D1 receptor cytoplasmic tail followed by a stop codon into an SrfI site present in the FLAG-DOR coding construct. This approach was used previously to investigate trafficking signals in adrenergic and opioid receptors (15Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

FLAG-DOR-D1-(360–366) and FLAG-DOR-D1-(360–373) were generated from FLAG-DOR-D1-(360–382) using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene) to introduce a stop codon at the appropriate location and then inserted into the DOR tail using an endogenous SrfI site. This strategy eliminates the distal six amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus of the DOR, which does not detectably affect the endocytic trafficking of this receptor to lysosomes (23Murray S.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor cDNAs were subcloned into pIRES-neo (Clontech) for expression and selection of polyclonal populations of stably transfected cells (see below). All constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (University of California San Francisco Genetics Core Sequencing Facility). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cells grown in 6-cm dishes were transfected with ∼5 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the indicated receptor by calcium phosphate precipitation. For studies of receptor trafficking in transiently transfected cells, cells were transfected as described above and plated onto coverslips 24 h after transfection, and experiments were conducted 24 h thereafter. Stably transfected cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors were generated by selection for neomycin resistance in 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 14–21 days (15Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Individual clones were not selected in order to allow biochemical analysis of a polyclonal cell population. Examination of Receptor Endocytosis and Recycling by Fluorescence Microscopy—A previously described method was used to visualize endocytosis and recycling of receptors after specific labeling in the plasma membrane with monoclonal antibody (15Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably or transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing the indicated receptor constructs were plated on glass coverslips (Corning), and surface receptors were specifically labeled by incubating intact cells with M1 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma) or HA.11 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml; Berkeley Antibody Co.) at 37 °C for 25 min in the absence of agonist. The cells were then incubated (37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of either 10 μm dopamine (Sigma) to activate D1 receptors or 10 μm [2-d-Ala, 5-d-Leu] enkephalin (DADLE; Research Biochemicals) to activate FLAG-DOR-D1 fusion constructs. After this incubation, cells were either fixed immediately, to visualize internalization of epitope-tagged receptors, or subsequently washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for an additional 45 min at 37 °Cin the presence of 10 μm of the appropriate dopamine or opioid antagonist (SCH23390 or naloxone, respectively) to evaluate recycling after endocytosis. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 10 min and then quenched with three washes of Tris-buffered saline with 1 mm CaCl2. Specimens were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in Blotto (3% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1: 500 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min to detect epitope-tagged receptors. Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon 60x NA1.4 objective and epifluorescence optics. Images were collected using a 12-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced to a Macintosh computer. Estimation of Receptor Recycling by a Ratiometric Immunofluorescence Assay—To estimate the extent of recycling in transiently or stably transfected cells, a modification of a recently described method using quantitative fluorescence microscopy was applied (18Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-DOR-D1 fusion constructs were grown on glass coverslips (Corning), and surface receptors were labeled (30 min at room temperature) with Alexa 488-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody (2.0 μg/ml; Sigma). Cells were subsequently treated (37 °C for 30 min) with 10 μm DADLE to drive internalization. At the end of this incubation, cells were quickly washed three times in PBS containing 0.04% EDTA and lacking Ca2+ or Mg2+ to strip residual surface receptors of antibody, followed by an additional incubation in culture medium (37 °C for 45 min) in the presence of the opiate antagonist naloxone (10 μm) to block possible residual agonist. Cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde freshly dissolved in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (conditions that do not permeabilize cells), and residual fixative was quenched with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Recycled receptors were detected by incubating the fixed, nonpermeabilized cells for 30 min at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) in the same nonpermeabilizing buffer. For each receptor construct examined, two parallel control coverslips were included, in which cells were fixed after a 30-min incubation in the absence of agonist and without an EDTA stripping step (100% recycled control) or immediately after the EDTA stripping step following agonist exposure (0% recycled control). Specimens were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy using a fixed illumination intensity. Twenty to thirty cells from each coverslip were selected at random, and red (representing recycled receptors) and green (representing total internalized receptors) images were visualized separately using appropriate dichroic filter sets (Omega Optical). Images were acquired using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) with fixed exposure times to assure linearity of fluorescence intensity determinations across samples. The total fluorescence intensity for each fluorochrome was integrated over the cell area using IP lab image software. The average red/green (surface/total) ratio for each experimental coverslip was scaled between the ratios from the corresponding 0% and 100% recycled controls, computed as described previously (18Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), to estimate the percentage of recycled receptors. Three to five experiments were conducted in this way, and results were averaged for the final values reported. Error bars represent the S.E. across replicate experiments. Quantification of Receptor Internalization and Recycling by Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—Internalization and recycling of epitope-tagged receptors were measured in stably transfected cell clones using a variant of a previously described flow cytometric assay (22Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of stably transfected cells expressing the indicated FLAG or HA-tagged receptor construct were incubated in the presence of 10 μm agonist (dopamine or DADLE) for 30 min at 37 °C and then chilled on ice. To estimate recycling after agonist washout, monolayers were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of dopaminergic or opiate antagonist (10 μm SCH23390 or naloxone, respectively). At the indicated time points after agonist washout, cell monolayers were again chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking. Cells were dissociated from dishes using 0.04% EDTA in PBS lacking Ca2+ or Mg2+ (PBS/EDTA; University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cell suspensions were washed twice in 1 ml of PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 45–60 min in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2.5 μg/ml M1 anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) using standard methods or 3F10 anti-HA monoclonal antibody that was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Surface receptor immunoreactivity was measured using fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence intensity of 20,000 cells was collected for each sample, and each condition was tested in triplicate samples. Cellquest software (BD Biosciences) was used to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity of the cell populations, and fractional internalization and recycling of receptors were calculated from these measurements as described previously. All experiments were conducted at least three times with similar results. The values reported represent internalization and recycling determinations averaged across all experiments conducted, and the error bars represent the S.E. Quantification of Receptor Degradation by Permeabilized Flow Cytometry—A flow cytometric assay was used to determine the total amount of epitope-tagged receptor immunoreactivity in permeabilized cells, and this measure was used to estimate agonist-induced proteolysis of receptors. Stably transfected cells expressing the indicated HA D1 or FLAG-DOR-D1 receptor construct were plated on 12-well plates (Corning), allowed to reach confluence, and then exposed to a saturating concentration (10 μm) of agonist (dopamine or DADLE) for 30 min or 1, 2, or 4 h. Then cells were chilled on ice and recovered from dishes using a PBS-based reagent devoid of protease activity (Cell Dissociation Buffer; Invitrogen). Cell suspensions were washed with PBS and then gently pelleted using a swinging bucket rotor (Sorvall) at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, the pellet was resuspended in PBS, 1% formaldehyde was added, and cells were incubated with fixative for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS using gentle pelleting, and the fixed cell suspension was permeabilized by incubation for 30 min on ice with 0.2% Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS. Permeabilized cells were incubated in the presence of either anti-HA fluorescein-conjugated high-affinity 3F10 antibody (1 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) or Alexa 488-conjugated M1 antibody (3 μg/ml) in a 0.2% Triton X-100/0.3% bovine serum albumin/PBS solution for 60 min to allow labeling of epitope-tagged receptors present in both the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments of fixed cells. Then cells were washed several times with PBS to remove residual antibody not bound to epitope-tagged receptors, and cells were post-fixed in 1% formaldehyde/PBS and analyzed using a BD Biosciences fluorescence-activated cell sorter. A total of 20,000 fixed cells were analyzed for each sample, and mean fluorescence intensity was determined to estimate the total number of immunoreactive receptors in the cell populations. Mean fluorescence intensity values obtained from agonist-treated cells were normalized to the values determined from control cells not exposed to agonist, in order to determine agonist-induced proteolytic degradation. Nontransfected HEK293 cells were used for measurement of nonspecific background staining, which was always <5% of the total. Values reported indicate mean total receptor immunoreactivity determined across three to four experiments for each construct, and error bars represent the S.E. To determine whether the D1 dopamine receptor contains a sequence necessary for its efficient recycling after agonist-induced endocytosis, we began by testing the effects of progressively truncating the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). The rationale for this approach is that studies of several other mammalian GPCRs indicate that sequences controlling recycling of internalized receptors are located at or near the extreme carboxyl terminus of the receptor protein. We first tested whether carboxyl-terminal truncations prevented the ability of receptors to undergo initial agonist-induced endocytosis. An HA-tagged version of the human D1 receptor internalized rapidly in stably transfected HEK293 cells after the addition of 10 μm dopamine to the culture medium (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous studies (7Ariano M.A. Sortwell C.E.

A series of truncation mutations that remove a limited distal portion of the cytoplasmic tail (HA-D1–436T), a middle portion (HA-D1–382T), or essentially the entire tail beyond the predicted eighth helical domain (HA-D1–359T) were then tested (Fig. 1). All of these mutant receptors exhibited significant rapid internalization in response to dopamine (Fig. 2A), making it feasible to test the ability of these mutant receptors to recycle to the plasma membrane after agonist washout.Fig. 2Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the D1 receptor selectively inhibits recycling of receptors after agonist-induced internalization.A, truncation of the D1 receptor cytoplasmic tail does not prevent agonist-induced internalization. Agonist-induced internalization of the HA-tagged full-length D1 receptor (D1 (wt)) or the indicated truncated mutant receptors was estimated using fluorescence flow cytometry to measure the decrease in surface receptor immunoreactivity produced by exposure of stably transfected HEK293 cells to 10 μm dopamine for 30 min. The agonist-induced decrease in surface receptor immunoreactivity is expressed as a percentage of the surface receptor immunoreactivity measured in control (untreated) cells. Bars represent mean percentage internalization of receptors derived from four independent experiments, with 20,000 cells analyzed per condition in each experiment. Error bars represent the S.E. across the experiments. B, truncation of the D1 receptor cytoplasmic tail inhibits recycling after agonist-induced internalization. Surface receptor immunoreactivity was measured by flow cytometry in stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing the HA-tagged full-length D1 receptor (D1 (wt)) or the indicated truncated mutant receptors after agonist pretreatment (10 μm dopamine for 30 min), agonist washout, and subsequent incubation with antagonist (10 μm SCH23390) at 37 °C for 60 min. Fractional recycling was calculated by expressing this surface receptor immunoreactivity measured after these incubations as a percentage of that measured in control (untreated) cells. Data points represent mean determinations derived from four independent experiments, with 20,000 cells analyzed per condition in each experiment. Error bars represent the S.E. across the experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. *, p < 0.05 when compared with wild-type HA-tagged D1. C, the HA-D1–359T truncated mutant receptor is specifically defective in recycling. Surface receptor immunoreactivity of stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing either the HA-tagged full-length D1 receptor (wt) or the mutant receptor truncated after residue 359 (359T) was measured by fluorescence flow cytometry 30 min before agonist addition (t = –30), after exposure to 10 μm dopamine for 30 min (t = 0), or after dopamine exposure followed by agonist washout and antagonist exposure (10 μm SCH23390) for 30 or 60 min (t = 30 or 60, respectively). Data points represent mean surface receptor fluorescence intensity (normalized to untreated control cells) from three independent experiments, with 20,000 cells analyzed per condition in each experiment. Error bars represent the S.E. across the experiments. D, the HA-D1–359T truncated mutant receptor is visualized in endocytic vesicles after agonist washout. Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing the indicated receptor were plated on glass coverslips, and then surfacereceptors were specifically labeled using anti-HA monoclonal antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the localization of antibody-labeled receptors was visualized in cells not exposed to ligand (Untreated), incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm dopamine (Agonist), or incubated for 30 min with dopamine followed by agonist washout and incubation for 45 min in the presence of 10 μm of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 (Agonist→Antagonist). Representative micrographs of individual cells are shown. Whereas the HA-D1–382T truncated receptor redistributed almost completely to the plasma membrane after agonist washout, internalized HA-D1–359T mutant receptors remained predominantly in intracellular membrane structures (examples are indicated by arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the several GPCRs previously shown to contain a sequence necessary for efficient recycling, the required sequences are located either at the extreme carboxyl terminus or in a distal portion of the cytoplasmic tail in all cases (14Cao T.T.

Knowledge of which regions in P-gp undergo conformational alterations will provide vital information to elucidate the locations of drug binding sites and the mechanism of coupling. A number of investigations have implicated transmembrane segment six (TM6) in drug-P-gp interactions, and a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis approach was directed to this segment. Introduction of cysteine residues into TM6 did not disturb basal or drug-stimulated ATPase activity per se. Under basal conditions the hydrophobic probe coumarin maleimide readily labeled all introduced cysteine residues, whereas the hydrophilic fluorescein maleimide only labeled residue Cys-343. The amphiphilic BODIPY-maleimide displayed a more complex labeling profile. The extent of labeling with coumarin maleimide did not vary during the catalytic cycle, whereas fluorescein maleimide labeling of F343C was lost after nucleotide binding or hydrolysis. BODIPY-maleimide labeling was markedly altered during the catalytic cycle and indicated that the adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate-bound and ADP/vanadate-trapped intermediates were conformationally distinct. Our data are reconciled with a recent atomic scale model of P-gp and are consistent with a tilting of TM6 in response to nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis occurs in the two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) (8al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are essential for transport activity (9Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Active transport mechanisms require (i) binding site re-orientation and (ii) binding site affinity changes that are directly coupled to the provision of energy, usually through ATP hydrolysis (11Tanford C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 379-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Krupka R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 114-122PubMed Google Scholar). These fundamental events in a transport cycle have been demonstrated for P-gp, and the data have generated possible models outlining the sequence of binding site changes driven by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (13Martin C.

Drug binding to the TMDs is known to stimulate ATP hydrolysis (15Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Sharom F.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), providing evidence for TMD → NBD communication. The reverse communication pathway has also been observed (18Druley T.E. Stein W.D. Roninson I.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4312-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and numerous biophysical techniques have demonstrated that P-gp undergoes tertiary structural changes in response to both nucleotide binding and subsequent hydrolysis (19Sonveaux N.

Direct evidence that the TMDs undergo functionally important conformational transitions has been obtained from structural investigations using electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals (21Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F.

However, this evidence does not indicate which of the 12 transmembrane segments is affected or which protein regions transduce the communication between TMDs and NBDs. Structural evidence has proposed that the TMD is organized into a “ring” of protein surrounding a central aqueous pore (21Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D.

Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) and MsbA (24Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Initial topographical maps using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis rejected the symmetric and mirror image arrangements of TM segments for P-gp in favor of the “cyclone model” (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, a more recent manuscript by the same authors has revised this model (26Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), reverting to the initial suggestion of a ring of helices surrounding the aqueous central pore. Clearly, more work is required to elucidate the precise configuration of TM segments in P-gp. A consistent feature of such investigations has been that (i) TM segments 6 and 12 approach each other at the cytoplasmic membrane face (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, an atomic scale model of P-gp, based on the MsbA structure, has been proposed that agrees with the two points taken from cross-linking data (30Stenham D.R. Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S. Higgins C.F. Kerr I.D. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This model allows more focused site-directed mutagenesis investigations to fully elucidate the protein topography. The earliest attempts to elucidate the drug binding site(s) labeled P-gp with photoactivable drugs and identification of proteolytic fragments using specific antibodies (5Greenberger L.M. Lisanti C.J. Silva J.T. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20744-20751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bruggeman E.P. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol.

The labeled fragments comprised elements of TM helices 5, 6, 11, and 12, although many other species were observed. A recent investigation using the more sophisticated mass spectroscopic approach identified similar structural elements (33Ecker G.F. Csaszar E. Kopp S. Plagens B. Holzer W. Ernst W. Chiba P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, it is worth noting that a major drawback with photoactivable drugs is their inherent reactivity and, thus, may label residues distant to the actual pharmacophoric region (34Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Striessnig J. Goll A. Moosburger K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Investigations employing mutagenesis approaches identified numerous residues throughout the TM segments of P-gp that contribute to protein function (35Gros P. Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7289-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Kajiji S. Talbot F. Grizzuti K. Van Dyke-Phillips V. Agresti M. Safa A.R. Gros P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16400-16409Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They were not confined to a single TM segment; however, a significant proportion was localized to TM6. Selection of cell lines in actinomycin D (39Devine S.E. Ling V. Melera P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4564-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or doxorubicin with PSC833 (40Chen G. Duran G.E. Steger K.A. Lacayo N.J. Jaffrezou J.P. Dumontet C. Sikic B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5974-5982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) produced expression of P-gp with mutations to different residues within TM6, and in both cases the mutation led to an altered spectrum of resistance compared with wild type protein. Site-directed mutagenesis also indicated that residues Ser-337, Val-338, Ile-340, Gly-341, Ala-342, Ser-344, and Gly-346 were involved in drug transport by P-gp. Because most of these investigations use cellular drug resistance profiles as the indicator for P-gp function. it is unclear what aspect of the transport cycle was impaired (e.g. drug binding or allosteric communication). These lines of circumstantial evidence clearly implicate TM6 as playing a defining role in the overall transport mechanism. TM6 is directly linked to the N-terminal NBD, and a role in communication may be hypothesized. The present investigation uses a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis approach combined with fluorescent labeling to elucidate the topography of this key TM segment in P-gp. The protein was then trapped in nucleotide-bound and post-hydrolytic conformations of the catalytic cycle to ascertain the nature of conformational changes in TM6 produced by events in the NBDs. The results were explained using the recently described atomic model of P-gp. Materials—BODIPY-maleimide, fluorescein-maleimide, and coumarin-maleimide were all purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, NL). Octyl-β-d-glucoside and nickel nitrilotriacetic acid His Bind Superflow resin were obtained from Merck. [3H]Phosphatidylcholine (83 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) disodium adenosine triphosphate (Na2ATP), cholesterol, vinblastine, nicardipine and sodium orthovanadate were all from Sigma. Crude Escherichia coli lipid extract was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Insect-Xpress medium was purchased from Cambrex BioScience (Nottingham, UK), and Excell 405 was from AMS Biotechnology (Abingdon, UK). All other reagents were of at least analytical grade. Production of Recombinant Baculovirus—Expression and characterization of a cysteine-less, histidine-tagged P-gp in mammalian cells has been described (41Blott E.J. Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6800-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Taylor A.M. Storm J. Soceneantu L. Linton K.J. Gabriel M. Martin C. Woodhouse J. Blott E. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Single cysteines were introduced into the cysteine-less multidrug resistance (MDR1)-coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (41Blott E.J. Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6800-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following mutagenic oligonucleotides were used (5′ to 3′; in each case the cysteine codon is in bold): oligoV331C, TCTATTGGACAATGCCTCACTGTA; oligoT333C, ATTGGACAAGTTCTCTGCGTATTCTTTTC; oligoF335C, CTCACTGTATGCTTTTCTGTGTTAATTGGG; oligoS337C, CTGTATTCTTTTGTGTGTTAATTGGG; oligoL339C, CTTTTCTGTATGCATTGGGGCT; oligoG341C, CTGTATTAATTTGCGCATTTAGTGTTGG; oligoF343C, TTTTCTGTATTGATTGGGGCTTGTAGTGTTGG. Additionally, all oligonucleotides were designed to generate a restriction site, which is silent with respect to the coding sequence. This was done to monitor subsequent cloning steps by restriction digest profiles (italicized if outside the cysteine codon). The nucleotide sequences of the mutated DNA fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. The entire coding sequence for cysteine-less-P-gp and single cysteine mutants, including the 5′ Kozak sequence, was introduced into the baculoviral transfer vector pBacPAK9 (Clontech), and recombinant baculoviruses were generated by in vivo recombination with BacPAK6 DNA (Clontech). Expression of P-gp and Isolation of Insect Cell Membranes—The Trichoplusia ni (High Five) cell line was routinely used for the expression of P-gp and maintained in shaking suspension cultures as previously described (42Taylor A.M. Storm J. Soceneantu L. Linton K.J. Gabriel M. Martin C. Woodhouse J. Blott E. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). High Five cells at a density of ∼3.106 cells/ml were infected with recombinant baculovirus (∼5.107 plaque-forming units/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. After 2 h of incubation with virus, the cells were diluted to a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml and grown for a further 3 days before harvesting by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min). Crude membrane preparations were isolated as previously described (42Taylor A.M. Storm J. Soceneantu L. Linton K.J. Gabriel M. Martin C. Woodhouse J. Blott E. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the final membrane preparations were stored in high sucrose buffer at -80 °C for up to 6 months before further use. Purification and Reconstitution of P-gp—Membrane preparations were solubilized in buffer containing 2% (w/v) octyl-β-d-glucoside and P-gp-purified using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid by virtue of the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Reconstitution of the purified protein was achieved by selective detergent adsorption, and efficiency was monitored by comparing lipid and protein migration after sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Full details of the purification and reconstitution procedures have been described previously (42Taylor A.M. Storm J. Soceneantu L. Linton K.J. Gabriel M. Martin C. Woodhouse J. Blott E. Higgins C.F.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7780-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Concentration—Commercial protein assay kits could not be used to quantify P-gp concentrations due to unacceptable levels of interference due to the presence of lipids, imidazole, and glycerol. Consequently, a densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels was used. The P-gp bands were compared with a series of known amounts of bovine serum albumin (0.2–1.0 μg) on the same gel. Gels were stained with 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Blue (1–2 h) in 50% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Destaining was achieved using 5% (v/v) methanol in 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The intensity of protein bands was determined by quantitative densitometry using the NIH Image Software. Measurement of ATP Hydrolysis—ATP hydrolysis was determined by measurement of inorganic phosphate liberation using a colorimetric assay (44Chifflet S. Chiesa U.T.R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) with previously described modifications (42Taylor A.M. Storm J. Soceneantu L. Linton K.J. Gabriel M. Martin C. Woodhouse J. Blott E. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reconstituted protein (0.3 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with varying concentrations of Na2ATP (0–1.75 mm). To determine the drug-stimulated ATPase activity, samples were incubated with 30 μm nicardipine. The ATPase activity (nmol of Pi released/min/mg of P-gp) was plotted as a function of ATP concentration, and the maximal velocity (Vmax) and substrate affinity (KmATP) were determined by non-linear regression of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Where information on the effects of drugs on P-gp activity was required, the ATPase activity was measured as above except at a constant ATP concentration of 2 mm. The drugs (nicardipine and vinblastine) were added from stocks in Me2SO to provide a range between 10-9 and 10-4m. The ATPase activity was plotted as a function of drug concentration, and the potency of effect (EC50 or IC50) was derived from non-linear regression of the general dose-response equation, V=Vmin+Vmax−Vmin1+10(log EC50−[L]) eq.1 where V is the rate of ATP hydrolysis, Vmin is minimal activity, Vmax is maximal activity, and [L] is drug concentration. Octanol:Water Partition Coefficient—The polarities of the three fluorescent probes, coumarin-maleimide (CM), fluorescein-maleimide (FM), and BODIPY-maleimide (BM) were determined by assessment of relative partitioning between aqueous and octanol solutions. Fluorophores were added to 1 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) in a concentration range of 3–100 μm. Octanol (1 ml) was added, and the solutions were mixed by rotation for at least 12 h at 20 °C to reach partition equilibrium. After phase separation, absorption spectra were recorded (Hitachi U-1200 spectrophotometer), and the maximal absorbance was determined according to Beer's Law. The extinction coefficients were: FM = 83,000 cm-1m-1, CM = 33,000 cm-1m-1, and BM = 88,000 cm-1m-1 as provided by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Leiden NL). The ratio of the amount in the octanol compared with the aqueous phase was calculated (P). The logarithm10 of this ratio (log P) indicates the relative polarity. Time Courses for Labeling of Single Cysteine-containing P-gp Isoforms—The time courses for reaction of maleimide-containing probes with single cysteine mutant P-gp isoforms were undertaken to enable determination of both the extent of labeling and the half-life describing the reaction. Purified, reconstituted P-gp (1.5–3 μg) was incubated at 20 °C with fluorescent probes (10 μm) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 300 min. These conditions provided at least a 100-fold molar excess of probe to P-gp to ensure that ligand depletion did not occur. Probes were added from concentrated stocks in Me2SO, and the final solvent concentration did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). Reaction with probe was terminated by the addition of excess dithiothreitol (100 μm), and the samples were immediately placed on ice. Samples were diluted 1:1 in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.02% NaN3) to reduce the glycerol content and subjected to ultracentrifugation (125,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The resulting pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved with 6% SDS-PAGE. To trap P-gp in the nucleotide-bound state the samples were preincubated in the presence of AMP-PNP (2 mm) for 20 min before the addition of fluorophore (13Martin C. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15733-15742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Vanadate trapping was achieved by preincubation of the protein with 2 mm ATP and 300 μm sodium orthovanadate at 37 °C for 30 min before probe addition (13Martin C. Higgins C.F. Callaghan R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15733-15742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A further sample of denatured P-gp (i.e. fully accessible cysteine residues) was included in each assay to determine the signal produced by 100% labeling. The sample was subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above and resuspended in 2% (w/v) SDS to denature the protein and then incubated in the presence of probe (10 μm) for a further 3 h. Analysis of P-gp Labeling with Cysteine-reactive Fluorescent Probes—Gels from the labeling reactions described above were analyzed using the BioDocIt Imaging system (UVP), which comprised a UV light source (λ = 302 nm) and a CCD camera. Images of the gels were quantified using densitometric analysis (NIH Image Software). Fluorescence intensity of the P-gp bands were expressed as a percentage of the denatured sample and plotted as a function of labeling time. The profiles were fitted using non-linear regression of the exponential association curve, L=Lmax×(1−e−kt) eq.2 where L is the percent labeled, Lmax is the maximum percent labeled, t is time (min), and k is the observed rate constant for labeling. The labeling rate constant may be converted to a half-life by the relationship t½ = Ln2/k. After imaging, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue for 30 min as described above to ensure equivalent protein loading. Data Analysis—All non-linear regression analyses were produced using the GraphPad Prism3.0 program. A minimum data set was obtained from at least three independent protein purification preparations, and all values are given as the mean ± S.E. Multiple data comparisons (>3 sets) were analyzed using ANOVA with a Newman-Keul post-hoc test, and statistical significance was presumed where p < 0.05. Introduction of Single Cysteines into TM6 of P-gp Has Little Effect on the ATPase Activity—Expression levels for the various P-gp isoforms were similar (data not shown), and the yield of purified protein from 50 mg of crude membrane was in the range 41 ± 4 μg (S337C) to 65 ± 9 μg (Cys-less). Only the F335C isoform was consistently outside this range (p < 0.05, n > 10) and exhibited a yield of 28 ± 6 μg of P-gp. Reconstitution efficiencies were typically 95% of the protein co-migrating through sucrose gradients with 80% of the total lipid. Those samples where less than 70% of the protein co-migrated with less than 70% of total lipid displayed low ATPase activity and were excluded from further analysis. The basal ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp displayed a maximal activity (Vmax) of 0.58 ± 0.15 μmol of Pi min-1 mg-1 characterized by an ATP affinity (Km) of 0.58 ± 0.06 mm (Table I). In the presence of the non-transported P-gp modulator nicardipine, the activity was stimulated 2.9 ± 0.3-fold to a Vmax = 1.46 μmol of Pi min-1 mg-1. In contrast, the Km for ATP was only marginally reduced to 0.38 ± 0.04 mm. The maximal unstimulated ATPase activities of the mutant P-gp isoforms containing a single cysteine in TM6 were in the range 0.35–0.65 μmol of Pi min-1 mg-1, none of which was significantly different to that observed for Cys-less protein (Table I). Similarly, the Km values (0.40–0.53 mm) did not differ statistically between the TM6 mutant isoforms, indicating that the catalytic cycle remained intact. Despite the introduction of mutations at positions throughout TM6, both the maximal ATPase activity (1.12–1.67 μmol of Pi min-1 mg-1) and the degree of stimulation (2.2–3.5-fold basal) in the presence of nicardipine were not statistically different from the values observed for Cys-less P-gp (Table I). This indicates that the communication from the nicardipine binding site to the NBDs was unaffected by any of the changes introduced into TM6.Table ICharacteristics of basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activity for purified reconstituted single cysteine mutants of P-gp Pure, reconstituted P-gp (0.3 μg) was incubated in the presence of varying ATP concentrations (0–1.75 mm), and the ATPase activity was determined by measurement of inorganic phosphate liberation. Basal activity was measured in the absence of any drugs, whereas stimulated activity was determined in the presence of 30 μm nicardipine. The substrate affinity (Km) and maximal activity (Vmax) were determined by non-linear regression of the Michaelis-Menten equation. -Fold stimulation was determined by the ratio of Vmax (stimulated)/Vmax (basal).

However, as shown in Table II, the potency for nicardipine to stimulate ATP hydrolysis did not vary significantly between the various isoforms (EC50 = 2.1–3.9 μm). This confirms that the nicardipine-P-gp interaction is unaffected by the mutations introduced into TM6. It has been previously demonstrated that P-gp contains at least four distinct drug binding sites (4Martin C. Berridge G. Higgins C.F. Mistry P. Charlton P. Callaghan R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) within the TMD. To examine the possibility that the introduced mutation"

The ydaG and ydbA genes of Lactococcus lactis encode two ATP-binding cassette half-transporters, which both share homology with MDR proteins such as LmrA from L. lactis or the mammalian P-glycoprotein. The ydaG/ydbA genes were cloned and expressed separately and jointly in L. lactis using the nisin-inducible system. When both proteins are co-expressed, several structurally dissimilar drugs such as ethidium, daunomycin, and BCECF-AM are extruded from the cell. YdaG and YdbA could be co-purified as a stable heterodimer. ATPase activity was found to be associated with the YdaG/YdbA heterodimer only and not with the individual subunits. Both the ydaG and ydbA genes are up-regulated in multidrug-resistant L. lactis strains selected for growth in the presence of a variety of toxic compounds. This is the first demonstration of a functional heterodimeric ATP-binding cassette-type MDR transporter.

This is the first demonstration of a functional heterodimeric ATP-binding cassette-type MDR transporter. Multidrug resistance is a phenomenon that has first been attributed to the active efflux of drugs that renders tumor cells resistant toward structurally unrelated compounds, thereby causing a serious problem in chemotherapy of cancer (1Litman T. Druley T.E. Stein W.D. Bates S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Later, it was realized that similar transporters in bacteria are responsible for multiple resistance to antibiotics and other toxic compounds (2Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The wide spread of (multi)drug-resistant microorganisms is a serious treat to the effectiveness of antibiotics, and accordingly, previously curable infectious diseases reemerge, posing an increasing public health problem (3Travis J. Science. 1994; 264: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Jenkinson H.F. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Cohen M.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The extrusion of noxious agents which are unrelated in terms of their chemical structures is catalyzed by so-called multidrug resistance (MDR) 1The abbreviations used are: MDR, multidrug resistance; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; TMD, transmembrane domain; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; ST II, Streptag II; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxylfluorescein; AM, acetoxymethyl ester. transporters. These transporters can be divided into two major classes on the basis of bioenergetic and homology criteria: 1) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) primary active transporters, which utilize the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive substrate transport across the lipid bilayer; and 2) secondary transporters, which use the proton or sodium motive force for substrate transport. The latter class includes most of the bacterial multidrug efflux systems described to date (6Blackmore C.G. McNaughton P.A. van Veen H.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

McKeegan K.S. Walmsley A.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 313-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The former class comprises well characterized eukaryotic MDR transporters such as P-glycoprotein, MRP1, and BCRP (1Litman T. Druley T.E. Stein W.D. Bates S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 10Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev.

Surprisingly, only few homologs of eukaryotic ABC-type MDRs have been characterized in bacteria: LmrA from Lactococcus lactis (12van Veen H.W. Venema K. Bolhuis H. Oussenko I. Kok J. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10668-10672Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), BmrA (YvcC) from Bacillus subtilis (13Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and HorA of Lactobacillus brevis (14Sakamoto K. Margolles A. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5371-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These proteins are believed to function as homodimeric MDR transporters. Genomic sequences, however, show a ubiquitous distribution of putative MDR ABC-type pumps (15Paulsen I.T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Saier Jr., M.H. Paulsen I.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), but these systems have not yet been linked to multidrug resistance in bacteria. ABC transporters are usually composed of four domains: two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) with typically six membrane-spanning α-helices and two membrane-associated, hydrophilic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) (17Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 18Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar, 19Kerr I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1561: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The TMDs are believed to accommodate the substrate binding site(s). The diversity of the substrates transported by members of ABC transporters is reflected by a low conservation of the TMDs sequences. In contrast, amino acid sequences of the NBDs are evolutionarily highly conserved with the Walker A and B motifs of the ATP binding domain as well as motifs unique to ABC transporters (i.e. the ABC signature, the histidine, and the glutamine loop) (19Kerr I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1561: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Chang G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). With many bacterial ABC transporters, the four domains are contained in separate proteins, whereas in eukaryotes, these domains are mostly fused to yield a so-called “full-transporter” that accommodates all domains in a single polypeptide (19Kerr I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1561: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Lage H. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2003; 22: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In “half-transporters,” one TMD is fused to an NBD, and these proteins either homo- or heterodimerize to form the active unit. The Gram-positive bacterium L. lactis harbors at least two multidrug transporters (i.e. LmrP, a secondary drug extrusion system that mediates a drug/H+ antiport activity, and LmrA, an ABC MDR transporter). In addition, some strains contain a plasmid-encoded LmrA homolog termed LmrB that is responsible for the extrusion of the bacteriocin, lactococcin (22Gajic O. Buist G. Kojic M. Topisirovic L. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34291-34298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). L. lactis exhibits several different MDR-like transport activities (23Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that are not explained by the presence of the well characterized transporters LmrA and LmrP. Most importantly, strains with a deletion of the lmrP (25Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or lmrA gene (Fig. 2B) exhibit an unaltered ability to secrete ethidium from the cell. This implies that there must be other MDR-like transporters active in L. lactis that so far have escaped detection. Analysis of the recently published genome of L. lactis ssp. lactis IL1403 (26Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) indeed indicates the presence of another MDR-like transport system. Here we report on two open reading frames ydaG and ydbA that are predicted to be co-transcribed and that encode two separate MDR-like half-transporters. The data demonstrate that YdaG and YdbA heterodimerize to form a functional MDR transporter. This is the first report on a heterodimeric ABC MDR transporter. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) which lacks the MDR transporter LmrA (22Gajic O. Buist G. Kojic M. Topisirovic L. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34291-34298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from O. Gajic and J. Kok, Department of Genetics, University of Groningen) was used as a host for expression of pNG8048E-based plasmids with the nisincontrolled promoter (27de Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multidrug-resistant mutants of L. lactis MG1363 selected for growth in the presence of ethidium (Ethr), daunomycin (Daur), and rhodamine (Rhor) were described by Bolhuis et al. (23Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol when necessary. Recombinant DNA Techniques—DNA manipulation was performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The ydaG and ydbA genes were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of L. lactis IL1403. NcoI and XbaI restriction sites flanking the genes were introduced to enable cloning into expression vector pNS8048E, resulting in pNSGA. This plasmid contains both ydaG and ydbA genes under control of the nisin-inducible promoter with a C-terminal Streptag II on YdbA. ydaG and ydbA were cloned separately using the same strategy, and this resulted in the plasmids pNSG and pNSA encoding for YdaG and YdbA with a C-terminal Streptag II, respectively. All cloned genes were verified by DNA sequencing to confirm that no PCR-borne mutations were introduced. RNA Techniques—RT-PCR was used to assess the expression levels of ydaG and ydbA in a series of multidrug-resistant mutants of L. lactis MG1363 (23Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer sets were chosen to amplify internal fragments of 320, 318, and 375 bp of ydaG, ydbA, and the secY gene, respectively (Table I). Total RNA was isolated from L. lactis strains using High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science), and RT-PCR reactions were performed with ReadyToGo RT-PCR beads according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Amersham Biosciences).Table ISequence of primer sets used for RT-PCRPrimer namePrimer sequenceExpected product sizebpSecY1Ftacaactgctccagctacga375SecY2RgttcctccaagagcgacaatYdaG1Fcgttcgtgaagcgacttaca320YdaG2RtggcgttaatacggtccatcYdbA1Fttgacagttgctgcttctcc318YdbA2Raagaacataggccgttccac Open table in a new tab Preparation of Membrane Vesicles—Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) harboring different pNS8048E-based expression vectors. Control cells were transformed with pNG8048E, and these were subjected to the same treatment. Cells were grown at 30 °C up to an OD660 of 0.8, and the expression of the plasmid-encoded genes was induced by the addition of 0.2% (v/v) supernatant derived from an overnight culture of the nisin-producing strain L. lactis NZ9700 (∼10 ng/ml Nisin A). Subsequently, cells were grown for 2 h, harvested by centrifugation, and washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Cells were resuspended in the same buffer and treated with lysozyme (10 mg/ml). After 30 min at 30 °C, 10 mm of MgSO4 and 100 μg/ml of DNase were added, and the suspension was passed twice through a French pressure cell (15,000 p.s.i.). Cell debris was removed by two centrifugation steps at 13,000 × g (15 min at 4 °C), and the inside-out membrane vesicles were collected by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Strep-Tactin Affinity Purification—Inside-out membranes (∼30 mg/ml total protein) containing overexpressed YdaG-ST II, YdbA-ST II, both YdaG and YdbA-ST II, or the control were solubilized in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside. After 30 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 280,000 × g at 4 °C. Subsequently, the supernatant was subjected to one-step affinity purification on Strep-Tactin columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA). Purified proteins were visualized by an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with SYPRO Ruby Protein Stain Gel (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Western blotting using Strep-Tactin alkaline phosphatase for detection (IBA). ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity of purified YdbA and/or YdaG was determined using a colorimetric method of Lanzetta at al (29Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Detergent-solubilized proteins were incubated at 30 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgSO4, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.05% dodecylmaltoside, and 2.5 mm ATP. Samples of 30 μl were transferred to a 96-well microplate every 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of malachite green molybdate reagent. After 5 min, 34% citric acid was added to facilitate color development. Absorbance was measured after 50 min of incubation at room temperature at 600 nm and compared with a phosphorus standard. Transport Assays—L. lactis cells induced for the various transporters were washed three times with 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.0, and 5 mm MgSO4. For the daunomycin and BCECF-AM transport assays, the buffer was supplemented with 25 mm K2SO4. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to an OD660 of 0.5 in the buffer for the fluorescence measurements. For ethidium transport, cells were pre-energized for 5 min with 20 mm glucose, whereupon ethidium was added to final concentration of 10 μm. The fluorescence of the ethidium complex with polynucleotides was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 580 nm, respectively (30Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For BCECF-AM, pre-energized cells were incubated with the ionophores valinomycin and nigericin (1 μm each) to preclude any interference by the electrochemical pH gradient. BCECF-AM was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm, and the fluorescence was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 502 and 525 nm, respectively. For daunomycin transport measurements, 10 μm daunomycin was added to nonenergized L. lactis cells, and the passive influx of the compound into the cell was monitored by following the fluorescence quenching upon binding to polynucleotides. Fluorescence was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 590 nm, respectively. Efflux was induced by the addition of 20 mm of glucose, whereupon the ionophores valinomycin and nigericin (1 μm each) were added to assess the contribution of the YdbA and YdaG proteins to the daunomycin efflux. Hoechst 33342 (1 μm) (Molecular Probes) transport assays were performed with glucose-energized cells. Fluorescence emission and excitation wavelengths were at 355 and 457 nm, respectively. All measurements were performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 50B fluorometer with magnetic stirred holder at 30 °C. Other Techniques—Protein expression levels were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins was detected with Strep-Tactin alkaline phosphatase conjugates directed against Streptag II (IBA, Germany) and visualized by chemiluminescence with CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) and imaged on a Lumni Imager (Roche Applied Science). Identification and Overproduction of the ABC Half-transporters YdaG and YdbA in L. lactis—Genome sequencing analysis of L. lactis ssp. lactis IL1403 (26Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A.

The respective gene products YdaG and YdbA show significant sequence homology to the L. lactis LmrA protein and other ABC multidrug transporters (Table II), suggesting a possible role in multidrug resistance. The ydaG and ydbA genes were amplified by PCR from the L. lactis IL1403 genome and cloned into the pNS8048E expression vector, which is a derivative of pNG8048E that allows gene expression under control of the tightly regulated, inducible nisA promoter (27de Ruyter P.G. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pNS8048E vector was created by insertion of an XbaI and HindIII DNA fragment encoding the Streptag II (ST II) and stop codon into pNG8048E. This allows the in-frame fusion of the ST II to the 5′ termini of the cloned genes, thus yielding the following expression constructs: 1) pNSG containing ydaG with a ST II; 2) pNSA containing ydbA with a ST II; and 3) pNSGA containing both ydaG and ydbA with a ST II localized on YdbA. The expression vectors were transformed to L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA), a strain that lacks the lmrA gene and that was used to preclude any background drug extrusion activity of this transporter. Cells were grown in the presence of nisin to induce the expression of the various genes, and subsequently, membranes were isolated for protein expression analysis. Membranes derived from L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) harboring pNSG, pNSA, or pNSGA showed on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE the presence of protein bands with the expected molecular sizes: YdaG (63 kDa), YdbA (74 kDa), and YdaG/YdbA, respectively (Fig. 1A). These polypeptide bands were absent in membranes derived from L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) harboring the control vector pNG8048E. Western blotting with Strep-Tactin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase directed against the ST II (ST II is Streptag) confirmed the presence of the tagged YdaG and YdbA proteins (Fig. 1B).Table IIComparison of amino acid sequence between different MDR systemsIdentityaPercentage of identical residues in pairwise alignments using the ClustalW tool available on the World Wide Web at pbil.ibcp.fr/html/pbil_index.html.YdbAbShown are L. lactis YdaG (accession number AAK04408) YdbA (AAK04409), and LmrA (P97046); B. subtilis BmrA (D70031); and the N- and C-terminal halves (residues 1-640 and 641-1279, respectively) of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (NP 000918).YdaGLmrABmrAC-PgpN-Pgp%%%%%%YdbA21.322.524.425.625.7YdaG21.324.225.622.625.0LmrA22.524.242.127.127.6BmrA24.425.642.126.129.3C-Pgp25.622.627.126.138.7N-Pgp25.725.027.629.338.7a Percentage of identical residues in pairwise alignments using the ClustalW tool available on the World Wide Web at pbil.ibcp.fr/html/pbil_index.html.b Shown are L. lactis YdaG (accession number AAK04408) YdbA (AAK04409), and LmrA (P97046); B. subtilis BmrA (D70031); and the N- and C-terminal halves (residues 1-640 and 641-1279, respectively) of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (NP 000918). Open table in a new tab YdaG and YdbA Mediate Ethidium Bromide Extrusion from L. lactis Cells—Ethidium bromide is a toxic compound that is widely used to detect the activity of multidrug resistance efflux pumps (25Bolhuis H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Ethidium becomes fluorescent upon intercalation with DNA, and this property can be used conveniently to monitor its influx into the cell. The addition of ethidium to glucose-energized L. lactis NZ9000 cells resulted in a rapid increase of ethidium fluorescence (Fig. 2B). An identical influx pattern was observed with L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) cells that lack the wild-type lmrA gene (Fig. 2B), indicating that LmrA does not significantly contribute to ethidium efflux in these cells. When L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) cells were used that expressed both YdaG and YdbA, a strongly reduced influx of ethidium was observed. In contrast, overexpression of YdaG or YdbA alone resulted in a pattern indistinguishable from the control plasmid and thus did not decrease the influx of ethidium (Fig. 2A). These observations indicate that both YdaG and YdbA are needed for active extrusion of ethidium, suggesting that these proteins interact to form a functional MDR transporter. YdaG and YdbA Function as a Multidrug Transporter—In addition to ethidium, several other compounds were tested as possible substrates for the YdaG and YdbA transporters. The hydrophobic noncharged ester BCECF-AM is widely used for intracellular pH measurements. As an ester, BCECF readily diffuses across the cytoplasmic membrane, whereupon it is hydrolyzed by a nonspecific esterase that releases the membrane-impermeable fluorescent BCECF in the cytosol (33Ozkan P. Mutharasan R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Active efflux of BCECF-AM by the human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein was demonstrated in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. In such assays, extrusion of BCECF-AM was assumed to occur from the membrane before the compound reached the cytoplasm, since the hydrolysis by esterases was found to be not rate-limiting for fluorescence development (34Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a multidrug-resistant mutant of L. lactis (Ethr) that shows an increased resistance to ethidium bromide also rapidly expels the BCECF-AM in an ATP-dependent manner (24Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A rapid development of BCECF fluorescence was observed when BCECF-AM was added to L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) control cells or to cells that expressed YdaG or YdbA independently (Fig. 3). The fluorescence development was greatly reduced when cells were used that expressed YdaG and YdbA simultaneously (Fig. 3). The rate of BCECF-AM influx was not altered when cells were incubated with the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin, showing a similar behavior as ethidium-resistant (or Ethr) L. lactis cells (24Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and ruling out a proton motive force-dependent extrusion mechanism. The antitumor drug daunomycin is excreted by several human MDR transporters including P-glycoprotein, MRP1, and BCRP (for reviews, see Refs. 1Litman T. Druley T.E. Stein W.D. Bates S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar and 10Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4632) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a high rate of daunomycin efflux was observed from an ethidium-resistant strain of L. lactis (23Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence of daunomycin is quenched upon binding to polynucleotides, and this feature can be used to monitor its influx. When daunomycin is added to L. lactis cells, a rapid fluorescence increase is observed due to the addition of drug followed by a drop in the fluorescence signal caused by entrance of the drug into the cell and binding to intracellular polynucleotides. Upon energization of the cells with glucose, all tested strains exhibited similar rates of daunomycin efflux (Fig. 4). However, upon the addition of the ionophores valinomycin and nigericin, which dissipate the proton motive force, only cells expressing both YdaG and YdbA were able to maintain a high fluorescence level (Fig. 4). These data indicate that YdaG plus YdbA mediates efflux of daunomycin. Another widely used substrate for MDR transporters is the lipophilic compound Hoechst 33342 (13Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Margolles A. Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N.

Hoechst 33342 is a membrane-permeable nuclear stain that becomes fluorescent upon intercalation in the lipophilic membrane environment and upon binding to DNA (37Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The addition of Hoechst 33342 to glucose-energized cells of L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) control cells results in a rapid increase in fluorescence, which is most likely due to binding of the drug to double-stranded DNA (Fig. 5). However, when cells are used that overexpress YdaG and YdbA, the fluorescence development of the drug is greatly reduced, suggesting that Hoechst 33342 is actively exported by the YdaG/YdbA transporter. Cells overexpressing YdbA show a fluorescence development that is similar to the control, whereas cells overexpressing YdaG reproducibly exhibited a slightly lower level of Hoechst 33342 accumulation (Fig. 5). Taken together, these data demonstrate that YdaG and YdbA constitute a functional MDR transporter in L. lactis. YdaG and YdbA Co-purify as a Heterodimer—Since YdaG and YdbA are both needed for the extrusion of various fluorescent compounds, it is likely that they form a heterodimer as a functional unit. To investigate whether YdaG and YdbA form stable dimers, a co-purification method was used. For this purpose, membranes were isolated from cells harboring the control vector or vectors that encode for YdaG and YdbA either independently or together. These constructs contained an ST II either on YdbA or on YdaG, whereas the co-expressed YdaG and YdbA harbored a ST II tag on YdbA only. Membranes were solubilized with dodecylmaltoside and subjected to one-step ST II affinity chromatography. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 6, A and B). YdaG and YdbA migrate on SDS-PAGE as proteins with molecular masses of 63 and 74 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 4). When YdbA was purified from membranes containing both YdaG and YdbA-ST II, two polypeptide bands were obtained with molecular masses that corresponded to YdaG and YdbA, respectively (Fig. 6A, lane 3). The identity of these polypeptides was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). From the relative intensities of YdbA and YdaG in the SYPRO Ruby-stained gel, it appears that both proteins are present in stoichiometric amounts, indicating the presence of a stable heterodimer.

In view of this fact, the aim of the present work was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the actions of mepyramine at the guinea pig H1 receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We found that mepyramine is able to decrease the basal constitutive activity of the guinea pig H1 receptor, to bind with high affinity to a Gq/11 protein-coupled form of the receptor and to promote a G protein-coupled inactive state of the H1 receptor that interferes with the Gq/11-mediated signaling of the endogenously expressed ATP receptor, as predicted by the Cubic Ternary Complex Model of receptor occupancy. The effect of mepyramine on ATP-induced signaling was specifically neutralized by Gα11 overexpression, indicating that mepyramine is able to reduce G protein availability for other non-related receptors associated with the same signaling pathway. Finally, we found a loss of mepyramine efficacy in decreasing basal levels of intracellular calcium at high Gα11 expression levels, which can be theoretically explained in terms of high H1 receptor constitutive activity. The whole of the present work sheds new light on H1 receptor pharmacology and the mechanisms H1 receptor inverse agonists could use to exert their observed negative efficacy.

Traditionally, ligands acting at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptor; CTC, Cubic Ternary Complex Model; gp-H1r, guinea pig histamine H1 receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate; mepyramine, 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(p-methoxybenzyl)amino)-pyridine; triprolidine, (E)-2-[1-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propenyl]pyridine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PTX, pertussis toxin; InsP, inositol phosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptor; CTC, Cubic Ternary Complex Model; gp-H1r, guinea pig histamine H1 receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate; mepyramine, 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(p-methoxybenzyl)amino)-pyridine; triprolidine, (E)-2-[1-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propenyl]pyridine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PTX, pertussis toxin; InsP, inositol phosphate. were classified as agonists, accounting for ligands with observable positive efficacy, or as antagonists, for ligands with no observable efficacy. However, the identification of constitutively active receptors led to the identification of ligands with intrinsic negative efficacy, characterized by their ability to decrease basal constitutive receptor activity. In view of this property, those ligands were defined as inverse agonists (1Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Considering the importance accurate ligand classification has in terms of proper pharmacological use, the mechanism(s) by which these ligands exert their effects has to be extensively and carefully characterized (2Strange P.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In an attempt to understand such mechanisms, several receptor occupancy models have been developed (3Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 4Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Weiss J.M. Morgan P. Lutz M. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 178: 151-167Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Weiss J.M.

Biol. 1996; 181: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For all of the currently accepted models, basal activity is proportional to the population of receptors active and coupled to G protein. The simplest explanation for the negative efficacy observed for inverse agonists is, then, the selective affinity of the ligand for an inactive state of the receptor. Binding of the ligand would then deplete the levels of active receptors coupled to G protein, resulting in a decrease in receptor constitutive activity. Alternatively, ligands with observed negative efficacy could promote uncoupling from G proteins, leading to G protein-free receptor species, which are unable to evoke response. However, the Cubic Ternary Complex Model (CTC) predicts a third mechanism accounting for negative efficacy (5Weiss J.M. Morgan P. Lutz M. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 178: 151-167Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Weiss J.M. Morgan P. Lutz M. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 178: 169-182Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Weiss J.M. Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 181: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). According to the CTC, a ligand may bind with high affinity to a G protein-coupled but inactive form of the receptor, resulting in a decrease of spontaneous receptor activity. The distinctive feature of this proposed mechanism is that, by promoting receptor-G protein coupling, binding of the ligand would result in a reduction of the G protein availability to other receptors associated with the same pathway, thus interfering with the signaling of those GPCRs (8Monczor F. Fernandez N. Legnazzi B.L. Riveiro M.E. Baldi A. Shayo C. Davio C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, experimental evidence supporting all the three aforementioned mechanisms has been reported for different inverse agonists.Mepyramine, traditionally classified as a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, is the reference ligand for studying H1 receptor pharmacology (9van der Goot H. Timmerman H. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Together with other formerly named H1 antagonists, it has been recently reclassified as an inverse agonist, in view of its negative efficacy at the constitutively active human H1 receptor observed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (10Bakker R.A. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taking into account the clinically widespread use of histamine H1 receptor antihistamines in the treatment of human diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis, proper classification of these ligands and accurate characterization of their mechanism(s) of action is of great importance.The aim of the present work was to identify the mechanisms involved in mepyramine actions at the guinea pig H1 receptor (gp-H1r) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. We found that mepyramine acts as an inverse agonist decreasing the basal spontaneous activity of the gp-H1r. Moreover, mepyramine inhibited histamine-induced inositol phosphate (InsP) production and intracellular calcium mobilization with a marked decrease in the maximal response to histamine at high mepyramine concentrations. This effect was not observed with triprolidine, another H1 receptor inverse agonist. A strong interference of mepyramine with the Gq/11-mediated signaling of the endogenously expressed ATP receptor was observed. This indicates that mepyramine may, at least in part, exert its action by promoting a G protein-coupled inactive state of the H1 receptor as predicted by the CTC model. Accordingly, the effect of mepyramine was neutralized by overexpression of Gα11 protein, indicating that mepyramine is able to reduce the G protein availability for other non-related receptors associated with the same signaling pathway. Finally, we found a decrease in the efficacy of mepyramine to diminish the basal levels of intracellular calcium at high Gα11 expression levels. This G protein-dependent efficacy observed for mepyramine can be explained in terms of the high H1 receptor constitutive activity. The whole of the present work sheds new light into the understanding of H1 receptor pharmacology and the mechanisms inverse agonists could utilize to exert their observed negative efficacy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]Mepyramine and myo-[3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Histamine dihydrochloride, mepyramine hydrochloride, myo-inositol, pertussis toxin (PTX), cAMP, fura-2 AM (fura-2 pentakis(acetoxymethyl) ester), bovine serum albumin, bicinchoninic acid method reagents, and ethidium bromide were purchased from Sigma. Triprolidine was from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ballwin, MO). Dowex AG-1X8 formate form and Chelex 100 resins were obtained from Bio-Rad. DMEM, fetal calf serum, agarose, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Taq DNA polymerase and all the restriction endonucleases were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). pcDNA3Gαq, pcDNA3Gα11, pcDNA3Gαi1, and pcDNA3GαS plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. O. Cosso (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Cloning and Sequencing of the Guinea Pig Histamine H1 Receptor— Guinea pig histamine H1 receptor was cloned following recently described procedures (11Shayo C. Fernandez N. Legnazzi B.L. Monczor F. Mladovan A. Baldi A. Davio C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, two 25-bp oligonucleotides derived from the sequence of the intronless gene encoding the gp-H1r (12Traiffort E. Leurs R. Arrang J.M. Tardivel-Lacombe J. Diaz J. Schwartz J.C. Ruat M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number S68706) were used to amplify a 1501-bp cDNA fragment from guinea pig genomic DNA, obtained from guinea pig liver (5′-ctaagcttgtcattatggctttcct-3′ (sense primer), where the underlined sequence indicates a HindIII site, and the sequence in bold indicates a Kozac's sequence, and 5′–ctgcctcctctagatgcaccctcaa-3′ (antisense primer), where the underlined sequence indicates a XbaI site containing an internal stop codon).PCR amplification was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase, and the resulting PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the pCEFL vector. The 1501-bp insert was sequenced using specific primers for the vector, and the sequence was found to be 100% homologous to the reported gp-H1r. For functional expression, the insert was excised by double digestion with HindIII-XbaI and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen) at the HindIII-XbaI sites to give the correct orientation for transcription. The identity and orientation of the insert was verified by sequencing. The resulting plasmid was used to transfect CHO-K1, and a single stable clone with high histamine H1 receptor expression (CHO-gpH1) was established by neomycin selection. A separate single clone containing the empty vector was selected under the same conditions (CHO-mock). Transient and stable transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.Cell Culture—All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. CHO-gpH1 and CHO-mock cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.8 mg/ml G418. Parental CHO-K1 cells were cultured in the same medium without G418.Membrane Preparation and H1 Receptor Binding Assays—Membrane-purified fraction from CHO-gpH1 and CHO-mock cells were prepared, and binding assays were performed as described (8Monczor F. Fernandez N. Legnazzi B.L. Riveiro M.E. Baldi A. Shayo C. Davio C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CHO-gpH1 cells were cultured in 10-cm plastic plates for 48 h (70–80% confluence) and lifted from the plates using a plastic cell lifter (Costar®, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in 5 volumes of ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The cells were then disrupted by sonication in binding buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 30,000 × g, and the pellet was suspended in an adequate volume of binding buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method, and the pellet was resuspended in binding buffer at a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored at –70 °C.For saturation binding experiments membrane fractions (10–20 μg of protein) were incubated in triplicate with different concentrations of [3H]mepyramine ranging from 0.05 to 10 nm in a final volume of 200 μl for 45 min. For competition binding experiments, membranes were incubated with [3H]mepyramine (2 nm) in assay triplicates in the presence of different concentrations of competitors in a final volume of 200 μl for 45 min. For dissociation kinetics of [3H]mepyramine binding, assay preparations were done in a larger volume to allow extraction of several aliquots of 1 ml at adequate time points over a time interval of 90 min. Membranes were preincubated with [3H]mepyramine for 45 min before measuring radioligand dissociation by the addition of 10 μm cold mepyramine (13Anthes J.C. Gilchrest H. Richard C. Eckel S. Hesk D.

In all cases assay mixtures were incubated at 25 °C in polypropylene tubes. To study the effect of GTPγS on [3H]mepyramine binding, membrane fractions were pretreated at 37 °C for 1 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution in the presence of increasing concentrations of GTPγS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10–4m triprolidine. Kinetic studies demonstrated that equilibrium was reached after 15 min of incubation and persisted for 4 h (data not shown). After the incubation samples were filtered through 0.3% polyethyleneimine-soaked GF/B filters and washed 3 times with ice-cold binding buffer. Filters were suspended in 5 ml of Hi-Safe scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer), and radioactivity was counted in a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter.[3H]Inositol Phosphate Production—Total inositol phosphate production was measured as previously described (14Fitzsimons C. Engel N. Policastro L. Duran H. Molinari B. Rivera E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1785-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well cluster dishes and cultured for 24 h (70–80% confluence) in DMEM. Cells were then washed, and the medium was replaced for DMEM without calf serum plus the addition of myo-[3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) and cultured for 24 h. Thereafter, the medium was aspirated and replaced with DMEM without calf serum containing 10 mm LiCl and incubated for 20 min. Cells were then stimulated for 20 min with histamine in concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm in a final volume of 300 μl in the presence or absence of specific H1 antagonists in the concentrations indicated in each particular experiment. The incubation was stopped by the addition of 900 μl of cold chloroform, methanol, 0.12 m HCl (1:2:1 v/v, freshly prepared), and phases were split by the addition of 300 μl of water and 300 μl of chloroform. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the total water-soluble inositol phosphate fraction was purified by anion exchange chromatography. Radioactivity of the eluted fractions was measured using a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter. Results were expressed as the ratio obtained when total [3H]inositol phosphate radioactivity was normalized to total [3H]inositol radioactivity recovered from the initial water wash of the columns.Ca2+ Measurements—Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration were measured by the standard method described elsewhere (15Megson A.C. Walker E.M. Hill S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1012-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 10-cm-diameter plastic dishes for 24 h (70–80% confluence). Thereafter, cells were detached with trypsin, EDTA (0.5 g/liter of trypsin, 0.2 g/liter of EDTA, and 0.85 g/liter NaCl) and resuspended in loading buffer (2 mm CaCl2, 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then loaded in the presence of 5 μm fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were 5-fold-diluted and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C to facilitate the hydrolysis of the ester to the acid form. Excess dye was removed by two cycles of centrifugation/resuspension in 2 ml of loading buffer containing 0.1 mm EGTA. Each Ca2+ measurement was preceded by a rapid cycle of centrifugation/resuspension in 2 ml of loading buffer containing 0.1 mm EGTA. Fluorescence was measured in a Jasco FP750 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with the CA-261 accessory to measure Ca2+ with continuous stirring. The wavelength was set at 340/380 nm, and detection was at 500 nm. After 10 s of initial recording to determine basal levels, agonists were added in 20-μl final volumes, and the time course of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was recorded for 70 s. At the end of the time course, CaCl2 (20 mm) followed by Triton X-100 (0.25% v/v) was added to determine Fmax followed by EGTA (6.25 mm, pH 8.6) to determine Fmin. Autofluorescence was quantified by measuring the fluorescence produced by an equivalent suspension of not-loaded cells. Using these values intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antagonists were preincubated for 10 min. Results were expressed as the percentage of the maximal response of the system, measured in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100. Basal levels determined in the first 10 s were considered 0% in all of the cases.Western Blots—Standard Western blotting was performed as previously described (17Fernandez N. Monczor F. Lemos B. Notcovich C. Baldi A. Davio C. Shayo C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1506-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and sonicated to shear DNA. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and aliquots were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The residual binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20), and membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-Gα11 rabbit antibody or anti-actin goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBST. All subsequent washes were performed with the same buffer. Reactivity was developed using an anti-rabbit or anti-goat polyclonal antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Analytical Methods—Binding data and dose-response curve fitting were done using Prism 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Specific binding was calculated by subtraction of nonspecific binding from total binding. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post test was performed using InStat version 3.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSMepyramine Binding and Inverse Agonism at the Stably Expressed Guinea Pig Histamine H1 Receptor—We first aimed to study the binding and signaling profile of mepyramine at the gp-H1r heterologously expressed in CHO-K1 cells. To examine this, we generated a stable cell line expressing gp-H1r named CHO-gpH1. In these cells, mepyramine displayed specific, reversible, and saturable binding. Interestingly, saturation binding experiments disclosed two binding sites for mepyramine (p < 0.05, F test), one with higher affinity (0.16 ± 0.02 nm) and lower capacity (32.8 ± 2.8 fm/mg of protein) and a second one with lower affinity (2.4 ± 0.4 nm) and higher capacity (445.8 ± 19.9 fm/mg of protein). This is consistent with previous observations from several other groups (18Casale T.B. Rodbard D. Kaliner M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 3285-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Dini S. Caselli G.F. Ferrari M.P. Giani R. Clavenna G. Agents Actions. 1991; 33: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Carman-Krzan M. Krzan M. Schunack W. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Most of the ligands previously classified as H1 antagonist were recently reclassified as inverse agonists in view of the reported constitutive activity of the human histamine H1 receptor (10Bakker R.A. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To corroborate this observation made in COS-7 cells, we tested the effects of mepyramine on InsP levels in CHO-gpH1 cells. As anticipated, mepyramine was able to dose-dependently decrease basal InsP levels (log EC50 = –7.94 ± 0.11), (Fig. 1). To confirm this observation we tested the effect of triprolidine, another formerly designated H1 antagonist, on basal InsP levels in CHO-gpH1 cells. As observed with mepyramine, triprolidine was able to dose-dependently decrease the basal InsP production in CHO-gpH1 cells (log EC50 = –8.03 ± 0.23) (Fig. 1). Importantly, although the potency of both inverse agonists was similar, triprolidine could only inhibit 60% of the basal levels of InsP, indicating that triprolidine is a less efficacious ligand than mepyramine and, thus, might be classified as a partial inverse agonist, whereas mepyramine may be classified as full inverse agonist at the gp-H1r expressed in CHO cells. Both tested compounds inhibited the constitutive activity of the gp-H1r, displaying the negative efficacy expected for inverse agonists, in accordance with previous observations made with the human H1 receptor (21Bakker R.A. Schoonus S.B. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).Effect of GTPγS on Mepyramine Binding at the gp-H1r—In the theoretical representation of ligand-receptor interaction denoted by the extended ternary complex model (4Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the negative efficacy observed for inverse agonists is explained by a selective affinity of the ligand for a non response-evoking state of the receptor (2Strange P.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Under this assumption, the affinity of an inverse agonist should be increased by uncoupling the receptor from the G protein (4Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To evaluate the effect of receptor uncoupling from G protein, membranes from CHO-gpH1 cells were incubated with increasing amounts of GTPγS. Under these conditions, GTPγS dose-dependently inhibited mepyramine binding with a pEC50 value of 4.72 ± 0.18 and a maximal effect of 64.9 ± 4.6% inhibition at 1 × 10–3m GTPγS (Fig. 2A). We then proceeded to further study the effect of G protein uncoupling on mepyramine binding using a concentration of 3 × 10–4m GTPγS. Preincubation of CHO-gpH1 cell membranes with this GTPγS concentration induced a significant decrease in the affinity of mepyramine for the gp-H1r, shifting the homologous displacement curves of mepyramine from a pIC50 value of 8.77 ± 0.08 in the absence of GTPγS to a pIC50 value of 7.44 ± 0.07 in the presence of GTPγS (p < 0.01, n = 5). These results are in agreement with previous observations made with the gp-H1r expressed in atrial membranes (22Hattori Y. Endou M. Gando S. Kanno M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1573-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Gα11 proteins had the opposite effect, inducing a leftward shift in the homologous displacement curves to a pIC50 value of 9.68 ± 0.08 (p < 0.01 versus non transfected cells, n = 8) (Fig. 2B). Conversely, under the same experimental conditions the affinity of triprolidine for the gp-H1r was only marginally affected, with observed pIC50 values of 8.83 ± 0.05 in the absence of GTPγS versus 8.51 ± 0.07 in the presence of GTPγS and 8.99 ± 0.10 in the Gα11 overexpression system (p > 0.05 versus nontreated non-transfected cells, n = 8) (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Effects of GTPγS pretreatment and Gα11 overexpression on mepyramine- or triprolidine-induced displacement of [3H]mepyramine binding.A, membrane fractions obtained from CHO-gpH1 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of GTPγS before performing homologous competition binding experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, membranes from CHO-gpH1 cells (▪), CHO-gpH1 cells transiently overexpressing Gα11 (⋄), and CHO-gpH1 cells preincubated with 3 × 10–4m GTPγS (□) were exposed to 2 nm [3H]mepyramine and increasing concentrations of unlabeled mepyramine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of assay triplicates. Similar results were obtained in five independent experiments. C, membranes from CHO-gpH1 cells (▪), CHO-gpH1 cells transiently overexpressing Gα11 (⋄), and CHO-gpH1 cell membranes preincubated with 3 × 10–4m GTPγS (□) were exposed to 2 nm [3H]mepyramine and increasing concentrations of unlabeled triprolidine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of assay triplicates. Similar results were obtained in eight independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results indicated that even though mepyramine and triprolidine displayed intrinsic negative efficacy at the gp-H1r, they may recognize functionally different receptor subpopulations. Triprolidine binding was insensitive to uncoupling of the receptor from G protein. In contrast, mepyramine affinity for the gp-H1r was significantly decreased by pretreatment with GTPγS and increased when Gα11 protein was overexpressed, indicating a higher affinity for receptor species coupled to G protein. We have recently reported similar observations with the histamine H2 receptor inverse agonist tiotidine (8Monczor F. Fernandez N. Legnazzi B.L. Riveiro M.E. Baldi A. Shayo C. Davio C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of membranes from U-937 cells with GTPγS drastically decreased the affinity of tiotidine for the human H2 receptor, indicating that binding of the inverse agonist could bias the system toward a G protein-coupled but inactive receptor state, predicted only by the CTC model of receptor occupancy (7Weiss J.M. Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 181: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To test if binding of mepyramine could induce a similar receptor state of the H1 receptor, we decided to measure the effects of mepyramine on histamine intrinsic efficacy at the H1 receptor expressed in CHO-gpH1 cells.Effects of Mepyramine on Histamine Intrinsic Efficacy at the gp-H1r—To evaluate the effect of mepyramine on histamine intrinsic efficacy at gp-H1r, different assays were used to rule out bias of the experimental readout on the observations. Histamine intrinsic efficacy was drastically decreased by incubation with increasing concentrations of mepyramine (Fig. 3, A and B). Mepyramine induced marked depressions of the maximal histamine response along with rightward shifts of histamine dose-response curves in both assays used to evaluate its effects on histamine response. Interestingly, similar effects of mepyramine on histamine maximal response have been recently described using a c-fos-luciferase reporter-gene assay (15Megson A.C. Walker E.M. Hill S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1012-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the mag"

Importantly, prominent defects in the actin cytoskeleton were observed in all of these strains, thus implicating a known causal relationship between the deregulation of actin and the inhibition of mRNA transport.

Our novel observations suggest that vesicular transport regulates the actin cytoskeleton in yeast (and not just vice versa) leading to subsequent defects in mRNA transport and localization. The establishment of cell polarity in eukaryotes involves the asymmetric organization of mRNA, the cytoskeleton, and the secretory pathway to lead to the polarized distribution of new membrane along a given axis (1Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 2Kloc M. Zearfoss N.R. Etkin L.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In yeast, polarization leads to the budding of daughter cells (cell division), the asymmetric segregation of cell-fate determinants, and mating of haplotypes (3Casamayor A. Snyder M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 2: 179-186Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These aspects of polarization require proper control of the actin cytoskeleton, as mutations therein block the exocytosis of proteins and new membrane along the axis of growth as well as the delivery of an mRNA encoding a protein involved in mating-type control (e.g. Ash1). For example, loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding yeast actin (ACT1), tropomyosin (TPM1,2), and a type V myosin (MYO2) all block exocytosis and result in lethality (5Novick P. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 40: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Pruyne D.W. Schott D.H. Bretscher A. J.

Similarly, mutations in actin, tropomyosin, and another type V myosin (encoded by MYO4) also block ASH1 mRNA transport (2Kloc M. Zearfoss N.R. Etkin L.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, an essentially common mechanism for both vesicle and mRNA transport to the growing bud appears to have evolved in eukaryotes. A key question that remains to be resolved is whether components of the secretory apparatus play a role in mRNA transport and localization to the bud. Because both share an actin-dependent transport mechanism, it seems likely that feedback from the exocytic pathway may affect actin assembly and, therefore, subsequent mRNA transport. In yeast, SHE4, one of five SHE genes known to be required for the transport and localization of ASH1 mRNA (2Kloc M. Zearfoss N.R. Etkin L.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 9Takizawa P.A. Sil A. Swedlow J.R. Herskowitz I. Vale R.D.

Cell. 1996; 84: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), was isolated as an endocytosis-defective mutant and was shown to have a depolarized actin cytoskeleton (13Wendland B. McCaffery J.M. Xiao Q. Emr S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1485-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, components of the endocytic apparatus that regulate actin may also influence mRNA transport. Until recently, the function of She4 in either endocytosis or actin regulation was not known. However, it was shown that She4 interacts directly with the motor domain of unconventional myosins, including Myo4/She1, and that mutations in this domain can bypass she4Δ growth and endocytosis defects but not defects in mating-type switching (14Toi H. Fujimura-Kamada K. Irie K. Takai Y. Todo S. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2237-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that She4 may serve multiple roles, one in the regulation of myosin motor function and perhaps an additional role in ASH1 mRNA transport (14Toi H. Fujimura-Kamada K. Irie K. Takai Y. Todo S. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2237-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These are likely to be mediated by different domains of the protein, as expression of the C-terminal domain of She4 suppresses the growth defects in the she4Δ mutant, whereas full-length She4 is necessary to suppress both the growth and the HO gene expression phenotypes (14Toi H. Fujimura-Kamada K. Irie K. Takai Y. Todo S. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2237-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Other endocytic proteins have been shown to modulate mRNA transport and localization, including Drosophila Rab11 which plays a role in endocytic protein sorting, microtubule organization, and also oskar mRNA localization (15Dollar G. Struckhoff E. Michaud J. Cohen R. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 517-526PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a connection between endocytic transport, regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and mRNA localization exists in higher organisms and may parallel that observed in yeast. Here we have examined directly whether mutations in components of the late secretory pathway affect the transport of ASH1 mRNA to the daughter cell and its localization therein using both in situ and in vivo assays. Most importantly, we have found that both polarity and secretion-related proteins modulate the asymmetric distribution of ASH1 mRNA. For example, alleles of small GTPases (e.g. cdc42-6 and rho3-V51) thought to mediate specifically secretory vesicle fusion and not to affect significantly the actin cytoskeleton (16Adamo J.E. Rossi G. Brennwald P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 12: 4121-4133Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Adamo J.E. Moskow J.J. Gladfelter A.S. Viterbo D. Lew D.J. Brennwald P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) greatly inhibited ASH1 distribution to the bud. This effect was also observed in yeast bearing mutations in either RAS2 (e.g. ras2Δ) or CMD1 (e.g. cmd1-239), although we note that the actin cytoskeleton was substantially disorganized in all of these mutants. Most surprisingly, however, conditional loss-of-function mutations in genes thought to be directly involved in protein export, and not actin regulation, revealed numerous cases whereby mRNA localization was also affected. For example, mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the transport and fusion of secretory vesicles, like Sec4 and Sro7 (18Salminen A. Novick P.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 19Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as well as Pik1, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase involved in Golgi export (20Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 8: 2673-2689Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar), all greatly inhibited ASH1 mRNA distribution to the bud. To a somewhat lesser extent, mutations in the Sec1 SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. regulator (22Jahn R. Neuron. 2000; 2: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the exocyst components, Sec10 and Sec15 (23TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) (the latter being a possible Sec4 effector (24Salminen A. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)), and the exocytic SNAREs, Sec9, and Sso1/2 (25Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 26Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 11: 4095-4104Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar), also resulted in the mislocalization of ASH1 mRNA. This suggests that SNAREs, SNARE regulatory, exocyst, and Golgi export proteins all exert control over mRNA transport and localization. Subsequent analysis of the actin cytoskeleton in these mutants revealed that all have a disorganized pattern of actin labeling, which occurs rapidly upon the shift to semi-restrictive and restrictive temperatures. This indicates that a novel relationship exists between vesicle transport and the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, active exocytosis in yeast is necessary for both maintenance of the polarized actin cytoskeleton and subsequent mRNA transport and localization to the growing bud. Media, DNA, and Genetic Manipulations—Yeast were grown in standard growth media containing 2% glucose. Synthetic complete and drop-out media were prepared similar to that described previously (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P.

Standard methods were used for the introduction of DNA into yeast and the preparation of genomic DNA (27Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Cells transformed with plasmids for ASH1 mRNA labeling (see below) were grown on selective synthetic medium. For the induction of MS2 coat protein fused to GFP (MS2-GFP), cells were switched to synthetic medium lacking methionine for 1-2 h. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains used are listed in Table I. Plasmids—Plasmids encoding an ASH1 gene fragment with an MS2 viral coat protein-binding site in its 3′-untranslated region (pIIIA/ASH1-UTR) and a gene fusion of the MS2 coat protein and GFP (pCPGFP) (28Beach D.L.

The coding region of the ASH1 was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using forward (Ash1-For, 5′-CCTATCGCTCCTGTCCTATCCTTATTACG-3′) and reverse (Ash1-Rev, 5′-AGTTATTAGTTGAAAGAGCTCCAGTTATCC-3′) oligonucleotides. The 1751-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield pGEM-ASH1. For creation of the DNA template used to make the RNA probe for in situ hybridization, a 250-bp fragment of the ASH1 coding region was obtained by the digestion of pGEM-ASH1 with SphI and NdeI. This fragment was then ligated into the SphI and NdeI sites of pGEM to yield pGEM-ASH1short. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Immunofluorescence—ASH1 mRNA was detected by FISH with the following modifications. Cultures were grown to A600 = 0.5, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 1 h, washed, and then spheroplasted in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1.2 m sorbitol, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 40 μg/ml zymolase (100T; ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for 30 min at 24 °C. Spheroplasts were washed and spread onto clean polylysine-coated, multiwell test slides (ICN Biomedicals). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C in hybridization mix (50% formamide, 5× SSC, yeast tRNA (1 mg/ml), heparin (100 μg/ml), 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mm EDTA) and then incubated overnight at 50 °C in hybridization mix containing 5 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled 250-bp ASH1 RNA probes. ASH1 RNA probes were synthesized in both the sense and antisense orientations, using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After hybridization, cells were washed in 0.2× SSC and blocked in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% horse serum. Cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin monoclonal antibodies (1:500) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in blocking buffer for 2 h. After washing, cells were incubated with Cy5-conjugated anti-horseradish peroxidase antibodies (1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed and mounted in 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 90% glycerol, 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, and 0.1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). The actin cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Cells were grown to A600 = 0.5 in YPD and fixed with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 4% for 1 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice with 1× PBS, permeabilized using 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 5 min, and washed again with 1× PBS. For staining, 100-μl aliquots of cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (final concentration of 0.165 μm) for 15-60 min on ice and washed with 1× PBS. Cells were mixed with mounting medium and mounted on glass slides with coverslips prior to visualization. To obtain quantitative data on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, between 50 and 100 cells of each strain were scored for the distribution of actin patches in the mother and bud.

The following wavelengths were used: rhodamine-phalloidin (excitation 545 nm and emission 560-580 nm); GFP (excitation 480 nm and emission 530 nm), and Cy5 (excitation 650 nm and emission 680 nm). Control experiments for in situ hybridization showed no observable background using the sense ASH1 RNA probe. Likewise, no signal was observed in the absence of primary antibodies. For live cell imaging, cells were grown overnight to log phase in synthetic medium at 26 °C and shifted to synthetic medium lacking methionine for 1 h to induce the production of coat protein-GFP. For temperature-shift experiments, cells were incubated in medium lacking methionine at the appropriate restrictive temperature. Cells were concentrated, supplemented with gelatin (Sigma) or low melting point agarose (FMC, Rockland, ME) (0.25 or 0.5% final concentration, respectively), and mounted on glass slides or coverslips. A temperature-controlled chamber (Warner Instrument Corp.) was used to maintain cells at constant temperature. Optical sectioning was performed as described in Shaw and Quatrano (29Shaw S.L. Quatrano R.S. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2623-2630PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were sectioned optically at 0.75-μm increments for a total of 3.0 μm. Measurement of mRNA Localization and Distribution in Situ—To obtain quantitative data on the localization of the ASH1 mRNA in each strain, between 30 and 80 cells with visible buds (i.e. cells in S and G2/M phase) were scored for a localized or mislocalized ASH1 mRNA signal using FISH (note: ASH1 mRNA localizes to the newly forming bud tip in early S phase). Thus, an ASH1 mRNA signal was considered as localized when it was present at the bud tip or localized along one side of the bud. An mRNA signal was considered as mislocalized to the bud and mother when it was distributed in both the bud and mother cell (i.e. transported to but not anchored at the bud tip). An mRNA signal was considered mislocalized to the mother when it was found in the mother cell only (neither transported to nor anchored in the bud). The standard deviation obtained from two separate counts (per strain) was calculated.

The latter include actin, tropomyosins 1/2, and myosin 4, and these are encoded by ACT1, TPM1/2, and MYO4, respectively. To determine the involvement of known secretory proteins, we employed fluorescence-based in situ hybridization (FISH) by using digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense ASH1 probes and mutants of the late secretory pathway in yeast. We first examined whether temperature-sensitive mutations in small GTPases may influence the localization of ASH1 mRNA after shifting cells to restrictive temperatures (see Table II and Fig. 1A). ASH1 mRNA localization was examined in budded S and G2/M phase yeast cells by using FISH, and the results were statistically compiled from 30 to 80 cells per condition. Specific FISH signals were observed by using the antisense probes only. 2S. Aronov and J. E. Gerst, unpublished observations. We found that >75% of wild-type cells had ASH1 mRNA present at the bud tip (Table II and note examples in Fig. 1A), as shown previously (8Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Takizawa P.A. Sil A. Swedlow J.R. Herskowitz I. Vale R.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and did not vary significantly with temperature (15-37 °C). Nonetheless, a small number of cells (<20%) were found to have some mRNA located in the nucleus of the mother cell, the latter detected by propidium iodide staining, which probably represents a maternal pool of ASH1 mRNA that had yet to be exported and delivered to the daughter cell. In contrast to wild-type cells, less than 20% of myo4Δ deletion mutants had ASH1 mRNA localized at the bud tip (Table IV and Fig. 1A). Thus, myo4Δ mutants are defective in ASH1 mRNA localization, as determined previously (8Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Takizawa P.A. Sil A. Swedlow J.R. Herskowitz I. Vale R.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, we found that a temperature-sensitive mutation in Cdc42 (cdc42-6), which was proposed to act only upon vesicle transport at 33 °C and not to affect the actin cytoskeleton (17Adamo J.E. Moskow J.J. Gladfelter A.S. Viterbo D. Lew D.J. Brennwald P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), had prominent effects upon ASH1 mRNA localization at either permissive (26 °C) or restrictive (33 °C) temperatures (Table II and Fig. 1A). At the permissive temperature about 50% of the mRNA was mislocalized in the bud or to the mother cell, whereas 70% was mislocalized at the restrictive temperature. Moreover, nearly identical results were obtained with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Cdc42 exchange factor, Cdc24 (cdc24-1), which showed similar amounts of mislocalized ASH1 mRNA overall (Table II). Thus, Cdc42 is likely to play a significant role in the delivery of ASH1 to the daughter cell. Next, we examined other GTPases (Table II) including the following: Sec4, which confers secretory vesicle tethering and SNARE assembly (30Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); Rho3, which regulates actin assembly but may also play a role in vesicle transport (16Adamo J.E. Rossi G. Brennwald P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 12: 4121-4133Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar); Ypt31/32, which is involved in Golgi export (31Jedd G. Mulholland J. Segev N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); and Ras2, which regulates signaling pathways involved in both cell growth and actin regulation (32Ho J. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1541-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar to cdc42-6, we found that an allele of Rho3 (rho3-V51) that was proposed to act upon vesicle transport alone (16Adamo J.E. Rossi G. Brennwald P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 12: 4121-4133Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) had strong effects upon ASH1 mRNA localization (Table II). At the permissive temperature (26 °C) about 40% of the cells had mislocalized ASH1 mRNA, whereas this increased to 85% at the restrictive temperature (15 °C; 1 h), wherein most of the mRNA accumulated exclusively in the mother cell. Interestingly, ASH1 mRNA was mislocalized at restrictive temperatures with all of the other GTPase mutants examined, including the following: sec4-8 (37 °C; 1 h) (for example, see Fig. 1A); sec4-P48 (15 °C; 1 h); ypt31Δ ypt32-1 (37 °C; 1 h); and ras2Δ cells (37 °C; 1 h). However, in these particular strains ASH1 mRNA was distributed in both mother and daughter cells and was not restricted to the mother cell as seen in cdc42-6 and rho3-V51 cells. Nonetheless, the finding that two different alleles of SEC4, which encodes a protein involved in the terminal steps of vesicle docking and fusion, affect ASH1 mRNA localization strongly suggested a direct involvement of the secretory pathway in mRNA transport and localization.

Numerous gene-specific analyses have implicated Abf1p in the transcriptional control of genes involved in a diverse range of cellular functions, leading to the notion that Abf1p acts as a global transcriptional regulator. Here we report findings from a genome-wide comparison of the gene expression profiles in the wild-type and abf1-1 temperature-sensitive mutant. The study identifies a total of 86 Abf1p-regulated genes (1.4% of the genome) of which 50 are activated and 36 are repressed by Abf1p. Interestingly, Abf1p binds to its own promoter in vivo and strongly represses its own transcription, suggesting a potential negative regulatory loop in Abf1p-mediated gene regulation. A comparison of our microarray data with the available databases reveals a significant overlap of genes regulated by Abf1p and those by several general transcription factors such as Mot1p and TAFs (TATA-binding protein-associated factors). Different mutant alleles of abf1 affect Abf1p-mediated transcription in a gene-dependent manner. Furthermore, Abf1p in vivo is associated with the promoter region of most Abf1p-activated but not with that of most Abf1p-repressed genes. Taken together, these results strongly suggest distinct underlying mechanisms by which Abf1p regulates gene expression.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar to many site-specific transcription factors, Abf1p can be divided structurally into an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) (approximately aa 1–500) (17Cho G. Kim J. Rho H.M. Jung G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal activation domain (AD) (aa 604–731) (18Li R. Yu D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the DBD of Abf1p is responsible for recognizing specific DNA sequences, the C-terminal AD confers the stimulatory activity of Abf1p in all three chromosomal events (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Detailed mutagenesis of the AD indicates the presence of two critical regions named C-terminal sequence 1 (CS1) (aa 624–628) and CS2 (aa 639–662) (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although both regions are important for the essential function of Abf1p in supporting cell viability, they seem to play distinct roles in various Abfp1-mediated nuclear events. CS2 is capable of inducing chromatin remodeling, which most likely accounts for its positive role in multiple nuclear events such as transcription and DNA replication (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent study indicates that CS1 plays an important role in the nuclear localization of Abf1p. 2C. M. Loch, submitted for publication. 2C. M. Loch, submitted for publication. Despite these findings, the impact of different functional domains of Abf1p on global gene expression remains to be examined. Abf1p also distinguishes itself from most of the known yeast transcription factors in several aspects. First, as reviewed above, Abf1p stands out as a multifunctional protein that stimulates diverse chromosomal events. Second, unlike many transcription factors that are present in low intracellular concentrations and are dedicated to gene expression under specific physiological conditions (e.g. Gal4p for galactose metabolism), Abf1p is very abundant and apparently involved in gene regulation of diverse metabolic activities. Given the presumed role of Abf1 in global gene regulation, it is intriguing that Abf1p only displays weak trans-activation potential (20Goncalves P.M. Griffioen G. Minnee R. Bosma M. Kraakman L.S. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Wiltshire S. Raychaudhuri S. Eisenberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but acts synergistically with other trans-acting factors to stimulate transcription (14Morrow B.E. Johnson S.P. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Of note, many of these features of Abf1p are shared by another abundant, essential, and multifunctional protein Rap1p despite their apparent non-overlapping functions in yeast (22Morse R.H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed a whole genome approach to identify Abf1p-regulated genes in the yeast genome. Our results uncover a surprisingly small number of Abf1p target genes, one of which is ABF1 itself. Despite the general importance of the various functional domains of Abf1p in gene regulation, our finding also indicates a gene-specific effect of these domains on transcriptional regulation. Finally, the Abf1p-controlled gene expression profile shares a significant overlap with those of Mot1p and certain TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAFs), suggesting a functional cooperation between Abf1p and these general transcription factors. Yeast Media, Genetic Analysis, and Strains—TMY86 (MATaade2–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 can1–100 abf1::HIS3MX6 pRS416-ABF1) (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and its derivatives carrying various abf1 mutant plasmids were used in this study. Standard techniques were used for preparation of yeast media, genetic analyses, and yeast transformation (23Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Plasmids—The K625I mutation was introduced into pRS415-ABF1-(1–662) by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the FLAG-tagged Abf1p and its derivatives were constructed in the following manner. First, a SalI site was introduced between the first and second codon of ABF1 on the shuffling plasmid pRS415-ABF1-(1–662) (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, three tandem repeats of an oligonucleotide (5′-TCG ATT ATA AAG ATG ATG ACG ATA AAG GTG GTG-3′) encoding the FLAG tag were introduced at the SalI site of the pBluescript vector (Stratagene). A fragment containing the three tandem repeats was excised by the XhoI-SalI digestion and subsequently cloned into SalI site of the re-engineered shuffling plasmid. To generate the other FLAG-tagged ABF1 mutant constructs, the modified 5′-coding region of the full-length ABF1 shuffling vector was used to replace that of various mutants of ABF1 as described previously (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Microarray Hybridization Experiments and Data Analysis—Microarray hybridization and data analyses were described previously (25Dasgupta A. Darst R.P. Martin K.J. Afshari C.A. Auble D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant strains were cultured in YPAD medium at 30 °C until A600 reached 1.0–1.2. The culture was split into two, and each was mixed with the same volume of YPAD preheated at 30 and 42 °C, respectively, to reach the final temperature of 30 or 36 °C. After a 45-min incubation, the cultures were harvested and processed for further analyses. RNA was isolated, and microarray hybridization was performed in quadruplicate as described previously. The complete ABF1 microarray dataset is available at dir.niehs.nih.gov/microarray/datasets/home-pub.htm. Note that four genes were eliminated from the original microarray data for the following reasons. YOL053C-A and YCLX10C most probably do not represent genuine yeast genes. YGL032C (AGA2) was deleted because the fold of change was <1.8. YCL018W (LEU2) was omitted, because LEU2 was used as a marker for shuffling and it was unclear whether the microarray result of LEU2 reflects chromosomal gene expression. To measure the overlap between genes affected by Abf1p and genes affected in previously published experiments as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, published data sets were taken from several sources (25Dasgupta A. Darst R.P. Martin K.J. Afshari C.A. Auble D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I.

A PERL program was written to match hybridization data for genes affected by Abf1p with the hybridization data for those same genes in other published experiments. Clusters and trees were produced from hybridization data using protocols available at slcview.stanford.edu/.Fig. 5Correlation between Abf1p-regulated gene set and the gene expression profile in cells at stationary phase.Clustering and tree views were made from the abf1-1 and YPD stationary growing cell data sets of Abf1p-regulated genes. YPD stationary data were retrieved from previously published work (27Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). The lengths of the culturing time following inoculation at A600 = 0.3 are indicated. Clustering is applied only to the genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RNA Isolation, Northern Blotting, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—RNA was isolated by following the methods described previously (25Dasgupta A. Darst R.P. Martin K.J. Afshari C.A. Auble D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were resolved by formaldehyde-containing agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane, and probed with radiolabeled random-primed DNA probes corresponding to specific genes. Signals were detected by autoradiography. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described previously (28Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Whole Genome Analysis of Abf1p-regulated Genes—To conduct a genome-wide search for genes that are regulated by Abf1p, total RNA was isolated from wild-type ABF1+ cells and cells harboring a temperature-sensitive abf1 mutant (abf1-1) (29Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This mutant allele was chosen, because it causes a complete loss of the DNA binding ability of the protein and thus abolishes the protein function in all of the Abf1p-mediated nuclear events at the restrictive temperature (29Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-labeled cDNA was used to co-hybridize microarray chips that contain 6,024 yeast open reading frames. Four independent co-hybridization experiments were performed, and the data were analyzed. 86 genes displayed over a 1.8-fold difference in expression between the wild-type and mutant strains at the 99% confidence level (Supplemental Table I). Among these genes, 50 were expressed at lower levels in the mutant background and thus scored as Abf1p-activated genes (Supplemental Table IA), whereas the remaining 36 were expressed more robustly in the abf1-1 strain and therefore were considered as Abf1p-repressed genes (Supplemental Table IB). The list includes some (e.g. ARO3 (30Kunzler M. Springer C. Braus G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and TRP3 (31Martens J.A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) but not all of the previously identified Abf1p-regulated genes (e.g. ADH1 (32Yoo H.Y. Jung S.Y. Kim Y.H. Kim J. Jung G. Rho H.M. Curr. Microbiol. 1995; 31: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and TUB2 (4Halfter H. Kavety B. Vandekerckhove J. Kiefer F. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4265-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). The Abf1p-controlled gene set represents 1.4% of the genome and entails genes involved in a diverse range of cellular and biological processes in budding yeast including signal transduction (e.g. MFA1), protein biosynthesis (e.g. RIX7, HBS1, RPL5, and RPP1A), stress response (e.g. HSP12 and HSP26), amino acid biosynthesis (e.g. ARO3, PRO3, and TRP3), and phosphate metabolism (IPP1). Intriguingly, the expression of the ABF1 gene itself is significantly increased in the abf1-1 mutant background, indicating a negative feedback loop involved in the ABF1 gene expression. Effects of Multiple Mutant Alleles of abf1 on Abf1p-mediated Gene Expression—Using Northern blot analysis, we confirmed the effect of ABF1 on the expression of seven Abf1p-activated and five Abf1p-repressed genes. RNA was isolated from the wild-type and abf1-1 mutant cells grown at either the semi-permissive (30 °C) or restrictive temperature (36 °C). As shown in Fig. 1A, the message levels of the genes in the first group were increased to various degrees in the abf1-1 background (compare lane 1 with 2 and lane 8 with 9), consistent with them being Abf1p-repressed genes. In contrast, the transcripts of the second group of genes were significantly reduced in the mutant strain (Fig. 1B), thus corroborating the stimulatory effect of Abf1p on expression of these genes. As controls, the transcription of those genes in the third group (TUB2, ACT1, and SPT15) remained relatively constant in the wild-type and mutant cells at both temperatures (Fig. 1C). It is also worth noting that the effect of abf1-1 on some genes (e.g. TRP3 and ARO3) only manifested at the restrictive temperature (compare the difference between lanes 1 and 2 with that between lanes 8 and 9). This observation is correlated with the microarray findings of relatively small differences in gene expression at these loci between the wild-type and mutant strains (Supplemental Table I). Abf1p can be divided structurally into an N-terminal DBD (roughly aa 1–500) and a C-terminal AD (aa 604–731) (17Cho G. Kim J. Rho H.M. Jung G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Li R. Yu D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The severe phenotype of abf1-1, which carries a point mutation in the zinc finger motif and therefore impairs the DNA binding ability of the protein, is in full agreement with the essential role of the DBD in Abf1p-mediated gene regulation (29Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The abf1-5 mutant, which harbors a point mutation that leads to a P357L change in the second DNA-binding domain of Abf1p (aa 323–496) (17Cho G. Kim J. Rho H.M. Jung G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), displays thermolabile binding to DNA in vitro (29Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As expected, Abf1p-dependent gene expression was also significantly affected in the abf1-5 mutant background (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 10). Detailed mutagenesis of the AD conducted in our laboratory indicates the presence of two critical regions for Abf1p function named CS1 (aa 624–28) and CS2 (aa 644–48) (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the GAL4-tethering approach used in the previous work precluded the assessment of the importance of the C-terminal AD in the expression of native Abf1p-controlled genes. Therefore, as described in detail below, we also examined the impact of several AD mutants on the expression of Abf1p-regulated genes. Consistent with the previous finding that the last 69 amino acids of Abf1p is dispensable for cell growth (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), Abf1p-(1–662), which lacks these sequences, behaved nearly equivalently to the full-length protein in mediating gene repression and activation (Fig. 1, compare lane 1 with 4 and 8 with 11). A larger C-terminal deletion that includes the CS2 region of the AD, as in the case of Abf1p-(1–643), led to the elevated expression of some Abf1p-repressed genes such as HSP12 and HSP26 as well as overall reduced levels of the Abf1p-activated genes (compare lane 1 with 6 and lane 8 with 13). Truncation of the entire activation domain (aa 1–607) severely impaired the regulation of all of the Abf1p-mediated genes examined (compare lane 1 with 7 and lane 8 with 14), consistent with the previous conclusion that this part of the protein contains an important trans-activation domain (19Miyake T. Loch C.M. Li R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among all of the abf1 mutant alleles examined in the study, a point mutation in CS1-(1–662/K625I) that resulted in impaired nuclear localization exhibited the most striking phenotypes at both temperatures (lanes 5 and 12).2 For instance, the Abf1p-repressed genes in the Abf1p-(1–662/K625I) mutant background were expressed at levels even higher than those in abf1-1. On the other hand, Abf1p-activated gene expression was significantly compromised in the 1–662/K625I mutant strain with some of the genes in this group expressed below detectable levels (e.g. PRO3 and SEC53). This finding clearly demonstrates the significance of the CS1 region in Abf1p-dependent gene regulation. It is noteworthy that a given mutant allele of abf1 does not appear to have a uniform impact on the different Abfp1-regulated genes within the same group. For example, abf1-1 reduced the expression of PRO3 to a lower level than did abf1-5, whereas the opposite was true for ARO3 and SEC53 (Fig. 1, compare lanes 9 and 10). Likewise, although abf1-1, 1–662/K625I, and 1–607 mutants had similar effects on the expression of IMD1, RPP1A, TRP3, and ARO3, the 1–662/K625I mutant clearly gave rise to a more prominent increase in the steady-state levels of MFA1 and ABF1. The gene-specific effect of the different abf1 mutant alleles may result from distinct interactions of Abf1p with specific promoter sequences and other trans-acting factors. Distinct Modes of Abf1p Action in Transcriptional Activation and Repression—Given the DNA sequence-specific binding nature of Abf1p, it was of importance to determine whether the Abf1p-mediated gene regulation was due to a direct or an indirect impact of the protein at the corresponding promoters. The Yeast Genome Pattern Matching in the Saccharomyces genome data base indicates a total of 1,787 consensus Abf1p-binding sites (RTCRYNNNNNACG) (29Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that are located within the 1,000-base pair region upstream of the initiation codons of 1,497 yeast genes. Among the 50 Abf1p-activated genes revealed by the current microarray study, 39 genes contain a total of 42 putative ABF1-binding sites (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the majority of the putative binding sites (35Loo S. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 519-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) are located between 100 and 250 bp upstream of the initiation codon (Fig. 2B). In contrast, only 6 of the 36 Abf1p-repressed genes contain the consensus Abf1p-binding sites within the 1,000-base pair upstream region examined. A recent genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (“ChIP on Chip”) of yeast transcription factors has led to the prediction of 275 (p < 0.001) and 458 (p < 0.005) Abf1p-bound genes, the largest numbers among all of the known site-specific transcription factors in yeast (6Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.T. Thompson C.M. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tange J. Volkert T.L. Fraenkel E. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only 5 (p < 0.001) and 12 (p < 0.005) of the predicted genes were identified as the 50 Abf1p-activated genes in the current microarray study. Furthermore, only one of the 36 Abf1p-repressed genes is predicted to be Abf1p-associated at the p < 0.005 value. To directly assess the physical association of Abf1p with its target promoters, we performed ChIP using yeast strains harboring FLAG-tagged full-length Abf1p or its derivatives. As shown in Fig. 3, four of five Abf1p-activated promoters examined were associated with the FLAG-tagged wild-type Abf1p (lane 2) and those derivatives carrying the intact DBD (lane 4 for aa 1–662 and lane 5 for aa 1–643). As controls, cells harboring untagged wild-type Abf1p (lane 1) or the tagged DNA-binding defective mutant abf1-1 (lane 3) did not give rise to any significant signals for the specific PCR products. Furthermore, PCR amplification of the ChIP samples for the coding region of the corresponding genes (e.g. ARO3 and IPP open reading frames) did not yield any specific signals, strongly suggesting that the amplified promoter fragments were due to an association of Abf1p with the corresponding promoter regions. Interestingly, the promoter region of the Abf1p-activated gene PRO3, which does not contain any Abf1p consensus binding sites in its promoter region, is not associated with Abf1p in vivo (Fig. 3). In addition, most of the Abf1p-repressed promoters examined did not show any indication of in vivo association with Abf1p in the ChIP assay (Fig. 3). The only exception in this category is the ABF1 promoter, which contains multiple consensus Abf1p-binding sites and is apparently associated with Abf1p to a similar extent as the Abf1p-activated promoters. This finding lends additional support to the notion that Abf1p negatively autoregulates its expression by directly binding to its own promoter. Lastly, Abf1p was clearly associated with the promoter regions of both the TUB2 and ACT1 genes, yet neither gene was identified as the Abf1p-controlled gene in the microarray or Northern blot analysis. Taken together, the ChIP results suggest different modes of Abf1p action in gene activation and repression. Whereas most of the Abf1p-mediated transcriptional activation may be carried out upon direct binding of the regulator protein to the transcriptional promoters, many of the Abf1p-repressed genes may be targeted by Abf1p through an indirect mechanism (also see “Discussion”). In addition, Abf1p association with a given promoter is apparently not sufficient for the transcription factor to exert a major impact on the promoter activity. Correlations with the Actions of Other Transcription Regulators—To determine whether the Abf1p-dependent gene expression profile is correlated with the gene expression profiles of other transcription regulators, the Abf1p-regulated gene sets were compared with a total of 492 different available gene profiles. Figs. 4 and 5 represent comparisons of the microarray data from the current study and the data from previously published work (25Dasgupta A. Darst R.P. Martin K.J. Afshari C.A. Auble D.T. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W2092116013,"The yeast gene VHS3 (YOR054c) has been recently identified as a multicopy suppressor of the G1/S cell cycle blockade of a conditional sit4 and hal3 mutant. Vhs3 is structurally related to Hal3, a negative regulatory subunit of the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase Ppz1 important for cell integrity, salt tolerance, and cell cycle control. Phenotypic analyses using vhs3 mutants and overexpressing strains clearly show that Vhs3 has functions reminiscent to those of Hal3 and contrary to those of Ppz1. Mutation of Vhs3 His459, equivalent to the supposedly functionally relevant His90 in the plant homolog AtHal3a, did not affect Vhs3 functions mentioned above. Similarly to Hal3, Vhs3 binds in vivo to the C-terminal catalytic moiety of Ppz1 and inhibits in vitro its phosphatase activity. Therefore, our results indicate that Vhs3 plays a role as an inhibitory subunit of Ppz1. We have found that the vhs3 and hal3 mutations are synthetically lethal. Remarkably, lethality is not suppressed by deletion of PPZ1, PPZ2, or both phosphatase genes, indicating that it is not because of an excess of Ppz phosphatase activity. Furthermore, a Vhs3 version carrying the H459A mutation did not rescue the synthetically lethal phenotype. A conditional vhs3 tetO:HAL3 double mutant displays, in the presence of doxycycline, a flocculation phenotype that is dependent on the presence of Flo8 and Flo11. These results indicate that, besides its role as Ppz1 inhibitory subunit, Vhs3 (and probably Hal3) might have important Ppz-independent functions.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In all these cases, Ppz1 has a more prominent role, as denoted by the observation that cells lacking Ppz2 display a wild-type phenotype, unless PPZ1 has been also deleted. Recent evidence indicates that most of the phenotypes associated with the absence or the overexpression of the Ppz phosphatases are a consequence of the inhibitory effect that these phosphatases exert on the function of the Trk1/Trk2 potassium transporters (9Yenush L. Mulet J.M. Arino J. Serrano R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been postulated a negative role for Ppz1 on the calcineurin pathway, which would explain the increased expression of the ENA1 Na+-ATPase in ppz1 cells and, at least in part, the salt tolerant phenotype of the mutant strain (10Ruiz A. Yenush L. Arino J. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ppz1 is negatively regulated by Hal3/Sis2, which binds to the C-terminal catalytic moiety of the phosphatase and inhibits its activity (11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of inhibition is still unknown. HAL3/SIS2 was identified independently by two laboratories: as a gene able to confer saline tolerance when overexpressed (12Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defect of a sit4 mutant (13Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sit4 is a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (14Arndt K.T. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) required for proper passage from G1 to S phase (15Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell.

The current evidence suggests that Hal3 regulates most (if not all) the functions of Ppz1. Therefore, overexpression of HAL3 in an slt2/mpk1 MAP kinase mutant aggravates the lytic defect of this strain (11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), thus mimicking the effect of deletion of PPZ1. Similarly, overexpression of HAL3 confers salt tolerance (and increases ENA1 expression), and mutation of the gene results in salt sensitivity, in a Ppz-dependent fashion (10Ruiz A. Yenush L. Arino J. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, it is known that the sit4 and hal3 mutations are synthetically lethal because of a G1/S blockade (13Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Simon E. Clotet J. Calero F. Ramos J. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29740-29747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and this phenotype is suppressed by disruption of PPZ1 (8Clotet J. Gari E. Aldea M. Arino J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In a recent work (18Munoz I. Simon E. Casals N. Clotet J. Arino J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) we reported the use of a conditional sit4Δ tetO:HAL3 strain to screen for multicopy suppressors of the G1 blockade suffered by this strain under non permissive conditions (presence of doxycycline). Among the several ORFs identified, YOR054c (renamed as VHS3) has our immediate attention because it encoded an acidic, 674 residue protein displaying a substantial sequence similarity (49% identity) with Hal3. In this work we characterize the biological role of Vhs3 and demonstrate that in addition to acting as a negative regulatory subunit of the Ppz1 protein phosphatase, this protein may also have other important functions. Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast cells were grown at 28 °C in YPD medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, and 20 g/liter dextrose) or, when indicated, in synthetic minimal or complete minimal medium (19Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 147-148Google Scholar).

Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), containing the URA3 marker. The disruption cassette is recovered by digestion with KpnI/EcoRI and used to transform yeast cells. Disruption of VHS3 with the nat1 marker was accomplished as follows. The 1.29-kbp PvuII/SpeI fragment from plasmid pAG25 (21Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar), containing the nat1 gene from Streptomyces noursei was used to replace the 1.05-kbp SnaBI/NheI fragment of plasmid pUC19-VHS3. The deletion cassette was released by digestion with AfeI/PvuII and used to transform the appropriate strains. Positive clones were selected in the presence of nourseothricin (21Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Disruption of VHS3 with the kanMX marker (from nucleotides –40 to 2050, relative to the initiating Met codon) was accomplished by the short flanking gene replacement technique (22Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The HAL3 gene was disrupted with the LEU2 marker as previously described (12Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).

Deletion of the PPZ1 gene with the kanMX marker has been reported previously (24de Nadal E. Fadden R.P. Ruiz A. Haystead T. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Deletion of PPZ1 with the LEU2 marker was done by replacing a 1.6-kbp XhoI/StuI fragment from plasmid YEp181-Ppz1 (7Clotet J. Posas F. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26349-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the SmaI/SalI 1.7 kbp LEU2 marker from plasmid YDp-L (20Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The PstI/NdeI 2.5 kbp cassette is used to transform cells. Deletion of PPZ2 with a TRP1 marker was performed as described in Ref. 7Clotet J. Posas F. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26349-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. The use of the cassette tetO:HAL3 was described previously in Ref. 17Simon E. Clotet J. Calero F. Ramos J. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29740-29747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. Deletion of the FLO11/MUC1 gene was performed as follows. A 5.2-kbp region of the FLO11 genomic locus spanning the entire ORF, plus 484 nucleotides upstream and 761 nucleotides downstream, was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI/EcoRV sites of pBluescript to give plasmid pBS-FLO11. Then, a 3.6-kbp HincII/PstI fragment of the ORF was replaced by the 0.85-kbp TRP1 marker, recovered from plasmid YDp-W (20Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) by digestion with SmaI/PstI, to yield plasmid pBS-FLO11::TRP1. This plasmid was digested with ApaI/SacI, and the resulting 2.5-kbp fragment was used to transform cells. To construct the flo8::TRP1 cassette, a 3.99-kbp fragment spanning from –998 to +2987 (referred to the ATG of the FLO8 ORF) was amplified by PCR, digested with XbaI (an artificially added site) and EcoRV, and then cloned into the XbaI and HincII sites of pBluescript to give plasmid pBS-FLO8. An EcoRI/SalI 1.8-kbp fragment of the FLO8 gene was replaced by the marker TRP1 (0.85 kbp), recovered from plasmid YDp-W. The resulting construct, pBS-flo8::TRP1, was digested with NdeI, and cells were transformed with the 2.65-kbp fragment released. To disrupt the STE12 gene, a 3.7-kbp fragment (from –970 to +2700 relative to the initiating codon) was amplified by PCR including added PstI and EcoRI sites. After digestion with the indicated enzymes, it was inserted into pUC19 generating pUC19-STE12. Then, a HincII/BamHI 1.6-kbp fragment was replaced by the marker TRP1 (obtained by digestion of YDp-W with SmaI/BamHI). This plasmid, called pUC19-ste12::TRP1 was digested with SacI, and the 1.75-kbp ste12::TRP1 cassette used to transform the appropriate strains. Disruption of the TEC1 gene was made as follows. First, a 3.0-kbp fragment from positions –1050 to +1950 (referred to the ATG codon) was amplified by PCR using a 3′-primer with a KpnI artificial site. The fragment obtained by digestion with PstI and KpnI was cloned into pUC19, yielding plasmid pUC19-TEC1. Then, the 0.92-kbp XbaI/StuI fragment was replaced by the SmaI/NheI fragment of YDp-W, which contains the TRP1 marker and the resulting construct (pUC19-tec1::TRP1) digested with SphI and XhoI to produce the tec1::TRP1 cassette (2.95 kbp) employed for yeast transformation. The MSS11 gene was disrupted with the TRP1 marker as follows. A fragment from –950 to +2742 was amplified by PCR with an added HindIII restriction site, digested with BamHI/HindIII and cloned into the same sites of plasmid pUC19 to give pUC19-MSS11. The construct was cleaved by XhoI/HincII and the 0.89-kbp DNA fragment obtained was replaced with a 0.85-kbp TRP1 marker, previously released from plasmid YDp-W by digestion with SalI/SmaI. The final construct, pUC19-mss11::TRP1, was digested with SnaBI/KpnI and the 2.47 kbp fragment released was used for yeast transformation. All gene deletions generated in this work were confirmed by PCR. For high copy expression of HAL3, the gene was recovered from plasmid YEp351-HAL3 (12Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI/HindIII and cloned into these sites of YEplac112 (TRP1 marker) and YEplac181 (LEU2 marker) vectors (25Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). High copy expression of VHS3 was achieved by cloning a 3566-bp insert, starting from a KpnI site at position –776 from the ATG codon of VHS3 and ending at the EcoRI site located 765 bp after the stop codon, at these sites of plasmids YEplac195 (URA3 marker), YEplac181, or YEplac112 (TRP1 marker). An identical cloning strategy using plasmid YCplac22 (TRP1 marker) allowed low copy, centromeric expression. The construction of a version of VHS3 carrying a C-terminal 3×FLAG tag was as follows. An artificial SacI site right in front of the stop codon (which introduces the residues EL) was created by sequential PCR using external oligonucleotides that encompassed the ClaI and AfeI sites. The amplification fragment was digested with these enzymes and used to replace the 1.13-kbp ClaI/AfeI fragment of YEp195-VHS3. A 3×FLAG tag, with added SacI sites, was amplified by PCR from plasmid pCM220 (a gift of M. Aldea, Universitat de Lleida, Spain) and then cloned into the previous construct in the appropriate orientation to yield YEp195-VHS3(3×FLAG). Mutation of Vhs3 His459 to Ala was made by sequential PCR. In a first step, the 1.13-kbp ClaI/AfeI fragment of VHS3 gene was amplified in two separate reactions by using primers with the modification introduced to change His459 to Ala (CA to GC). In the second step the entire ClaI/AfeI fragment was amplified, digested, and the product cloned into the ClaI/AfeI sites of YEp195-VHS3, to yield YEp195-VHS3(H459A). The mutated version of the gene was also cloned in the centromeric plasmid YCplac22 as a KpnI/EcoRI fragment. To express in bacteria GST-Hal3 and GST-Vhs3 fusion proteins the HAL3 and VHS3 genes were amplified by PCR, with added EcoRI/XhoI sites, and cloned into plasmid pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The catalytic domain of Ppz1 (Δ1–344) amplified by PCR as described previously (7Clotet J. Posas F. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26349-26355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was cloned into the SalI and HindIII sites of the pSP72 vector (Promega) to yield plasmid pSC2. The insert was recovered by digestion with BamHI and PvuII and cloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of plasmid pGEX6P-1. The constructs for bacterial expression of GST-Ypi1 and GST-Glc7 have been previously described (26Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A FLO11-lacZ reporter plasmid (pFLO11-LacZ) was constructed by PCR amplification of the 3-kbp region 5′ of the ATG using primers with added BglII sites, following by cloning into the BamHI site of YEp367R (27Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). All fragments generated by PCR reactions (with the only exception of the FLO11 promoter) were fully sequenced to confirm the absence of unwanted changes. β-Galactosidase Assays—To evaluate the influence of high levels of HAL3 or VHS3 on ENA1 expression, the different strains tested were transformed with plasmids YEpHAL3 or YEpVHS3, and then with plasmid pKC201, which contains the entire ENA1 promoter fused to the β-galactosidase gene (28Alepuz P.M. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described in Ref. 10Ruiz A. Yenush L. Arino J. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Analysis of the FLO11 promoter activity was carried out by introducing into the appropriate strains the FLO11-lacZ reporter described above. Cultures were grown overnight in selective medium, diluted up to an OD660 of 0.005 and then grown for 15 h at 28 °C in YPD medium, in the presence or the absence of 100 μg/ml doxycycline (control cells received the same volume of the vehicle, a 50% ethanol solution). Then cells were collected and processed for β-galactosidase assay as above. In Vitro and in Vivo Binding Assays—In vitro binding assays were performed as follows. GST-Ppz1(Δ1–344) was expressed in bacteria and bound to glutathione-agarose beads essentially as described previously (26Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from strain EDN75 (ppz1Δ) were prepared as described (11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and 1 mg of total protein incubated with 50 μl of the affinity beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Washing and subsequent procedures were as in Ref. 11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar except that after extensive washing the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled. After a brief centrifugation, the sample (10 μl) was electrophoresed, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-FLAG-antibodies (Sigma). Expression in yeast of the GST fusion versions of the full-length and the catalytic domain of Ppz1 from the native PPZ1 promoter was accomplished by transformation of strain EDN75 (ppz1::kanMX) with plasmids pYGST-C1Z1 and pYGST-C2Z1, respectively (11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Identification of in vivo binding of Vhs3 with the different Ppz1 versions was carried out essentially as previously described for Hal3 (11de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) except that cells were transformed in this case with plasmid YEp195-VHS3(3×FLAG) and bound proteins revealed with anti-FLAG antibodies.

It is found that the highly ordered HAP nanocrystallite assembly is attributed to the so-called self-(homo)epitaxial nucleation and growth. On the other hand, according to this mechanism, a high supersaturation will give rise to a random assembly of HAP crystallites. The effects of ions, biosubstrate, and supersaturation on the micro/nanostructure correlation between substrate and biominerals as well as their implications in hard tissue formation were examined. Surprisingly, some biomolecules are found to be able to suppress the supersaturation-driven interfacial structure mismatch and hence promote the well aligned HAP pattern formation.

The biomineralization of compounds such as hydroxyapatite (HAP), 1The abbreviation used is: HAP, hydroxyapatite.1The abbreviation used is: HAP, hydroxyapatite. Ca5(PO4)3(OH), and CaCO3 plays a vital role in our life and the environment around us (1Ali S.Y. Evens L. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 647-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berman A. Hanson J. Addadi L. Weiner S. Nature. 1988; 331: 546-548Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 3Mann S. Nature. 1993; 365: 499-505Crossref Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 4Berman A. Leiserowitz L. Koetzle T.F. Weiner S. Addadi L. Science. 1993; 259: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). HAP is the key component of teeth and bones. Many hard tissues consist of well organized and assembled aggregates of biomineral nanocrystallites. Such self-organized and assembled biomineral aggregates possess properties far superior to those of the single crystals alone. For instance, human teeth mainly consist of well aligned and compact HAP crystals, which provide high hardness and elasticity, whereas the HAP crystals of the bones are less well ordered (5Anderson H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 6Ten Cate A.R. Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1985Google Scholar). Evidently, differently assembled structures among biominerals and organic substrates acquire different elastic and mechanical properties. However, the mechanism of forming these mineral structures in biological systems is not yet clear. Previous studies of biomineralization imply that nucleation plays an important part in the pattern formation of biomineral nanocrystallites through the mediating role of many organic and inorganic substrates or particles (7Winter A. Seisser S.G. Coccolithophores. Cambridge University Press, New York1994: 51-62Google Scholar, 8Lindahl U. Hook M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 9Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). The occurrence of these additives not only determines the crystallization process but also has a significant impact on the size, shape, aggregation pattern, and properties of the materials. Thus, a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of nucleation is essential for the methods of engineering of micro/nanostructures of materials applicable across a broad spectrum of materials-based technologies, having significant implications for life sciences. Although many authors, aware of the importance of proteins or biomolecules in the biomineralization of organisms, put forward some global nucleation models and concepts that elucidate the formation of high order organization based on aggregation-mediated processes (10Colfen H. Mann S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003; 42: 2350-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), they do not give detailed insight into the pathways and rigorous concepts. To understand the precise mechanism is still a difficult task, in particular, the kinetics of nucleation. Our experiments show that biopolymeric molecules facilitate the alignment of a well ordered assembly of HAP crystallites by changing the kinetics of self-epitaxial nucleation of daughter (or secondary) HAP crystals, which nucleate and grow on the surface of existing (parent) HAP crystallites. In this work, we examine the mechanism controlling the pattern formation of nanocrystallites, in particular, the formation of synergistic alignment of HAP under various conditions. We focus on the nucleation and the synergistic structure formation of HAP in a so-called body fluid to reach an understanding of the process of biomineralization. In connection with the obtained results, we study the templating effect of the substrate and the newly identified supersaturation-driven interfacial structure mismatch effect as well as their implications on the ordered pattern formation. It has been noted that many biomolecules, especially proteins, exert a strong impact on biomineral assemblies. In this work, we also examine and analyze how some of these molecules influence the HAP nanocrystallite self-alignment. Model of Heterogeneous Nucleation—As the first step, the formation of biomineralization, nucleation, and particularly heterogeneous nucleation plays an important role in building up a complex structure. Thus, it is necessary to establish a quantitative description of nucleation. According to classical nucleation theory, nucleation is a process of creating nuclei with a size larger than the critical size. This is associated with a process of overcoming the nucleation barrier as controlled by the fluctuation and growth of crystalline clusters. Because foreign bodies, such as microclusters, macromolecules, and biomembranes, occur inevitably in biological systems, in most cases nucleation has a heterogeneous rather than a homogeneous nature (11Oxtoby D.W. Nature. 2000; 406: 464-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the following discussion, we examine HAP nucleation based on a newly developed model (12Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). The supersaturation σ is the source of a driving force for biomineralization and can be defined according to thermodynamics (13Chernov A.A. Modern Crystallography III-Crystal Growth. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 225-307Google Scholar) by Equation 1,ln(1+σ)=Δμ/kT=ln(a/ae)eq.1 where Δμ denotes the chemical potential difference between the solution state and the equilibrium state of the crystallizing species, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and a and ae are the actual and equilibrium activities of a given ion, respectively. As biomineralization occurs in electrolyte solutions, the thermodynamic driving force is then defined as (14Zettlemoyer A.C. Nucleation. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar) Equation 2,Δμ=kT ln[a(Ca2+)]5[a(PO43−)]3[a(OH−)]Ksp(HAP) eq.2 whereKsp(=[ae(Ca2+)]5[ae(PO43−)]3[ae(OH−)]) is the solubility product at a given temperature. To obtain the activities of the ions in the solution, we first calculate the ionic strength given as (15Harris D.C. Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1999: 175-190Google Scholar) Equation 3,I=12∑icizi2eq.3 where ci represents the concentration of the ith ion and zi represents the ion charge. The calculation of the activity coefficient γ by the Debye-Huckel Law is subject to some limitations because of the point charge assumption made in that law. An estimation using this law is reliable only for extremely dilute solutions, and therefore, it can only be applied at low ionic strength. However, in the extended Debye-Huckel theory (15Harris D.C. Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1999: 175-190Google Scholar), not only is the ion size taken into account by incorporating the mean effective diameter of the hydrated ions but also the temperature and the solvent effect are taken into account, resulting in improved accuracy of the prediction. Therefore, the following expression of the activity is applicable for solutions having much higher ionic strength, especially for the multiionic systems as shown in Equation 4,logγ=−0.51z2I1+(αI305)eq.4 where α is the hydrated ionic radius. So the activity of the ions can be obtained using the Equation 5.a=γ×ceq.5 Nucleation, being the first step of biomineralization, means overcoming a free energy barrier, the so-called nucleation barrier (ΔG*) at a given thermodynamic driving force Δμ (14Zettlemoyer A.C. Nucleation. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in the size of a crystalline cluster. It is found that nucleation normally consists of a number of heterogeneous nucleation processes if the interfacial free energy between the crystal and the fluid phases is not too low (16Liu X.Y. J. Chem. Phys. 1999; 111: 1628-1635Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Liu X.Y. Strom C.S. J. Chem. Phys. 2000; 113: 4408-4411Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Liu X.Y. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 7337-7345Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the association between the substrate and the biominerals is largely determined by heterogeneous nucleation, we examine in the following analysis the impact of the nucleation on the kinetics and the formation of the self-organized structure of biomineral aggregates. Taking into account the effect of the substrate on both the nucleation barrier and the transport process, the nucleation induction is given according to the model (12Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar, 19Liu X.Y. J. Chem. Phys. 2000; 112: 9949-9955Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 6,J=(Rs)2Nof“(m)[f(m)]1/2B exp[−ΔGhomo*kTf(m)] eq.6 with Equation 7,ΔGhomo*=16πγcf3Ω23[kT ln(1+σ)]eq.7 and Equations 8 and 9,f′′(m)=12(1−m)eq.8 f(m)=14(2−3m+m3)eq.9 where Rs and N0 are the radius and the density of the substrates respectively, B is the kinetic constant, ΔΔGhomo* is the homogeneous nucleation barrier, γcf is the specific interfacial free energy between the crystals and the mother phase, and Ω is the volume of the growth units. In Equations 6, 7, 8, 9, m depends on the interaction and (statistical) interfacial structural match between the crystalline phase and the foreign bodies and is expressed as a function of the interfacial free energies among the different phases as shown in Equation 10.m=(γsf−γsc)/γcf(−1≤m≤1)eq.10 Here, γsf, γsc, and γcf correspond to the interfacial tension between substrate and fluid, crystal and substrate, and crystal and fluid, respectively. In the presence of the substrates, the nucleation barrier assumes the form (12Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar) in Equation 11,ΔGheter*=ΔGhomo*f(m)(0≤f≤1)eq.11 where f(m) is a factor describing the lowering of the nucleation barrier ΔG* because of the occurrence of foreign bodies. Substituting the appropriate values of m, γcf, and Δμ into Equations 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, we can calculateΔGheter* and, correspondingly, the specific f(m) for any nucleation process. Notice that the factor f(m) varies from 1 to 0. Obviously, this factor plays an important role in the determination of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier,ΔGheter*. The influence of foreign particles, such as dust particles, proteins, or even existing HAP crystallites, on the nucleation barrier and the association between the nucleating phase and the substrate can be fully characterized by this factor. To describe the kinetics of nucleation, one of the most common ways is to measure the induction time (ts) of nucleation at different supersaturations. By definition (12Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar), the nucleation rate J can be expressed as Equation 12,J≅1/(tsV)eq.12 where V is the volume of the system. It then follows from Equation 6 that Equation 13,lnts=κf(m)[ln(1+σ)]2−ln{V(Rs)2N0f′′(m)[f(m)]1/2B}eq.13 whereκ=16πγcf3Ω2/3(kT)3, will remain constant under a given condition. Interfacial Structure Match and Mismatch—Concerning the effect of a foreign body, most theories published so far mainly focus on the influence on the nucleation barrier (13Chernov A.A. Modern Crystallography III-Crystal Growth. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 225-307Google Scholar, 20Laaksonen A. Talanquer V. Oxtoby D.W. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1995; 46: 489-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21Weakliem C.L. Reiss H. J. Chem. Phys. 1994; 101: 2398-2406Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Zeng X.C. Oxtoby D.W. J. Chem. Phys. 1991; 94: 4472-4478Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23McGraw R. Laaksonen A. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 76: 2754-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Actually, the occurrence of a foreign body will not only lower the nucleation barrier but also affect the transport of growth units to the surface of the crystalline clusters. As shown in Fig. 1, in the case of homogeneous nucleation, the growth units can be incorporated into the nucleus from all directions. However, nucleation on a foreign particle will cause a reduction in the “effective surface” of the nucleus where the growth units are incorporated into the nucleus. This tends to slow down the nucleation kinetics, which cancels the effect of lowering the nucleation barrier. As a result, these will exert a direct impact on the formation of self-organized aggregates mediated by nucleation and can be described by the interfacial correlation factor f(m) and f″(m) in the pre-exponential factor of Equation 6. According to Equation 10, m is directly associated with γcs, which depends on the interaction and structural match between the nucleating phase and the substrate. For a given crystalline phase and substrate, the optimal structural match at crystallographic orientation (hkl) corresponds to the strongest average interaction or the lowest interfacial energy difference, i.e. the (minimal) cusp in the γ-plot (Fig. 2A). In the neighborhood of the minimal specific interfacial free energy, γcs(α) and corresponding m are given (24Gebhardt M. Hartman P. Crystal Growth: an Introduction. North-Holland, Publishing Co., Amsterdam1972: 105-142Google Scholar) in Equations 14 and 15,γcs(α)≈γcsmin+ϵbα4π(1−p)(1−α−αmaxαmax)eq.14 m≈γsfγcf{1−1γsf[γcsmin+ϵbα4π(1−p)(1−α−αmaxαmax)]}eq.15 where α is the misorientation angle, ϵ is elastic modulus, and p and b are the Poisson constant and Burgers vector, respectively. In general, the interfacial structure match between the crystalline phase and the substrate changes from a completely correlated and ordered state to a completely uncorrelated and disordered mismatch state as m varies from 1 to –1. For instance, an excellent structural match (γcs(α) → 0 or m → 1) implies thatΔGheter* vanishes almost completely. This occurs only when the growing crystals are well oriented and ordered with respect to the structure of the substrate. Whereas, in the case of m → –1, the substrate exerts almost no influence on the nucleation, the nucleation is controlled by the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation, which results in the nuclei emerging as disordered. Due to the anisotropy of the crystalline phase, the available γcs(α) or m values should be a discrete set of values. Therefore, when the structural match deviates from the optimal structural match position, a secondary optimal structural match will be adopted. According to Equation 15 with the deviation far from the optimal structural match, m will shift from m = 1 to a lower value, e.g. m2 (cf.Fig. 2, B and C). Kinetic Effect of Supersaturation and Substrate on Structure Correlation—Because for the crystalline phase m and f(m) take on only those values corresponding to some crystallographically preferred orientations, we should obtain a set of intercepting straight lines from the lnts versus 1/[ln(1 + σ)]2 plot according to Equation 13 (cf. Fig. 3A). These lines with different slopes κf(m) in different regimes indicate that nucleation is governed by a sequence of progressive heterogeneous processes. According to Fig. 3A, the change of κf(m) can also be described using Fig. 3B. With increasing supersaturation, the interfacial correlation factor subsequently increases from f(m1) to f(m2), because κ is the constant for a given nucleation system. This finding unambiguously implies that an increase in supersaturation tends to drive the interfacial structure correlation between substrates and biominerals from a match state to a mismatch state (Fig. 2C). Apart from supersaturation, the role of the substrate is another important factor that influences the interfacial properties. Although the occurrence of a substrate will promote nucleation by providing templating, it will also exert a negative impact on the surface integration. As mentioned before, nucleation on a substrate will reduce the effective collision of structural units to the surface of clusters, which slows down the nucleation kinetics. These two contradictory effects play different roles in different regimes. At low supersaturations where the nucleation barrier is very high, heterogeneous nucleation with an optimal structural match between the crystalline phase and the substrate will be kinetically favored. In this case, the nucleation of crystalline materials will be best templated by substrates. However, at higher supersaturations where the nucleation barrier becomes less important, instead of the nucleation barrier it is the effective collisions described by the factors f(m) and f″(m) that dominate in controlling the kinetics. Thus, nucleation on substrates with larger f(m) and f″(m) will be favored and lead to a mismatch structure. As mentioned above, the templating of a substrate and the supersaturation-driven interfacial structure mismatch are two effects playing opposing roles in nucleation. Thus, we can fabricate and engineer the complex structures of functional materials on the micro/nano scale by carefully adjusting these two effects. In our experiments, we examine the kinetics of HAP nucleation and the effects of additives and supersaturation on structure correlation from the prepared solutions using a dynamic light-scattering system (BI-200SM, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation) with a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) source and a photomultiplier tube detector. This can be achieved by measuring the induction time, ts, of nucleation at different supersaturations (12Liu X.Y. Sato K. Nakajima K. Furukawa Y. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). To mimic the kinetics of the biomineralization process in the human body, the nucleation of HAP was carried out in a so-called body fluid. The supersaturated aqueous solutions were prepared to simulate physiological conditions according to which the ionic concentrations in solutions such as Na+, Ca2+, K+, Cl–, andHPO42− are similar to the physiological concentrations in the body fluid (25Kokubo T. Ito S. Huang Z.T. Hayashi T. Sakka S. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2000; 24: 331-343Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Because there are many components (including inorganic ions and organic matrices) that play different roles in biomineralization, we studied some of their effects separately. In the nucleation kinetics experiments of HAP, we first prepared two solutions with a mole ratio 1.67 of calcium/phosphorus by dissolving reagent-grade CaCl2·2H2O and K2HPO4·3H2O in deionized water. The reaction equation for hydroxyapatite is as indicated in Reaction 1.5Ca2++3HPO42−+H2O=Ca5(PO4)3(OH)↓+4H+Reaction 1 After determining the range of concentrations at which ts could be detected, a series of concentrations of two solutions was prepared by gradually diluting the original solutions. Both kinds of solutions then were injected through filters (200 nm) into a rectangular glass cell to examine the kinetics by dynamic light scattering at room temperature. Subsequently, we studied the effect of some foreign agents on the nucleation and the aggregation of HAP because there are many other compositions such as salts, glycans, and proteins in the body fluid. We examined the kinetics of HAP from the prepared solutions with 140 mm NaCl, 100 mg/liter lysozyme (Sigma), 10 mg/liter chondroitin sulfate (Sigma), 5 mg/liter phosvitin (Sigma), and 1 mg/liter type I collagen (Sigma), respectively. To guarantee the accuracy of the data before carrying out the experiments, the nucleation vessels were cleaned properly and the solutions were filtrated several times by filters with a pore size of 200 nm. All of the solutions used were prepared freshly before performing the experiments. According to our model, to mimic the self-organized structure of hard tissue, we also studied the formation of the self-alignment of HAP crystallite aggregates under different conditions. We obtained a series of HAP precipitates from the solutions with different supersaturations and additives. To confirm the crystal phases of the samples prepared under such conditions, x-ray diffraction analyses were carried out and the obtained x-ray diffraction patterns matched those of HAP crystals from the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards powder diffraction data base (Fig. 4). This implies that HAP is the only stable calcium phosphate compound under normal physiological conditions because of the lowest solubility product among calcium phosphate phases (26Elliott J.C. Structure and Chemistry of the Apatites and Other Calcium Orthophosphates. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1994: 111-190Google Scholar, 27McDowell H. Gregory T.M. Brown W.E. J. Res. Natl. Bur. Standards. 1977; 81A: 273Crossref Google Scholar). The microstructure of HAP aggregates was observed using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6700F, JEOL) after coating with platinum to increase the conductivity. Kinetic Effect of Supersaturation and Substrate on Biomineralization—In our experiments, concrete evidence supporting the above analyses can be identified from the ln(ts) versus 1/[ln(1 +σ)]2 plot. To examine the influence of the supersaturation and the substrate on the kinetics and the structure correlation between HAP crystallites, the ln(ts) versus 1/[ln(1 +σ)]2 plots were constructed for HAP nucleation from different systems as presented in Fig. 5. According to Equation 13, for a given system (κ and B = constant), we can analyze the change of the structure correlation between the substrate and the crystalline phase in terms of the variation of the slope. As shown in Fig. 5A, the depicted curve 1 (nucleation from the solution without additives) can in principle be fit by two intersecting straight lines with different slopes, which divides the supersaturation space into two regimes at σ * = 1.54 × 1014. This indicates that the nucleation is controlled by two discrete values of f q(m) within the corresponding regimes. As the supersaturation increases from regime I to II, f(m) will subsequently increase from 1.05 × 105/κ to 2.10 × 105/κ (cf. Fig. 5C, curve 1). This implies that the structural match between the substrate and the nucleating crystallites becomes poor as supersaturation increases. This observation is in good agreement with the predicted changes shown in Fig. 3 (supersaturation-driven interfacial structure mismatch) (28Liu X.Y. Lim S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our experiments also show a similar result for HAP nucleation from solutions containing Na+ and Cl– ions (CNaCl = 140 mm) (cf. Fig. 5A, curve 2). An obvious difference is that the slopes of curve 2 (2.89 × 104 in regime I and 4.13 × 104 in regime II) are much smaller than those of curve 1 within the given range of supersaturation. In this case, although the concentrations of CaCl2 and K2HPO4 increase much in the solutions with NaCl, the activities of Ca2+ andPO43− will not change much because of the buffering effect of additive ions, which can influence the activity coefficients by changing the ionic strength. This finding implies that the accumulation of supersaturation of HAP for nucleation in a biosystem will be buffered because of the high concentration of other ions. It follows that the effect of the supersaturation-driven interfacial mismatch can be suppressed to some extent by increasing the ion strength. In nature, biomineralization is a highly complex process and involves a large number of components, which serve as “regulating” agents in controlling the shape and the crystallite assembly of biominerals. As mentioned before, this is a growing area especially in the field of materials engineering where the effective control of the nucleation process is essential. Here, we investigated the effect of four biopolymeric additives: chondroitin sulfate; collagen; phosvitin; and lysozyme. Among them, chondroitin sulfate is one of the glycosaminoglycans, which comprise the extracellular matrix of cartilage and bone and can provide a nucleation site (8Lindahl U. Hook M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 9Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 29Hunter G.K. Bader S.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1989; 138: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Phosvintin is one type of phosphoprotein, which is thought to play a primary role in the biomineralization of HAP on the collageneous matrix of bone and dentin (30Saito T. Arsenault A.L. Yamauchi M. Kuboki Y. Crenshaw M.A. Bone (NY). 1997; 21: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Kobayashi N. Onuma K. Oyane A. Yamazaki A. Key Eng. Mat. 2004; 254: 537-540Google Scholar). The roles of collagen in the nucleation of HAP during the bone formation process have also been clarified through the work of Glimcher (32, Glimcher, M. J.

Thus, the influence of these biomolecules on the nucleation kinetics was examined and the results are given by Fig. 5B and Table I.Table IThe effect of additives on the interfacial correlation parameter for HAP nucleationAdditivesκf(m1)κf(m2)σ1→2*× 104× 1014None10.4721.011.54NaCl2.894.130.60CHS8.3413.982.12Phosvitin3.278.343.17Lysozyme3.977.645.84Collagen3.955.303.81 Open table in a new tab As illustrated in Fig. 5, B and C, the main characteristics of HAP nucleation in such solutions are similar to those in solutions without additives and are also in good agreement with our nucleation model. However, because of the adsorption of additives on the surface of the substrate, the four curves corresponding to the nucleation of HAP crystals under the effect of these additives exhibit a decrease in the slopes as compared with the controlled sample (Table I). The slope of the corresponding straight line in curve 1 (1.05 × 105) is much higher than that in sets 2–5 (8.34 × 104, 3.27 × 104, 3.95 × 104, and 3.97 × 104, respectively) within regime I. In particular, for phosvitin, the slope of the line shows a decrease of 70%. This effect can also be clearly described by the factor f(m) in Fig. 5C. Because the factor f(m) plays an important role in the determination of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier (cf.Equation 11), these results confirm that the additives will lower the nucleation barrier of HAP by improving the structural match between the nucleating HAP and the substrate, especially at low supersaturations. Apart from this finding, the transition f(m1) → f(m2) occurs at σ* as the supersaturation increases. According to our model, such a transition corresponds to the supersaturation-driven structure mismatch and actually provides a very narrow parameter window for us to achieve perfect HAP alignment. A large σ * corresponds to a large regime I, implying that good HAP alignment will be achieved in a wider range of supersaturations. As shown in Table I, solutions with additives expand the range of regime I. This implies that these organic additives suppress the supersaturation-driven structure mismatch occurring in a HAP assembly in a wide range of supersaturations. This structural alignment transition effect has never been recognized before and, evidently, is extremely important in engineering biomaterials with self-assembled structures. In addition, the corresponding ln(ts) versus 1/[ln(1 + σ)]2 plots of curves 2–5 shift further upward than curve 1, meaning that the nucleation induction time in these systems is longer than in a system with the usual random foreign particles. From the viewpoint of kinetics, this nucleation induction time is mainly caused by the effect of additives on the transport of growth units to the surface of the crystalline clusters because of collision, adsorption, and desorp"

The TBPIP/HOP2 protein is a factor that ensures the proper pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In the present study, we found that the purified mouse TBPIP/HOP2 protein stimulated homologous pairing catalyzed by the meiotic DMC1 recombinase in vitro. In contrast, TBPIP/HOP2 did not stimulate homologous pairing by RAD51, which is another homologous pairing protein acting in both meiotic and mitotic recombination. The positive effect of TBPIP/HOP2 in the DMC1-mediated homologous pairing was only observed when TBPIP/HOP2 first binds to double-stranded DNA, not to single-stranded DNA, before the initiation of the homologous pairing reaction. Deletion analyses revealed that the C-terminal basic region of TBPIP/HOP2 is required for efficient DNA binding and is also essential for its homologous pairing stimulation activity. Therefore, these results suggest that TBPIP/HOP2 directly binds to DNA and functions as an activator for DMC1 during the homologous pairing step in meiosis.

During meiosis, two successive rounds of nuclear division, meiosis I and meiosis II, are promoted with a single round of DNA replication. As a result, diploid cells produce haploid gametes in eukaryotes. In the cell division at meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are aligned, and a high level of recombination occurs between homologous chromosomes but not between sister chromatids. This preferential recombination between homologous chromosomes, called homologous recombination, ensures their correct segregation at meiosis I through the formation of chiasmata, which physically connect homologous chromosomes.Homologous recombination is initiated by double strand break (DSB) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; m, mouse; h, human; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; m, mouse; h, human; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. formation by SPO11 at the initiation sites for recombination (1Keeney S.

Then a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail derived from a DSB site invades the homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to form a heteroduplex. This strand invasion step, called homologous pairing, is the key step in homologous recombination. In Escherichia coli, the RecA protein catalyzes the homologous pairing step (4Shibata T. DasGupta C.

The RAD51 gene is expressed in both mitotic and meiotic cells, but the DMC1 gene functions only in meiotic cells. Disruption of the Rad51 gene results in early embryonic lethality in mice (16Lim D.-S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 17Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y.

In chicken DT40 cells, the RAD51 gene disruption causes the accumulation of spontaneous chromosomal breaks and significantly reduces the recombination frequency between sister chromatids (18Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 19Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S.

In contrast, disruption of the Dmc1 gene does not cause lethality in mice, but the dmc1 knock-out mice are sterile with an arrest of gametogenesis in the first meiotic prophase (20Pittman D.L.

Therefore, DMC1 is a meiosis-specific homologous pairing protein that may be a central player in meiosis-specific events such as the homologous pairing between homologous chromosomes but not between sister chromatids.In addition to the DMC1 gene, genetic studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified the HOP2 gene, which is essential for proper homologous chromosome pairing and recombination during meiosis (22Leu J.-Y. Chua P.R. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The HOP2 homologues of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana, meu13 and AHP2, respectively, were also identified as meiosis-specific factors that facilitate the pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination (23Nabeshima K. Kakihara Y. Hiraoka Y. Nojima H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3871-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Schommer C. Beven A. Lawrenson T. Shaw P. Sablowski R. Plant J. 2003; 36: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The hop2 deletion mutant in S. cerevisiae fails to sporulate due to a uniform arrest at the pachytene stage of meiosis I with most of the chromosomes engaged in synapsis with nonhomologous partners (22Leu J.-Y. Chua P.R. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This meiotic cell cycle arrest by the hop2 mutation is bypassed by the dmc1 mutation, indicating that the meiotic arrest of hop2 is due to the action of the Dmc1 protein (25Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 915-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This genetic interaction between HOP2 and DMC1 suggests that the Hop2 protein functions in the strand invasion step, which is promoted by the Dmc1 protein, during meiosis. The mammalian HOP2 homologue, TBPIP, was first identified as a factor interacting with TBP-1, which binds to the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Tat protein (26Tanaka T. Nakamura T. Takagi H. Sato M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Ijichi H. Tanaka T. Nakamura T. Yagi H. Hakuba A. Sato M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The TBPIP/hop2 knock-out mice also display the meiotic cell cycle arrest due to the failure of DSB repair (28Petukhova G.V. Romanienko P.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrated that the mammalian TBPIP/HOP2 protein is an activator that specifically stimulates the homologous pairing catalyzed by DMC1. The homologous pairing stimulation by the TBPIP/HOP2 protein was only observed when TBPIP/HOP2 binds dsDNA, not ssDNA, before the initiation of homologous pairing by DMC1. Deletion analyses of TBPIP/HOP2 showed that the C-terminal basic region, required for efficient DNA binding, is essential for the homologous pairing stimulation activity of TBPIP/HOP2. This is the first biochemical evidence that TBPIP/HOP2 functions with the meiosis-specific homologous pairing protein DMC1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOverexpression and Purification of the Mouse and Human TBPIP/HOP2 Proteins—The mouse and human TBPIP/Hop2 genes (26Tanaka T. Nakamura T. Takagi H. Sato M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Ijichi H. Tanaka T. Nakamura T. Yagi H. Hakuba A. Sato M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were ligated with the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen) at the NdeI-BamHI sites. The proteins were overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) as N-terminal His6-tagged proteins. The cells were grown in 10 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C. At the logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.6), the TBPIP/HOP2 expression was induced with 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). Cells were harvested after an overnight incubation at 18 °C and were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science)) on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 27,700 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were gently mixed by the batch method with 4 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The Ni-NTA-agarose beads with the His6-tagged mouse TBPIP/HOP2 protein were packed into an Econo column (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 30 column volumes of buffer A containing 15 mm imidazole at a flow rate of about 0.3 ml/min. The beads with the His6-tagged human TBPIP/HOP2 protein were washed with buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. The His6-tagged mouse and human TBPIP/HOP2 proteins were eluted in a 15-column volume linear gradient from 15 mm (or 50 mm for the human TBPIP/HOP2 protein) to 400 mm imidazole in buffer A. The His6 tag was uncoupled from the mouse and human TBPIP/HOP2 proteins (mTBPIP/HOP2 and hTBPIP/HOP2, respectively) by digestions with 1 unit of thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences)/mg of mTBPIP/HOP2 and with 3 units of thrombin protease/mg of hTBPIP/HOP2. The mTBPIP/HOP2 and hTBPIP/HOP2 proteins were immediately dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m KCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.4 m KCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol), respectively, for more than 12 h at 4 °C. The proteins were loaded onto a 6-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column previously equilibrated with either buffer B (for mTBPIP/HOP2) or buffer C (for hTBPIP/HOP2). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer B or C, and the proteins were eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.2 m KCl in buffer B (mTBPIP/HOP2) or from 0.4 to 1.4 m KCl (hTBPIP/HOP2) in buffer C. The peak fractions of mTBPIP/HOP2 were dialyzed against buffer B, and those of hTBPIP/HOP2 were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m KCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Construction and Purification of the Mouse TBPIP/HOP2 Deletion Mutants—The mouse TBPIP/Hop2 deletion mutant genes were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and were ligated into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen). These deletion mutants are mTBPIP-(1–210), mTBPIP-(1–189), mTBPIP-(1–181), mTBPIP-(1–178), mTBPIP-(1–162), mTBPIP-(1–157), mTBPIP-(1–143), mTBPIP-(1–125), and mTBPIP-(1–105), which lack 7, 28, 36, 39, 55, 60, 74, 92, and 112 amino acids from the C-terminal end, respectively. The mTBPIP-(1–210), mTBPIP-(1–189), mTBPIP-(1–181), and mTBPIP-(1–178) mutants were purified by the same method as that used for mTBPIP/HOP2. The mTBPIP-(1–162), mTBPIP-(1–157), mTBPIP-(1–143), mTBPIP-(1–125), and mTBPIP-(1–105) mutants were dialyzed against buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) after the Ni-NTA column chromatography. The His6 tags were uncoupled by treatments with 3 units (for mTBPIP-(1–162) and mTBPIP-(1–157)) and 2 units (for mTBPIP-(1–178)) of thrombin protease/mg of protein. Then all the mTBPIP/HOP2 mutants were loaded onto a 6-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column previously equilibrated with buffer E. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer E, and the mutants were eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl in buffer E. The peak fractions of the mTBPIP/HOP2 deletion mutants were dialyzed against buffer B. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Overexpression and Purification of the Human DMC1 and RAD51 Proteins—The human RAD51 protein was purified as described previously (29Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35201-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The human DMC1 gene was inserted into the pET-15b plasmid (Novagen) at the NdeI-BamHI sites, and the protein was overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) as an N-terminally His6-tagged protein (30Kinebuchi T. Kagawa W. Enomoto R. Tanaka K. Miyagawa K. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 10 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C. When the A600 of the culture was between 0.4 and 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) was added to induce protein expression. Cells were harvested after an overnight incubation and were lysed by sonication in buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science)) on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 27,700 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were gently mixed by the batch method with 4 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein-bound beads were packed into an Econo column (Bio-Rad) and were washed with 30 column volumes of buffer F containing 5 mm imidazole. The DMC1 protein was eluted in a 20-column volume linear gradient from 5 to 300 mm imidazole in buffer F. The His6 tag was uncoupled from DMC1 by a digestion with 3 units of thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences)/mg of DMC1, and the protein was immediately dialyzed against buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) for more than 12 h at 4 °C. The protein was loaded onto a 4-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column previously equilibrated with buffer G. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer G, and the protein was eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient of 0.2 to 1.2 m KCl in buffer G. The peak fractions of DMC1 were dialyzed against buffer G. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard.DNA Substrates—In the D-loop formation assay, alkaline treatment of the cells harboring the plasmid DNA was avoided to prevent the dsDNA substrates from undergoing irreversible denaturation. Instead the cells were gently lysed using sarkosyl as described previously (29Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35201-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The pGsat4 DNA was created by inserting a 198-base pair fragment of the human α-satellite sequence into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega).For the ssDNA substrate used in the D-loop assay, the following high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotide was purchased from Roche Applied Science: SAT-1 (50-mer, 5′-ATT TCA TGC TAG ACA GAA GAA TTC TCA GTA ACT TCT TTG TGC TGT GTG TA-3′). The 5′ ends of the oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides.The DNA Binding Assay—The ϕX174 circular ssDNA (40 μm, 5386 bases) or the ϕX174 circular dsDNA (10 μm, 5386 bp) was mixed with TBPIP/HOP2 in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations were 2, 4, and 8 μm for the ssDNA binding experiments and 1, 2, and 4 μm for the dsDNA binding experiments. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and were resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA) buffer at 3.3 V/cm for 2 h. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining.The D-loop Formation Assay—The reactions were started by incubating 5 μm DMC1 or 5 μm RecA with 1 μm32P-labeled SAT-1 ssDNA at 37 °C for 5 min in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm ATP (or 1 mm AMP-PNP), 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 75 μg/ml creatine kinase. Then the supercoiled pGsat4 (3,218-bp) DNA (30 μm) and 5 μm TBPIP/HOP2 were added along with MgCl2 (10 mm). In this assay, a 4.3-fold excess amount of ssDNA (molecule) was used relative to the amount of dsDNA (molecule). After incubations at 37 °C for the indicated times, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5% SDS and 700 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. The 6-fold loading dye was added, and the products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris base, 64.6 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 3.3 V/cm for 2 h and were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel.RESULTSPurification of the Mouse and Human TBPIP/HOP2 Proteins—To study the function of TBPIP/HOP2, we overexpressed mTBPIP/HOP2 in the E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus (Stratagene) strain as a fusion protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (His6 tag) containing a cleavage site for thrombin protease. The His6-tagged mTBPIP/HOP2 protein was expressed by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and was purified by chromatography on a Ni2+-chelating column (Qiagen). The His6 tag was uncoupled with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) from the mTBPIP/HOP2 portion, and mTBPIP/HOP2 was further purified by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 1A).The human TBPIP/HOP2 protein, which shares about 90% amino acid sequence identity with mTBPIP/HOP2, was also overexpressed and was purified by a similar method as that used for mTBPIP/HOP2. The purified human TBPIP/HOP2 preparation contained about 10% of a lead-through product as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Furthermore degradation products (about 10%) were detected in the fraction containing the purified human TBPIP/HOP2 protein (data not shown), suggesting that the human TBPIP/HOP2 protein is less stable than mTBPIP/HOP2. Therefore, we used mTBPIP/HOP2 in the subsequent biochemical analyses.The DNA Binding and Homologous Pairing Activities of the TBPIP/HOP2 Protein—The purified mTBPIP/HOP2 protein was tested for its ssDNA and dsDNA binding abilities. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, mTBPIP/HOP2 bound to both ssDNA and dsDNA. These DNA binding characteristics are similar to those of the homologous pairing proteins such as RAD51, RAD52, and DMC1. Then we tested the homologous pairing activity of mTBPIP/HOP2. To do so, we used the D-loop formation assay, which was used to detect the homologous pairing activity of the human and yeast DMC1 proteins (13Li Z. Golub E.I. Gupta R. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Hong E.L. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this assay, a single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide and superhelical dsDNA were used as substrates, and the D-loop was formed as a product of the homologous pairing reaction (Fig. 2A). As reported previously (13Li Z. Golub E.I. Gupta R. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11221-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the homologous pairing activity of the human DMC1 protein was detected in the D-loop formation assay (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 1). On the other hand, the same amount of mTBPIP/HOP2 (5 μm) itself formed a trace amount of D-loop, which was only detected when the gel was overexposed (Fig. 2, B and C). Therefore, mTBPIP/HOP2 shows very little homologous pairing activity in the D-loop formation assay as compared with DMC1.Fig. 2Homologous pairing activity of mTBPIP/HOP2.A, a schematic diagram of the D-loop formation assay. Asterisks indicate the 32P-labeled end of the ssDNA. B, time course experiments. A 32P-labeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (1 μm) was incubated with mTBPIP/HOP2 (5 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of pGsat4 form I DNA (30 μm) and 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were conducted with a 4.3-fold excess amount of ssDNA (molecule) relative to the dsDNA. The reactions were continued for 0 min (lane 3), 5 min (lanes 1, 2, and 4), 10 min (lane 5), 20 min (lane 6), 30 min (lane 7), and 60 min (lane 8).

We used the human DMC1 protein, which shares 97% amino acid identity with the mouse DMC1 protein. When mTBPIP/HOP2 (5 μm) was incubated with superhelical dsDNA before mixing with DMC1 (5 μm) and ssDNA for the initiation of the homologous pairing reaction, the D-loop yield was significantly increased (Fig. 3A, lane 2) as compared with the reaction without mTBPIP/HOP2 (lane 3). The D-loop formation promoted by DMC1 was inhibited in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3B, lanes 9–14) because DMC1 catalyzes D-loop formation in an ATP-dependent manner (13Li Z. Golub E.I. Gupta R.

As shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 3–8), the D-loop formation promoted by DMC1 and mTBPIP/HOP2 was also inhibited in the presence of ADP. On the other hand, the mTBPIP/HOP2 protein contains neither the ATP-binding motif nor the ATPase activity (data not shown). These results further confirmed that DMC1 is the catalytic center for homologous pairing in the presence of DMC1 and mTBPIP/HOP2.Fig. 3Stimulation of the DMC1-mediated homologous pairing by mTBPIP/HOP2.A, a 32P-labeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (1 μm) was incubated with 5 μm mTBPIP/HOP2 (lane 1) or 5 μm DMC1 (lanes 2 and 3) at 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were initiated by the addition of pGsat4 form I DNA (30 μm) and 10 mm MgCl2 with or without mTBPIP/HOP2 (5 μm). Reaction orders are indicated on the top of A. Reactions were conducted for 5 min after initiation. When mTBPIP/HOP2 was first incubated with ssDNA, DMC1 was added to the reaction mixture 5 min before reaction initiation by the addition of dsDNA (lane 1). Lane 3 indicates a control experiment with DMC1 alone, and lane 4 indicates the negative control experiment without protein. B, inhibition of D-loop formation by ADP. A 32P-labeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (1 μm) was incubated with DMC1 (5 μm) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and the indicated amounts of ADP, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of pGsat4 form I DNA (30 μm) with or without mTBPIP/HOP2 (5 μm). The amounts of ADP added were 1 mm (lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13) and 4 mm (lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14). The reactions were continued for 0 min (lanes 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11) and 10 min (lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14). Lane 1 indicates a negative control experiment without protein, and lane 2 indicates a control experiment with DMC1 alone. C, the D-loop assay with RAD51 and mTBPIP/HOP2. The reactions were conducted in the same manner as those in A except that the human RAD51 protein was used instead of DMC1. Reaction orders are indicated on the top of C. When mTBPIP/HOP2 was first incubated with ssDNA, RAD51 was added to the reaction mixture 5 min before reaction initiation by the addition of dsDNA (lane 1). Lane 3 indicates the negative control experiment without protein, and lanes 4 and 5 indicate control experiments with RAD51 alone and DMC1 alone, respectively. D, the D-loop assay with RecA and mTBPIP/HOP2. A 32P-labeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (1 μm) was incubated with 5 μm RecA (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) in the presence of 1 mm ATP (lanes 2, 3, and 4) or 1 mm AMP-PNP (lanes 6, 7, and 8) at 37 °C for 5 min. Lanes 1 and 5 indicate the negative control experiments without protein in the presence of ATP and AMP-PNP, respectively. The reactions were initiated by the addition of pGsat4 form I DNA (30 μm) and 10 mm MgCl2 with mTBPIP/HOP2 (5 μm) (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Reactions were conducted for 3 min after initiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When mTBPIP/HOP2 was mixed with ssDNA before the addition of DMC1, the D-loop formation by DMC1 was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Therefore, mTBPIP/HOP2 only enhanced the DMC1-mediated homologous pairing reaction when it was bound to dsDNA, not ssDNA, before the initiation of the homologous pairing reaction.Intriguingly mTBPIP/HOP2 did not enhance homologous pairing by the human RAD51 protein, another eukaryotic RecA homologue. Although the homologous pairing activity of the human RAD51 protein alone is too weak to be detected by the D-loop formation assay (31Mazin A.V. Zaitseva E. Sung P. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), mTPBIP/HOP2 did not enhance the RAD51-mediated D-loop formation to a detectable level (Fig. 3C). In addition, mTPBIP/HOP2 significantly inhibited the RecA-mediated D-loop formation when it was incubated with superhelical dsDNA before mixing with RecA (5 μm) and ssDNA (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that mTBPIP/HOP2 does not enhance either RAD51- or RecA-dependent homologous pairing. Instead it may specifically function in the DMC1-dependent homologous pairing, which is probably essential for recombination between homologous chromosomes in meiosis.The mTBPIP/HOP2 Protein Does Not Inhib"
https://openalex.org/W2081857384,"The leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin has an important role in the initial steps of leukocyte extravasation during inflammation and lymphocyte homing. Its cytoplasmic domain is involved in signal transduction after L-selectin cross-linking and in the regulation of receptor binding activity in response to intracellular signals. However, the signaling events occurring at the level of the receptor are largely unknown. This study therefore addressed the question of whether protein kinases associate with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor and mediate its phosphorylation. Using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the L-selectin cytoplasmic domain, we isolated a kinase activity from cellular extracts of the human leukemic Jurkat T-cell line that phosphorylated L-selectin on serine residues. This kinase showed characteristics of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Moreover, the Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes θ and ι were found associated with the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin. Pseudosubstrate inhibitors of these isozymes abolished phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain, demonstrating that these kinases are responsible for the phosphorylation. Analysis of proteins specifically bound to the phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin revealed that PKCα and -θ are strongly associated with the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin. Binding of these isozymes to L-selectin was also found in intact cells after phorbol ester treatment inducing serine phosphorylation of the receptor. Furthermore, stimulation of Jurkat T-cells by CD3 cross-linking induced association of PKCα and -θ with L-selectin, indicating a role of these kinases in the regulation of L-selectin through the T-cell receptor complex.

Leukocytes travel with the blood and lymph circulation throughout the body but have to leave the vessels to exert their immunological functions. Granulocytes migrate toward inflammatory sites in tissues (1Ley K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), whereas lymphocytes home to secondary lymphoid tissues, where they become activated (2Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). These extravasation events are mediated by the orchestrated interaction of several adhesion molecule families that constitute an adhesion cascade, leading to recruitment of leukocytes to the vessel wall and migration through the endothelial cell layer (3Dunon D. Piali L. Imhof B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). L-selectin, a member of the carbohydrate binding selectin family of adhesion molecules, has an essential role in the initial steps of this adhesion cascade, the capture of leukocytes from the flowing blood (“tethering”), and the subsequent rolling along the vascular endothelium (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). L-selectin is a type I transmembrane protein with a lectin domain responsible for ligand binding, an epidermal growth factor domain, two short consensus repeats, a membrane-spanning region, and a short 17-amino acid cytoplasmic domain without any conserved signaling motifs or interaction sequences (6Kansas G.S. APMIS. 1992; 100: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is essential for L-selectin function because deletion mutants lacking the C-terminal 11 amino acid residues cannot support leukocyte rolling and binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules, although recognition of soluble ligand is not impaired (7Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This defect has been attributed to a missing connection of the truncated L-selectin with the actin cytoskeleton, which might be mediated by the cytoskeletal linker α-actinin in intact L-selectin (8Pavalko F.M. Walker D.M. Graham L. Goheen M. Doerschuk C.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and normally is induced by receptor ligation (9Evans S.S. Schleider D.M. Bowman L.A. Francis M.L. Kansas G.S. Black J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3615-3624PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its adhesive function, L-selectin also mediates signaling in leukocytes. Ligation of L-selectin with antibody or ligand elicits of a number of cellular events, including elevated Ca2+ and phosphotyrosine protein levels (10Laudanna C. Constantin G. Baron P. Scarpini E.

Linderkamp O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, L-selectin triggers the enhanced binding activity of both β1 and β2 integrins (16Giblin P.A. Hwang S.T. Katsumoto T.R. Rosen S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3498-3507PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hwang S.T. Singer M.S. Giblin P.A. Yednock T.A. Bacon K.B. Simon S.I. Rosen S.D. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 1502-1514PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from transducing signals received from the outside of the cell, L-selectin itself is subject to regulation by cellular signals. Treatment of leukocytes with lineage-specific stimuli (cross-linking of CD2 or CD3 for lymphocytes, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or tumor necrosis factor α for neutrophils) leads to an increased binding of L-selectin to soluble ligand and of lymphocytes to high endothelial venule frozen sections (20Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This enhancement of binding activity is assumed to be a result of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor on serine residues, which occurs constitutively at low levels and is significantly increased by stimulation with phorbol ester or chemokines through co-transfected G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors (21Haribabu B.

Although it is well established that signaling from and toward L-selectin occurs, the events at the level of the receptor are poorly understood. This study, therefore, aimed at the identification of cytosolic interaction partners (especially kinases) for L-selectin that are involved in receptor signaling. Here we report that in T-cell lysates two PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LScyto, L-selectin cytoplasmic domain; TCR, T-cell receptor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; mAb, monoclonal antibody. isozymes, novel PKCθ and atypical PKCι, phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin on serine residues. Serine-phosphorylation of L-selectin increased association with PKCθ and induced binding of the conventional PKCα to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin in cell lysates and intact cells after activation with PMA. Moreover, lymphocyte activation through CD3 of the T-cell receptor complex induced binding of these PKC isozymes to L-selectin. These findings indicate a central role for PKC isozymes in the signal transduction events at the cytoplasmic domain of the L-selectin adhesion receptor. Reagents—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Merck unless stated otherwise. Purified histone H1 was from Calbiochem, myelin basic protein was from Invitrogen. Protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and genistein were purchased from Alexis (Gruenberg, Germany), bisindolylmaleimide was from Calbiochem, and PKCθ and -ι pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitors were obtained from Biosource (Nivelles, Belgium). Hybridoma cell lines producing the mAbs Dreg200 and Dreg55 were kind gifts from Dr. E. C. Butcher, Stanford University. Expression and purification of mAb were described before (22Fieger C.B. Emig-Vollmer S. Petri T. Grafe M. Gohlke M. Debus N. Semmler W. Tauber R. Volz B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1524: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Isotype-specific PKC antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences/Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). Cloning of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Constructs—The sequence encoding the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin was amplified by PCR using the full-length L-selectin cDNA in pCR3.1 (22Fieger C.B. Emig-Vollmer S. Petri T. Grafe M. Gohlke M. Debus N. Semmler W. Tauber R. Volz B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1524: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as a template. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were introduced by the PCR primers, and the fragment was subcloned in pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). A vector-encoded serine residue in the multiple cloning site, which could serve as a possible target for serine kinases with basic recognition sites, was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Inactivating mutations of putative phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain were introduced by use of altered PCR primers. The resulting fragments were subcloned into pGEX4T1 as described for the wild type sequence. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli strain BL-21 Codon Plus-RIL (Stratagene) transformed with pGEX4T1 or the fusion protein expression constructs were induced at mid-logarithmic growth phase with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 and disrupted by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and supernatants were applied to a GSH-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing with buffer A, fusion protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Purity of isolated proteins was judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and concentration of purified protein was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Cell Culture—The human leukemic Jurkat T-cell line was maintained in RPMI1640 (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 1× MEM nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 25 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Isolation of Cellular Proteins Interacting with GST Fusion Protein (“Pull Down”)—Jurkat T-cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij 58, 1× Complete® protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 100 μg/ml RNase A on ice for 15 min, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Cell lysates were incubated with 10 μl of GSH-Sepharose coated with GST or GST fusion protein. After 2 h beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 4 times with lysis buffer, and used in in vitro kinase assays, or bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Kinase Assay—To test for protein kinases in protein complexes bound to GST fusion proteins, isolated complexes were washed 3 more times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2) and incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 450 μl of phosphorylation stop buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA), and beads were washed 4 times with phosphorylation stop buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For inhibitor studies protein complexes were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of inhibitor for 15 min before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. After the final washing step, protein complexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue, and dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. In experiments where additional substrates were used in the phosphorylation reaction, SDS sample buffer was added without further washing steps. In Vitro Kinase Assays with Purified Kinases—Purified protein kinases were incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer (protein kinase A (Promega, Mannheim, Germany): 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol; PKC (Roche Applied Science): 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 20 μg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol; PKG (Promega): 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2 μm cGMP) together with 1 μg of substrate protein and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C. Phosphorylation was terminated after 30 min by the addition of 450 μl of phosphorylation stop buffer, and 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose was added for recovery of the GST fusion protein substrates. After 1 h at 4 °C, bound proteins were washed 4 times with phosphorylation stop buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed as described above. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment with 50 ng/ml PMA, 3 μg/ml anti CD3 (UCHT1), or isotype-matched control antibody (both from BD Biosciences/Pharmingen) for 3 min at 37 °C, Jurkat T-cells were lysed as described above with the exception that the lysis buffer contained 1% Nonidet P-40 as detergent. Cleared lysates were incubated for 2 h with anti-L-selectin mAb (a mixture of Dreg200 and Dreg55) coupled to sheep-anti-mouse-Ig-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection with isozyme-specific PKC mAb (BD Biosciences/Transduction Laboratories). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Proteins—For identification of PKCα, bands were excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and in-gel digested with trypsin. The resulting peptide mixture was desalted using ZipTips (Millipore Corp) and analyzed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were acquired on a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The peptide sequence tag method (23Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) and de novo sequencing were used to identify the protein. PKCθ tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE STR (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The peptide mass fingerprints obtained were analyzed searching the NCBI non-redundant protein and Swiss-Prot databases with the ProFound and Mascot software. Expression of the Cytoplasmic Domain of L-selectin as a GST Fusion Protein in E. coli—For isolation and characterization of L-selectin kinases, we generated a fusion construct (GST-LScyto) of the cytoplasmic domain of human L-selectin (Fig. 1A) with GST. Inactivating mutations of putative phosphorylation sites were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1B). The GST-LScyto fusion proteins as well as GST alone were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by glutathione (GSH) affinity chromatography from bacterial lysates. Purity of the eluted proteins was judged by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1C). The L-selectin Cytoplasmic Domain Associates with a Serine/Threonine Kinase Activity from Jurkat Cell Lysates—To isolate cellular kinases that are able to associate with and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin, GSH-Sepharose-coupled fusion protein GST-Lscyto was incubated with Jurkat T-cell lysates to allow binding of interacting proteins. The extensively washed protein complexes were then subjected to in vitro kinase assays to test for associated kinases. This assay revealed the presence of a kinase activity in the GST-LScyto-precipitated complexes that phosphorylated the fusion protein (Fig. 2A, right lane). The GST part alone showed no incorporation of radioactivity (Fig. 2A, left lane). A 60-kDa band of unknown origin was observed with GST as well as with GST-LScyto. Thus, to exclude that the kinase that phosphorylates GST-LScyto is actually bound to the GST portion of the fusion protein, we added GST-LScyto to GST isolates as an additional substrate during kinase assays. No phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin was observed in this experiment (Fig. 2B, right lane). Vice versa, the addition of GST to GST-LScyto precipitates did result in phosphorylation of GST-LScyto but not GST, showing that phosphorylation of the fusion protein does not occur on residues present in the GST part of the protein (Fig. 2B, left lane). Therefore, both binding of and phosphorylation by the associated kinase activity takes place at the L-selectin portion of the fusion protein. Because the intracellular L-selectin sequence contains both serine and tyrosine residues which could serve as phosphoryl acceptor sites, we next aimed to characterize the specificity of the associated kinase activity. This kinase was able to strongly phosphorylate the classical serine/threonine kinase substrates histone H1 and myelin basic protein (MBP) (Fig. 3A). These findings were supported by the ability of the broad range serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine to abolish LScyto phosphorylation completely (Fig. 3B), whereas genistein, which blocks tyrosine kinases, had no effect on the activity of the L-selectin kinase. Furthermore, replacement of both serines in the cytoplasmic sequence resulted in a complete loss of LScyto phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), whereas the kinase phosphorylated the fusion protein that carried an inactivated tyrosine to an extent comparable with the wild type protein. This demonstrated that the LScyto phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues. Single serine-to-alanine replacements of the two potential phosphorylation sites revealed a preference of the kinase for serine 364 over serine 367, since inactivation of serine 364 resulted in a much stronger decrease in LScyto phosphorylation. Taken together, these results show that the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin associates with, and is phosphorylated by, a serine kinase activity from T-cell lysates. L-selectin Is an in Vitro Substrate for PKC and cGMP-dependent Protein Kinase —The serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin that are putative phosphoryl acceptor sites are surrounded by a high density of positively charged residues (Fig. 1A). To examine serine/threonine kinases that target basic sequences for the ability to use L-selectin as a substrate, in vitro phosphorylation assays with purified kinases were performed. Whereas protein kinase A showed very little phosphorylation activity toward GST-LScyto (data not shown), both PKC- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase strongly phosphorylated the fusion protein (Fig. 4). Further tests using protein variants carrying inactivating mutations of serine residues in the L-selectin sequence revealed that the two kinases can utilize both serines as substrates, although with different preferences. Whereas cGMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation was strongly impaired by the lack of serine 367 (Fig. 4A), phosphorylation by PKC, as observed for the cellular LScyto kinase, was more strongly affected by inactivation of serine 364 (Fig. 4B). The LScyto Kinase Is Stimulated by PKC Activators and Blocked by PKC Inhibitors—Because purified PKC and the LScyto-associating kinase activity from T-cell lysates displayed a similar phosphorylation pattern of the fusion protein, the effects of PKC-activating and -blocking substances on the phosphorylation of LScyto were further investigated. When cells were treated before lysis with the phorbol ester PMA, which can activate classical and novel PKC isozymes directly, the cellular GST-LScyto kinase activity was strongly stimulated (Fig. 5A). The PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I effectively blocked the phosphorylation of LScyto in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrations that are considered specific for this kinase (Fig. 5B). These results strongly indicated that members of the PKC family of kinases are responsible for the observed phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin. The L-selectin Cytoplasmic Domain Associates with PKC in an Isozyme-specific Manner—Because our results pointed toward an involvement of PKC in the phosphorylation of L-selectin, we next examined whether PKC isozymes associate with the L-selectin cytoplasmic domain. To do so, GST-LScyto was incubated with Jurkat T-cell extracts, and bound protein complexes were tested for the presence of PKC by Western blotting using isozyme-specific monoclonal antibodies. Of the isozymes expressed in Jurkat cells, exclusively novel PKCθ and atypical PKCι were detected in GST-LScyto pull down samples but not in GST controls. (Fig. 6, A and B). No association of the PKC isozymes α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, η, or ζ with GST-LScyto was found in this assays (data not shown). To test whether the two PKC isozymes associated with the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin are responsible for the observed phosphorylation of this protein on serine residues, peptides that correspond to the intrinsic pseudosubstrate sequence (24House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) of the kinases were employed in inhibition assays. These sequences differ between members of the PKC family and allow isozyme-specific inhibition, which is difficult to achieve with chemical PKC inhibitors (25Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. House C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). LScyto pull down precipitates were incubated with PKCθ or -ι pseudosubstrate peptides before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Treatment with each one of the two pseudosubstrate inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of the fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C), indicating that both PKC isozymes are involved in L-selectin phosphorylation. Indeed, the extent of inhibition was increased when both pseudosubstrates were used simultaneously. These results clearly show that although various PKC isozymes could phosphorylate LScyto to a similar extent in vitro (data not shown), PKCθ and -ι shown to be associated with the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin by immunoblotting (Fig. 6, A and B) indeed represent the cellular kinase activity that phosphorylates L-selectin (Fig. 2). Identification of Phosphorylation-specific Interacting Proteins—Because phosphorylation of proteins involved in signal transduction frequently modulates their interaction capabilities with other signaling molecules, we examined whether the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin associates with cytoplasmic proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For this purpose, LScyto was serine-phosphorylated by purified rat brain PKC, and interacting proteins were isolated from Jurkat T-cell lysates as described above. Analysis of bound protein complexes on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of two bands of ∼79 and 81 kDa that were only observed in association with phosphorylated LScyto but not with the unmodified cytoplasmic domain or GST controls (Fig. 7A). These protein bands were excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Both proteins were identified as PKC isozymes (Table I), p79 as novel PKCθ and p81 as conventional PKCα. The presence of both proteins in the pull down eluates was confirmed in Western blots using isozyme-specific PKC antibodies (Fig. 7B). Because PKCα was also present in the rat brain PKC preparation used for phosphorylation of the fusion protein (Fig. 7B, upper panel), it had to be excluded that the enzyme bound to GST-LScyto represents a contamination from the phosphorylation reaction. The initial indication that PKCα was derived from the cell lysate came from the observation that GST-LScyto, which had been phosphorylated by rat brain PKC but subsequently incubated with lysis buffer rather than Jurkat cell lysates, was not bound to detectable amounts of PKCα when analyzed in silver gels (Fig. 7A, fourth lane) or by more sensitive immunoblotting (Fig. 7B, upper panel, fifth lane). This was confirmed by the results of the tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the N-terminal peptide of the isolated protein. The sequence of this peptide corresponded to the sequence of the human rather than the rat isozyme, which differ in two residues. PKCα was solely associated with the phosphorylated LScyto fusion protein, and no binding was detectable with the non-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain.Table IMass spectrometric identification of proteins associating with the phosphorylated LScyto fusion proteinSequenceResiduesp81, PKCα (SwissProt:P17252)Ac-ADVFPGNDSTASQDVANR1-18NLIPMDPNGLSDPYVK181-196LSVEIWDWDR239-248p79, PKCθ (Swiss-Prot Q04759)Matched peptides, 17Sequence coverage, 22% Open table in a new tab The PKCθ isozyme bound to phosphorylated GST-LScyto also originated from the Jurkat cell lysate, since this kinase was not detectable in the rat brain PKC preparation used for phosphorylation of the fusion protein (Fig. 7B, lower panel). In this experiment the previously shown association of PKCθ with the non-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin was not detectable, since the amount of PKCθ that binds to the phosphorylated LScyto fusion protein (Fig. 7B) is significantly higher compared with the interaction with the non-phosphorylated protein shown in Fig. 6A. PKCθ bound to unphosphorylated LScyto was only detectable in highly concentrated eluates of the associating protein complexes but not visible in more diluted samples as used in Fig. 7. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin, thus, increases binding of PKCθ and induces association of PKCα. L-selectin Associates with PKC in Intact Cells—L-selectin has been reported to become phosphorylated on serine residues in various cell lines including Jurkat T-cells after stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA (21Haribabu B.

Using Gαq/Gα11 -deficient cells, it was shown that the PMT-induced pleiotropic effects are mediated by Gαq but not by the highly related Gα11 protein (Zywietz, A., Gohla, A., Schmelz, M., Schultz, G., and Offermanns, S.

Infection of Gαq -deficient cells with retrovirus-encoding Gαq caused reconstitution of PMT-induced activation of phospholipase Cβ, whereas Gα11 -encoding virus did not reconstitute PMT activity. Chimeras between Gαq and/or Gα11 revealed that a peptide region of Gαq, covering amino acid residues 105–113, is essential for the action of PMT to activate phospholipase Cβ. Exchange of glutamine 105 or asparagine 109 of Gα11, which are located in the all-helical domain of the Gα subunit, with the equally positioned histidines of Gαq, renders Gα11 capable of transmission PMT-induced phospholipase Cβ activation.

The Pasteurella multocida is a facultative pathogen, which cause bite wound infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, and septicemia in men. In pigs, the pathogen induces atrophic rhinitis, which is characterized by a loss of nasal turbinate bone (1Kamp E.M. Kimman T.G. Am. J. Vet.

PMT consists of 1285 amino acid residues. It is generally accepted that the toxin is structured according to a typical AB toxin. Initial studies revealed that the N terminus of PMT is involved in the binding and in translocation of the toxin into target cells (6Pullinger G.D. Sowdhamini R. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7839-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the biologically active domain is located in the C-terminal part of the protein (6Pullinger G.D. Sowdhamini R. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7839-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Busch C. Orth J. Djouder N. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3628-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This concept is in line with a significant sequence similarity of PMT at its N terminus with the N-terminal part of the cytotoxic necrotizing factor of Escherichia coli that is also involved in binding and translocation. According to the hypothesis that the C terminus of PMT carries the biological activity, an essential cysteine residue (Cys1165) was identified at the C terminus (8Ward P.N. Miles A.J. Sumner I.G. Thomas L.H. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The change of Cys1165 to serine blocked toxin activity but not cell binding. In addition, histidine residues (His1205 and His1223) in this part of the toxin were recognized to be essential for the activity of PMT (9Orth J. Blöcker D. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4971-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PMT activates numerous cellular signal transduction pathways. It is a strong mitogen and stimulates DNA synthesis and proliferation in several cell lines (10Rozengurt E. J. Cell.

The mitogenic actions of PMT appear to depend on the stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (15Seo B. Choy E.W. Maudsley W.E. Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

In addition, PMT activates the small GTPase RhoA, thereby inducing formation of stress fibers, focal adhesions, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin (12Dudet L.I. Chailler P. Dubreuil D. Martineau-Doize B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Jun kinase appears to be independent of Gq, indicating that PMT activates signaling pathways in a Gq-dependent and -independent manner (18Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). So far, however, the precise mode of molecular action of PMT is not known. Recently, it was shown by gene deletion of the α-subunits of Gq and G11 that PMT acts on PLCβ via Gαq but not via Gα11 (18Zywietz A. Gohla A. Schmelz M. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This is remarkable because Gαq and Gα11 are highly related and share 89% of their amino acid residues. We studied the molecular basis for this unique difference between Gαq and Gα11. Using G protein chimeras, we identified the helical domain of Gαq to be essential for mediating the activation of PLCβ by PMT. We obtained evidence that the region of helix αB of Gαq is involved in the PMT effect. Moreover, exchange of residues Gln105 and Asn109 in Gα11 to that of Gαq renders Gα11 sensitive toward PMT effects. These findings show that not only the Ras-like GTPase domain of Gαq but also the helical domain, which is inserted into the GTP-binding domain before switch 1, are functionally important and essential for mediating the activating effects of PMT. These findings give important new information on the site of action of PMT and suggest that the all-helical domain is important for signal transduction processes from Gαq to PLCβ. Materials—3H-Labeled inositol was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Dreieich, Germany). PCR primers were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) or from Qiagen Operon Europe (Cologne, Germany). The QuikChange kit was from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). Inositol-free minimal essential medium was purchased from Cell Concepts (Umkirch, Germany). Plasmids and Retroviral Vector Construction—The plasmids containing the constructs of Gαq and Gα11 were a kind gift of Dr. B. Nürnberg (University of Düsseldorf, Germany). The plasmids pMD-G and pMD-g/p (19Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by R. Mulligan (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The plasmid pLNCX2 was purchased from Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany). The retroviral transfer vectors Gαq-pLNCX2 and Gα11-pLNCX2 were generated using standard cloning techniques. The plasmids encoding for chimeric Gαq/Gα11 constructs (Gαq-Gα11121–359, Gα11-Gαq121–359, Gαq-Gα1167–120, and Gα11-Gαq67–120) were generated by splicing by overlap extension. From the two complementary primers used for each chimera, only one is listed: Gαq-Gα11121–359, 5′-AGG TTG ATG TGG AGA AGG TCA CAA CTT TTG AGC A-3′; Gα11-Gαq121–359, 5′-AGG TCG ATG TGG AGA AGG TGT CTG CTT TTG AGA A-3′; Gαq-Gα1167–120, 5′-ATC CAC GGG TCG GGC TAC TCG GAG GAG GAC-3′; Gα11-Gαq67–120, 5′-ATC CAC GGG GCC GGC TAC TCT GAC GAA GAC-3′. The chimeric Gαq/Gα11 constructs Gαq-Gα11105–113 and Gα11-Gαq105–113 were generated by sequential mutation of differing amino acids within this region by site-directed mutagenesis. For primers see “Constructions of Mutant Gαq and Gα11.” Cell Culture, Virus Production, and Transduction—Mouse fibroblasts derived from Gαq/Gα11 knock-out mice were cultured as described previously (20Offermanns S. Zhao L.-P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The retroviral vector was produced as described previously (21Nickel C. Benzing T. Sellin L. Gerke P. Karihaloo A. Liu Z.-X. Cantley L.G. Walz G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pMD-G, pMD-g/p, and the retroviral transfer vector. The calcium phosphate method was used. The supernatant was collected after 4 days and centrifuged to spin down cellular debris. The virus-containing medium was filtered and ultracentrifuged to concentrate the retrovirus. Cells were infected in the presence of Polybrene. The expression was monitored by Western blot analysis. Constructions of Mutant Gαq and Gα11—Mutated proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using pLNCX2 constructs as template and the respective oligonucleotides using the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide changes responsible for mutation are underlined. From the two complementary primers used for each mutation, only one is listed: GαqH105Q, 5′-TAC AAG TAT GAA CAA AAT AAG GCT AAT-3′; GαqH109N, 5′-CAC AAT AAG GCT AAT GCA CAA TTG GTT-3′; Gα11Q105H, 5′-TAC AAG TAT GAG CAT AAC AAG GCC-3′; Gα11N109H, 5′-CAG AAC AAG GCC CAT GCA CTC CTG ATC-3′; GαqH109/Q111L/V113I, 5′-AAG GCT AAT GCA CTC TTG ATC CGA GAG GTT GAT-3′; Gα11Q105H/N109H/L111Q/I113V, 5′-GAG CAC AAC AAG GCC CAT GCA CAA CTG GTT CGG GAG-3′. The plasmids were transformed in E. coli XL1 cells. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing with the ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Überlingen, Germany). Analysis of Total Inositol Phosphate—Infected Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells were grown in 24-well plates for 3 days and labeled with 2 μCi/ml [2-3H]inositol in inositol- and serum-free medium (minimal essential medium) for 12 h. Subsequently, PMT and LiCl (20 mm) were added, and the cells were incubated for the indicated times. For cell lysis and extraction of inositol phosphate, the medium was replaced with 750 μl of ice-cold formic acid (10 mm, pH 3). After 30-min incubation on ice, the extract was neutralized with 3 ml of NH3 (5 mm, pH 8.5). Analysis of total inositol phosphate was done by anion exchange chromatography using AG1-X8 resin (200–400 mesh; Bio-Rad, München, Germany) as described previously (7Busch C. Orth J. Djouder N. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3628-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of PMT Protein—Recombinant PMT protein was expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). In brief, glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was isolated by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose, followed by proteolytic cleavage using 3.25 units of thrombin/mg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Thrombin was removed by incubation with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Wild-type, Gαq/Gα11-deficient, or retrovirus-infected cells were extracted at 4 °C with RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, COMPLETE™ protease inhibitors, Roche Applied Science) and analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by chemiluminescence detection using goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Biotrend Chemikalien, Cologne, Germany) coupled to horseradish peroxidase and were visualized using ECL reagent. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Gαq/11 (C-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Fig. 1 shows the effects of PMT on wild-type and Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells. Whereas PMT causes a strong activation of inositol phosphate accumulation in wild-type cells, the toxin had no effect in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells. The Western blot analysis revealed that wild-type cells expressed Gαq and Gα11, whereas in the Gαq and Gα11 gene-deficient cells, no expression of the α-subunits of Gq and G11 were detected. Next, we studied whether the PMT response could be reconstituted in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells by introduction and expression of the cDNA of the G proteins into the cells. For this purpose, we used a retroviral system, harboring the cDNA of Gαq or Gα11. As shown in Fig. 2, infection with Gαq but not with Gα11 caused reconstitution of the PMT effect. This confirms recent results showing that Gαq but not Gα11 is able to mediate PMT-induced activation of PLCβ.Fig. 2Retroviral infection of Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells with Gαq-encoding virus recovers PMT-induced inositol phosphate production. Gαq- or Gα11-encoding retrovirus was produced, and Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells were transduced with the resulting retrovirus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, transduced with Gαq (filledrhombus)- or Gα11 (open rhombus)-encoding retrovirus were incubated for 6 h at the indicated concentrations of PMT. The total amount of inositol phosphate was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are given as fold stimulation over buffer control. B, expression of Gαq or Gα11 in retroviral transduced Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells was examined by Western blot. Shown is an immunoblot of RIPA extracts of Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells. The immunoblot was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for this unique specificity of PMT, we decided to construct Gαq/Gα11 chimeras. Gαq and Gα11 are about 89% identical in their amino acid sequences. At first, we constructed a chimera consisting of the N-terminal part of residues 1–120 of Gαq and 121–359 of Gα11 (Gαq-Gα11121–359). Conversely, we constructed the chimera Gα11-Gαq121–359 (Fig. 3). These constructs were introduced into the retrovirus, and the Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells were infected with the retrovirus. As shown in Fig. 4, only the construct with the N-terminal part of Gqe.g. Gαq-Gα11121–359caused activation of PLCβ after PMT addition to infected cells.Fig. 4The N-terminal 120 amino acids of Gαq are essential for PMT induced activation of Gαq-PLCβ pathway. Gαq-Gα11121–359- or Gα11 -Gαq121–359-encoding retrovirus was produced, and Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells transduced with the resulting retrovirus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, transduced with Gαq-Gα11121–359 (filled rhombus) or Gα11-Gαq121–359 (open rhombus)-encoding retrovirus were incubated for 6 h at the indicated concentrations of PMT. The total amount of inositol phosphate was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are given as fold stimulation over buffer control. B, expression of Gαq-Gα11121–359 or Gα11-Gαq121–359 in retroviral transduced Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells was examined by Western blot. Shown is an immunoblot of RIPA extracts of Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells. The immunoblot was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we further confined the region responsible for PMT sensitivity of Gαq and constructed the chimera Gα11-Gαq67–120 (Fig. 3). As a control, we constructed the inverse chimera Gαq-Gα1167–120. Western blot analysis showed that these proteins were expressed in infected cells (Fig. 5). When cells, which expressed these chimeric G proteins, were treated with PMT, an increase in inositol phosphate accumulation was observed with Gα11-Gαq67–120but not with the other constructs. This finding indicated that the structural requirements for mediation of PMT activity are located within a peptide of Gαq that covers residues 67–120. This region harbors the helix αA and αB of the all-helical domain, and only a few residues are different between Gαq and Gα11 (Fig. 6A). To identify the region essential for PMT-mediated PLCβ activation, we exchanged helix αB of Gαq and Gα11 by sequential site-directed mutagenesis. Thereby, we generated chimeric Gαq protein, harboring helix αB from Gα11 (Gαq-Gα11105–113), and Gα11 protein, harboring helix αB from Gαq (Gα11-Gαq105–113) (Fig. 3). Both constructs were tested for the ability to mediate PMT-induced activation of PLCβ. As Fig. 6B shows PMT-stimulated PLCβ only via Gα11-Gαq105–113.Fig. 6Introduction of helix αB of Gαq into Gα11 is sufficient to mediate PMT-induced activation of the resulting Gαq/Gα11 chimera.A, an alignment of Gαq and Gα11 harboring N-terminal αA and αB helices of the helical domain is shown. The regions with predicted helical structures are indicated, and amino acids, which are different in Gαq and Gα11, are highlighted. In the region of helix αB four amino acids differ. These amino acids were sequentially exchanged in Gαq and Gα11 by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, retrovirus encoding for Gα11-Gαq105–113 (filled triangles) and Gαq-Gα11105–113 (open triangles) were generated and used to transduce Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells. The ability to induce inositol phosphate formation by treatment with PMT was determined as before. C, expression of Gα11-Gαq105–113 or Gαq-Gα11105–113 in retroviral transduced Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells was examined by Western blot. Shown is an immunoblot of RIPA extracts of Gαq/Gα-deficient cells. The immunoblot was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we exchanged glutamine at position 105 and asparagine at position 109 in Gα11 with the equally positioned histidines in Gαq. The mutants Gα11Q105H and Gα11N109Hwere introduced into the retrovirus and the Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells infected with the virus. As shown in Fig. 7, PMT treatment of Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, which expressed Gα11Q105H or Gα11N109H, resulted in stimulation of inositol phosphate production and reconstituted the stimulation of PLCβ. Surprisingly, a converse mutant, e.g. GαqH105Q/H109Nq, did not lose the ability to activate PLCβ by PMT treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that the minimal requirement to recover PMT-mediated response via Gα11 is the introduction of a histidine residue at position 105 or 109. However, to render Gαq inactive, the additional exchange of helix αB to that of Gα11 is required. PMT has pleiotropic effects on target cells, including activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, RhoA activation, and activation of PLCβ. Although the molecular mechanism of PMT is not known, evidence has been obtained that Gαq activation is involved in the stimulation of PLCβ by PMT. Recently, it was shown that activation of PLCβ by PMT is mediated by Gαq but not by Gα11. This finding was surprising because both G proteins are closely related, and Gαq-coupled receptors were constantly found to activate also Gα11. Because both G proteins share a sequence identity of 89%, we were prompted to identify the region that is responsible for this unique specificity of PMT. For this purpose, we used Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells, which are unresponsive toward PMT in regard to PLCβ stimulation. Introduction of Gαq but not of Gα11 into these cells reconstituted the sensitivity of these cells for PLCβ activation by PMT. We constructed several chimeras and checked the expression of the chimeras by Western blotting. These studies showed that a small region, covering residues 105–113, defined the structural requirement of Gαq as compared with Gα11 to mediate the PLCβ stimulatory effects of PMT. Because Gαq and Gα11 are very similar in this region, we further equalized both sequences by changing amino acid residues in Gα11 to that of Gαq. Exchange of Gln105 or Asn109 in Gα11 to histidine rendered Gα11 capable of mediating PMT-induced activation of PLCβ. These findings are surprising because residues 105 and 109 of Gαq and of Gα11 are positioned in the helical domains of the G proteins. So far almost all functions of Gαq are related to the Ras-like GTPase domain of the G proteins. The functional role of the helical domain is still largely enigmatic. However, our findings indicate that this region, especially helix αB, is involved in the PMT effects. Moreover, the finding that exchange of one amino residue in the region largely effects the functional properties of the Gαq/11 proteins suggested that minor structural changes have major consequences in the function of G proteins. During recent years some findings suggested that the all-helical domain of other G proteins might have a role in signal transduction. For example, it was shown by crystal structure analysis that the GoLOCO motif (also called G protein regulatory motif), which is found in some GTPase-activating proteins of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family (e.g. RGS12 and RGS14), binds to the all-helical domain of G proteins (22Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Skiba N.P. Yang C.-S. Huang T. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8770-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also AGS proteins (activators of G protein signaling), which function as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, possess a GoLOCO domain (24Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). AGS3 protein binds to the GDP-bound forms of all Gi isoforms, to Gαt, and weakly to Gαq. Recently, Natochin et al. (25Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) identified residues 144–151 of Gαi, which are located in the helical domain, to be essential for interaction with AGS3. However, it appears that AGS3 has activity as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor only toward Gαi and Gαt. Thus, so far, no evidence has been presented that the helical domain of Gαq is somehow involved in signaling processes. Comparing the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins with the mode of activation of small GTPases and GTP-binding elongation factors, recently, Cherfils and Chabre (26Cherfils J. Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggested a novel model of G protein activation. The main point of the model is an increase in the interaction and contact area of Gβ/γ and Gα to stabilize a nucleotide-free complex. In contrast to the dissociation model of G protein activation, Cherfils and Chabre (26Cherfils J. Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) proposed that upon activation the N terminus of the Gγ-subunit interacts in a hook-like manner with the helical domain, especially with the αA or αB helices of Gα. Moreover, by fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based studies, it has been proposed recently that subunit rearrangement rather than dissociation is involved in Gi protein activation (27Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is fascinating to speculate that the same region, e.g. αA or αB helix of Gα, which is important for G protein activation, is involved in PMT-induced activation of Gq. The molecular mode of action of PMT is still not known. The high potency of the toxin suggests that an enzyme activity is involved as reported for many other bacterial protein toxins and bacterial effectors targeting eukaryotic cells (28Barbieri J.T. Riese M.J. Aktories K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Several bacterial effectors target G proteins, including pertussis toxin and cholera toxin, which ADP-ribosylate Gi, and Gs, respectively (29Cassel D. Pfeuffer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 30Ui M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1984; 5: 277-279Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Low molecular mass GTPases, especially of the Rho/Ras family, are modified by ADP-ribosylation, glucosylation, (e.g. Clostridium difficile toxins), and by deamidation (e.g. cytotoxic necrotizing factors from E. coli) (28Barbieri J.T. Riese M.J. Aktories K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, several bacterial effectors activate or inactivate small GTPases by mimicking the activity of eukaryotic guanine nucleotide exchange factors (e.g. SopE from Salmonella enterica) and GT-Pase-activating proteins (e.g. SptP from S. enterica) (28Barbieri J.T. Riese M.J. Aktories K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Fu Y. Galán J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 33Hardt W.-D. Chen L.-M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). So far no evidence is available that PMT belongs to one of these toxin families. Recently, it was shown that PMT induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαq (34Baldwin M.R. Pullinger G.D. Lax A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32719-32725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gq has been claimed to regulate the activity of the G protein (35Liu W.W. Mattingly R.R. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto-Osaki T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, PMT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gq, which occurs at the very C terminus, is also observed with the cysteine mutant that is defective in activation of PLCβ (34Baldwin M.R. Pullinger G.D. Lax A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32719-32725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we report that exchange of only one amino acid residue in Gα11 (e.g. Gln105 or Asn109) allows PMT-induced activation of PLCβ. Surprisingly, the reverse is not true; exchange of the equivalent residues in Gαq (e.g. His105 or His109) did not block its ability to mediate PMT-induced activation of PLCβ. One explanation of this finding is that the interaction of PMT (or that of a putative PMT-effector) with Gαq and the subsequent activation of the G protein is supported by several amino acid residues, some of which are located in the αB helix. Exchange of one of these residues did not prevent the PMT effect. However, only one of these crucial residues allows mediation of PMT activation of PLCβ in Gα11. Taken together, our data indicate that the α-helical region, especially the αB helix, is essential for the functional difference of Gαq and Gα11 to serve as a target of PMT. These data support the view that the helical domain of Gαq has important functions in G protein activation and signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2044481966,"An extensive set of analyses of the yeast PHO5 gene, mostly performed in vivo, has made this gene a model for the role of chromatin structure in gene regulation. In the repressed state, the PHO5 promoter shows a characteristic chromatin organization with four positioned nucleosomes and a short hypersensitive site. So far the basis for this nucleosome positioning has remained unresolved. We have therefore decided to complement the in vivo studies by an in vitro approach. As a first step, we have asked whether the characteristic PHO5 promoter chromatin structure depends on the cellular context including replication or higher order nuclear chromatin organization or whether it can be reconstituted in vitro in a cell-free system. To this end we have established an in vitro chromatin assembly system based on yeast extracts. It is capable of generating extensive regular nucleosomal arrays with physiological spacing. Assembly requires supplementation with exogenous histones and is dependent on energy leading to chromatin with dynamic properties due to ATP-dependent activities of the extract. Using the PHO5 promoter sequence as template in this replication independent system, we obtain a nucleosomal pattern over the PHO5 promoter region that is very similar to the in vivo pattern of the repressed state. This shows that the chromatin structure at the PHO5 promoter represents a self-organizing system in cell-free yeast extracts and provides a promising substrate for in vitro studies with a direct in vivo correlate.

Eukaryotic cells assemble their DNA with histone and non-histone proteins into a complex structure called chromatin. All nuclear, DNA-related processes therefore have to contend with chromatin as their primary substrate. Elucidating the structural and regulatory role of chromatin is now widely recognized as an important part of the research on transcription, replication, recombination, and repair (1Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 2001; 106: 523-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Our laboratory is interested in the role of chromatin in gene regulation. In this regard, the PHO system in yeast has become a model system and here we focus on the PHO5 gene. In the repressed state, the PHO5 promoter region is organized into four positioned nucleosomes with a short hypersensitive site between nucleosomes -2 and -3 (Fig. 2). These four nucleosomes become remodeled as a prerequisite for the induction of the PHO5 gene leading to an extended nuclease hypersensitive site (3Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Many aspects of this process have been elucidated by a series of in vivo studies. The chromatin transition is strictly dependent on the transactivator protein Pho4 but independent of replication and PHO5 transcription (4Svaren J. Hörz W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 as well as the nucleosome remodeling complex SWI/SNF were shown to have a kinetic effect on the promoter opening process, and the former could be linked to a transient hyperacetylation of the promoter histones (5Barbaric S. Walker J. Schmid A. Svejstrup J.Q. Hörz W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4944-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The fully induced promoter was shown to be devoid of histones (6Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 7Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), which provides an answer to the long standing question of the molecular makeup of a hypersensitive site (8Reinke H. Hörz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite the fruitful and ongoing in vivo approach, there remain issues, especially mechanistic questions, which will be difficult to answer solely by analyzing whole cells. Therefore we set out to extend our study of the PHO system by a complementary in vitro approach. At the beginning it was not for certain whether such an approach would be feasible. It is not predictable so far whether a certain chromatin domain with its typical nucleosome positioning represents an autonomous structure or whether its assembly depends on the nuclear context including higher order chromatin folding, nuclear matrix organization and replication. Especially the first two would make an in vitro reconstitution system rather unlikely to generate the proper chromatin structure. In order to address this point, we turned to in vitro chromatin assembly systems based on cellular extracts. In contrast to uncatalyzed systems like salt gradient dialysis or histone chaperone-mediated assembly, the cellular extracts contain enzymatic activities e.g. ATP-dependent remodeling machines, which might be vital for generating in vivo like nucleosome positioning. Several systems are currently available based on extracts from Xenopus eggs, Drosophila embryos, or mammalian cells (9Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Morris N.R. Cell. 1977; 10: 237-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Kamakaka R.T.

Biol. 1990; 10: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Gruss C. Gutierrez C. Burhans W.C. DePamphilis M.L. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the study of the yeast PHO system a homologous chromatin assembly using yeast extracts seemed desirable. However, at the time when we launched into this project the only yeast extract system described (14Schultz M.C. Methods. 1999; 17: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Schultz M.C. Hockman D.J. Harkness T.A. Garinther W.I. Altheim B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9034-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) did not reliably produce extensive, regular nucleosomal arrays, which is a hallmark of physiologically relevant chromatin. We found that this limitation can be overcome by the supplementation of yeast extracts with exogenous histones. Excitingly, besides supporting the regular spacing of arrays such a yeast extract based in vitro chromatin assembly system is able to generate the proper positioning of nucleosomes. Using the DNA sequence of the PHO5 locus as a template we demonstrate that a nucleosome pattern over the PHO5 promoter, which is very similar to the in vivo pattern, can be generated by de novo assembly in vitro. This is a proof of principle that the extended chromatin organization of the yeast PHO5 promoter can be reconstituted in a cell-free in vitro system in the absence of replication and provides the basis for studies of the PHO5 promoter in vitro. Yeast Whole Cell Extract Preparation—Our procedure is based on the protocol of M. C. Schultz (14Schultz M.C. Methods. 1999; 17: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with modifications by S. E. Kong and J. Q. Svejstrup. 1S. E. Kong and J. Q. Svejstrup, personal communication. A 2-liter culture of strain YS22 (MAT α, his3-11, his3-15, leu2-3, leu2-112, canR, ura3Δ5, pho4::URA3) was grown in YPDA to an OD600 of 2–4 and harvested at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was washed subsequently with 200 ml of cold water, 50 ml, and finally 20 ml of cold extraction buffer (0.2 m Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 390 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, only in the final wash: Complete™ protease inhibitor without EDTA (Roche Applied Science)). The pellet was extruded into liquid nitrogen. Cell lysis was done by grinding under liquid nitrogen in a mortar with an additional 1.5 ml of extraction buffer containing Complete™ without EDTA. After slow thawing, the slurry was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Only the middle part of the supernatant was withdrawn with a syringe, leaving behind the cloudy layer on top of the pellet and the lipid-rich layer at the meniscus. 337 mg of solid (NH4)2SO4/ml was added slowly while stirring in the cold until complete dissolution. This solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 41,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended with 0.5–0.75 ml of dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete™ without EDTA) and dialyzed against this buffer. The dialysis need not go to completion but residual (NH4)2SO4 should be taken into account for the chromatin assembly conditions. Aliquots of the extract were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. At least two freeze-thaw cycles did not diminish the performance of the extract. The extracts have a protein concentration of 30–60 mg/ml as determined by Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Chromatin Assembly—For each preparation of DNA, extract, and histones, the ratio of DNA:extract:histones had to be carefully optimized. A 150-μl chromatin assembly reaction contained for example 2 μg of DNA, 300 μg of extract protein, and 6 μg of Drosophila histone octamers. The DNA template was the circular, supercoiled, 10.01 kb plasmid pCB(LEU2) (derivative of pCB/wt (16Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Hörz W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with the TRP1 marker replaced by the LEU2 marker). Drosophila histone octamers were purified essentially as described (17Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and kept in 1 m KCl and 50% glycerol at -20 °C. The standard assembly buffer consists of 20 mm Hepes/KOH pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 12% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and was supplemented if called for with a regenerating energy system of 3 mm ATP/MgCl2, 30 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma) and 5 ng/μl creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science). The contribution of the histones regarding KCl and glycerol was taken into account. Siliconized tubes were blocked with a solution of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet-40 for all assembly reactions. The assembly reaction was incubated at 30 °C. Prior to any manipulation or analysis, the assembly reaction was always centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature and maximum speed in a table-top centrifuge. Gel Filtration and Sucrose Gradient Fractionation of Chromatin— 150 μl of chromatin were loaded onto a 600-μl sucrose gradient (10–50% sucrose in assembly buffer), centrifuged for 1 h at 27,000 × g and 25 °C and fractionated. Fractions were screened for chromatin by Southern blotting. In addition or alternatively, 150 μl of chromatin were spun through 1 ml of Sephacryl S300HR (Amersham Biosciences, equilibrated in assembly buffer plus 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 min at 1100 × g and room temperature yielding the chromatin in the flow-through. Chromatin Analysis—Nuclei preparation and chromatin analysis by restriction enzymes, MNase or DNase I as well as indirect end-labeling, gel electrophoresis, and blotting procedures were as described (18Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Gregory P.D. Barbaric S. Hörz W. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 417-425PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary cleavage for DNase I digests employed ApaI and for restriction enzyme digests HaeIII. Probe 1 corresponds to the ApaI-BamHI fragment upstream of the PHO5 gene and probe β to the HpaI-ClaI fragment at the beginning of the LEU2 gene. The BamHI-BstEII fragment was used as PHO5 promoter probe and a PCR product using the primers GCCAACACTTTGAGTGCTTGTAAC and TGAGGCATTGAACAAGTTGGAACC as PHO5 coding region probe. Quantification of restriction enzyme accessibility assays was done using a PhosphorImager (Fuji FLA3000, AIDA™ software). Apyrase Treatment and ATP Measurement—Chromatin was incubated with 0.001 to 0.02 units/μl apyrase (grade I, Sigma) and incubated for at least 15 min at 30 °C. This treatment routinely reduced the ATP concentration by a factor of 10-5 to 10-6. The ATP concentration was measured with the luciferin/luciferase assay (Enliten™, Promega; Lumat LB 9501, Berchtold Technologies). The assay was not inhibited by addition of a mock assembly without ATP. The Yeast Whole Cell Extract Assembly System Generates Extensive Nucleosomal Arrays—Our in vitro chromatin assembly system uses a yeast whole cell extract. Its preparation was based on a protocol by Schultz (14Schultz M.C. Methods. 1999; 17: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with an additional ammonium sulfate precipitation step. It was originally reported by Schultz (14Schultz M.C. Methods. 1999; 17: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that yeast whole cell extracts failed to reliably produce extensive nucleosomal arrays like those seen with Drosophila embryo or Xenopus egg extracts (9Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Morris N.R. Cell. 1977; 10: 237-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We found that this was due to a lack of sufficient amounts of endogenous histones in the yeast extract. Without additional histones, limited micrococcal digestion of a yeast extract assembly reaction indeed showed a smear only (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). In contrast, if the assembly reaction was supplemented with purified histones the yeast extract system was very capable of generating extensive arrays (Fig. 1, lanes 20–22). This assembly required energy in addition to supplementary histones. A reaction without the ATP regenerating system yielded only few closely spaced nucleosomes (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6). The third critical factor for successful chromatin assembly was the incubation time. The kinetics of the assembly reaction were slow. The length of the arrays increased steadily for up to 6 h when finally the pattern looked very similar to those found with nuclei in vivo (Fig. 1, lanes 20–22 versus 23–25). Interestingly, while the length of the arrays increased with assembly time, the spacing of the nucleosomes did not change with time but remained constant from the beginning (Fig. 1, lanes 7–18 and 20–22). Under the conditions shown here, the nucleosomal repeat length was about 170 bp but was to some extent dependent on the salt concentration (data not shown). Apart from the assembly without additional histones we did not observe significant amounts of subnucleosomal DNA even at early time points. Similar results were obtained when a different region of the plasmid was probed (data not shown). The in Vitro Assembled Chromatin Is Dynamic in an Energy-dependent Way because of Activities Intrinsic to the Yeast Extract—The generation of extended nucleosomal arrays was the first step toward reconstitution of physiologically relevant chromatin. The assembly kinetics hinted at an energy-dependent dynamic quality of histone deposition and/or nucleosome rearrangement in the system, which would reflect a second physiological feature. We supposed that the ATP-dependent rearrangement of nucleosomes would be an important step leading to the proper positioning of nucleosomes. In order to test more directly if the yeast extract system generates dynamic chromatin, we monitored the accessibility of the ClaI site in the PHO5 promoter under different conditions (Fig. 3). Restriction nucleases are widely used to probe the structure and dynamics of chromatin (3Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W.

In the case of static chromatin with essentially immobile nucleosomes, restriction enzyme accessibility reflects the position of the restriction site in a nucleosomal versus non-nucleosomal region. In contrast, in dynamic chromatin nucleosomes are mobile and will adopt different positions over time. On time average, at equilibrium, these positions will be occupied with higher or lower probabilities. The irreversible cut of the restriction enzyme will integrate accessibility over the time window of digestion. This way even a site that is nucleosomal on time average will show significant accessibility after a prolonged digestion time if the mobilization of nucleosomes, e.g. by ATP-dependent remodelers, provides transient exposure (22Varga-Weisz P.D. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The ClaI site was quite accessible if probed in freshly assembled chromatin at the end of the assembly kinetics (Fig. 3, column 1). This could either mean a location of the ClaI site in a non-nucleosomal region or could be a sign of dynamic chromatin in the assembly system. The latter explanation turned out to be correct as removal of ATP either by apyrase treatment or by sucrose gradient fractionation and/or gel filtration of the chromatin led to a marked decrease in ClaI accessibility (Fig. 3, columns 2 and 3). This lower accessibility under static conditions suggested that the ClaI site was nucleosomal in the assembled chromatin. The separation of the chromatin from unbound lower molecular weight compounds by sucrose gradient fractionation and/or gel filtration removed the energy but did not remove the ATP-dependent factors as mere re-addition of ATP after the separation step restored ClaI accessibility (Fig. 3, column 4). The activity of the ATP-dependent factors responsible for the dynamic behavior could be removed after assembly by treatment of the chromatin with the detergent sarkosyl (21Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) prior to the separation step. In this case, readdition of ATP alone was not sufficient to increase the ClaI accessibility significantly unless yeast extract as a source of the ATP-dependent and sarkosyl-sensitive factors was added as well (Fig. 3, columns 6 and 7). The ClaI accessibility under static conditions of the sarkosyl-treated chromatin (Fig. 3, column 5), was significantly higher than without sarkosyl (Fig. 3, columns 2 and 3) indicating a damaging effect of sarkosyl on the chromatin structure. The Nucleosome Positioning over the PHO5 Promoter as Assembled in Vitro Closely Resembles the in Vivo Pattern—The assembly of DNA into extensive regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays as well as the ATP-dependent dynamics of the resulting chromatin were promising signs indicating that the yeast extract system might be able to generate a physiological chromatin structure in vitro. In our case we were particularly interested to see if the yeast extract system could generate in vivo-like nucleosome positioning over the PHO5 promoter. A direct comparison of the in vivo chromatin structure with the in vitro assembled chromatin as assayed by DNase I digestion and indirect end labeling revealed very close similarities (Fig. 4A; lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 8–15). The short hypersensitive site between nucleosomes -3 and -2 is longer than a typical linker region and leads to a strong band in the DNase I pattern in vivo. It is a hallmark of the nucleosomal organization over the PHO5 promoter (HS, Fig. 2; arrowhead in Fig. 4A; Ref. 18Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This band was strong and broad and at the proper location in the in vitro chromatin as well. The site of preferential cleavage by DNase I in free DNA, which notoriously leads to a band at the position of the ClaI marker fragment (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4, Ref. 18Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) 2W. Hörz, P. Korber, A. Schmid, and D. Blaschke, unpublished data. was well protected after the in vitro assembly speaking for the stable positioning of a nucleosome at this location, i.e. the -2 nucleosome. The position of the band corresponding to the linker region between the nucleosomes -4 and -3 also matched exactly. Its intensity was usually very strong (Fig. 4A, lanes 8–15), a feature that is also sometimes observed in vivo albeit less often (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). 2W. Hörz, P. Korber, A. Schmid, and D. Blaschke, unpublished data. The two bands framing the position of the -1 nucleosome were slightly shifted downstream in the in vitro chromatin as compared with the in vivo pattern. Differences in the DNase I pattern further downstream of the promoter, i.e. in the upper part of the lane, reflect differences in the DNA sequence. For example, the open reading frame of PHO5 is followed in vivo by a hypersensitive site and then the PHO3 gene (18Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) whereas the in vitro template harbors the CEN6 element here. The proper positioning of the nucleosomes in vitro was again dependent on supplementary histones and energy (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2) and was clearly distinct from the DNase I pattern of free DNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). The strikingly in vivo-like DNase I pattern was highly reproducible, examples from six independent assembly reactions with different extract preparations are shown in Figs. 4A, 5, and 6. We emphasize this point because achieving reproducibility was a major difficulty in setting up this assembly system. It demanded the appropriate buffer conditions and careful titration of template DNA, histones, and extract. Once assembled, the pattern persisted through sucrose gradient fractionation or gel filtration (Fig. 4A, lanes 10–13).Fig. 6The DNase I pattern is unaffected by the presence or absence of energy during digestion. After 6.5 h an in vitro assembly reaction was either supplemented with 30 mm creatine phosphate and 5 ng/μl creatine kinase or treated with apyrase (0.02 units/μl) and incubated for additional 35 min at 30 °C prior to DNase I digestion leading to a final ATP concentration of 2.25 mm or 3 nm, respectively. DNase I concentrations were 15 units/ml (lanes 1 and 3) or 30 units/ml (lanes 2 and 4). Lane 5 shows digests with HaeIII or ClaI (top to bottom) as size marker. Numbered ovals are as in Fig. 4A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to analysis by DNase I digestion and indirect end-labeling, the nucleosome structure over the PHO5 promoter was also probed by restriction enzyme accessibility under static conditions, i.e. after apyrase treatment (Fig. 4B). This technique has the advantage of covering the total population of DNA molecules whereas DNase I digestion with indirect end labeling may reflect a subpopulation due to the low degree of digestion intrinsic to the method. In vivo, the enzymes BamHI and BstEII cut in linker regions with accessibilities of about 50% whereas the site for ClaI lies within the -2 nucleosome and has a low accessibility of about 10–20% (Figs. 2 and 3). 2W. Hörz, P. Korber, A. Schmid, and D. Blaschke, unpublished data. The up and down of the restriction enzyme accessibilities along the PHO5 promoter which arises from the positioned nucleosomal array was well recapitulated by the in vitro assembled chromatin. Regarding the absolute accessibility values, the value for the BstEII site appeared to be somewhat too low. This could be a consequence of the slightly shifted -1 nucleosome or reflect a heterogeneity of chromatin configurations or be a property of the BstEII enzyme. Different restriction enzymes tend to cope differently with chromatin as substrate, and even under dynamic conditions different restriction enzymes cleave to different extents (data not shown). This was also true for the in vitro assembled chromatin, although only when fully assembled. DNA assembled without exogenous histones was cut to 100% by all restriction enzymes tested (data not shown). This ruled out an inhibition of the enzymes by components of the extract or the buffer conditions of the assembly. In order to get a more meaningful perspective on the absolute accessibility values, we took advantage of a BstEII site in the open reading frame of the LEU2 gene on the same plasmid template DNA. The LEU2 BstE II site was 4-fold less accessible than the site in the PHO5 promoter (Fig. 4B). We took this lower value to represent an upper limit for a nucleosomal BstE II site. This in turn showed that the BstEII site in the PHO5 promoter region was relatively accessible and did indeed represent a linker region. Nucleosome Positioning Slowly Matures into the Native Pattern over the PHO5 Promoter—The DNase I pattern in the region of the PHO5 promoter matures strikingly with time. We monitored the chromatin structure over the PHO5 promoter during assembly kinetics by DNase I digestion and indirect end labeling (Fig. 5). At early time points (Fig. 5; lanes 1–3), the region corresponding to the -2 and -3 nucleosomes exhibited multiple DNase I bands indicating multiple nucleosome positions. After 3.5 h and even more pronounced after 6.5 h the DNase I bands merged into few bands and formed the distinctive pattern of the PHO5 promoter (Fig. 5, lanes 6–8). We could literally watch how the -2 and -3 nucleosomes of the PHO5 promoter homed in on their proper positions during the in vitro assembly. Interestingly, the -1 or TATA-box nucleosome was inaccessible to DNase I right from the beginning even though this region is accessible in free DNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) speaking for a rapid positioning of this nucleosome. The pattern after about 6 h represented the equilibrium state as further prolongation of the assembly up to overnight did not lead to changes of the pattern, even if supplemented with additional creatine phosphate and creatine kinase (data not shown). The pattern was also not influenced whether the DNase I digest was performed in the presence of ATP or after energy depletion by apyrase treatment (Fig. 6). This is due to the low degree of digestion, which is intrinsic to the DNase I indirect end-labeling method and ideally results in only one double strand cut in the region of interest. This limit digest will always score only the positions, which are occupied with high probability and the nucleosomes apparently become frozen in these positions after removal of energy by apyrase. We have successfully established a cell-free, replication-independent in vitro chromatin assembly system based on yeast extracts that is able to position nucleosomes over the PHO5 promoter region very much as found in vivo. This shows that nuclear features like higher order chromatin folding (23Thoma F. Zatchej M. Cell. 1988; 55: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), nuclear matrix or chromosome environment as well as the process of replication (24Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) do not play an essential role in setting up the nucleosome positioning at the PHO5 promoter. Instead, the PHO5 promoter DNA is able to act as the template for an ATP-dependent self-organization process if provided with a yeast extract and sufficient histones. Our here established system provides a new tool for the study of nucleosome positioning and chromatin remodeling. It combines the advantage of a system thoroughly characterized in vivo with the possibility of asking mechanistic questions in vitro that cannot be addressed in vivo. The potential of such a system was recognized several years ago, but initial attempts using yeast extracts were un"

The cytoxicity of these enzymes is related to their resistance to the ribonuclease protein inhibitor (RI).

The RNA population in cells is controlled post-transcriptionally by ribonucleases (RNases) of varying specificity.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are effective cytotoxic agents both in vitro and in vivo. It is generally accepted that the cytoxicity of these RNases is mainly related to their ability to evade the cytoplasmic RNase inhibitor (RI) and to degrade cellular RNA (5Makarov A.A. Ilinskaya O.N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Haigis M.C. Kurten E.L. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The antitumor activity exhibited by cytotoxic RNases varies depending on the type of tumor. Factors that could determine susceptibility are the ability of RNases to bind to the cell surface and the efficiency of their internalization (15Haigis M.C. Raines R.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the vertebrate RNase family, for which RNase A is the prototype, BS-RNase holds a unique position, as it is the only native dimeric member, and the two subunits are cross-linked by disulfide bonds between Cys31 of one chain and Cys32 of the other and vice versa (16D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Mazzarella L. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonuclease: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 383-423Google Scholar). Another unique feature is the coexistence of two dimeric forms: MxM, in which the two subunits interchange the N-terminal helical segment (residues 1–15) through a linker peptide spanning residues 16–22 (hinge peptide) and M=M with no interchange (17Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Despite the swapping of the N termini, the two isomers have been shown by x-ray analysis to have similar quaternary structure (18Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Berisio R. Sica F. De Lorenzo C. Di Fiore A. Piccoli R. Zagari A. Mazzarella L.

Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), so that they are practically indistinguishable by their external shape. The MxM form, accounting for about two-thirds of protein molecules, has allosteric properties, whereas M=M shows a typical Michaelis kinetics (17Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Di Donato A. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Biochem.

Moreover, the swapped form is endowed with an unusual multiplicity of biological action: it exhibits antispermatogenic, antiviral, embryotoxic, immunosuppressive, and antitumor properties (7Kim J.S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10525-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Mazzarella L. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonuclease: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 383-423Google Scholar). Only a minor antitumor action has been detected for M=M (23Cafaro V. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. Bracale A. Mastronicola M.R. Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since both MxM and M=M forms cannot be accommodated into the cavity of RI, the different behavior of the two isomers has been explained with their different fate inside the cell (24Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the reducing environment of the cytosolic compartment, M=M dissociates into monomers, which readily bind to RI. By contrast, in MxM the swapping of the N termini is sufficient to stabilize the dimeric form even when the interchain disulfide bridges are broken; in this case a non-covalent dimer (NCD) is formed, which is supposed to be the species responsible for the unique biological properties of MxM (17Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This explanation of the remarkable difference in the biological properties of the two isomers implies that NCD would adopt a quaternary structure capable of evading RI. Beside BS-RNase, other ribonucleases, such as RNase A (25Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1: 217-222PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sorrentino S. Barone R. Bucci E. Gotte G. Russo N. Libonati M. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and human pancreatic ribonuclease (HP-RNase) (27Canals A. Pous J. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribo M. Vilanova M. Coll M. Structure. 2001; 9: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are able to form in vitro non-covalent dimers through the swapping of a structural element among subunits. In particular, under well defined experimental conditions, monomeric RNase A produces two different non-covalent dimeric forms (26Sorrentino S. Barone R. Bucci E. Gotte G. Russo N. Libonati M. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), both studied crystallographically: ND-RNase A, where the N-terminal α-helices are interchanged (28Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and CD-RNase A, where the swapping involves the C-terminal β-strands (29Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the x-ray analysis of a variant of monomeric HP-RNase, in which the region 1–22 and residue 101 are substituted for those of BS-RNase, revealed the presence in the crystal of an N-terminal domain-swapped dimer (PM8), whose quaternary organization is different from ND-RNase A (27Canals A. Pous J. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribo M. Vilanova M. Coll M. Structure. 2001; 9: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The HP-RNase variant does not exhibit cytotoxic activity (27Canals A. Pous J. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribo M. Vilanova M. Coll M. Structure. 2001; 9: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the two dimers of RNase A show low antitumor activity compared with BS-RNase (30Matousek J.

These results raise the problem of clarifying how the two subunits are assembled in the non-covalent dimer obtained from MxM. In this study, we report the crystal structure of NCD, carboxyamidomethylated at the residues Cys31 and Cys32 (NCD-CAM) and complexed with 2′-deoxycitidylyl(3′-5′)-2′-deoxyadenosine (dCpdA), at 2.0 Å resolution. The thermal and kinetic stability of this BS-RNase form in solution has also been investigated. Despite the lack of disulfide bridges, the quaternary assembly of NCD-CAM turned out to be much closer to MxM than to ND-RNase A and to PM8. Furthermore, model building of the complex between RI and the N-terminal swapped dimeric RNases show that NCD is the only known non-covalent dimer whose quaternary structure hampers the formation of the complex with RI. The comparative analysis of RNase A, PM8, and NCD-CAM structures has also allowed the identification of key residues that are important to stabilize for the latter enzyme a quaternary structure, which is capable of evading the protein inhibitor. Materials—RNase A (type XII-A) from bovine pancreas, the oligonucleotide dCpdA, as well as yeast RNA were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Superdex G-75, Superdex 75 10/30, and Source 15S HR 10/10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. A column of Superdex G-75 was calibrated with molecular mass standards from Bio-Rad and Sigma. NCD-CAM Preparation—The BS-RNase non-covalent dimer was prepared according to the protocol previously described by Piccoli et al. (17Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sample of native mixture of the BS-RNase was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, to the final concentration of 7.1 mg/ml. The interchain disulfide bridges were selectively reduced by adding, under a nitrogen flux, a 10-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol with respect to the protein molar concentration. The sulfurs of cysteines 31 and 32 were then alkylated in the dark with iodoacetamide, which was added to the reaction mixture in 2-fold molar excess with respect to dithiothreitol. This treatment furnishes two BS-RNase derivatives: the monomer and the non-covalent dimer, which were obtained from the M=M and MxM, respectively. The products were separated at 4 °C by HPLC (model 410 BIO distributed by PerkinElmer Life Sciences) gel-filtration chromatography, on a column of Superdex G-75, equilibrated, and eluted with 0.2 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.1. Protein homogeneity was judged by native and denaturing gel electrophoresis performed on a Phast System (Amersham Biosciences). The native electrophoresis of the purified NCD-CAM revealed a single band with a molecular mass comparable to that of the BS-RNase control. The denaturing gel showed, instead, a single band located at the height of the monomeric RNase A standard. The ribonucleolytic activity was measured by the Kunitz assay (31Kunitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ND-RNase A Preparation—The oligomerization of RNase A was obtained, as previously described (26Sorrentino S. Barone R. Bucci E. Gotte G. Russo N. Libonati M. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), by lyophilizing a solution of the enzyme (5 mg/ml) in 40% acetic acid. Briefly, the aqueous acetic acid solution of RNase A was first kept at room temperature for 60 min under stirring, then frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized overnight. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, at a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml and was subjected to ion exchange chromatography, carried out with an Amersham Biosciences Source 15S HR 10/10 column. The monomeric enzyme was eluted using 0.085 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) at the flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, whereas the two dimers, ND-RNase A and CD-RNase A, were separated using a 0.085 ± 0.180 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.7) linear gradient. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—The non-covalent dimer of BS-RNase was crystallized in the presence of dCpdA at 4 °Cby using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The best crystals of NCD-CAM were grown from a crystallization solution containing 22% (w/v) PEG 8000, 5% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m cacodilate buffer, pH 6.5. In particular, a protein sample (5 mg/ml) containing a 10-fold molar excess of the ligand (1.8 mm) was mixed with an equal volume of the precipitant solution and equilibrated against the reservoir in 2-μl drops. The x-ray data collection has been performed at the ELETTRA Synchrotron (Trieste, Italy) using a 30-cm diameter MAR-Research image plate system. Prior to data collection, the crystal was transferred into a cryo-protectant solution containing a higher concentration of PEG 8000 (24% w/v) in comparison with the mother liquor and 15% (v/v) glycerol as cryogenic agent, and frozen at 110 K under a N2 stream. Data were indexed, processed, and scaled with the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (32Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Intensities were truncated to amplitudes using the TRUNCATE program (33Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The crystal diffracted up to 2.0 Å and belongs to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 41.47 Å, b = 69.69 Å, and c = 110.80 Å. Assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient (Vm) (34Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) is estimated to be 2.82.

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The crystal structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the X-PLOR program. 2A. T. Brunger (1996) Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT. As a search model, a structural unit (residues 1–15 of one subunit and 23–124 of the second one) of MxM (PDB code 1BSR) (18Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used, as this unit was supposed to be the conservative region of the molecule. The cross-rotation function, calculated using data in the 10–3.4 Å resolution range, clearly shows two prominent peaks, which were ascribed to the two protein chains. The two maxima are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold rotation, in agreement with the results of the self-rotation function. After a run of the X-PLOR PC-Refinement routine, 2A. T. Brunger (1996) Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT. the dimer was finally assembled in the asymmetric unit through a stepwise translation search. Few cycles of rigid body refinement of the two structural units were followed by several runs of positional and temperature refinement alternated with manual building using the O program (36Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C. Ealick S. Crystallography Model Methods Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag Press, New York1990: 189-199Google Scholar). The building of the two hinge peptides was not difficult as the associated Fo–Fc electron density was well defined. A randomly selected 10% of data was set aside as a free data set. Reflections with Fo<2σ(Fo) were also excluded from the structure refinement. Water molecules were placed at stereochemically reasonable positions if they displayed electron density in the Fo–Fc map greater than 3σ. The final model contains 1898 protein atoms, 74 nucleotide atoms, and 120 water molecules, and has an Rfactor and an Rfree of 20.9 and 27.3%, respectively. The correctness of stereochemistry was finally checked using PROCHECK (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss M.D. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); calculations of r.m.s.d. values from ideal values for bonds, angles, dihedral, and improper angles were performed using X-PLOR. The relevant parameters of the refinement are presented in Table I. Circular Dichroism Analysis—The thermal denaturation of NCD-CAM, monomeric carboxyamidomethylated derivative of BS-RNase (MCAM), RNase A, and ND-RNase A was monitored by using CD spectroscopy. The spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter equipped with thermostatic cuvette holder (JASCO PTC-348). Specifically, the minimum centered around 211 nm of a 0.2 mg/ml solution of ribonuclease was monitored as the temperature of the solution was increased from 4 to 73 °C with a scan rate of 0.5 °C/min. Data were fitted to a two-state transition model, and the resulting curve was used to calculate the value of Tm, which corresponds to the temperature at the midpoint of the thermal denaturation. Kinetics of Thermal Dissociation of NCD-CAM—The dissociation kinetics of NCD-CAM and ND-RNase A were studied by incubating solutions of protein (0.42 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 130 mm NaCl, at 37 °C. At various time intervals, aliquots of the samples were withdrawn, cooled, and analyzed by gel filtration on an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system, equipped with a Superdex 75 10/30 column, equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 m NaCl (flow rate 0.6 ml/min). Elution was performed at room temperature. The amount of the dimeric enzyme, measured as a percentage of the initial value, was monitored as function of time. Subunit Superposition and Construction of the Complex with the Protein Inhibitor—For superposition and comparison of the various chains, only the Cα carbon atoms of residues 25–35, 40–60, 72–86, 95–110, and 116–123 were used. This selection includes the β-sheet core of the protein and two α-helices. Exposed loops and the N-terminal helix involved in the swapping were not included in the calculations. For the detection of the breathing skeleton motion of each subunit, the V-shaped β-sheet motif was separated in two arms, V1 and V2, which includes the Cα carbon atoms of residues 61–63, 71–75, 105–111, 116–124, and 42–46, 82–87, 96–101, respectively. Models of PM8, ND-RNase A, and NCD-CAM complexed with the protein inhibitor RI were obtained by superimposition of the atomic coordinates of one subunit of each dimer onto the crystallographic coordinates of RNase A bound to RI (Ref. 38Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar; PDB access code 1DFJ). In the case of NCD-CAM and PM8, which possess a stringent 2-fold symmetry, the choice of the chain to superimpose on the RNase A coordinates is not relevant, and only one model was analyzed. On the contrary, for ND-RNase A (28Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which deviates considerably from the 2-fold symmetry, two different models can be built, using either chain A or chain B (as reported in the PDB file, access code 1A2W). Enzyme Characterization—Among the swapped proteins, the MxM isomer of BS-RNase represents a singular case because the subunit assembly is governed by two different types of constraints: the swapping of the N termini and the two consecutive antiparallel intersubunit disulfide bridges (18Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Merlino A. Vitagliano L. Sica F. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Biopolymers. 2004; 73: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The selective reduction of these disulfides by titration with dithiothreitol, followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide, produces a non-covalent dimer (NCD-CAM), whose quaternary structure is held together only by the swapping (17Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The nature of NCD-CAM has been assessed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions, in which this derivative migrates as a single band with a molecular mass of 14 and 28 kDa, respectively. The enzymatic activity of NCD-CAM, determined on yeast RNA as a substrate, in agreement with previous data (17Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is almost twice that of the native enzyme and comparable with that of MCAM (39Sica F. Di Fiore A. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Proteins. 2003; 52: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of NCD-CAM has been measured by CD spectroscopy in the range from 4 °C to 85 °C and compared with that of MCAM, RNase A, and ND-RNase A. The reversible thermal transitions of the various enzymes have been fitted to equations describing a two-state model. The values of Tm, obtained at the midpoint of the thermal denaturation curve, are 56.2 and 61.7 °C for the monomers MCAM and RNase A, respectively, 56.0 and 61.9 °C for the corresponding dimers, NCD-CAM and ND-RNase A. These data indicate that the dimers have the same conformational stability of the monomeric counterpart thus suggesting that the dissociation of the oligomers precedes the onset of the thermal unfolding. The stability of NCD-CAM as a dimer has also been determined at 37 °C and compared with that of ND-RNase A. The amount of the dimeric protein, recovered by gel filtration at regular time intervals, was fitted with first order plots and gave t½ of 7 and 24 h for NCD-CAM and ND-RNase A, respectively. For the latter enzyme the t½ obtained in our experiments is practically consistent with literature data (26Sorrentino S. Barone R. Bucci E. Gotte G. Russo N. Libonati M. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the higher dissociation rate at 37 °C, NCD-CAM is stable up to 2 months at 4 °C as judged by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Thus, crystals of this dimer could be grown at 4 °C from a freshly prepared sample without serious problems. General Structure—The structure of NCD-CAM in complex with dCpdA has been refined using diffraction data extending up to 2.0 Å resolution. The final model comprises two subunits, which interchange their N termini, as in native MxM isomer (Fig. 1). The electron density map is well defined for all residues (see Fig. 2A), including the four carboxyamidomethylated cysteine residues (Ycm) 31 and 32 (Fig. 2B), which form the interchain disulfide bridges in the native protein.Fig. 23 σ(I) level omit Fo–Fc maps, seen along the molecular local 2-fold axis. Hydrogen bonds are represented by dotted lines. Both chains A and B are shown: the hinge region (A); the four carboxyamidomethylated Cys residues (Ycm) (B), which form the interchain disulfides"
https://openalex.org/W2022435811,"Cysteine protease inhibitors are being studied as possible new antimalarial agents. To evaluate the potential for resistance to these compounds, we subjected chloroquine-resistant (W2 strain) Plasmodium falciparum to increasing concentrations of a vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitor. After incubation with 1–200 nm morpholine urea-leucine-homophenylalanine-phenyl vinyl sulfone over approximately 8 months, highly resistant parasites (∼100-fold increases in IC50) were selected. The vinyl sulfone-resistant parasites were also resistant to related peptidyl inhibitors, but had only modest (∼2-fold) decreases in sensitivity to other cysteine protease inhibitors. Compared with the parental strain, resistant parasites showed no changes in multiplication rates, but elevations in cysteine protease activity, falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 copy numbers, transcription of falcipain genes, and levels of these target proteases in trophozoites. Resistant parasites grown in the absence of the vinyl sulfone for 12 weeks showed partial reversion, with increased inhibitor sensitivity and apparent decreases in copy numbers of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3. The sequences of falcipain-1, falcipain-2, and falcipain-3 were identical in sensitive and resistant parasites. The accumulation of a vinyl sulfone inhibitor was decreased approximately 9-fold in resistant parasites. In summary, parasites resistant to a cysteine protease inhibitor were selected, although the acquisition of high level resistance required extended exposure to the inhibitor and this resistance was somewhat unstable. Resistance was specific for the type of protease inhibitor used for the selection and appeared to be mediated both by alterations in inhibitor transport and by a previously unidentified mechanism in P. falciparum, the amplification of genes encoding targets of enzyme inhibitors.

Malaria continues to be a challenging health problem, infecting hundreds of millions of people and resulting in 1–3 million deaths annually (1Breman J.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Most severe disease and deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The control of falciparum malaria is frustrated by increasing resistance of malaria parasites to available antimalarial drugs. Therefore, there is a great need to develop new antimalarial agents. Among potential new targets for antimalarial chemotherapy are proteases that hydrolyze hemoglobin in erythrocytic parasites (2Francis S. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D. Annu. Rev.

They are of particular interest as therapeutic targets, as falcipain inhibitors, including peptidyl fluoromethyl ketones and vinyl sulfones, blocked the hydrolysis of hemoglobin and development by cultured erythrocytic parasites (11Rosenthal P.J. Wollish W.S. Palmer J.T. Rasnick D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Rosenthal P.J. Olson J. Lee G. Palmer J. Klaus J. Rasnick D. Antimicrob.

In addition, the disruption of the falcipain-2 gene led to diminished hemoglobin hydrolysis in trophozoites, confirming the role of this enzyme as a hemoglobinase (15Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4384-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A concern regarding the use of protease inhibitors or, indeed, inhibitors of any enzyme as drugs, is that rapid selection of drug-resistant mutants will occur. This has been seen with inhibitors of folate pathway enzymes, where mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase target enzymes mediate resistance (16Wongsrichanalai C. Pickard A. Wernsdorfer W. Meshnick S. Lancet Infect Dis. 2002; 2: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Drug resistance might also develop by other mechanisms, including increases in target enzyme expression and diminished intracellular accumulation of an inhibitor. Earlier, we evaluated five strains of P. falciparum, which vary greatly in their sensitivities to established antimalarial drugs, and showed no differences in their sensitivities to cysteine protease inhibitors (17Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 949-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the likelihood of selection of resistance of P. falciparum to protease inhibitors has not previously been explored. We now report the selection and characterization of mutants of P. falciparum resistant to vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitors. These resistant parasites were quite readily selected, although multiple cycles of exposure to the vinyl sulfone were required. The mechanism of resistance was complex, suggesting that changes in drug accumulation and in protease expression, but not mutations in target proteases, contributed to the drug-resistant phenotype.

Cory Emal and William Roush, University of Michigan, Ann Arbbor, MI (Inp-Leu-Tyr-HPh-VSPh). E-64, leupeptin, chloroquine, quinine, artemisinin, and all other biochemical reagents were from Sigma. Parasite Culture—P. falciparum strain W2 was originally obtained from Dr. Dennis Kyle (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD). Parasites were cultured with human erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% human serum as previously described (18Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Parasite synchrony was maintained by serial sorbitol treatments (19Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). In Vitro Selection of Vinyl Sulfone Resistance—A stepwise protocol was used to select vinyl sulfone-resistant parasites. To begin the selection, 10-ml cultures (4% parasitemia) were incubated with 1 nm Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh, which was added from 1000× stocks in Me2SO. Control parasites were cultured with the same percentage of Me2SO (0.1%) throughout the selection process. Culture medium was changed every other day, and two thirds of cultures were removed weekly and replaced with fresh medium containing uninfected erythrocytes. Cultures were maintained at each selection step until the experimental culture reached control multiplication rates. When parasites multiplied as efficiently as controls, the concentration of Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh was increased (Table I). At each selection step, before the concentration of Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh was increased, an aliquot from each culture was cryopreserved.Table IStepwise selection of resistant P. falciparumSelection stepConcentration of Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPhNo. of growth cyclesaEach P. falciparum cycle is 48 h in length.nm111522.512351241095201264018710012820018a Each P. falciparum cycle is 48 h in length.

Parasitol. 1986; 62: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cultures were diluted with medium containing 5% uninfected erythrocytes to yield a concentration of 0.3 infected erythrocytes/100 μl. Aliquots (100 μl) of the diluted cultures were transferred to microplate wells and cultured for 4–5 weeks. Medium containing 200 nm Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh was changed every other day. Approximately every 10 days, half of each culture was removed, and 50 μl of a 2% suspension of uninfected erythrocytes was added. After 30–35 days 10–15% of wells demonstrated parasite growth. When these cultures reached 1% parasitemia, they were transferred to tissue culture flasks for large scale growth and subsequent analysis. In Vitro Susceptibility Tests—Synchronous ring-stage parasites were incubated with multiple concentrations of compounds of interest in 200-μl cultures in microwell plates. Controls were incubated with equal concentrations of Me2SO (0.1%). Media were changed after 24 h, and after 48 h culture plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min, medium was aspirated, and 200 μl of fixative (1% formaldehyde in PBS) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated at room temperature for at least 48 h to ensure proper fixation of erythrocytes. A 50-μl aliquot from each well was then placed into 500 μl of dye solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 nm YOYO-1 (Molecular Probes)) and samples were analyzed with a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). A total of 10,000 erythrocytes was analyzed for each sample. Parasitemia (percentage of nucleated cells) was determined from dot plots (forward scatter versus fluorescence) using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). The IC50 values for inhibition of multiplication were determined from graphs of percentage of control parasitemia over concentration using Prism 3.0 program (GraphPad Software) with data fitted by nonlinear regression to the variable-slope sigmoidal dose response formula y = 100/[1 + 10logIC50–x)H], where H is the Hill coefficient (slope factor). Goodness of fit was documented by R2 values of 0.93–0.99 for all the curves generated. To confirm results, parasite morphologies and manual counts of Giemsa-stained smears were also compared between treated and control cultures after 24- and 48-h incubations. Cysteine Protease Activity Assays—Trophozoite extracts were prepared and cysteine protease activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Leu-Arg-AMC as previously described (8Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Briefly, erythrocytes infected with trophozoite-stage parasites were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, treated with 0.1% saponin in ice-cold PBS for 5 min to lyse erythrocyte membranes, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; supernatants are referred to as trophozoite extracts. Extracts were incubated with 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm Z-Leu-Arg-AMC in a final volume of 350 μl. The release of aminomethylcoumarin was monitored (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) over 30 min at room temperature with a Labsystems Fluoroskan II spectrofluorometer. Activities were compared as fluorescence over time. Analysis of Falcipain Sequences—Genomic DNA was purified from vinyl sulfone-sensitive and -resistant clones by the method described previously (8Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of falcipain-1 (forward primer, 5′-TTGTGTCGACCTTTATATATTTTGTTTACATATTTATATACC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTATAAGCTTTGTGGTTTTATTTACAAGATAGGATTAGAAG-3′), falcipain-2 (forward primer, 5′-GTGTATTTTATTTTGTAGCAAGAACGTTTTGTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGACAAGCTTATTCAATTAATGGAATGAATGCATCAGTACC-3′), and falcipain-3 (forward primer, 5′-TTTTCAATTATTTTATTTTTTGTTTGAAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TATTAAGGAAAATCTATTTTATTATTATG-3′) were amplified from these DNAs by PCR with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The amplified fragments were purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the pCR2.1TOPO vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli (TOP10) were transfected with the plasmids and grown overnight, and recombinant plasmids were purified from bacteria using the QIAprep Spin Mini Prep Kit (Qiagen). Sequences of falcipain fragments were then determined by dideoxy sequencing in both directions. Analysis of Putative Transporter Genes—Total RNA was isolated from vinyl sulfone-sensitive and -resistant parasites, and cDNAs were prepared as described previously (9Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.S. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the P. falciparum pfcrt gene was amplified with Vent DNA polymerase using gene-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-CTTACATATAACAAAATGAAATTCGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GATATATTTTTATTGTGTAATAATTG-3′) and cDNA as a template. The open reading frame of the P. falciparum pfmdr-1 gene was amplified with Vent DNA polymerase in two parts (∼2.2 kb each) using genomic DNA as a template and specific primers (first fragment: forward primer, 5′-GATTTTGTGTTGAAAGATGG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CTGAGTCTTTATAAGCGCTAC-3′; second fragment: forward primer, 5′-CAAATAATGGAAATGATAATG-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CATATATATATTTATGATTTGC-3′). The purification, cloning, and sequencing of amplified fragments of pfcrt and pfmdr-1 were carried out as detailed previously for falcipains (8Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J.

J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—cDNAs were synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA from vinyl sulfone-sensitive and -resistant parasites using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) as described previously (9Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.S. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A set of internal primers (forward primer, 5′-TTTGATGCTTATATTTTGCATACTTTTC; reverse primer, 5′-ACAATTCATCATATCTTTCAATCGGTA (18 S rRNA); forward primer, 5′-TCTGTACTTTTAGTTGGTTATGGACAAG; reverse primer, 5′-AGACGTTGTCTCCATTTTTATTTCTACT (falcipain-1); forward primer, 5′-GCTTGTAGGTTTTGGTATGAAAGAA; reverse primer, 5′-AGATAGGTCCCTTTTTAAAATACTATTGAC (falcipain-2); forward primer, 5′-CGGTTATACTTGTAGGTTATGGTATGAA; reverse primer, 5′-GTTCATTTCTTTTTATTAAGGAAAATCTATTT (falcipain-3)) and cDNAs were used for PCR amplification of 18 S rRNA, falcipain-1, falcipan-2, and falcipain-3. Southern Blotting—For genomic blots, DNAs from vinyl sulfone-sensitive and -resistant parasites were digested with BglII, electrophoresed, and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For chromosomal blots, parasite blocks were prepared by suspending parasites (1 × 109/ml) in PBS and an equal volume of 1.6% low melting point agarose (37 °C), mixing gently, and dispensing the suspensions into plastic gel molds (2 × 5 × 10 mm, 100 μl volume, Bio-Rad). Parasite blocks were solidified at 4 °C for 20 min, treated with cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m EDTA, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, 2 mg/ml proteinase K) at 42 °C for 48 h, and then stored in TE buffer at 4 °C. Pulse field gel electrophoresis was carried out on 0.8% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer at 14 °C using the CHEF-DR II apparatus (Bio-Rad; voltage, 3.5 V/cm; switch time, 200–400 s; angle, 120 °C, run time, 72 h). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and transferred to nylon membranes. Probes specific for the mature regions of falcipain-1, falcipain-2, and falcipain-3, and for pfmdr-1 were amplified and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The probes were then labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen), and membranes were prehybridized, hybridized with specific probes, and washed as described earlier (9Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.S. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Singh A. Shenai B.R. Choe Y. Gut J. Sijwali P.S. Craik C.S. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 273-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Immunoblots were carried out as described earlier (9Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.S. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Singh A. Shenai B.R. Choe Y. Gut J. Sijwali P.S. Craik C.S. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem.

Radiolabeling of a Vinyl Sulfone Protease Inhibitor—The radiolabeling of Inp-Leu-Tyr-VSPh was performed as described previously (23Bogyo M. Verhelst S. Bellingard-Dubouchaud V. Toba S. Greenbaum D. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 27-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, IODO-GEN solution (Pierce, 1 mg/ml) was prepared in chloroform, aliquoted (100 μl) in fresh tubes, and dried under vacuum. PBS (35 μl) was added to the dried IODO-GEN solution, and then 10 μl of 125I (Amersham Biosciences) and 12.5 μl of Inp-Leu-Tyr-VSPh (0.5 mm in 50% ethanol) were added. The reaction was continued at room temperature for 15 min, and 100 μl of PBS was then added. The labeled vinyl sulfone was then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (with 5 ml of acetonitrile followed by 10 ml of PBS) SepPack column (Waters) and washed with 30 ml of PBS. Finally, the labeled vinyl sulfone was eluted in a 1-ml fraction with acetonitrile, and radioactivity was assessed with a γ-radiation counter. Accumulation Assays—Assays of the accumulation of Inp-Leu-Tyr-VSPh were performed in 5-ml cultures (5 ×107 parasites/culture) of vinyl sulfone-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites. [125I]Inp-Leu-Tyr-VSPh (5 μl, 5 × 106 cpm) was added to each tube, and 1-ml aliquots were collected every 30 min for 2 h. Samples from each time point were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 300 μl of 2.5% SDS in PBS, and radioactivity was measured with a γ-radiation counter. Generation of Vinyl Sulfone-resistant Mutants of P. falciparum—For the selection of vinyl sulfone-resistant mutants, we evaluated the W2 strain of P. falciparum, which is resistant to multiple established antimalarials and has been shown to develop resistance to other agents more readily than a chloroquine-sensitive strain (17Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 949-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Rathod P.K. McErlean T. Lee P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9389-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mutants were generated by stepwise exposure of cultured parasites to increasing concentrations of the vinyl sulfone Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh (Table I). For each selection step, parasite culture was maintained until the multiplication rate reached that of control parasites, which were cultured over the same period without the inhibitor. IC50 values were calculated after the 5, 20, 100, and 200 nm selection steps, and in each case were approximately half the selection concentration (Table II). After approximately 8 months of drug exposure, highly resistant mutants were generated, with growth in the presence of inhibitor concentrations over 200 times the IC50 of wild-type parasites.Table IIInhibitor sensitivity of parasites after selectionSelection stepFinal selection concentrationTotal length of selectionMu-Leu-HPh-VSPh IC50 valueaMeans from two experiments, each performed in duplicate, with standard deviations shown.nmweeksnmW2 (wild-type)000.7 ± 0.1435112.0 ± 0.75201712.5 ± 2.871002646.2 ± 3.18 (W2-K31)bParasites selected with 200 nm inhibitor were cloned before analysis.2003181.5 ± 2.1W2-K31rev6wkcW2-K31 revertant (rev) parasites were cultured without the inhibitor for the indicated period after the full selection.03764.7 ± 3.8W2-K31rev12wk04342.3 ± 1.8a Means from two experiments, each performed in duplicate, with standard deviations shown.b Parasites selected with 200 nm inhibitor were cloned before analysis.c W2-K31 revertant (rev) parasites were cultured without the inhibitor for the indicated period after the full selection. Open table in a new tab Highly drug-resistant mutants were cloned by limiting dilution before analysis. The multiplication rates of three vinyl sulfone-resistant clones were compared with the parental isolate. The multiplication rates of resistant mutants and wild-type isolates were nearly identical (Fig. 1). Sensitivities to multiple cysteine protease inhibitors and other antimalarial compounds were compared between vinyl sulfone-resistant mutants and parental parasites. Wild-type parasites were sensitive to sub-nanomolar concentrations of Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh. The resistant parasites demonstrated IC50 values increased by more than 2 orders of magnitude over those of parental isolates (Table III). Sensitivities of the three mutant clones were nearly identical (IC50 78.1–81.5 nm). Sensitivities to other inhibitors with similar structures to Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh were also markedly decreased in the mutants, with IC50 values increased 40-fold for N-Mepipu-Leu-HPh-VSPh, 5-fold for Inp-Leu-Tyr-VSPh, and 7-fold for the fluoromethyl ketone Mu-Phe-HPh-CH2F. Differences in sensitivities between wild-type and mutant parasites to two standard cysteine protease inhibitors, E-64 and leupeptin, were lower (IC50 values increased 2-fold). Sensitivities to three antimalarial drugs with different mechanisms of action than protease inhibition, chloroquine, quinine, and artemisinin, were nearly unchanged. For the cysteine protease inhibitors, but not the other antimalarial compounds, antiparasitic effects were uniformly accompanied by a block in hemoglobin hydrolysis, indicated by the appearance of swollen, dark-staining food vacuoles in parasites (7Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab To evaluate the stability of the resistant phenotype, the resistant W2-K31 clone was grown without drug pressure. The sensitivity of these parasites to Mu-Leu-HPh-VSPh doubled after 12 weeks, although they remained much less sensitive than wild-type controls (Table II). Analysis of Cysteine Protease Inhibitor Targets in Mutant Parasites—Vinyl sulfones probably act against P. falciparum by inhibiting falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, the principal cysteine protease hemoglobinases of erythrocytic parasites (25Rosenthal P.J. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Shenai B.R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 1659-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To characterize the basis of resistance that was selected against vinyl sulfones, we compared the cysteine protease activity in trophozoite extracts prepared from wild-type and vinyl sulfone-resistant parasites. Activity was measured against Z-Leu-Arg-AMC, an excellent peptide substrate for falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 (8Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab We assessed copy numbers of falcipain genes using Southern blots. Analysis of genomic blots showed amplification of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 genes in mutant, compared with parental parasites (Fig. 2A; increased 5.5- and 5.8-fold, respectively, as measured densitometrically). The density of the falcipain-1 band increased less than 2-fold, and that of pfmdr-1 was unchanged. Analysis of chromosomal blots showed increased size of chromosome 11 in mutant parasites that were selected with higher doses (100 and 200 nm) of Mu-Phe-HPh-CH2F, consistent with an increase in the copy number of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, which are located within a 12-kb stretch of that chromosome (Fig. 2B). Parasites that were grown for 12 weeks without drug pressure after selection, and reverted to approximately the sensitivity of parasites selected with 100 nm inhibitor, showed a decrease in the size of chro"

Most important for function were Arg13, Phe3, Cys7, Cys19, and the N-terminal amine of Glu1. Here we have built on these results by conducting cell binding and functional antagonism studies. Alanine replacement of Met12 (M12A) resulted in a peptide with biological activity indistinguishable from PSP. Competitive binding experiments using unlabeled and 125I-M12A generated an IC50 of 0.71 nm and indicated that unlabeled M12A, at concentrations ≥100 nm, completely blocked binding of label to hemocytes. We then tested the ability of other peptide mutants to displace 125I-M12A at a concentration of 100 nm. In the structured core, we found that Cys7 and Cys19 were essential for cell binding and functional antagonism, but these effects were likely because of the importance of these residues for maintaining the tertiary structure of PSP. Arg13, in contrast, was also essential for binding and activity but is not required for maintenance of structure. In the unstructured N-terminal region, deletion of the phenyl group from Phe3 yielded a peptide that reduced binding of 125I-M12A 326-fold. This and all other mutants of Phe3 we bioassayed were unable to antagonize PSP. Deletion of Glu1 in contrast had almost no effect on binding and was a strong functional antagonist. Experiments using a photoaffinity analog indicated that PSP binds to a single 190-kDa protein.

Most important for function were Arg13, Phe3, Cys7, Cys19, and the N-terminal amine of Glu1. Here we have built on these results by conducting cell binding and functional antagonism studies. Alanine replacement of Met12 (M12A) resulted in a peptide with biological activity indistinguishable from PSP. Competitive binding experiments using unlabeled and 125I-M12A generated an IC50 of 0.71 nm and indicated that unlabeled M12A, at concentrations ≥100 nm, completely blocked binding of label to hemocytes. We then tested the ability of other peptide mutants to displace 125I-M12A at a concentration of 100 nm. In the structured core, we found that Cys7 and Cys19 were essential for cell binding and functional antagonism, but these effects were likely because of the importance of these residues for maintaining the tertiary structure of PSP. Arg13, in contrast, was also essential for binding and activity but is not required for maintenance of structure. In the unstructured N-terminal region, deletion of the phenyl group from Phe3 yielded a peptide that reduced binding of 125I-M12A 326-fold. This and all other mutants of Phe3 we bioassayed were unable to antagonize PSP. Deletion of Glu1 in contrast had almost no effect on binding and was a strong functional antagonist. Experiments using a photoaffinity analog indicated that PSP binds to a single 190-kDa protein. The insect immune system consists of both cellular and humoral elements that innately recognize broad classes of foreign intruders (1Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.-M. Hetru C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 3Lavine M.L. Strand M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1295-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Insects usually kill multicellular parasites by encapsulation, which involves attachment of multiple layers of immune cells (hemocytes) to the foreign target. In Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) like Pseudoplusia includens, many intruders are recognized as foreign by a class of hemocytes called granular cells, which release cytokines that induce a second class of hemocytes, plasmatocytes, to bind to the target and form a capsule (4Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2053-2060PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lavine M.D. Strand M.R. J. Insect. Physiol. 2001; 47: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The most potent known activator of plasmatocytes is plasmatocyte-spreading peptide (PSP) 1The abbreviations used are: PSP, plasmatocyte-spreading peptide; AcPSP, acetylated PSP; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Bpa, benzoylphenylalanine; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. (6Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Natural and synthetic PSP induce plasmatocytes to adhere and spread on foreign surfaces within minutes at concentrations ≥100 pm. PSP is expressed by granular cells and fat body as a propeptide of 142 residues with the PSP sequence located at the C terminus (7Clark K. Witherell A. Strand M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1998; 250: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This biologically inactive precursor is then cleaved by an unknown protease to release the mature 23-amino acid peptide (ENFNGGCLAGYMRTADGRCKPTF). PSP homologs have been identified from a number of other moth species, and based on the consensus sequence of their N termini (Glu-Asn-Phe-X-X-Gly), these molecules are collectively referred to as the ENF peptide family (8Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect. Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Other ENF peptides besides PSP also function as plasmatocyte activators, suggesting these molecules may be of widespread importance as regulators of the cellular immune response in Lepidoptera (8Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect. Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10778-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of PSP consists of a disordered N terminus (residues 1-6) and a well defined core (residues 7-22) stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys7 and Cys19, hydrophobic interactions, and a short β-hairpin turn (11Volkman B.J.

Comparison with other proteins reveals that the core region of PSP adopts a very similar structure to the C-terminal subdomain of human epidermal growth factor and the anticoagulant protein thrombomodulin. No consensus binding site has yet been identified for EGF domains and their receptors, but several studies have implicated the C-loop as a critical region for binding (12Nagashima M. Lundh E.

Sykes B.D. Biopolymers. 1998; 43: 339-366Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, the consensus sequence for the N terminus of PSP is found solely in the ENF peptide family (11Volkman B.J.

Using alanine replacement and deletion mutants, we also have identified residues in both the structured and unstructured regions of PSP that are essential for plasmatocyte-spreading activity (16Clark K.D.

These include Cys7 and Cys19, which form the disulfide bond required for the proper three-dimensional structure of PSP, and the charged residue Arg13 within the β-hairpin turn. Deletion mutants in the unstructured N terminus also eliminate all biological activity. Ala replacement of Phe3 (F3A) abolishes activity because of the specific requirement of the phenyl side chain (16Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. King H.B. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ala replacement of Glu1 (E1A) actually enhances activity (17Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This is, in part, because the activity of PSP requires the presence of the N-terminal primary amine but not the side chain of Glu1 (17Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the PSP homolog growth-blocking peptide likewise identify Phe3 as critical for plasmatocyte activation in Pseudaletia separata (10Tada M. Aizawa T. Shinohara Y. Matsubara K. Miura K. Yoshida M. Shitara K. Kouno T. Mizuguchi M. Nitta K. Hayakawa Y. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10778-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The preceding studies provide important insight about structure-function relationships but do not indicate whether mutations in PSP that reduce biological activity affect receptor binding. In the current study we addressed this question by conducting competitive binding and functional antagonism experiments. Our results indicate that in most instances mutant peptides that strongly bound to hemocytes also functionally antagonized plasmatocyte spreading. However, we also identified a few mutants that bound to hemocytes but were poor functional antagonists. Receptor labeling experiments showed that a photoaffinity analog of PSP bound to a single 190-kDa protein in a manner consistent with our binding and antagonism results. Insects—P. includens larvae were reared on an artificial diet at 27 °C and with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod (18Strand M.R. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1990; 83: 538-544Crossref Google Scholar). Moths were fed 20% sucrose in water and maintained under identical environmental conditions. All experiments were conducted with hemocytes collected from 36-48-h fifth instar larvae. Hemocyte Collection and Bioassays—Hemocytes were collected by anesthetizing larvae with CO2 and bleeding them from an incision across the last abdominal segment. Hemolymph was collected in a microfuge tube containing anticoagulant buffer (98 mm NaOH, 186 mm NaCl, 17 mm Na2EDTA, and 41 mm citric acid, pH adjusted to 4.5). The ratio of hemolymph to buffer was ∼1:5. Hemocytes were pelleted for 1 min at 200 × g, and the plasma-buffer supernatant was then removed. Hemocytes were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh anticoagulant. After a 40-min incubation at 4 °C, hemocytes were washed twice by centrifugation in Excell 400 insect cell culture medium (JRH Biosciences). These unseparated hemocytes were then used in binding assays (see below). Plasmatocytes and granular cells account for 30 and 65%, respectively, of the total hemocyte population in P. includens (19Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Gardiner E.M.M. Strand M.R. J. Insect. Physiol. 1999; 45: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasmatocytes were isolated to high purity on Percoll step gradients as previously described (16Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. King H.B. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On average, 1.2 × 106 plasmatocytes were collected per gradient. Purity was 93%, with the primary contaminant being granular cells. These plasmatocytes were washed once in Excell 400 before use in antagonism assays (see below). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—All peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 433 synthesizer using standard Fmoc chemistry as previously described (16Clark K.D. Volkman B.F.

The resin-peptide was cleaved and deprotected for 4 h in reagent K (21King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Pep. Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref Scopus (732) Google Scholar), a mixture containing 5% phenol, 1.25% water, 2.5% thioanisole, and 2.5% dithioethane in trifluoroacetic acid. After removing the resin from the reaction mixture by filtration, the peptide was precipitated in cold t-butyl methyl ether, followed by repeated ether washes and air drying. Peptides were resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Disulfide bond formation was monitored periodically by 5-μl injections onto an HPLC (Rheodyne 9725i manual injector, Hitachi L-6220 pump, Hitachi L-4500A photodiode array detector, and Hitachi D-7000 chromatography software) where the reduced and oxidized peptides eluted in separate peaks on a C18 column (5-μm particle size, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, Supelco 58298) using HPLC-grade H2O (Sigma) and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0-80 min, 20-60%) at 0.5 ml/min. Both the H2O and acetonitrile contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. After the conversion was complete, the sample was purified by a series of 4- to 7-ml injections onto a preparatory HPLC column (10-μm particle size, 21.2 mm × 25 cm, Jupiter C18; Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) using HPLC-grade H2O and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0-70 min, 10-80%) at 9 ml/min. Both the H2O and acetonitrile contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The desired peak was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; disulfide bond formation was confirmed by NMR. After numerous purification runs, peaks were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in HPLC-grade H2O for the determination of amino acid composition and concentration. Mutant peptides were named according to the residue that was modified. For example, alanine replacement of Met12 was named M12A. Wild-type PSP, which lacks any modifications, is referred to as PSP throughout this report. F23Bpa (AAFNGGCLAGYARTADGRCKPTBpa) was synthesized as described above except that the C-terminal Phe was replaced with the photoaffinity reagent benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa), incorporated during the synthesis as the derivative Fmoc-p-Bz-Phe-OH (Bachem). Cleavage and deprotection were carried out as described for the other peptides except that dithioethane was replaced with dithiothreitol to avoid degradation of the benzoylphenylalanine ketone (26Breslav M. Becker J. Naider F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38 (2222): 2219Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Iodination of 125IF23Bpa was carried out as described below. Iodination of the PSP Mutant M12A—Preliminary studies indicated that M12A had plasmatocyte-spreading activity indistinguishable from PSP. 2K. D. Clark and M. R. Strand, unpublished results. We then used M12A in hemocyte binding experiments because it avoided the possibility of methionine sulfoxide formation during iodination of Tyr11 using the chloramine T method (22Crim J.W. Garczynski S.F. Brown M.R. Peptides. 2002; 23: 2045-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To iodinate M12A, 5.6 μg of synthetic peptide was added to 500 μCi of Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) and 2.5 ng of chloramine T in 35 μl of 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After incubation at room temperature for 20 s, the reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume of 50% acetic acid. The radiolabeled mixture was fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse phase C8 column (Vydac, 300 Å, 4.6 × 150 mm): solvent A, water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B, 80% acetonitrile and 20% water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (gradient program: 0-29% B, 29 min, 29-31% B, 40 min; 1 ml/min). 125I-labeled M12A was detected with an inline radioisotope detector. Fractions containing the radiolabeled peptide were collected, and bovine serum albumin (Fraction V; Sigma) was added to 1%. Radioactivity in fractions was quantified by γ counting. Final concentrations were determined based on specific activity (∼2000 Ci/mmol) of 125I in the product, which was free of the unlabeled peptide. Binding Assays—Binding experiments were conducted by adding 5 × 105 hemocytes to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes containing 100 pm125I-labeled M12A in medium (Excell 400 plus 3% bovine serum albumin and 1× protease mixture; Roche Applied Science) plus increasing concentrations of unlabeled M12A or other PSP mutants (1 pm-10 μm). Total reaction volumes were 200 μl. Tubes were incubated at room temperature for 3 h and vortexed every 30 min. Reactions were stopped by centrifuging tubes at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4°. Following removal of the supernatant, pellets were washed three times with ice-cold Excell 400. After the final wash, the bottoms of the microfuge tubes were cut off and counted on a Packard GammaII counter. 100 pm125I-labeled M12A resulted in ∼82,000 cpm/tube; ∼12% of this 125I-M12A bound to hemocytes in the absence of unlabeled M12A. Nonspecific binding values, determined by addition of 1 μm M12A, ranged from 0.38-0.64% of the total 125I-M12A and were subtracted from the raw cpm obtained from the binding assays. The resulting data were converted to percent total binding and then analyzed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism, v3.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The concentrations of peptide that reduced specific binding of 125I-labeled M12A by 50% (IC50), R2, and S.E. for each binding assay were likewise determined using GraphPad Prism. Antagonism of Plasmatocyte-spreading Activity by Mutant Peptides—Previously optimized in vitro assays indicated that 1-10 μm PSP induces 30-35% of plasmatocytes to spread after 30 min and a maximum of 70% of plasmatocytes to spread after 1 h (6Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Strand M.R. Clark K.D. Arch. Insect. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 42: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antagonism experiments in the current study were conducted similarly in 96-well culture plates (Corning). Plates were prepared by adding increasing concentrations of the mutant peptide and a fixed concentration of PSP/well. Wells were then filled with Excell 400 medium containing 1 × 103 plasmatocytes for a total volume of 60 μl. This yielded working concentrations of 100 pm-100 μm for the mutant peptide being assayed and 3 μm of PSP. The percentage of plasmatocytes that spread in an assay was scored 30 min later by counting 100 cells from a randomly selected field of view. Plasmatocytes were scored as spread if they assumed a flattened morphology and were ≥35 μm along their longest axis (6Clark K. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Unspread plasmatocytes remained no adhesive and spherical in shape. Each mutant peptide was bioassayed four times using an independently collected sample of plasmatocytes. The proportion of plasmatocytes spread in the presence of PSP alone was normalized to a value of 100%. The reduction in the number of spread plasmatocytes in the presence of the antagonist was then expressed as a percentage of this value. Photoaffinity Cross-linking—Mixed hemocytes were plated in the presence of 125I-F23Bpa at final concentrations of 50 pm, 0.5 nm, and 5 nm. Each concentration of 125I-F23Bpa was tested alone or in combination with either N2A (17Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or R13A at a final concentration of 1 μm. These hemocytes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed two times at 4 °C, plated (40 μl/well), and exposed to UV light at 366 nm (BlakRay) for 1 h on ice. Cells were lysed and prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding 10 μl of 5× sample buffer to each well and mixing rapidly. After boiling, 30 μl of each sample was applied to a gradient gel (8-16%, Gradipore). The gel was run at constant current (20 mA) and transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose. The dried blot was exposed to film (X-omat) for 2 days and then developed and digitally scanned for display. Binding Constants of Representative Peptides—Prior analysis indicated that several residues are invariant among ENF peptide family members (8Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect. Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. King H.B. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol.

These include Cys7 and Cys19, Thr14 and Thr22, all of the charged amino acids in the structured C terminus (Arg13, Asp16, Arg18, and Lys20), and the three N-terminal residues Glu1, Asn2, and Phe3. As previously noted, mutagenesis studies indicate that several of these residues are essential for biological activity (16Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetiatikal H. King H.B. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J.

The first step of the current study was to conduct full dose-response, competitive binding experiments using M12A and a subset of these mutant peptides. This allowed us to establish parameters for M12A binding that could then be used to optimize experiments with other mutants. For these studies, we used the alanine replacement mutants R13A and F3A, and AcPSP-(2-23), which lacked Glu1 and is acetylated at Asn2 to block the terminal amine. Each of these peptides has little or no biological activity and targets essential residues in the structured and unstructured regions of PSP. Our results indicated that M12A had an IC50 value of 0.71 nm and fully inhibited binding of 125I-M12A to hemocytes at concentrations ≥100 nm (Fig. 1). IC50 values for AcPSP-(2-23) (4 nm) and F3A (232.8 nm) were 5- and 326-fold higher, respectively, than M12A. R13A had an IC50 of 289.4 nm and did not fully inhibit binding of M12A at any concentration tested (Fig. 1). PSP Mutants of the Core Region Exhibit Congruent Patterns of Competitive Binding and Functional Antagonism—We next conducted competitive binding and functional antagonism experiments using R13A and other alanine replacement mutants targeting the structured core region of PSP. Antagonism experiments were conducted over a range of concentrations (100 pm-100 μm). Binding experiments, in contrast, were co"

A chemical inhibitor of Smad activation (SB203580) blocked the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β in SiHa, whereas the proliferative response in HeLa was unaffected. TGF-β-induced translocation of phospho-Smad 2 was relatively less in HeLa than in SiHa cells.

Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). TGF-βs were identified as regulators of mesenchymal growth and differentiation, cell cycle arrest in epithelial and hematopoetic cells, extracellular matrix production, and immunosuppression (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). TGF-β induces the assembly of heteromeric complexes of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, transforming growth factor-β receptor I (TβRI), and transforming growth factor-β receptor II (TβRII), and typically TβRII phosphorylates TβRI (3Huse M. Muir T.W. Xu L. Chen Y.G. Kuriyan J. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Activated TβRI phosphorylates Smad 2 and/or Smad 3, and a heterotrimeric complex is formed with Smad 4 that translocates into the nucleus, binds with a consensus sequence called Smad binding element (SBE), and directly or indirectly (by interacting with other transcription factors) regulates gene transcription (4Liu F.

Targets for the activated MAP kinases are transcription factors that include cAMP-response element-binding protein and Elk-1. p38 activates ATF-2 (9Terada Y. Nakashima O. Inoshita S. Kuwahara M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999; 14: 45-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). JNK phosphorylates c-Jun, a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors that can bind to and activate transcription from AP-1 or phorbol ester-responsive sites. Many TGF-β-regulated gene promoters also contain AP-1 sites (7Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), suggesting AP-1/Smad cooperation.In many epithelial cell types, TGF-β inhibits growth and/or induces apoptosis, but these cells may also lose their sensitivity and responsiveness to TGF-β because of loss of TGF-β or because of functional components of the TGF-β pathway that promote the development of cancer (10Markowitz S.D.

Recently we have reported loss of expression and mutations of Smad 2 and Smad 4 in human cervical cancer (21Maliekal T.T. Antony M.L. Nair A. Paulmurugan R. Karunagaran D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4889-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to understand the responsiveness of human cervical cancer cells to TGF-β. The results reveal variations among these cells and suggest that TGF-β enhances a proliferative pathway in HeLa but a growth inhibitory pathway in SiHa cells under the same conditions. The proliferative pathway in HeLa involves the activation of MAPKs, and this MAPK activation probably does not depend on Smad activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals, Reagents, and Antibodies—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and LipofectAMINE reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody to phospho-p42/44 MAPK (9910) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phospho-specific Smad 2 (566415) and U0126 were procured from Calbiochem, and SB203580 was purchased from Alexis Corporation. The p3TP-lux construct was a generous gift from Dr. P. Kondaiah, IISc, Bangalore, and pSBE4-BV/Luc was a generous gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center Molecular Genetics Laboratory. The plasmid pRL/CMV, the dual luciferase assay kit (E 1910), and RNase A were purchased from Promega.Cell Culture and Luciferase Assay—Human cervical cancer cell lines were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells (3 × 104) were transfected with the reporter plasmid and the pRL/CMV plasmid in 100:1 ratio using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After overnight transfection, the cells were allowed to recover for 10 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were treated with or without TGF-β (5 ng/ml) in serum-free medium for 16 h. Luciferase assay was performed using the dual luciferase assay reagent (E-1910) following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Bioluminescence was measured using a Turner Designs luminometer (TD-20/20) from Promega.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared essentially as reported earlier (22Anto R.J. Maliekal T.T. Karunagaran D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15601-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the binding reaction mixture (containing 0.5 ng of oligonucleotide labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase, 10 μg of nuclear extracts in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) was incubated for 1 h on ice, and appropriate antibodies were included before incubation for supershift assays. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 4% PAGE containing 2.5% glycerol with 0.25× Tris borate ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The gels were dried and exposed on a phosphorimaging screen (Bio-Rad) for 1 h for visualization.MTT Assay—Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well) and treated with or without TGF-β in serum-free medium. MTT was added (25 μl of 5 mg/ml stock) and incubated for 2 h. The formazan crystals formed were solubilized in MTT lysis solution (20% SDS in 50% formamide) for 4 h, and the absorbance was measured in a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad) at 570 nm.Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were seeded (1 × 106 cells) in 60-m Petri plates, treated with or without TGF-β for 24 h, and trypsinized and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at –20 °C overnight. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 μg/ml of RNase, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were stained with 25 μg/ml of propidium iodide for 15 min. The cell suspensions were then analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyzer. Only the single cells were included in the analysis.Immunofluorescence—Monolayer cells were cultured on coverslips and treated with or without TGF-β for 24 h. Monolayer was fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X 100, and then treated with anti-phospho-Smad 2 for 4 h at 37 °C. Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody was treated for 45 min, and the cells were visualized under UV light.Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar) using an antibody to phospho-p42/44 MAPK; p42 MAPK antibody was used as the control. Appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and the blot was developed using chemiluminescence luminol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTGF-β responsiveness of human cervical cancer cell lines was assessed with a reporter assay using p3TP-lux containing multiple response elements from the promoter of plasminogen activator inhibitor, which include the SBE and three phorbol ester-responsive elements (24Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) that together mediate optimal activation by TGF-β (25Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon treatment with TGF-β, the response (expressed as -fold activation of luciferase over untreated control) was high in HeLa (5.5-fold) followed by SiHa (4.2-fold), whereas Bu 25TK, C-33A, Ca Ski, and ME-180 cells were relatively less responsive to TGF-β (Fig. 1A). When a Smad 4-activated transcriptional reporter with four SBEs (pSBE4-BV/Luc) was used to check the involvement of Smads alone in TGF-β responsiveness, it was very high in SiHa cells, whereas others, including HeLa, were relatively less responsive (Fig. 1B). Thus, both SiHa and HeLa cells were sensitive to the p3TP-lux reporter assay, whereas SiHa, but not HeLa, cells were sensitive to TGF-β with pSBE4-BV/Luc. Loss of responsiveness to TGF-β in some of the human cervical cancer cell lines observed in the present study is consistent with earlier reports in pancreatic (27Jonson T. Albrechtsson E. Axelson J. Heidenblad M. Gorunova L. Johansson B. Hoglund M. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 71-81PubMed Google Scholar), head and neck (11Muro-Cacho C.A. Rosario-Ortiz K. Livingston S. Munoz-Antonia T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1618-1626PubMed Google Scholar), and colon cancers (28Miyaki M. Iijima T. Konishi M. Sakai K. Ishii A. Yasuno M. Hishima T. Koike M. Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunomiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), but it appears to be a rare event in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (29Osawa H. Shitara Y. Shoji H. Mogi A. Kuwano H. Hagiwara K. Takenoshita S. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 723-728PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of sensitivity to TGF-β observed in Bu25TK, C-33A, CaSki, and ME-180 may be because of the loss of function of any of the components of the TGF-β pathway; in addition, intragenic deletions of TβRII were reported in ME-180 and C-33A (17Kang S.H. Won K. Chung H.W. Jong H.S. Song Y.S. Kim S.J. Bang Y.J. Kim N.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Chu T.Y. Lai J.S. Shen C.Y. Liu H.S. Chao C.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, TGF-β has been shown to induce the expression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor gene in SiHa and HeLa cells (17Kang S.H. Won K. Chung H.W. Jong H.S. Song Y.S. Kim S.J. Bang Y.J. Kim N.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in another study, SiHa cells were reported to be resistant to TGF-β because of a mutation in Smad 4 (19Lee S. Cho Y.S. Shim C. Kim J. Choi J. Oh S. Zhang W. Lee J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although we could not detect any mutations in Smad 2 or Smad 4 in SiHa cells (21Maliekal T.T. Antony M.L. Nair A. Paulmurugan R. Karunagaran D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4889-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Actual reasons for these contradictory results in SiHa cells are not clear, but accumulation of genetic variations within a cell line acquiring new characteristics is known to occur and the responsiveness to TGF-β depends on its concentration (30James G.K. Kalousek D.K. Auersperg N. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1989; 38: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To analyze the involvement of Smad activation in TGF-β response, DNA binding ability of Smads in the presence and absence of TGF-β was then examined in human cervical cancer cells by EMSA using 32P-labeled SBE. TGF-β enhanced the DNA binding activity of Smads more prominently in SiHa than Ca Ski, Bu 25TK, and HeLa, whereas no activation could be observed in C-33A and ME-180 (Fig. 2A). To know whether the active complexes that bound SBE actually contained Smads, nuclear extracts from SiHa cells treated with TGF-β (that showed maximum DNA binding activity) were incubated with antibodies to Smad 2 or Smad 4 while carrying out EMSA. Both the antibodies shifted the active complex (supershift), slowing down its migration in the gel, suggesting that it contains Smad 2 and Smad 4 (Fig. 2B). Together these results show that human cervical cancer cells vary in their response to TGF-β, indicating the existence of defective TGF-β signaling in some cervical cancer cells. These results also suggest that even though HeLa cells respond to TGF-β, the activation of Smads is minimal in these cells. It is possible that the induction observed with p3TP-lux reporter construct by TGF-β in HeLa cells may be independent of the activation of Smads. The negligible stimulation of pSBE4-BV/Luc that contains four SBEs by TGF-β in HeLa cells suggests that because Smads are either inadequate or not essential for TGF-β response, additional factors are necessary. It is also to be noted that the DNA binding activity of Smads in HeLa upon TGF-β treatment is relatively less than that of SiHa cells.Fig. 2Changes in the DNA binding ability of Smads induced by TGF-β in human cervical cancer cells and the nature of the active Smad DNA binding complex in SiHa cells. A, human cervical cancer cells were treated with (+) or without (–) 10 ng/ml TGF-β for 1 h, and EMSA was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, supershift assay showing nuclear extracts from SiHa cells (15 μg) that were treated with or without TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 1 h and incubated with the indicated antibody (2 μg) or unlabeled oligo. EMSA was performed as above. The position of the active band is indicated with an asterisk. Arrows indicate the supershift. Results shown were confirmed in two other independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because HeLa and SiHa cells differed in their response to TGF-β when assessed by EMSA and two different reporter assays, it was decided to analyze their growth response to TGF-β (5 or 10 ng/ml) by MTT assay for different time intervals (24, 48, and 72 h). In HeLa cells at 24 h, 5 ng/ml of TGF-β induced proliferation (110 ± 2.1%), but at 10 ng/ml it inhibited cell growth (95 ± 2.1%). The viability decreased at other time points although more effectively at 48 than 72 h with both the concentrations of TGF-β (Fig. 3A). TGF-β decreased the viability in SiHa cells at all the time periods of the study, but the effect was maximum at 24 h for both the concentrations (85 ± 2.5 and 84 ± 0.5% over control for 5 and 10 ng/ml, respectively) (Fig. 3A). To get a better picture of TGF-β-mediated changes in growth, the changes in cell cycle stages were analyzed with and without TGF-β; to understand the involvement of Smads, a chemical inhibitor of Smads (SB203580) was used (32Fu Y. O'Connor L.M. Shepherd T.G. Nachtigal M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, 68.2% of HeLa cells were at G0/G1 -phase, 13.3% at S-phase, and 18.4% at G2/M-phase, but only 56% of TGF-β-treated HeLa cells were at G0/G1-phase. Treatment with SB203580 did not have much effect either alone or if given before TGF-β treatment. In the case of untreated SiHa cells, 72.6% were at G0/G1-phase, 9.8% at S-phase, and 12.8% at G2/M-phase, and treatment with TGF-β induced a G0/G1 arrest in SiHa cells (85%) and subsequent reduction in S-phase (4.9%) (Fig. 3B). As in HeLa, SB203580 treatment alone did not cause any significant change in cell cycle phases of SiHa cells, but pretreatment with SB203580 almost reversed TGF-β-induced changes in G0/G1- (75.5%) and S-phase (8.5%) (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that TGF-β-induced growth responses differ between SiHa and HeLa cells and that TGF-β-induced response in HeLa could not be blocked by SB203580, whereas the same compound blocked the growth arrest induced by TGF-β in SiHa cells. To confirm the role of Smads in these differential TGF-β-induced responses, localization of phospho-Smad 2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence with or without TGF-β treatment or SB203580 pretreatment. The untreated and SB203580-treated SiHa cells showed 16 and 12.8% nuclear positivity, respectively. In the SB203580-treated cells, accumulation on the nuclear membrane was observed in several cells, indicating a blockade of nuclear translocation. When the cells were treated with TGF-β, the intensity as well as the nuclear positivity for phospho-Smad 2 increased (68.6%); the nuclear localization was blocked when the cells were treated with TGF-β after SB203580 treatment (17%) (Fig. 3C). HeLa cells showed basal nuclear positivity for phospho-Smad 2 (18%), and this was unaffected in SB203580-treated cells. Upon TGF-β treatment, the nuclear accumulation increased to 30.3%. SB203580 treatment could also inhibit the TGF-β-induced nuclear translocation (14%) of Smads in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, in SiHa cells TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition depends on the nuclear accumulation of activated Smads. In HeLa cells the cell cycle progression induced by TGF-β is presumably independent of Smad activation because the use of SB203580 did not alter the TGF-β-induced decrease in G0/G1-phase cells, although the marginal Smad activation induced by TGF-β was completely blocked by this compound. Even though a small fraction of the HeLa cells showed a nuclear accumulation of activated Smads, the effects exerted by TGF-β on cell cycle do not seem to depend on this activation of Smads as the inhibition of Smads with SB 203580 did not alter the decrease in the percentage of cells at G0/G1. Thus, in HeLa cells at least in the initial stages, a TGF-β-dependent pathway is activated that probably does not require Smad activation. Without a functional Smad 4 gene, VACO-235, a colon cancer cell line, exhibited TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition as well as activation of p3TP-lux reporter, but not pSBE4-BV/Luc (33Fink S.P. Swinler S.E. Lutterbaugh J.D. Massague J. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 256-260PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible Smad-independent pathway in this cell line. Growth inhibitory responses to TGF-β appear to be transactivated, at least in part, by a Smad 4-independent pathway (34Dai J.L. Schutte M. Bansal R.K. Wilentz R.E. Sugar A.Y. Kern S.E. Mol.

The results from EMSA indicate that EGF, used as a positive control, induced DNA binding activity of AP-1 in HeLa and SiHa cells, whereas TGF-β enhanced it in HeLa cells, but not SiHa cells (Fig. 4A). Western blot for phospho-p42/p44 MAPK shows that activation occurred within 5 min in HeLa cells and persisted up to 15 min upon TGF-β treatment, whereas the activation in SiHa cells was negligible (Fig. 4B). Changes in JNK activation were also analyzed by Western blot using phospho-JNK antibody. After 10 min of TGF-β activation, there was up-regulation of phospho-JNK in HeLa, but SiHa cells showed a down-regulation of its activity at the same time. These results suggest that TGF-β activates MAPK pathway and DNA binding activity of AP-1 more effectively in HeLa, but not SiHa, cells. Cell viability was determined to confirm the role of MAPKs and Smads in TGF-β response with and without specific blockers of p42/44MAPK (U0126) (38Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F.

https://openalex.org/W2089249571,"We show herein that removal of the first 86 amino acids (aa) of the N terminus (designated N) of type VI adenylyl cyclase (ACVI) caused the resultant ACVI mutant (ACVI-ΔA87) to be more greatly inhibited by a Gαi-coupled receptor or activated Gαi protein. Moreover, invitro binding of the full-length N and C1a domain (designated C1a), which interacts with Gαi, was detected. A truncated N terminus (aa 1–86) also interacted with C1a, suggesting that the C1a-interacting region is located within aa 1–86. Mutation analyses further revealed that N might interact with C1a in the region (aa 434–505) where Gαi is bound. Mutations of two residues (Leu-472 and Val-476) located in this N-binding region of C1a suppressed the interaction between recombinant N and C1a and markedly reduced Gαi-mediated inhibition of ACVI-ΔA87. Further biochemical analyses of the effect of internal mutations of Leu-472/Val-476 on Gαi-mediated inhibition of wild-type ACVI and ACVI-ΔA87 suggested that N modulates the Gαi-mediated inhibition of ACVI via binding to C1a when the level of Gαi is low (i.e. around the IC50 value) and that a more complicated interfering mode results when the level of Gαi is high (i.e. ∼10- to 20-fold of the IC50 value).

The mammalian adenylyl cyclase (AC) 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; ACVI, type VI adenylyl cyclase; PKC, protein kinase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; H6, hexahistidine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); aa, amino acid(s); D2s-R, dopamine D2 receptor; CHOP, Chinese hamster ovary cell expressing the polyoma large T antigen; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; Quin, quinpirole; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor. superfamily consists of nine membrane-bound isoforms. All of these possess three large cytosolic domains (designated N, C1a, and C2 domains; Fig. 1A), which are separated by two sets of six-transmembrane domains (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G.

The C1a and C2 domains among the nine AC members are highly homologous (with 50–90% similarity in amino acids). In addition, the C1a and C2 domains of each AC share ∼50% similarity and form the catalytic core complex, which can be stimulated by forskolin or Gαs proteins (4Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W.

Crystallographic analysis of the catalytic complex consisting of the C1a domain, the C2 domain, and the GTPγS-bound Gαs protein revealed that forskolin and/or Gαs stimulate ACs by enhancing the interaction between the C1a and C2 domains and by stabilizing the C1a-C2 catalytic core complex (7Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Although most ACs can be activated by Gαs and forskolin, regulation of each AC isozyme differs. Studies of the more-variable N and C1b domains reveal that these two domains may play important regulatory roles. For example, the C1b domain has been implicated in the regulation of AC isozymes mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin, calcineurin, or protein kinase A (8Levin L.R. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Cali J.J. Parekh R.S. Krupinski J. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the C1b domain of ACV and ACVII has been shown to modulate Gαs-evoked activation by interacting with catalytic core complexes (12Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Yan S.Z. Beeler J.A. Chen Y. Shelton R.K. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Others and we have shown that another variable region, the N-terminal domain, also significantly contributes to the regulation of AC activity (14Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Gu C. Cooper D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specifically, the N-terminal domain of ACVI (amino acids 1–160) plays an important role in the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated inhibition and phosphorylation of ACVI (14Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Removal of the first 86 amino acids (aa) of ACVI reduced the inhibitory effect of PKC on ACVI activity without affecting the basic enzymatic properties, including the affinities toward its substrate and two stimuli (forskolin and Gαs protein (14Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). The N-terminal domain of ACVI therefore functions as a regulatory domain. Further biochemical analyses revealed that at least four PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser-10, Ser-568, Ser-674, and Thr-931), located in the three large cytosolic domains of ACVI, significantly contribute to PKC-mediated inhibition of ACVI (16Lin T.H.

Intramolecular interactions among the N, C1a/b, and C2 domains of ACVI therefore appear to be important for regulation of ACVI activity. Gαi-mediated inhibition is a major regulatory feature of the AC superfamily. Among AC members, only ACI, ACV, and ACVI can effectively be inhibited by Gαi proteins (17Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 18Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on results obtained from an in vitro binding assay, the C1a domain was shown to bind myristoylated Gαi proteins and form stable complexes (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Yigzaw Y. Stringfield T.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9551-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of full-length ACV in the α2 and α3 helices of the C1a domain revealed several residues important for the inhibition by Gαi proteins. It was postulated that Gαi may exert its inhibitory effect through binding to the C1a domain at the site just opposite the Gαs-binding site on the C2 domain and, subsequently, causes reduced interaction between the C1 and C2 domains (21Dessauer C.W. Chen-Goodspeed M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28823-28829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present evidence to suggest that the N-terminal domain of ACVI directly interacts with the C1a domain and may play an important role in the regulation of ACVI by Gαi proteins. Materials—Quinpirole (Quin) was obtained from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). Forskolin, cAMP, and ATP were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). MgCl2 and other chemicals were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfection—The CHOP cell line, which expresses the polyoma large T antigen, was originally derived from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line and was a generous gift from Dr. J. W. Dennis (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (22Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml Geneticin in 10% CO2 and 90% air. The cDNA of rat ACVI was kindly provided by Dr. R. Iyengar (Dept. of Pharmacology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York) (23Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Coding regions of rat ACVI variants were subcloned into an expression construct (pCEP4 or pcDNA3, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Expression of ACVI in transfected cells was driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene enhancer-promoter. The expression construct of the short form dopamine D2 receptor (D2s-R (24Huang C.L. Chen H.C. Huang N.K. Yang D.M. Kao L.S. Chen J.C. Lai H.L. Chern Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) was kindly provided by Dr. J.-C. Chen (Chang-Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan). For transient transfection experiments, CHOP cells were transfected with the desired construct using the DEAE-dextran method (25Wong Y.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection for analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Membrane fractions were separated on 8–15% separating gels according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following electrophoresis that were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated with the desired antiserum at 4 °C overnight. The polyclonal antibody, AC6D, was raised against aa 987–1187 (the C2 domain) of ACVI (27Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Typically, a 1:5000 dilution was used for AC6D unless stated otherwise. To determine if the recombinant Gαi1 proteins were myristoylated, 9% SDS-PAGE gels containing 4 m urea were employed (28Linder M.E. Pang I.H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as were Western blot analyses using an anti-Gαi1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:200 dilution. Then the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. The immunoreactive bands were stained using a light-emitting non-radioactive method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—AC activity was assayed as previously described (29Chern Y. Lai H.L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sonicated using a W-380 sonicator (Ul-trasonics, Farmingdale, NY) at a setting of 20% output power for a total of 90 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min to collect the P1 membrane fractions. Unless specifically addressed, the AC activity assay was performed at 37 °C for 10 min in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 unit of adenosine deaminase, 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 μm GTP, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 20 μg of membrane protein. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.6 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cAMP formed was isolated by Dowex chromatography (Sigma) and assayed by radioimmunoassay. The enzyme activity was linear for up to 30 min with membrane proteins up to 40 μg. The ACVI activity was determined as the difference between the cyclase activities measured in the membrane fractions collected from CHOP cells transfected with the indicated ACVI cDNA versus an empty vector (pcDNA3). For CHOP cells expressing wild-type ACVI, endogenous cyclase activities represented ∼40% of the total activity. The absolute values of ACVI activity observed in different transient transfection experiments might have slightly varied due to the passages of cells. Nevertheless, the overall pattern of AC regulation was consistent among experiments. Recombinant Gαs and Gαi Protein Expression—The expression construct (pQE60/H6-GαS) of the Gαs protein was a generous gift from Dr. W.-J. Tang (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). The hexahistidine (H6)-tagged Gαs protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified using Ni-NTA His·Bind® resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described elsewhere (30Yan S.Z. Huang Z.H. Andrews R.K. Tang W.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To stimulate AC activity, the indicated concentration of Gαs protein was activated by GTPγS (20 μm) in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT for 20 min at 20 °C. The expression construct (pET11D-H6-Gαi1) of the Gαi protein was constructed by subcloning an XhoI/BamHI fragment encoding full-length human Gαi1 from the pCDNA3.1+-Gαi1 construct (Guthrie cDNA Resource Center, Sayre, PA) into the corresponding sites of a H6-tagged pET11d vector (Novagen). The Gαi protein with an H6 tag fused to its N terminus was expressed in E. coli harboring a yeast protein, N-myristoyltransferase (28Linder M.E. Pang I.H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was purified using Ni-NTA His·Bind® resin (Novagen) as described elsewhere (32Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The expression construct of N-myristoyltransferase was a generous gift from Dr. Tohru Kozasa (Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL). To inhibit AC activity, the indicated concentration of Gαi protein was activated by GTPγS (400 μm) in the presence of 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 2 h. Free GTPγS was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) with a washing buffer containing 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. PCR Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction—Different lengths of DNA fragments encoding the C1a and N domains of ACVI were produced using the PCR technique. DNA amplification was carried out in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 0.2 mg of the desired primers, 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), a DNA template, and 2 units of DynaZyme™ thermostable DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) per 50 μl of reaction solution. The reactions proceeded for 40 PCR cycles. Primers utilized to create domains of ACVI (23Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) are listed in the section of Supplementary Materials (Table S1). The amplified DNA fragments were ligated to the C terminus of the H6 tag in the pET11d vector (Novagen; N1–160, N1–86, and C1a-2), or subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector using a TA expression kit (Invitrogen; C1a-1, C1a-3, C1a-4, and C1a-5). Nucleotide sequences in all constructs used were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The L472A/V476A-C1a mutant was created by a two-step PCR technique as described previously (33Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) with the following primers: 5′-CATATGATGGAAATGAAAGAGGAT-3′; 5′-GGATCCCTACTTCTCCTCTTTCCGTTT-3′; 5′-TGCCTCACGCACCGCCGAGATGGCCTCGATCAT-3′; and 5′-GCGGTGCGTGAGGCAACGGGTGTAAATGTGAAC-3′, with pVL1393-ACVI as the DNA template. The resultant DNA fragment, which encoded aa 364–575 of ACVI, contained double point mutations at L472A and V476A. The PCR product was then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector using the TA expression kit (Invitrogen). Mutations of L472A and V476A were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resultant construct was digested with SacI and Bsu36I and subcloned into the SacI/Bsu36I-digested pVL1393-ACVI construct to create the pVL1393-ACVI-L472A-V476A mutant construct. The eukaryotic expression construct (pcDNA3-ACVI-L472A-V476A) of the ACVI-L472A/V476A mutant protein was constructed by subcloning a BamHI/EcoRI fragment encoding ACVI-L472A-V476A from pVL1393-ACVI-L472A-V476A into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3. The ACVI-ΔA87-L472A-V476A mutant was created by subcloning the NheI/Bsu36I-digested pcDNA3-ACVI-L472A-V476A fragment containing the mutated residues (L472A and V476A) into the NheI/Bsu36I-digested pcDNA3-ACVI-ΔA87 construct. The ACVI-N5 mutant was also created by the two-step PCR technique using two ACV-specific primers (5′-GGATCCATGTCCGGCTCCAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GTGAGGCTGCTCTGGTTCAGGCGGAA-3′) and pVL1393-ACV (23Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as the DNA template and two ACVI-specific primers (5′-AACCAGAGCAGCCTCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-CTCCGCAGCCAGCTTGTCGAA-3′) and pVL1393-ACVI as the DNA template. The rat ACV was a generous gift from Dr. R. T. Premont (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The resultant PCR product encoded a fragment comprising the aa 1–244 of ACV fused to aa 161–430 of ACVI. This fragment was then digested with SacI and BamHI and subcloned into the SacI/BamHI-digested pVL1393-ACVI construct. pVL1393-ACVI-N5 was next digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3 vector to create the pcDNA3-ACVI-N5 construct. In Vitro Binding—The recombinant domains of ACVI were synthesized in vitro by the TnT®T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) using [35S]methionine (Amersham Bioscience) following the manufacturer's protocol. Percent incorporation was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating the TnT lysates containing the [35S]methionine-labeled recombinant proteins (8–12 fmol) in 50 μl of reaction buffer (1 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 30 °C. The complex was purified immunologically using antiserum against the N terminus of ACVI (AC6N (34Liu F.C. Wu G.C. Hsieh S.T. Lai H.L. Wang H.F. Wang T.W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), analyzed using 12.5% or 15% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. For the interaction between Gαi and the C1a domain, recombinant H6-tagged GTPγS-Gαi1 protein (10 μg) purified as described above was first bound to the Ni-NTA His·Bind® resin (10 μl, Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and then incubated with the TnT lysates containing the [35S]methionine-labeled C1a-1 proteins (12 fmol) in 200 μl of binding buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) for 2 h at 4 °C. The complexes bound on the Ni-NTA His·Bind® resins were washed with wash buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) three times and eluted with 20 μl of the sample treatment buffer. The complexes were analyzed using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, gels were cut into half based on the molecular weight markers. The halves of gels, which contained proteins larger than 30 kDa were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and levels of Gαi1 were analyzed using the Western blot analysis described above. The other halves of the gels, which contained proteins smaller than 30 kDa, were fixed and autoradiographed as described above. One important regulation for ACVI, which can be observed for only two other AC isozymes (ACI and ACV), is the inhibition mediated by Gαi proteins (17Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 18Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal domain is highly variable among AC isozymes, we set out to investigate the role of the N-terminal domain of ACVI in Gαi-mediated inhibition. The wild-type ACVI or an N terminus-truncated ACVI mutant, which lacks the first 1–86 aa and exhibits a smaller size in the SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis (ACVI-ΔA87; Fig. 2A (14Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), was co-expressed with a Gαi-coupled short form D2 dopamine receptor (D2s-R) in CHOP cells. AC assays were performed in the presence of forskolin (100 μm) at the indicated concentration of a D2s-R-selective agonist (quinpirole, Quin). As shown in Fig. 2B, inhibition of ACVI-ΔA87 by D2s-R stimulation was more significant than that of wild-type ACVI at high concentrations of Quin. This observation indicates that partial truncation of the N-terminal domain might cause ACVI to be more sensitive to Gαi-mediated inhibition. To verify this hypothesis, we next examined the inhibitory effect of myristoylated recombinant Gαi protein on the Gαs-evoked activities of wild-type ACVI and ACVI-ΔA87. Myristoylation of the recombinant Gαi1 protein produced in the presence of N-myristoyltransferase (28Linder M.E. Pang I.H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was verified by its faster mobility in 9% SDS-PAGE gels containing 4 m urea when compared with those of the unmodified Gαi1 proteins prepared in the absence of N-myristoyltransferase (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the above observation, inhibition of ACVI-ΔA87 by the myristoylated Gαi was much more significant than that of wild-type ACVI (Fig. 3B). No significant difference in the IC50 values of the activated/myristoylated Gαi for the wild-type and ACVI-ΔA87 was observed (16.6 and 21.5 nm, respectively). However, the extent of maximal inhibition of ACVI-ΔA87 by the activated/myristoylated Gαi was markedly higher than that of wild-type ACVI (71.5% and 46.4% for ACVI-ΔA87 and the wild-type ACVI, respectively) (Fig. 3B), further supporting a functional role of the N-terminal domain of ACVI in Gαi-evoked inhibition.Fig. 3Involvement of the N terminus of ACVI in the regulation of Gαi-mediated regulation.A, recombinant human Gαi1 proteins (0.1 μg) produced in the absence (–, left lane) or presence (+, right lane) of N-myristoyltransferase (28Linder M.E.

B, membrane fractions collected from CHOP cells transiently transfected with ACVI-WT or ACVI-ΔA87 were used for the AC activity assay. AC activity evoked by the activated Gαs protein (0.19 μm) was measured in the presence of activated/myristoylated recombinant Gαi1 protein (Gαi1) indicated concentrations. Values are at the expressed as percentages of Gαs-evoked ACVI activity measured in the absence of Gαi1 (146.2 ± 30.3 pmol/(min·mg) for wild-type (WT) ACVI and 108.7 ± 21.2 pmol/(min·mg) for ACVI-ΔA87) and represent the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. Differences between the Gαi1-mediated inhibition of Gαs-evoked AC activities of WT and those of ACVI-ΔA87 are statistically significant: *, p < 0.05, compared with WT at the indicated concentration (by Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next replaced the N-terminal domain of ACVI by that of type V adenylyl cyclase (ACV), the closest isozyme to ACVI in the AC superfamily. Except for the N-terminal domain, the C1a and C2 domains of ACV and ACVI are highly homologous (23Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Using a two-step PCR-based mutagenesis method, we replaced the N terminus (aa 1–160) of rat ACVI with the N terminus (aa 1–242) of rat ACV. The resultant mutant (designated ACVI-N5) exhibited a larger size than that of wild-type ACVI because of the longer N terminus it possessed (Fig. 4A). In line with our previous finding (14Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which suggested that the N terminus of ACVI does not contribute to the catalytic core complex, major enzymatic properties (i.e. Vmax and EC50 values of forskolin and Gαs protein) of ACVI-N5 were very similar to those of wild-type ACVI (Table I). In contrast, when co-expressed with D2s-R in CHOP cells, D2s-R-mediated inhibition of ACVI-N5 was much less effective at both low (10 nm) and high (10 μm) doses of a D2s-R agonist (Quin; Fig. 4B). Because replacement of the N terminus domain markedly altered its response to Gαi-mediated inhibition of ACVI, these results strengthened our hypothesis that the N terminus of ACVI plays an important role in Gαi-mediated inhibition.Table IEnzymatic properties of ACVI mutantsACVIGαs, EC50Forskolin, EC50Vmaxnmμmpmol/mg·minWT35.3 ± 9.615.0 ± 2.072.5 ± 15.4N551.5 ± 5.820.0 ± 4.8142.2 ± 37.4 Open table in a new tab Dessauer and colleagues (19Dessauer C.W.

It is therefore possible that the N terminus of ACVI might modulate Gαi-mediated inhibition by interacting directly with the C1a domain. We first prepared a C1a domain of ACVI (aa 364–587, designated C1a-1) which comprised the potential Gαi binding domain based on a previous study of ACV (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using an in vitro TnT translation system. As shown in Fig. 5A, interaction between C1a-1 and the activated/myristoylated Gαi protein, which harbored an H6 tag was demonstrated by an Ni-NTA resin pull-down assay. Thus, the C1a domain of ACVI, similar to ACV, bound to the Gαi protein. Moreover, recombinant C1a domains synthesized using this in vitro translation system appeared to exhibit the proper conformation. We next performed the in vitro binding analyses of the recombinant N (aa 1–160, designated N1–160) and the C1a-1 domain. Using an antibody that specifically interacts with the N-terminal domain of ACVI (34Liu F.C. Wu G.C. Hsieh S.T. Lai H.L. Wang H.F. Wang T.W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the C1a-1 fragment could be co-immunoprecipitated with N1–160 (Fig. 5B). Note that a smaller degradation protein sometimes appeared in the in vitro-translated C1a-1 preparation (Fig. 5B); we therefore constructed another C1a domain (aa 364–575, designated C1a-2) based on a previous study of ACV (7Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The C1a-2 protein comprises the predicted Gαi-interacting domain of ACVI as does the C1a-1 protein and"
