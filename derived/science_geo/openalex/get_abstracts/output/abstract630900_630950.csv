https://openalex.org/W2933304441,"The heterogeneity of small extracellular vesicles and presence of non-vesicular extracellular matter have led to debate about contents and functional properties of exosomes. Here, we employ high-resolution density gradient fractionation and direct immunoaffinity capture to precisely characterize the RNA, DNA, and protein constituents of exosomes and other non-vesicle material. Extracellular RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and other cellular proteins are differentially expressed in exosomes and non-vesicle compartments. Argonaute 1-4, glycolytic enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins were not detected in exosomes. We identify annexin A1 as a specific marker for microvesicles that are shed directly from the plasma membrane. We further show that small extracellular vesicles are not vehicles of active DNA release. Instead, we propose a new model for active secretion of extracellular DNA through an autophagy- and multivesicular-endosome-dependent but exosome-independent mechanism. This study demonstrates the need for a reassessment of exosome composition and offers a framework for a clearer understanding of extracellular vesicle heterogeneity."

Antibody blockade of PD-L1 can activate an anti-tumor immune response leading to durable remissions in a subset of cancer patients. Here, we describe an alternative mechanism of PD-L1 activity involving its secretion in tumor-derived exosomes. Removal of exosomal PD-L1 inhibits tumor growth, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Exosomal PD-L1 from the tumor suppresses T cell activation in the draining lymph node. Systemically introduced exosomal PD-L1 rescues growth of tumors unable to secrete their own. Exposure to exosomal PD-L1-deficient tumor cells suppresses growth of wild-type tumor cells injected at a distant site, simultaneously or months later. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies work additively, not redundantly, with exosomal PD-L1 blockade to suppress tumor growth. Together, these findings show that exosomal PD-L1 represents an unexplored therapeutic target, which could overcome resistance to current antibody approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2932352133,"Differentiation of proinflammatory CD4+ conventional T cells (Tconv) is critical for productive antitumor responses yet their elicitation remains poorly understood. We comprehensively characterized myeloid cells in tumor draining lymph nodes (tdLN) of mice and identified two subsets of conventional type-2 dendritic cells (cDC2) that traffic from tumor to tdLN and present tumor-derived antigens to CD4+ Tconv, but then fail to support antitumor CD4+ Tconv differentiation. Regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion enhanced their capacity to elicit strong CD4+ Tconv responses and ensuing antitumor protection. Analogous cDC2 populations were identified in patients, and as in mice, their abundance relative to Treg predicts protective ICOS+ PD-1lo CD4+ Tconv phenotypes and survival. Further, in melanoma patients with low Treg abundance, intratumoral cDC2 density alone correlates with abundant CD4+ Tconv and with responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Together, this highlights a pathway that restrains cDC2 and whose reversal enhances CD4+ Tconv abundance and controls tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2929827553,"Long-range (>10 μm) transport of electrons along networks of Geobacter sulfurreducens protein filaments, known as microbial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide range of globally important redox phenomena. These nanowires were previously thought to be type IV pili composed of PilA protein. Here, we report a 3.7 A resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure, which surprisingly reveals that, rather than PilA, G. sulfurreducens nanowires are assembled by micrometer-long polymerization of the hexaheme cytochrome OmcS, with hemes packed within ∼3.5-6 A of each other. The inter-subunit interfaces show unique structural elements such as inter-subunit parallel-stacked hemes and axial coordination of heme by histidines from neighboring subunits. Wild-type OmcS filaments show 100-fold greater conductivity than other filaments from a ΔomcS strain, highlighting the importance of OmcS to conductivity in these nanowires. This structure explains the remarkable capacity of soil bacteria to transport electrons to remote electron acceptors for respiration and energy sharing."

Using a combination of dynamic intravital imaging and confocal multiplex microscopy, we report here that tissue-resident macrophages rapidly sense the death of individual cells and extend membrane processes that sequester the damage, a process that prevents initiation of the feedforward chemoattractant signaling cascade that results in neutrophil swarms. Through this “cloaking” mechanism, the resident macrophages prevent neutrophil-mediated inflammatory damage, maintaining tissue homeostasis in the face of local cell injury that occurs on a regular basis in many organs because of mechanical and other stresses. Inflammation is a multicellular host response to infectious or physical tissue damage involving a complex, tightly orchestrated sequence of events. It begins with an initiation phase at the onset of infection or sterile cell injury during which chemoattractant signals promote immune cell recruitment, followed by propagation and enhancement of the initial hematopoietic cell response, and ending with the eventual resolution of the lesion through clearance of the inflammatory cells and repair of the underlying tissue damage. The latter resolution event may take place with or without scarring that can disrupt optimal tissue homeostasis and function (Medzhitov, 2008Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3929) Google Scholar). Neutrophils and recruited cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) play pivotal roles in this sequence of events, dominating the early infiltrate and providing a critical, fast-acting layer of innate defense. Inflammation, however, is not always beneficial to the host. Innate immune cell activation, particularly neutrophil function, is a contributing factor to different aspects of disease pathology (e.g., myocardial infarction, pneumonia) in both rodents and humans (Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2017Nicolás-Ávila J.A. Adrover J.M. Hidalgo A. Neutrophils in Homeostasis, Immunity, and Cancer.Immunity. 2017; 46: 15-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Rock et al., 2010Rock K.L.

Tissue destruction by neutrophils.N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar). The powerful weaponry neutrophils possess to combat pathogens can cause substantial collateral damage, which then amplifies further immune cell activation, loss of functional tissue, and eventual organ dysfunction (Brandes et al., 2013Brandes M. Klauschen F. Kuchen S. Germain R.N. A systems analysis identifies a feedforward inflammatory circuit leading to lethal influenza infection.Cell. 2013; 154: 197-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The capacity of the innate immune cellular response to increase tissue damage beyond that created by the inciting infection or lesion itself suggests that early checkpoints controlling the inflammatory response must be in place to counter unnecessary recruitment and secondary damage mediated by these effector cells. However, what such checkpoints might be and whether they operate merely to attenuate the magnitude or duration of otherwise typical neutrophil infiltration responses or might actually prevent such potentially tissue-damaging actions of the innate immune system remain largely unknown. Among the cells likely to play a central role in such putative regulatory activities are cells of the MPS. Macrophage transcriptional signatures are common in tissue samples from individuals or experimental animals with variety of disease processes (Murray, 2017Murray P.J. Macrophage Polarization.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, Wynn et al., 2013Wynn T.A. Chawla A. Pollard J.W. Macrophage biology in development, homeostasis and disease.Nature. 2013; 496: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). The MPS is comprised of macrophages resident in all tissues as well as migratory monocytes, which primarily circulate in the bloodstream and infiltrate tissues upon initiation of the inflammatory cascade, where they can become definitive macrophages (Geissmann et al., 2010Geissmann F. Manz M.G. Jung S. Sieweke M.H. Merad M. Ley K. Development of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.Science. 2010; 327: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Fate mapping studies have revealed a strong development component of this dichotomy: most resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are primarily of prenatal origin (yolk sac or fetal liver), whereas monocytes are continuously produced by definitive post-natal hematopoiesis (Ginhoux and Guilliams, 2016Ginhoux F. Guilliams M. Tissue-Resident Macrophage Ontogeny and Homeostasis.Immunity. 2016; 44: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Defects in the RTM compartment are often associated with developmental disorders and disruptions of physiological tissue equilibrium states (Gordon and Martinez-Pomares, 2017Gordon S. Martinez-Pomares L. Physiological roles of macrophages.Pflugers Arch. 2017; 469: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Okabe and Medzhitov, 2016Okabe Y. Medzhitov R. Tissue biology perspective on macrophages.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), highlighting the homeostatic functions executed by these macrophages, whereas circulating monocytes have long been implicated in the various aspects of the inflammatory cascade (Murray, 2018Murray P.J. Immune regulation by monocytes.Semin. Immunol. 2018; 35: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, how RTMs other than brain microglial cells directly respond to tissue damage has not been carefully explored, despite the probable contribution of such cells to the regulation of local inflammatory responses (Medzhitov, 2008Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3929) Google Scholar). In this study, we use high-resolution intravital as well as static multi-parameter in situ imaging techniques to examine the very early stages of inflammatory responses to sterile tissue damage. We identified a regulatory mechanism that involves tissue-sessile, interstitial RTMs acting as very local, dynamic first responders to small-scale (single-cell) tissue damage. By physically sequestering or “cloaking” pro-inflammatory debris, the RTMs actively prevented initiation of a previously defined neutrophil recruitment and swarming cascade (Lämmermann et al., 2013Lämmermann T. Afonso P.V. Angermann B.R. Wang J.M. Kastenmüller W. Parent C.A. Germain R.N. Neutrophil swarms require LTB4 and integrins at sites of cell death in vivo.Nature. 2013; 498: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), disrupting potential tissue-damaging inflammatory responses at the earliest possible stage. Failure of the RTM-mediated cloaking process led to unchecked local inflammatory responses, neutrophil swarms, and collateral tissue damage that required secondary containment of neutrophil-driven inflammation by recruited migratory monocytes. Thus, by cloaking tissue lesions, RTM set a tissue-specific critical threshold for innate immune cell activation, constituting a previously unrecognized immune checkpoint involving active prevention of steady-state inflammatory damage. Neutrophil congregation is a key feature of most peripheral inflammatory responses and follows distinctive dynamic patterns described as neutrophil swarming, which comprises the recruitment and collective directed movement of inflammatory neutrophils toward a focus in response to the prior activation of one or more “leading” neutrophils (Lämmermann et al., 2013Lämmermann T. Afonso P.V. Angermann B.R. Wang J.M. Kastenmüller W. Parent C.A. Germain R.N. Neutrophil swarms require LTB4 and integrins at sites of cell death in vivo.Nature. 2013; 498: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, Ng et al., 2011Ng L.G. Qin J.S. Roediger B. Wang Y.

To study regulatory pathways orchestrating this activation in greater detail in vivo, we developed an intravital imaging platform involving the peritoneal wall (Figure S1A; Video S1A). The peritoneal serosa provided a useful site with a clear anatomical structure (Figure S1B; Video S1B) along with minimal optical and physical barriers, enabling in-depth, high-resolution imaging of inflammation and cell recruitment kinetics. This model also permitted topical application of small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies for in situ labeling of cells (Figures S1C and S1D). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4YWUxNDI0OTVkZTE0YTMxZWNmNDdlZmE1Yjc2NDhlNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4OTQ4MTQ2fQ.K9yAad98B2nNwo2s4d0ebO1UGYyoVadJWfilBZPpxZdFbyXDX7kjeO76ayjKRRsUa_QJgSItMV7MsWdYjCNIhx0iprQubZxaznYh6tjYXhm6qQoDdS2-N5rIhP_bNe9NI_k1wcbwzU5eEKxmWpqm8B2jQ2zNlAXn5wySVUxVOVdaYTwlTsqMtXG1-zH89z_mHsyVKZcXP5gKOQiPF5Mi418fmzZA_OKPcmT5Z350AT_t1o1tG_m9UIVLp8YHp591fppXSDItTJsBDpYRSo1fqE5U-sq-op-KVWiarnGBiMHHAj1Zz1g1Zjfw_6wVbsiuaKVg0DZOOuRk9AerXT6-Mw Download .mp4 (13.8 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

B) 3D surface reconstruction of anatomical structures of the visceral abdominal wall. See Figure S1B. C) Intravital visualization of neutrophil (magenta = LysM) swarming dynamics in response to bacteria (white = Salmonella). See Figure S1E. To record extravascular neutrophil dynamics, we topically applied chemokines to attract neutrophils into the peritoneum, leading to accumulation within 40–60 min. As expected, neutrophils displayed strong swarming behavior in response to both pathogens (Figure S1E; Video S2A) and sterile laser-induced damage (Figure 1A; Video S2B). In both cases, cells followed sequential activation patterns (Videos S2C and S2D); the neutrophils first approaching the damage site displayed exploratory movements (Figure 1B), followed by one or more of the cells undergoing terminal activation upon direct contact with the debris. This event was marked by distinct morphological changes and nuclear uptake of propidium iodide, consistent with cell death (Figure 1B; Figures S1F and S1G). This activation was subsequently followed by the attraction of a large number of activated neutrophils, which now directly targeted the damage, migrating in a very directed manner from many cell diameters away from the lesion site and displaying clear swarming behavior at the site of damage (Figures 1B and 1C; Figures S1G–S1I). Examining the site of neutrophil swarming using auto-fluorescence and second harmonic signals over time revealed the destructive potential of this process. The recruited and aggregating neutrophils broke down the coagulated tissue but also expanded the primary damage to initially unaffected healthy tissue with disruption and partial destruction of collagen fibers. The result was substantial local collateral tissue damage because of the swarming response (Figure 1D; Video S2E). These features were all consistent with prior studies in a sterile injury model in mouse ear skin (Lämmermann et al., 2013Lämmermann T. Afonso P.V. Angermann B.R. Wang J.M. Kastenmüller W.

I) Comparison of representative IVM-derived tracking data of pre-recruited (left) and endogenously recruited (right) neutrophils at a microlesion, respectively. Video starts as soon as neutrophils enter the imaging field. See Figures 1H and 1I. Given the damage imposed by neutrophil responses to cell injury, we asked whether there existed discriminatory thresholds for neutrophil activation that would prevent such undesirable responses by impeding unnecessary swarming. In particular, we considered whether the accidental, non-apoptotic death of single cells, which might well be a frequent event in various tissue sites because of mechanical or other stresses (e.g., in muscles or at pleural or visceral serosal surfaces), could be prevented from routinely eliciting an inflammatory response that might contribute to progressive organ injury. To simulate such individual necrotic cell death, we scaled down the size of the laser-induced lesion to the single-cell level (microlesion; Figures S2A–S2D). In an initial series of experiments, we used chemoattractants to pre-elicit neutrophil migration into the tissue so that they were present at the time the stromal lesion was initiated by the laser pulse. Such extravascular neutrophils engaged in direct contact with the exposed debris (Figures S2E and S2F; Data S1), displaying the same terminal activation patterns (Figure S2G; Video S2F) and subsequent swarming dynamics at microlesions (Figure 1E, top) as seen with macrolesions (Figure 1E, bottom; Figure S2H; Video S2G). Likewise, such swarming at a microlesion eventually resulted in similar collateral damage to cellular and acellular stromal components of the tissue (Figure 1F; Figure S2I; Video S2H). Extravascular neutrophils able to rapidly access cell debris thus appeared to respond in an all-or-nothing fashion, showing similar swarming dynamics at both macro- and microlesions. A fundamental mechanistic concept of swarming is the secretion of secondary mediators (e.g., LTB4) by activated neutrophils, which act in a signaling relay mode to promote recruitment of inflammatory cells over longer distances within the tissue (Afonso et al., 2012Afonso P.V. Janka-Junttila M. Lee Y.J. McCann C.P. Oliver C.M. Aamer K.A. Losert W. Cicerone M.T. Parent C.A. LTB4 is a signal-relay molecule during neutrophil chemotaxis.Dev.

Germain R.N. Neutrophil swarms require LTB4 and integrins at sites of cell death in vivo.Nature. 2013; 498: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We thus sought to study not only the behavior of pre-elicited neutrophils but to adapt our experimental setup to capture the endogenous response to the damage. Induction of a macrolesion in naive, untreated tissue reliably drove recruitment of neutrophils within the first hour, showing delayed but similar terminal activation patterns and swarming as seen with pre-elicited neutrophils (Figure 1G; Video S2I). However, compared with the dynamics of pre-recruited neutrophils (Figure 1H, top), the endogenous response at small microlesions differed considerably (Figure 1H, bottom; Video S2J): Neutrophils were still attracted to the site of damage but mostly displayed exploratory wandering movements and failed to undergo terminal inflammatory activation or induce swarming (Figure 1I; Figure S2J). To understand why endogenously recruited neutrophils, in contrast to pre-elicited extravascular neutrophils, failed to swarm at microlesions, we investigated the dynamic behavior of other cells in the tissue. Embedded among fibroblasts, we found a large population of evenly distributed RTMs (Figure 2A; Figure S3A; Data S2A) that were non-migratory but whose cellular processes exhibited a continuous sampling and endocytosis behavior (Figure S3B; Video S3A). Within 1–3 min of damage induction, however, RTMs quickly sent out multiple spreading pseudopods toward the lesion while still remaining sessile and fixed in position with respect to the main cell body (Figure 2B; Video S3B).Figure S3RTM Population Dynamics Determine Cloaking Capacity, Related to Figures 2 and 3 and Video S3Show full caption(A) Representative (n > 5) confocal overview image showing RTM (green = CD169) embedded in a stromal tissue network (blue = CD34).

https://openalex.org/W2935272799,"During autophagy, vesicle dynamics and cargo recruitment are driven by numerous adaptors and receptors that become tethered to the phagophore through interactions with lipidated ATG8/LC3 decorating the expanding membrane. Most currently described ATG8-binding proteins exploit a well-defined ATG8-interacting motif (AIM, or LC3-interacting region [LIR]) that contacts a hydrophobic patch on ATG8 known as the LIR/AIM docking site (LDS). Here we describe a new class of ATG8 interactors that exploit ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-like sequences for high-affinity binding to an alternative ATG8 interaction site. Assays with candidate UIM-containing proteins together with unbiased screens identified a large collection of UIM-based ATG8 interactors in plants, yeast, and humans. Analysis of a subset also harboring ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domains revealed a role for UIM-directed autophagy in clearing non-functional CDC48/p97 complexes, including some impaired in human disease. With this new class of adaptors and receptors, we greatly extend the reach of selective autophagy and identify new factors regulating autophagic vesicle dynamics."

These results will improve reproducibility and stimulate further progress in exRNA biomarker development. The discovery of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in biofluids has sparked considerable interest in their biological functions and potential clinical applications. Diagnostic, prognostic, and theranostic exRNA biomarkers have been reported for a variety of diseases. However, few have been validated across studies, likely due to methodological differences among studies, including differences exRNA isolation and measurement techniques. A comprehensive understanding of the variability associated with these procedures is therefore a prerequisite for improving the reproducibility of exRNA biomarker studies. Multiple sources of heterogeneity influence the exRNA profiles obtained from biofluid samples. Most biofluids contain exRNAs derived from multiple cell types and even multiple tissues. Therefore, biological variables, such as the age, fitness, and state of individual organs may impact exRNA profiles. In addition, exRNAs can be associated with different carrier subclasses, including ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs), lipoprotein complexes (LPPs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Skog et al., 2008Skog J.

Systematic investigations to identify differences among exRNA isolation and measurement techniques would address this variability and improve the reproducibility of studies in this field. This collaborative study involving six laboratories in phase 1 of the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium (ERCC1) focused on exRNA isolation, while other ERCC1 studies compared exRNA profiling methods (Giraldez et al., 2018Giraldez M.D. Spengler R.M.

Gene expression profiling of different tissues using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has allowed investigators to examine cellular processes in health and disease in unprecedented detail. Although standard RNA-seq methods perform poorly on exRNA samples, small RNA-seq has been successfully used to profile exRNA isolated using several methods from different biofluids (Burgos et al., 2013Burgos K.L.

Small RNA-seq thus offers the possibility of unbiased discovery of disease-specific exRNA biomarkers. Recent studies demonstrating the generally high intra- and interlab reproducibility of commonly used small RNA-seq methods on exRNA and other low-input samples (Giraldez et al., 2018Giraldez M.D. Spengler R.M.

Shah R.V. et al.Evaluation of commercially available small RNASeq library preparation kits using low input RNA.BMC Genomics. 2018; 19: 331Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), as well as the popularity of small RNA-seq for exRNA biomarker studies, led us to focus on small RNA-seq as the primary readout for this study. The utility of exRNA profiling for biomarker discovery or for mechanistic studies is critically dependent on the notion that the effects of biological variables will not be obscured by variability from technical factors, such as those arising from exRNA isolation or analysis. Another key assumption is that candidate exRNA biomarkers will be efficiently isolated and measured by the methods employed, without significant variance across replicates or among test sites. Here, we report results from a comprehensive and rigorous study encompassing many of the available exRNA isolation methods on standardized samples of five biofluids across multiple test sites. Our studies reveal that exRNA carrier subclasses are preferentially enriched by specific isolation methods. We further characterize the success rate and reproducibility of each exRNA isolation method for each biofluid and provide an interactive web-based tool that investigators can use to select the optimal methodology for their study. We hope that our findings will inform future studies in exRNA biology, aid in improving the rigor and reproducibility of exRNA analyses, and smooth the path to discovery and application of disease-specific exRNAs as clinically relevant biomarkers. Standardized biofluid samples were used for exRNA isolation experiments (Figure S1). To avoid potential artifacts arising from interindividual differences, pooled samples of plasma, serum, and urine from 10 female or 10 male individuals were included. Bile was collected from three donors with suspected cholangiocarcinoma (P1–P3) and one healthy adult donor (P4). Cell culture conditioned medium (CCCM) was collected from three cell types in three labs: human embryonic stem cells (hESCs, Lab5), primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs, Lab2), and human cholangiocarcinoma cells (KMBCs, Lab6). Standardized serum, plasma, and urine samples were collected by Lab5 and consisted of one female pool, one female individual, one male pool, and one male individual sample each. Multiple exRNA isolation methods were tested for each biofluid. Selection of the methods was based on compatibility with the biofluid type and volume per manufacturers’ protocols. Methods designed to isolate total exRNA include miRNeasy micro (QIAGEN, referred to as “miRNeasy”), miRCURY Biofluids (Exiqon, “Exiqon”), and plasma/serum exosome purification and exRNA isolation kit with/without RNA concentration using an Amicon 3K filter (Norgen Biotek, “Nor_Ami” and “Nor,” respectively). Methods with pre-enrichment of exRNA carriers were: precipitation—ExoQuick+Seramir (SBI, “ExoQuick”) and miRCURY Exosome (Exiqon, “miRCURY”), sequential membrane filtration (Millipore, “Millipore”), ultracentrifugation (“Ultra”), and affinity purification—ExoRNeasy (QIAGEN; “ExoRNeasy”) and ME (New England Peptide; “ME”). miRNeasy was used to isolate RNA from the material enriched by the ExoRNeasy, Millipore, Ultra, and ME methods. exRNA isolation was performed in triplicate at each participating lab (Figure S1). For bile (200 μL sample input volume), exRNA isolation was performed in one lab using five methods: ExoRNeasy, miRNeasy, Exiqon, Ultra, and Millipore. exRNA isolation from CCCM (4 mL input) was performed in three labs using four methods: ExoRNeasy, Ultra, Millipore, and ExoQuick. For serum and plasma (500 μL input), three exRNA isolation methods (ExoRNeasy, miRNeasy, Exiqon) were tested in four (plasma) or three (serum) labs, six methods (Nor, Nor_Ami, Ultra, Millipore, and ExoQuick) were tested in two labs, and one method (miRCURY) was tested in one lab. For urine (500 μL input), exRNA isolation was performed in one lab using six methods: ExoQuick, ExoRNeasy, miRNeasy, Homebrew, Millipore, miRNeasy, and Ultra. The RNA size distributions ascertained using the bioanalyzer RNA pico chip differed among biofluids (except for plasma and serum), exRNA isolation methods, and (for CCCM) source cell lines (Figure S2). All serum and plasma samples displayed a bimodal distribution, with shorter (<200 nt) RNAs predominating in ExoQuick and ExoRNeasy samples, longer (>200 nt) RNAs predominating in miRNeasy samples, and both peaks being well represented in Exiqon, Nor, and Nor_Ami samples. There was greater diversity in the RNAs size distributions for CCCM, with marked differences among both exRNA isolation methods and source cell lines but good reproducibility across labs. The overall yield of exRNA was higher for hESCs and NRVMs compared to KMBCs. The Millipore and ExoRNeasy methods favored isolation of shorter RNAs, while ExoQuick was more efficient at isolating longer RNAs, especially for hESC and NRVM. Ultra showed the most variable results, with mostly shorter RNAs in the samples from Lab2, both short RNAs and full-length 18S and 28S rRNAs from Lab5, and poor overall yield for Lab6. In urine, the RNA size distributions were similar, but the yields varied across methods, with ExoQuick, Ultra, and Millipore having lower yields than ExoRNeasy, miRNeasy and Homebrew. We measured exRNA concentrations using RiboGreen (Thermo-Fisher), but the results were variable and often showed undetectable levels of RNA, even for samples in which RNA was clearly detected by Bioanalyzer, qRT-PCR, and small RNA-seq. The use of RiboGreen for quantification of isolated exRNA is therefore not recommended by the investigators. Quantification of three miRNAs was performed: let-7a-5p (since let-7 miRNAs were reported to be selectively secreted in exosomes; Beltrami et al., 2017Beltrami C. Besnier M. Shantikumar S.

For bile, exRNA isolation was performed in a single lab, and the largest source of variability was sample donor (P1–P4), followed closely by exRNA isolation method, with variation among the three miRNAs being markedly lower. For CCCM, lab was the largest source of variability, distantly followed by target miRNA, exRNA isolation method, and source cell line. The serum and plasma qRT-PCR data were analyzed together in two ways. First, we included the variables biofluid type (serum versus plasma), exRNA isolation method, target miRNA, and lab; subsequently, we added sex and sample (individual versus pooled) as additional covariates. For both analyses, the largest source of variability was target miRNA, followed by lab and exRNA isolation method. For the first analysis, biofluid type contributed little to the variability in the data, and for the second analysis, biofluid type, sex, and sample made negligible contributions. For urine, exRNA isolation was performed in one lab, and the largest source of variability was isolation method, followed by sex of the biofluid donor, with target miRNA and sample making negligible contributions. The residual for urine was large (76.8%), indicating that most of the observed variability was not explained by known variables. These results showed that when examining qRT-PCR data on a small number of miRNAs, the exRNA isolation method was a substantial source of variability for all biofluids except CCCM. In all multi-lab experiments, the lab variable contributed significantly to variability. On detailed inspection of the data, we noted that the two labs that used the same qRT-PCR machine produced the most similar results. This observation suggested that the qRT-PCR process, rather than the exRNA isolation process, might have been the major source of lab-to-lab variability. For CCCM and serum/plasma, target miRNA was also an important source of variability, suggesting that the three miRNAs assayed may be carried in different compartments in these biofluids. However, we felt that rigorous assessment of exRNA carrier subclasses would require assessment of a larger number of miRNAs and thus proceeded to perform small RNA-seq on the exRNA samples. Since the lab-to-lab variability in qRT-PCR results might have arisen during exRNA measurement rather than exRNA isolation, we performed small RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing for all exRNA samples in one laboratory (Lab5). A subset of exRNA samples were selected for small RNA sequencing. For plasma, serum, and CCCM, all three replicate exRNA isolations from one lab and one replicate from each of the other labs were sequenced. Since sample type did not contribute to variability in the qRT-PCR data from plasma and serum, we focused on the pooled samples for these biofluids. For bile, samples from two out of four donors were analyzed, as insufficient material remained from the other two cases after the qRT-PCR experiments for small RNA-seq. For urine, all samples from the female and male pools, one female individual, and one male individual were analyzed. The NEBNext small RNA-seq library preparation kit was used for library construction. Metadata and summary small RNA-seq library statistics are provided in Table S2.1. The initial mapped miRNA dataset (Table S2.2) was processed through a series of filtering and normalization steps (Table S2.3–11), and the number of libraries passing each step was tracked (Table S2.12). We calculated the percent of reads mapped to these RNA biotypes: rRNA, miRNA, tRNA, piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), other GENCODE sequences, and unmapped reads (Figure 1) and compared the percent of each RNA biotype across methods within each biofluid type (Table S2.13–17). For bile, the %miRNA was significantly higher for Exiqon compared to all other methods, and %tRNA was significantly higher for P1 than P2. The distribution of RNA biotypes was similar among all cellular RNA samples, with a predominance of rRNA sequences. For CCCM, the %tRNA was significantly lower for Ultra than the other methods, and the %miRNA was higher for ExoQuick and Ultra than ExoRNeasy and Millipore. The distributions of RNA biotypes were similar between plasma and serum, with the miRNeasy and Ultra samples displaying significantly higher %rRNA compared to other methods and ME, Millipore, and miRCURY showing significantly lower %miRNA compared to Exiqon, ExoQuick, ExoRNeasy, miRNeasy, Nor, and Ultra. The urine libraries overall had a high %tRNA, with the ExoRNeasy and Ultra methods yielding the highest (but still quite low) %miRNA. For every exRNA isolation method and every biofluid, the miRNA complexity (number of miRNAs with ≥10 raw counts) positively correlated with total miRNA read count (Figure 2). For each biofluid, the complexity began to plateau at a characteristic miRNA read depth, with the number of detected miRNAs at this plateau differing among biofluids: 180 detected miRNAs at 900,000 total miRNA counts for bile, 250 miRNAs at 600,000 total miRNA counts for CCCM, 400 miRNAs at 2.5 million total miRNA counts for plasma, 350 miRNAs at 2.5 million total miRNA counts for serum, and 120 miRNAs at 100,000 total miRNA counts for urine. For bile, only the Exiqon libraries reached this plateau. An ideal exRNA isolation method would display high yield and reproducibility for miRNAs from the desired exRNA carrier subclass(es) in the selected biofluid. To assess the relative performance of the tested exRNA isolation methods, we scaled and filtered the data to account for differences in sequencing depth among libraries and then calculated five metrics (Table S3): complexity (number of different miRNAs detected), mean number of detected miRNAs, mean percentage of replicates in which a given miRNA was detected, percent coefficient of variance (%CV) across replicates, and a combined expression/reproducibility score, which we term the integrated quality score (IQS) (Figures 3 and S3). Since the number of miRNAs detected and the probability of it being expressed consistently across technical replicates is dependent on the average expression level, results were displayed according to mean miRNA expression level (expressed in reads per million [RPM] miRNA counts) for each biofluid and isolation method (Figures 3A–3F and S3A–S3O). For each biofluid/isolation method combination, the IQS for each miRNA is the sum of the mean expression quantile and the %CV quantile across exRNA isolation kits. The scores for both the mean expression quantile and the %CV quantile range from 1–5: 1 for lowest mean expression or highest %CV and 5 for highest mean expression or lowest %CV across all isolation methods that had measurable expression for a given miRNA. The IQS values were computed for miRNAs that had measurable expression in at least four methods. (Table S3). Thus, a higher IQS for a given isolation method indicates better analytical performance due to higher expression and higher reproducibility. By comparing the distribution of the IQS values among exRNA isolation methods (Figures 3G, 3H, and S3P–S3T), we can easily select the optimal method for isolation for either a targeted list of miRNAs or for all miRNA detected for the biofluid of interest. The ideal isolation method would have a marked left skew, indicating a higher proportion of miRNAs with higher expression and reproducibility. Calculation of the 75th percentile IQS (IQS75) as an indicator of the left skewness in combination with the complexity of each isolation method enables ranking of the performance each of the tested exRNA methods.Figure S3Complexity and Reproducibility of exRNA Isolation Methods for Bile, CCCM, Plasma, Serum, and Urine, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A, F, K, P) Bile, (B-D, G-I, L-N, Q-S) CCCM, and (E, J, O, T) urine.

Using these metrics, the findings for plasma and serum were similar, with ME, Millipore, miRCURY, miRNeasy, and Ultra displaying markedly lower complexity compared to the other methods (Figures 3A and 3B). For most methods, the number of expressed miRNAs decreased with increasing miRNA expression level, with the exception of the 0–10 RPM expression window, which generally contained fewer miRNAs compared to the 10–100 window (likely due to removal of miRNAs with <5 samples expressing at least 10 RPM during filtering; Table S2.6). The percent of miRNAs expressed among replicates was positively correlated with average expression level, except for the miRCURY kit in plasma, which showed 100% for all expression levels because there was only one pass-filter sample (Figures 3C and 3D). For Exiqon, ExoQuick, ExoRNeasy, and Nor, the %CV decreased with increasing expression, as expected (Figures 3E and 3F). ME, Millipore, miRCURY, Nor_Ami, and Ultra displayed a lower %CV in the 0–10 RPM window compared to the 10–100 RPM window, likely due to a higher number of zero values for low-expressed miRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2932386949,"Plants are sessile and have to cope with environmentally induced damage through modification of growth and defense pathways. How tissue regeneration is triggered in such responses and whether this involves stem cell activation is an open question. The stress hormone jasmonate (JA) plays well-established roles in wounding and defense responses. JA also affects growth, which is hitherto interpreted as a trade-off between growth and defense. Here, we describe a molecular network triggered by wound-induced JA that promotes stem cell activation and regeneration. JA regulates organizer cell activity in the root stem cell niche through the RBR-SCR network and stress response protein ERF115. Moreover, JA-induced ERF109 transcription stimulates CYCD6;1 expression, functions upstream of ERF115, and promotes regeneration. Soil penetration and response to nematode herbivory induce and require this JA-mediated regeneration response. Therefore, the JA tissue damage response pathway induces stem cell activation and regeneration and activates growth after environmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W2929496863,"Summary Normal tissues accumulate genetic changes with age, but it is unknown if somatic mutations promote clonal expansion of non-malignant cells in the setting of chronic degenerative diseases. Exome sequencing of diseased liver samples from 82 patients revealed a complex mutational landscape in cirrhosis. Additional ultra-deep sequencing identified recurrent mutations in PKD1, PPARGC1B, KMT2D, and ARID1A. The number and size of mutant clones increased as a function of fibrosis stage and tissue damage. To interrogate the functional impact of mutated genes, a pooled in vivo CRISPR screening approach was established. In agreement with sequencing results, examination of 147 genes again revealed that loss of Pkd1, Kmt2d, and Arid1a promoted clonal expansion. Conditional heterozygous deletion of these genes in mice was also hepatoprotective in injury assays. Pre-malignant somatic alterations are often viewed through the lens of cancer, but we show that mutations can promote regeneration, likely independent of carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2926894237,"Cell fate decisions are governed by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) that act in small populations of cells within developing embryos. To understand their functions in vivo, it is important to identify TF binding sites in these cells. However, current methods cannot profile TFs genome-wide at or near the single-cell level. Here we adapt the cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) method to profile TFs in low cell numbers, including single cells and individual pre-implantation embryos. Single-cell experiments suggest that only a fraction of TF binding sites are occupied in most cells, in a manner broadly consistent with measurements of peak intensity from multi-cell studies. We further show that chromatin binding by the pluripotency TF NANOG is highly dependent on the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in individual blastocysts but not in cultured cells. Ultra-low input CUT&RUN (uliCUT&RUN) therefore enables interrogation of TF binding from rare cell populations of particular importance in development or disease."

This work enables rational tuning of cell sensing while providing a framework to guide reprogramming of GPCR-based signaling in other systems. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are widely represented in most lifeforms and comprise the largest family of signaling proteins in humans, with over 800 members detecting structurally diverse agonists (Fredriksson et al., 2003Fredriksson R. Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.G. Schiöth H.B. The G-protein-coupled receptors in the human genome form five main families. Phylogenetic analysis, paralogon groups, and fingerprints.Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Their abundance and ubiquity to all cell types makes them one of the most important signaling pathway classes in healthcare but also one of the most complex (Marinissen and Gutkind, 2001Marinissen M.J.

Multiple types of G protein-based signaling are seen and the downstream signal transduction to activate gene expression is typically complex and intertwined with other pathways (Kenakin, 2013Kenakin T. New concepts in pharmacological efficacy at 7TM receptors: IUPHAR review 2.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 168: 554-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Neves, 2002Neves S.R. G Protein Pathways.Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The nature of signal transduction through the pathway also depends on many different factors, including the stoichiometry of the signaling proteins, the presence of inherent feedback mechanisms, and even cellular history (Selbie and Hill, 1998Selbie L.A. Hill S.J. G protein-coupled-receptor cross-talk: the fine-tuning of multiple receptor-signalling pathways.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Altogether, this makes it difficult to delineate receptor and signaling properties simply from measuring the activation of downstream targets (Prezeau et al., 2010Prezeau L. Rives M.-L. Comps-Agrar L. Maurel D. Kniazeff J. Pin J.-P. Functional crosstalk between GPCRs: with or without oligomerization.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2010; 10: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It also makes it a major challenge to predict how changes in the levels of pathway components, for example due to different environments or mutations, can affect the performance of a given signaling pathway. One of the most studied examples of eukaryotic GPCR signaling is the pheromone response pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bardwell, 2004Bardwell L. A walk-through of the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.Peptides. 2004; 25: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), having been the focus of significant efforts from systems biology to model its actions via quantification of its behavior (Yu et al., 2008Yu R.C.

Biol. 2008; 2: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To understand this pathway, researchers have parsed the contributions of numerous studies that have perturbed the dose-response and dynamics of the native system by changing growth conditions, by protein mutagenesis, via traditional gene overexpression and knockout methods, and more recently using optogenetics (Alvaro and Thorner, 2016Alvaro C.G.

Chem. 2016; 291: 7788-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Atay and Skotheim, 2017Atay O. Skotheim J.M. Spatial and temporal signal processing and decision making by MAPK pathways.J.

Real-Time Genetic Compensation Defines the Dynamic Demands of Feedback Control.Cell. 2018; 175: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). While these efforts have helped to build our best picture of the events required for the transduction of signal from agonist to gene activation, inability to control the whole pathway in these experiments has meant that a complete system for exploring the dose-response relationship has not yet been achieved (Atay and Skotheim, 2017Atay O. Skotheim J.M. Spatial and temporal signal processing and decision making by MAPK pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In silico approaches typically model a system by concentrating only on the key components and varying important parameters of these such as their expression levels, while removing other non-key interactions from consideration (Aldridge et al., 2006Aldridge B.B. Burke J.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Sorger P.K. Physicochemical modelling of cell signalling pathways.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, Kholodenko, 2006Kholodenko B.N. Cell-signalling dynamics in time and space.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). With advanced genome engineering and synthetic biology tools available, it now becomes possible to take an equivalent modeling approach in vivo, removing any non-essential interactions via gene knockout and finely tuning the expression of the key components using promoter libraries (Chan et al., 2005Chan L.Y. Kosuri S. Endy D. Refactoring bacteriophage T7.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2005; 1: 0018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Temme et al., 2012Temme K. Zhao D. Voigt C.A. Refactoring the nitrogen fixation gene cluster from Klebsiella oxytoca.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 7085-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This engineering approach—known as refactoring—makes a system easier to study by removing all non-essential natural regulation and feedback, thus enabling the system to be more efficiently tuned and directly measured. Effectively this generates cells streamlined for improved understanding of pathways and systems, while also making these cells more straightforward to utilize in downstream applications. Here, we used genome engineering to construct a heavily modified yeast suitable as an in vivo model for tuning GPCR signaling. By removing non-essential components, native transcriptional feedback regulation, and all connections to the mating response, we built a model strain retaining only the core signaling elements. In conjunction with a mathematical model, we used promoter libraries to vary the key components in this simplified, refactored pathway and uncovered principles for tuning the sensitivity, basal activity, and signal amplitude of the dose-response curve via expression level. This new knowledge provides us with a rational approach for tuning signaling characteristics and, as we demonstrate, enables us to quickly reprogram yeast to sense and measure a variety of different inputs, either in single-cell systems or community-based systems. Glucose sensing and the pheromone response pathway are the two native GPCR signaling pathways in S. cerevisiae (Versele et al., 2001Versele M. Lemaire K. Thevelein J.M. Sex and sugar in yeast: two distinct GPCR systems.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and the latter has long been the go-to choice for coupling heterologous GPCRs to yeast gene expression or for building systems for evolving GPCRs to desired targets (Dong et al., 2010Dong S. Rogan S.C. Roth B.L. Directed molecular evolution of DREADDs: a generic approach to creating next-generation RASSLs.Nat.

Functional analysis of heterologous GPCR signalling pathways in yeast.Trends Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Core to this pathway is an extensively studied mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade that functions with its own intrinsic feedback to maintain a robust input-output relationship in varying conditions (Chen and Thorner, 2007Chen R.E. Thorner J. Function and regulation in MAPK signaling pathways: lessons learned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1311-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Because this MAPK cascade displays a graded, linear response with respect to dose and can be considered as a black-box processing unit in transduction through the pathway (Bashor et al., 2008Bashor C.J.

Graded mode of transcriptional induction in yeast pheromone signalling revealed by single-cell analysis.Yeast. 2001; 18: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we chose to make this natural system the core from which we build and tune GPCR signaling pathways. Keeping the five genes of the MAPK cascade fixed, we set out to generate a model strain for our work by first removing all other GPCR pathway-related genes from S. cerevisiae (Figure 1). This required making precise changes at 18 genomic loci in BY4741 yeast, generating our model strain, yWS1922, via nine rounds of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing (Figures S1A–S1C). Genomic changes were validated at each round by PCR and locus sequencing followed by long-read nanopore sequencing of the final strain (Figures S1D and S1E).Figure S1Cell Line Development, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A-C) Strategy for engineering the GPCR model strains.(A) To generate the 15 gene KOs in Figure 1D, double strand breaks (DSBs) were generated between the start and stop codon of the ORF of each gene using CRISPR/Cas9. Donor DNA was provided as a template for homology-directed repair (HDR), comprising 500 bp homology arms flanking a unique 20 bp Cas9 targeting sequence followed by a CGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. The resulting KOs represent a precise substitution of the open reading frame with a unique landing pad (LP) to enable future editing at each locus. A further 3 edits were performed at the URA3, LEU2, and HO loci to prepare the cells for efficient multiplexed integration of YTK plasmids by installing a landing pad between the two arms of homology.(B) To rapidly iterate through the 18 genomic edits a marker cycling strategy was employed. Once an edit, facilitated by CRISPR/Cas9 carried on a 2μ plasmid containing one of the three auxotrophic markers, URA3, LEU2 and HIS3, had been confirmed by colony PCR, the next set of edits would immediately be performed by transforming the donor DNA and CRISPR/Cas9 machinery supplied on a plasmid using the next marker in the cycle, removing the need to cure cells of the previous marker. A 3-marker cycle was sufficient to remove all trace of a marker before it was reused in the cycle.(C) Edits were implemented in a pairwise manner, totaling 8 rounds of editing to generate the yWS677 strain and an additional round to generate the yWS1922 strain. 12 colonies were screened for each pairwise edit, yielding at least one correct colony at each round.

During strain construction, we added addressable 24 bp targets in place of the open reading frames (ORFs) of all deleted genes. These allow for rapid and markerless (re)insertion of native or heterologous ORFs into these locations at high efficiency by CRISPR-aided multiplex integration (Figures S1F–S1H). For stable single-copy addition of further genes, three highly characterized landing pads were also introduced that interface with the MoClo Yeast Toolkit (YTK) modular cloning system, which enables rapid multigene construction from high-characterized parts (Lee et al., 2015Lee M.E. DeLoache W.C. Cervantes B. Dueber J.E. A Highly Characterized Yeast Toolkit for Modular, Multipart Assembly.ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These changes were designed to facilitate rapid exploration of the effects of altering individual components of the pheromone response pathway. To determine how the model strain performed with all non-essential components removed, the native GPCR (STE2), Gα (GPA1), Gβ (STE4), Gγ (STE18), and pheromone responsive transcription factor (STE12) genes were restored at their natural loci to generate the “Quasi-WT” strain (Figure S1H). The α-factor dose-response of this strain was then compared to BY4741 yeast using the pheromone response FUS1 promoter driving sfGFP expression (Hagen et al., 1991Hagen D.C. McCaffrey G. Sprague Jr., G.F. Pheromone response elements are necessary and sufficient for basal and pheromone-induced transcription of the FUS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell.

As expected, a substantial increase in sensitivity and signal output was observed upon minimizing the signaling pathway, largely due to the removal of the native regulator of G protein signaling, Sst2 (Figure S2A). Previous work has shown that the sensitivity of the yeast pheromone response pathway can be changed by altering the receptor number in the absence of Sst2 (Bush et al., 2016Bush A. Vasen G. Constantinou A. Dunayevich P. Patop I.L. Blaustein M. Colman-Lerner A. Yeast GPCR signaling reflects the fraction of occupied receptors, not the number.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2016; 12: 898Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Basal activity from constitutive receptor activity can also be reduced by overexpressing Gα (Bakker et al., 2001Bakker R.A. Schoonus S.B.J. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Histamine H(1)-receptor activation of nuclear factor-κ B: roles for G β γ- and G α(q/11)-subunits in constitutive and agonist-mediated signaling.Mol.

Pharmacology of muscarinic receptor subtypes constitutively activated by G proteins.Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), as this acts as a negative regulator of signaling since Gβγ propagates the response to the MAPK cascade (Bardwell, 2004Bardwell L. A walk-through of the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.Peptides. 2004; 25: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, to explore how sensitivity and basal activity could be varied by altering expression of the GPCR, Gα, and Gβγ, we built a mathematical model derived from a previously described cubic ternary complex model (Bridge et al., 2018Bridge L.J. Mead J. Frattini E. Winfield I. Ladds G. Modelling and simulation of biased agonism dynamics at a G protein-coupled receptor.J. Theor. Biol. 2018; 442: 44-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), designing this to capture G protein signaling in our minimized pheromone response pathway (Figure 2A). We then systematically probed the response of the pathway in this model by individually altering the initial GPCR, Gα, and Gβγ concentrations, while keeping all other components fixed (Figures 2D and 2E, model). While this model demonstrated a clear monotonic relationship between receptor number, sensitivity, and maximum signal, as previously shown by Bush et al., 2016Bush A. Vasen G. Constantinou A. Dunayevich P. Patop I.L. Blaustein M. Colman-Lerner A. Yeast GPCR signaling reflects the fraction of occupied receptors, not the number.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2016; 12: 898Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, the relationship between Gα and Gβγ levels and pathway response was non-monotonic. At lower concentrations of Gα, constitutive activation of the pathway was observed due to increased free Gβγ. This, in combination with the incorrect trafficking and instability of Gβγ, due to low levels of Gα, leads to a lower maximum-fold change in activation (Hirschman et al., 1997Hirschman J.E. De Zutter G.S. Simonds W.F. Jenness D.D. The G beta gamma complex of the yeast pheromone response pathway. Subcellular fractionation and protein-protein interactions.J. Biol.

Regulation of membrane and subunit interactions by N-myristoylation of a G protein α subunit in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20273-20283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). At higher Gα concentrations, free Gβγ is rapidly sequestered, also leading to a decrease in the maximum fold change by acting as a “sponge” to signaling. A reverse behavior was seen when varying the initial concentration of Gβγ, with low concentrations decreasing maximum signaling and high concentrations leading to increased basal activity, albeit with a lower maximum signal, due to incorrect trafficking of free Gβγ, and therefore the Ste5 scaffold (Pryciak and Huntress, 1998Pryciak P.M. Huntress F.A. Membrane recruitment of the kinase cascade scaffold protein Ste5 by the Gbetagamma complex underlies activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2684-2697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the model predicts an optimal level of Gα and Gβγ expression where all three members of the heterotrimeric G protein are required to be in balance to give a high-fold change in signal upon activation. Next, using the model strain and modular cloning system, we experimentally validated the findings of the mathematical model using a minimized pheromone response pathway. This was constructed by refactoring the GPCR, Gα, Gβγ, and transcription factor so that these are expressed from constitutive promoters that we determined to give approximately the same expression of the native promoters in their uninduced state (Figures S2B–S2G). For the Gβγ component, we expressed both subunits together as a bicistronic protein (Ste4-2A-Ste18) where the self-cleaving 2A peptide releases equimolar amounts of the two proteins (Liu et al., 2017Liu Z. Chen O. Wall J.B.J. Zheng M. Zhou Y. Wang L. Ruth Vaseghi H. Qian L. Liu J. Systematic comparison of 2A peptides for cloning multi-genes in a polycistronic vector.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The FUS1 promoter was used to express sfGFP as the response reporter (Figure S2H), enabling pathway activation to be measured by flow cytometry. With this strain, we then individually varied the expression of the GPCR, Gα, and Gβγ by changing their promoter strengths while keeping all other components fixed. This gave in vivo results that qualitatively matched the model, demonstrating tunability of sensitivity by changing GPCR expression and revealing the predicted optimal levels of Gα and Gβγ that give the peak response (Figures 2D and 2E, experimental; Figure S3). As basal activity could be reduced by altering levels of either Gα or Gβγ, we decided to concentrate on Gα tuning, using a strain with fixed expression of Gβγ (yWS677) for all further experiments. Next, we sought to modulate maximum pathway output by varying the expression of the pheromone-responsive transcription factor, Ste12, as levels of transcription factor in a system often dictate gene expression strength (Brewster et al., 2014Brewster R.C. Weinert F.M. Garcia H.G. Song D. Rydenfelt M. Phillips R. The transcription factor titration effect dictates level of gene expression.Cell. 2014; 156: 1312-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, increasing the expression of Ste12 led to poor cell growth, presumably by triggering high basal activity of mating response genes (Dolan and Fields, 1990Dolan J.W. Fields S. Overproduction of the yeast STE12 protein leads to constitutive transcriptional induction.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 492-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures S4A and S4B). We therefore needed a new means to tune pathway-mediated expression without changing Ste12 concentrations. By fusing the pheromone-responsive domain of Ste12 (PRD; 216-688) to the full-length LexA bacterial repressor protein (Mukherjee et al., 2015Mukherjee K. Bhattacharyya S. Peralta-Yahya P.

Numerous studies have provided insights into the pathologic mechanisms. However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of APOE genotype on microflora speciation and metabolism is completely lacking. In this study, we investigated the association between APOE genotype and the gut microbiome composition in human and APOE–targeted replacement (TR) transgenic mice. Fecal microbiota amplicon sequencing from matched individuals with different APOE genotypes revealed no significant differences in overall microbiota diversity in group-aggregated human APOE genotypes. However, several bacterial taxa showed significantly different relative abundance between APOE genotypes. Notably, we detected an association of Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae and several butyrate-producing genera abundances with APOE genotypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the gut microbiota of APOE-TR mice. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of murine fecal water detected significant differences in microbe-associated amino acids and short-chain fatty acids between APOE genotypes. Together, these findings indicate that APOE genotype is associated with specific gut microbiome profiles in both humans and APOE-TR mice. This suggests that the gut microbiome is worth further investigation as a potential target to mitigate the deleterious impact of the APOE4 allele on cognitive decline and the prevention of AD.—Tran, T.

https://openalex.org/W2932098601,"Stochastic activation of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) α, β, and γ genes generates a cell-surface identity code in individual neurons that functions in neural circuit assembly. Here, we show that Pcdhα gene choice involves the activation of an antisense promoter located in the first exon of each Pcdhα alternate gene. Transcription of an antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from this antisense promoter extends through the sense promoter, leading to DNA demethylation of the CTCF binding sites proximal to each promoter. Demethylation-dependent CTCF binding to both promoters facilitates cohesin-mediated DNA looping with a distal enhancer (HS5-1), locking in the transcriptional state of the chosen Pcdhα gene. Uncoupling DNA demethylation from antisense transcription by Tet3 overexpression in mouse olfactory neurons promotes CTCF binding to all Pcdhα promoters, resulting in proximity-biased DNA looping of the HS5-1 enhancer. Thus, antisense transcription-mediated promoter demethylation functions as a mechanism for distance-independent enhancer/promoter DNA looping to ensure stochastic Pcdhα promoter choice."
https://openalex.org/W2928690536,"Phytoplankton blooms are an important, widespread phenomenon in open oceans, coastal waters and freshwaters, supporting food webs and essential ecosystem services. Blooms are even more important in exploited coastal waters for maintaining high resource production. However, the environmental factors driving blooms in shallow productive coastal waters are still unclear, making it difficult to assess how environmental fluctuations influence bloom phenology and productivity. To gain insights into bloom phenology, Chl a fluorescence and meteorological and hydrological parameters were monitored at high-frequency (15 min) and nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton abundance and diversity, were monitored weekly in a typical Mediterranean shallow coastal system (Thau Lagoon). This study was carried out from winter to late spring in two successive years with different climatic conditions: 2014/2015 was typical, but the winter of 2015/2016 was the warmest on record. Rising water temperature was the main driver of phytoplankton blooms. However, blooms were sometimes correlated with winds and sometimes correlated with salinity, suggesting nutrients were supplied by water transport via winds, saltier seawater intake, rain and water flow events. This finding indicates the joint role of these factors in determining the success of phytoplankton blooms. Furthermore, interannual variability showed that winter water temperature was higher in 2016 than in 2015, resulting in lower phytoplankton biomass accumulation in the following spring. Moreover, the phytoplankton abundances and diversity also changed: cyanobacteria (< 1 μm), picoeukaryotes (< 1 μm) and nanoeukaryotes (3–6 μm) increased to the detriment of larger phytoplankton such as diatoms. Water temperature is a key factor affecting phytoplankton bloom dynamics in shallow productive coastal waters and could become crucial with future global warming by modifying bloom phenology and changing phytoplankton community structure, in turn affecting the entire food web and ecosystem services."

Here, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, and genome-wide CRISPR analysis to map the molecular dependencies of pancreatic cancer stem cells, highly therapy-resistant cells that preferentially drive tumorigenesis and progression. This integrated genomic approach revealed an unexpected utilization of immuno-regulatory signals by pancreatic cancer epithelial cells. In particular, the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγ), known to drive inflammation and T cell differentiation, was upregulated during pancreatic cancer progression, and its genetic or pharmacologic inhibition led to a striking defect in pancreatic cancer growth and a marked improvement in survival. Further, a large-scale retrospective analysis in patients revealed that RORγ expression may predict pancreatic cancer aggressiveness, as it positively correlated with advanced disease and metastasis. Collectively, these data identify an orthogonal co-option of immuno-regulatory signals by pancreatic cancer stem cells, suggesting that autoimmune drugs should be evaluated as novel treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2929623625,"Insulin receptor (IR) signaling is central to normal metabolic control and dysregulated in prevalent chronic diseases. IR binds insulin at the cell surface and transduces rapid signaling via cytoplasmic kinases. However, mechanisms mediating long-term effects of insulin remain unclear. Here, we show that IR associates with RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, with striking enrichment at promoters genome-wide. The target genes were highly enriched for insulin-related functions including lipid metabolism and protein synthesis and diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. IR chromatin binding was increased by insulin and impaired in an insulin-resistant disease model. Promoter binding by IR was mediated by coregulator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) and transcription factors, revealing an HCF-1-dependent pathway for gene regulation by insulin. These results show that IR interacts with transcriptional machinery at promoters and identify a pathway regulating genes linked to insulin's effects in physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2929944850,"Maintaining proteostasis in eukaryotic protein folding involves cooperation of distinct chaperone systems. To understand how the essential ring-shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT cooperates with the chaperone prefoldin/GIMc (PFD), we integrate cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), crosslinking-mass-spectrometry and biochemical and cellular approaches to elucidate the structural and functional interplay between TRiC/CCT and PFD. We find these hetero-oligomeric chaperones associate in a defined architecture, through a conserved interface of electrostatic contacts that serves as a pivot point for a TRiC-PFD conformational cycle. PFD alternates between an open ""latched"" conformation and a closed ""engaged"" conformation that aligns the PFD-TRiC substrate binding chambers. PFD can act after TRiC bound its substrates to enhance the rate and yield of the folding reaction, suppressing non-productive reaction cycles. Disrupting the TRiC-PFD interaction in vivo is strongly deleterious, leading to accumulation of amyloid aggregates. The supra-chaperone assembly formed by PFD and TRiC is essential to prevent toxic conformations and ensure effective cellular proteostasis."

Comparing these insertions to a null model, in which L1 endonuclease activity is the sole determinant dictating L1 integration preferences, demonstrated that L1 insertions are not significantly enriched in genes, transcribed regions, or open chromatin. By comparison, we provide compelling evidence that the L1 endonuclease disproportionately cleaves predominant lagging strand DNA replication templates, while lagging strand 3'-hydroxyl groups may prime endonuclease-independent L1 retrotransposition in a Fanconi anemia cell line. Thus, acquisition of an endonuclease domain, in conjunction with the ability to integrate into replicating DNA, allowed L1 to become an autonomous, interspersed retrotransposon."

Consistent with PEG10 having a critical role in placental development, PEG10-deficient trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) exhibited impaired differentiation into placental lineages. PEG10 expressed in wild-type, differentiating TSCs was bound to many cellular RNAs including Hbegf (Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor), which is known to play an important role in placentation.

The neural crest (NC) is a distinctive embryonic stem cell population central to the evolution of vertebrates and is endowed with one of the broadest differentiation potentials in vivo (Baggiolini et al., 2015Baggiolini A.

Sommer L. Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NC cells can give rise to a plethora of cell types, ranging from the craniofacial mesenchyme to neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system and skin melanocytes. Melanoma arises from the neoplastic transformation of melanocytes and is frequently driven by BRAF and NRAS mutations (Akbani et al., 2015Akbani R. Akdemir K.C. Aksoy B.A. Albert M. Ally A. Amin S.B. Arachchi H. Arora A. Auman J.T. Ayala B. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkGenomic classification of cutaneous melanoma.Cell. 2015; 161: 1681-1696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that, for disease initiation, progression, and drug resistance, cancer cells reuse aspects of native developmental programs. Several transcription factors (TFs) that allow cellular reprogramming and unlimited self-renewal are bona fide oncogenes (Suvà et al., 2013Suvà M.L. Riggi N. Bernstein B.E. Epigenetic reprogramming in cancer.Science. 2013; 339: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). For instance, skin squamous-cell carcinoma initiation is marked by the reactivation of an embryonic epidermis transcriptional program orchestrated by the stem cell TF Sox2 (Boumahdi et al., 2014Boumahdi S. Driessens G. Lapouge G. Rorive S. Nassar D. Le Mercier M. Delatte B. Caauwe A. Lenglez S. Nkusi E. et al.SOX2 controls tumour initiation and cancer stem-cell functions in squamous-cell carcinoma.Nature. 2014; 511: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Moreover, a core of neurodevelopmental TFs is essential for glioblastoma propagation (Suvà et al., 2014Suvà M.L. Rheinbay E. Gillespie S.M. Patel A.P. Wakimoto H. Rabkin S.D. Riggi N. Chi A.S.

However, in melanoma, Sox2 is required for neither tumor initiation nor disease progression (Schaefer et al., 2017Schaefer S.M. Segalada C. Cheng P.F. Bonalli M. Parfejevs V. Levesque M.P. Dummer R. Nicolis S.K. Sommer L. Sox2 is dispensable for primary melanoma and metastasis formation.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 4516-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, melanoma cells reprogrammed into cells with features of induced pluripotent stem cells gave rise to teratomas in vivo rather than to melanomas, suggesting that a lineage-specific stem cell program may determine cancer identity (Bernhardt et al., 2017Bernhardt M. Novak D. Assenov Y. Orouji E. Knappe N. Weina K. Reith M. Larribere L. Gebhardt C. Plass C. et al.Melanoma-derived iPCCs show differential tumorigenicity and therapy response.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 8: 1379-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When fully differentiated, reprogrammed melanoma cells lost their tumorigenic potential despite their oncogenic load, indicating that a progenitor program might be required for tumorigenesis (Bernhardt et al., 2017Bernhardt M. Novak D. Assenov Y. Orouji E. Knappe N. Weina K. Reith M. Larribere L. Gebhardt C. Plass C. et al.Melanoma-derived iPCCs show differential tumorigenicity and therapy response.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 8: 1379-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, the NC lineage TF SOX10 is recurrently overexpressed in human melanoma and down-modulation of this TF is sufficient to prevent melanoma initiation in a murine model (Shakhova et al., 2012Shakhova O. Zingg D. Schaefer S.M. Hari L. Civenni G. Blunschi J. Claudinot S. Okoniewski M. Beermann F. Mihic-Probst D. et al.Sox10 promotes the formation and maintenance of giant congenital naevi and melanoma.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Melanoma initiation in a BRAFV600E;P53-deficient zebrafish melanoma model is accompanied by the re-expression of NC progenitor markers (Kaufman et al., 2016Kaufman C.K. Mosimann C. Fan Z.P. Yang S. Thomas A.J. Ablain J. Tan J.L. Fogley R.D. van Rooijen E. Hagedorn E.J. et al.A zebrafish melanoma model reveals emergence of neural crest identity during melanoma initiation.Science. 2016; 351: aad2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, acquired resistance to RAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma patients has been linked to the emergence of a cell population expressing NC markers (Rambow et al., 2018Rambow F. Rogiers A. Marin-Bejar O. Aibar S. Femel J. Dewaele M. Karras P. Brown D. Chang Y.H. Debiec-Rychter M. et al.Toward minimal residual disease-directed therapy in melanoma.Cell. 2018; 174: 843-855.e19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the tumorigenic and migratory potential of melanoma cells depends on the attainment of a developmental program required for NC. In this study, we identified the TF Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a master regulator of a NC transcriptional program. Intriguingly, Yy1 is not only required for NC survival and proliferation at early embryonic stages but also for tumor initiation in a genetically engineered melanoma mouse model. Mechanistically, YY1 binds and regulates a large subset of genes involved in general metabolic processes, thus controlling various metabolic pathways as well as protein synthesis rates both during NC development and in melanoma. NC stem cells (NCSCs) can be primed to differentiate into specific cell fates by the use of instructive growth factors (Dupin and Sommer, 2012Dupin E. Sommer L. Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To identify players in NCSC maintenance, we performed a differential gene expression analysis in migratory NCSCs and NC cells primed to differentiate into mesenchymal, neuronal, and glial lineages (Figure 1A). We next asked which TF could act as a master regulator of this transcriptional program by applying an integrated motif activity response analysis (ISMARA) to the resulting dataset (Balwierz et al., 2014Balwierz P.J. Pachkov M. Arnold P. Gruber A.J. Zavolan M. van Nimwegen E. ISMARA: automated modeling of genomic signals as a democracy of regulatory motifs.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that NCSCs display higher Yy1, E2f, and Nfy motif activities than their primed counterparts, suggesting a possible role for these TFs in NCSC maintenance (Figures 1B and 1C; data not shown). Because Yy1 motif activity best discriminated NCSCs from their differentiated counterparts, we decided to focus our analysis on Yy1, a broadly expressed TF that can regulate gene expression by facilitating promoter-enhancer interactions (Weintraub et al., 2017Weintraub A.S. Li C.H. Zamudio A.V. Sigova A.A. Hannett N.M. Day D.S. Abraham B.J. Cohen M.A. Nabet B. Buckley D.L. et al.YY1 is a structural regulator of enhancer-promoter loops.Cell. 2017; 171: 1573-1588.e28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). To address the in vivo requirements of Yy1 during NC development, we crossed mice homozygous for the floxed allele of Yy1 (Affar et al., 2006Affar B. Gay F. Shi Y. Liu H. Huarte M. Wu S. Collins T. Li E. Shi Y. Essential dosage-dependent functions of the transcription factor yin yang 1 in late embryonic development and cell cycle progression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3565-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with mice carrying a transgene expressing Cre recombinase under the Wnt1 promoter (Danielian et al., 1998Danielian P.S. Muccino D. Rowitch D.H. Michael S.K. McMahon A.P. Modification of gene activity in mouse embryos in utero by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombinase.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 1D). This strategy allowed us to specifically and efficiently deplete Yy1 in pre-migratory NC cells (Figures S1A and S1B). Although Yy1 conditional knockout (cko) embryos perished around embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), Wnt1::Cre;Yy1fl/wt embryos were viable and developed into fertile offspring indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates (Figures 1E and S1C; data not shown). Gross morphological analysis of Yy1 cko embryos revealed marked midbrain and craniofacial defects consistent with the pattern of Wnt1::Cre expression (Danielian et al., 1998Danielian P.S. Muccino D. Rowitch D.H. Michael S.K. McMahon A.P. Modification of gene activity in mouse embryos in utero by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombinase.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a requirement of Yy1 for the morphogenesis of NC-derived mesenchyme (Figure 1E). Alcian Blue staining of Yy1 cko embryos showed loss of virtually all NC-derived chondrogenic craniofacial structures (Figures 1F and 1G). The acquisition of mesenchymal fates by NCSCs has been associated with loss of Sox10 and the acquisition of the mesenchymal marker Sox9 (John et al., 2011John N. Cinelli P. Wegner M. Sommer L. Transforming growth factor β-mediated Sox10 suppression controls mesenchymal progenitor generation in neural crest stem cells.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In branchial arch (BA) 1 of Yy1 cko embryos at E11.5, expression of these TFs was unaltered, suggesting that the craniofacial defects observed upon Yy1 cko are not due to an overt differentiation defect (Figures 1H–1J). In agreement with a requirement for Yy1 in NCSC maintenance, the depletion of Yy1 also affected the development of other NC derivatives (Figures 1F and 1K–1Q). Absence of the pan-neuronal marker neurofilament (NF) in E11.5 and E13.5 gut cross-sections revealed that Yy1 cko NCSCs fail to form the enteric nervous system (Figures 1K and S1D). Moreover, analysis of the melanocytic marker Dct showed a marked reduction in melanocyte numbers in Yy1 cko embryos (Figures 1L and 1M). Finally, E13.5 Yy1 cko embryos displayed a significant reduction in the size of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Figures 1N–1Q). However, immunohistochemistry for the sensory neuronal marker Brn3a, NF, and the satellite glial marker FABP7 demonstrated normal differentiation of Yy1 cko DRG cells (Figures 1N, 1P, 1R, S1E, and S1F). Similarly, the relative numbers of Yy1-deficient post-migratory NCSCs and glial cells marked by Sox10 were only modestly reduced at E11.5 and back to normal levels at E13.5 (Figures S1G, S1H, and 1S). Collectively, these results demonstrate that depletion of Yy1 in pre-migratory NCSCs results in agenesis or reduction of multiple NC derivatives, although NCSC differentiation is not impaired. The phenotype observed upon depletion of Yy1 in pre-migratory NCSCs could possibly result from defective proliferation and/or decreased cell survival. Indeed, proliferation in the BA and DRG of E11.5 Yy1 cko was impaired and cell death increased (Figures 2A–2E and 2G, 2H, and 2J ). Interestingly, analysis of proliferation and apoptotic rates at E13.5 revealed rescued proliferation and reduced apoptosis (Figures 2F, 2G, 2I, and 2J). NC derivatives harbor post-migratory NC cell populations exhibiting stem cell properties (Dupin and Sommer, 2012Dupin E. Sommer L. Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To address whether Yy1 was also required for post-migratory Sox10-expressing NC cells, we crossed mice carrying floxed alleles of Yy1 with Sox10::CreERT2 mice harboring a tamoxifen (TM)-inducible Cre recombinase under the Sox10 promoter (Simon et al., 2012Simon C.

Depletion of Yy1 at E10.5 resulted in a marked reduction in the number of melanocytes, consistent with previous findings (Li et al., 2012Li J. Song J.S. Bell R.J.A. Tran T.-N.T. Haq R. Liu H. Love K.T. Langer R. Anderson D.G. Larue L. Fisher D.E. YY1 regulates melanocyte development and function by cooperating with MITF.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Figures S2A–S2C). Likewise, Yy1 cko embryos displayed reduced DRG size (Figure S2D). However, no differences in the percentage of Sox10+ cells and Brn3a+ cells were observed (Figures S2E–S2H). Although depletion of Yy1 at E10.5 did not impair proliferation, it led to a transient decrease in cell survival that was resolved by E12.5 (Figures S2I–S2L). The abiding apoptosis upon Wnt1::Cre-mediated Yy1 ablation when compared to Sox10::CreERT2 (Figures 2I, 2J, S2K, and S2L) could be due to targeting of differentiated neurons with the Wnt1::Cre line and/or to a decreased requirement of Yy1 during embryonic development. Surprisingly, when Cre recombination was induced at E11.5, we did not observe any overt phenotype in the resulting Yy1 cko embryos (Figures 2K–2W). There were no significant differences in the number of Dct+ cells between control and Yy1 cko embryos at E14.5 (Figures 2M and 2N). Likewise, neither proliferation (Figures 2T and 2U) nor apoptosis was affected in Yy1 cko DRG at E14.5 (Figures 2V and 2W). Thus, unlike Yy1 depletion at a pre-migratory stage, Yy1 cko in post-migratory NC cells at E11.5 resulted in no obvious phenotype, indicating a stage-dependent requirement for Yy1 during NC development. Depletion of Yy1 in the melanocytic lineage during embryonic development leads to a reduction in the number of melanocytes postnatally (Li et al., 2012Li J. Song J.S. Bell R.J.A. Tran T.-N.T. Haq R. Liu H. Love K.T. Langer R. Anderson D.G. Larue L. Fisher D.E. YY1 regulates melanocyte development and function by cooperating with MITF.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether Yy1 is also required for homeostasis of adult melanocytes, we conditionally ablated either one allele of Yy1 (Yy1+/−) or both alleles of Yy1 (Yy1−/−) specifically in the adult melanocytic lineage by using a TM-inducible Tyr::CreERT2 line (Bosenberg et al., 2006Bosenberg M. Muthusamy V. Curley D.P. Wang Z. Hobbs C. Nelson B. Nogueira C. Horner 2nd, J.W. Depinho R. Chin L. Characterization of melanocyte-specific inducible Cre recombinase transgenic mice.Genesis. 2006; 44: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) known to drive Cre-dependent recombination in both melanocyte stem cells and in differentiated melanocytes (Harris et al., 2013Harris M.L. Buac K. Shakhova O. Hakami R.M. Wegner M. Sommer L. Pavan W.J. A dual role for SOX10 in the maintenance of the postnatal melanocyte lineage and the differentiation of melanocyte stem cell progenitors.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003644Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Figures 3A and 3B ). Fate mapping of recombined cells was possible due to inclusion of a ROSA26 Cre reporter allele. Although depletion of both Yy1 alleles resulted in hair graying, the coat color of Yy1+/− animals was indistinguishable from that of control animals (Figure 3C). During anagen, Yy1−/− animals had reduced numbers of melanocytes when compared to control animals, although no significant differences could be observed between control and Yy1+/− animals (Figures 3D and 3E). Some tdTomato+ melanocytes in Yy1−/− animals still retained Yy1 protein due to incomplete Cre recombination. However, in these animals, a small subset of hair follicles contained melanocytes devoid of Yy1 expression and these presented lighter pigmentation (Figure 3G). Interestingly, analysis of tdTomato+ hair bulbs per Dct+ hair bulbs showed that Yy1−/− animals had a reduced percentage of recombined hair follicles compared to Yy1+/− animals. Our results suggest that depletion of both alleles of Yy1 in the adult melanocytic lineage conferred a selective disadvantage to melanocyte stem cells and diminished the survival and/or proliferation rates of melanocytes (Figure 3F). To investigate whether Yy1 is functionally implicated in melanoma initiation, we took advantage of the cutaneous Tyr::N-RasQ61K;Cdnk2a−/− melanoma mouse model, which develops skin melanomas spontaneously within 6 months of age (Ackermann et al., 2005Ackermann J. Frutschi M. Kaloulis K. McKee T. Trumpp A. Beermann F. Metastasizing melanoma formation caused by expression of activated N-RasQ61K on an INK4a-deficient background.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Shakhova et al., 2012Shakhova O.

Mihic-Probst D. et al.Sox10 promotes the formation and maintenance of giant congenital naevi and melanoma.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In these mice, Yy1 was co-expressed with Dct in hair follicles, dermal hyperplasia, and skin melanomas (Figure S3A). Using Tyr::CreERT2 (Figure 4A), we conditionally depleted either one allele of Yy1 (Yy1+/−) or both alleles of Yy1 (Yy1−/−) at 1 month of age by injecting TM (Zingg et al., 2015Zingg D. Debbache J. Schaefer S.M. Tuncer E. Frommel S.C. Cheng P. Arenas-Ramirez N. Haeusel J. Zhang Y. Bonalli M. et al.The epigenetic modifier EZH2 controls melanoma growth and metastasis through silencing of distinct tumour suppressors.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Figures 4B and S3B). Recombination efficiency was 47.07% ± 3.20%, as determined by quantifying the number of GFP-expressing cells among the total number of Dct-expressing cells in skin hyperplastic lesions. Strikingly, although control animals developed skin melanomas as expected, both Yy1+/− and Yy1−/− animals exhibited significantly reduced tumor burden and significantly increased melanoma tumor-specific survival (Figures 4C and 4D). Two months after recombination, Yy1−/−, but not Yy1+/−, mice displayed hair pigmentation defects, reflecting deficiencies in the melanocytic lineage (Figure S3C). Therefore, we focused our further analysis on Yy1+/− animals. Tracing of recombined cells by means of immunohistochemistry for GFP and DCT revealed that GFP-expressing cells could be detected in hair follicles and hyperplastic lesions, whereas virtually no recombined skin melanomas were found in Yy1+/− mice (Figures 4E and 4F). Thus, depletion of one Yy1 allele is sufficient to prevent melanoma initiation in this melanoma mouse model. To address whether Yy1 reduction was associated with reduced proliferation and increased cell death in melanoma, we isolated skin-melanoma-derived cells from control animals harboring the Tyr::CreERT2;Yy1fl/wt Tyr::NrasQ61K;Cdnk2a−/− genotype and engrafted these cells into athymic nude Foxn1nu mice (Zingg et al., 2015Zingg D. Debbache J. Schaefer S.M. Tuncer E. Frommel S.C. Cheng P. Arenas-Ramirez N. Haeusel J. Zhang Y. Bonalli M. et al.The epigenetic modifier EZH2 controls melanoma growth and metastasis through silencing of distinct tumour suppressors.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Figure 4G). Tumors were allowed to grow, and loss of one Yy1 allele was induced by TM injection (Figure 4H). No differences in NrasQ61K transgene expression were observed between control and Yy1+/− tumors (Figures S3D and S3E). Although depletion of one allele of Yy1 did not increase cell death in already established tumors, Yy1+/− tumors exhibited decreased numbers of cells in S phase when compared to control melanomas (Figures 4I–4K). To address the relevance of our findings in human melanoma, we reduced YY1 levels in a panel of human melanoma cell lines by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown (KD) (Figures S3F and S3G). Although YY1 KD did not alter cell survival in human melanoma (Figure 4L), YY1 KD led to reduced numbers of cells in S phase (Figure 4M). Thus, as in NC cells, YY1 regulates proliferation in melanoma cells. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the dependence of NC cells on Yy1, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in E10.5 BA1 cells of control and Yy1 cko embryos. Clustering of biological replicates demonstrated comparable global gene expression patterns across samples of the same genotype (Figure 5A). Gene Ontology (GO) network-based cluster analysis showed that gene sets transcriptionally regulated by Yy1 are enriched in developmental and metabolic processes (Figures 5B and S4A; Table S1). To verify that the changes in metabolic gene expression observed upon Yy1 depletion were not due to the presence of a small population of dying cells, we analyzed the expression of a subset of metabolic genes at E9.5, when apoptosis was not yet evident (Figures S4B and S4C). Similar to E10.5 Yy1 cko embryos, E9.5 Yy1 cko embryos already displayed altered gene expression in metabolism-related genes (Figure S4D). Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR for Yy1 in control E10.5 BA1 cells identified binding of Yy1 to the promoter region of metabolic and protein translation genes, consistent with previous findings (Kleiman et al., 2016Kleiman E. Jia H. Loguercio S. Su A.I. Feeney A.J. YY1 plays an essential role at all stages of B-cell differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E3911-E3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Lu et al., 2013Lu L. Sun K. Chen X. Zhao Y. Wang L. Zhou L. Sun H. Wang H.

USA. 2014; 111: 7695-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Figure S4E). To address whether a similar transcriptional program was controlled by YY1 in human melanoma, we performed differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq in a human melanoma cell line subjected to siRNA-mediated YY1 KD (Figures 5C, S3F, and S3G). In addition, we performed ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis for YY1 to identify its direct targets in human melanoma. Peak calling in two experimental replicates identified 2,063 and 1,719 peaks (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.01), which were at least 2-fold enriched over input. Consistent with bona fide YY1 binding sites, the most enriched motif in these regions was the YY1 motif with a high significance score (p value < 1e−50; Figure 5D). Analysis of YY1 binding site location with HOMER demonstrated that approximately 50% of the peaks were located in the promoter region (Figure 5E). For instance, we detected YY1 binding events at the mitochondrial complex I gene NDUFA6, the nucleotide metabolism gene RRM1, and at the promoter regions of protein-synthesis-related genes (Figures 5F–5I). To identify functional classes of YY1 direct targets, we intersected our RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets and performed network-based cluster analysis. This analysis unveiled cellular metabolic processes, mRNA metabolic processes, and translation-related processes to be among the most enriched functional ontologies (Figures 5J and S5; Table S1). To verify this transcriptional response to YY1 KD, we validated the expression of several genes involved in different fundamental metabolic processes by qRT-PCR in three additional human melanoma cell lines (Figure 5K). In all cell lines, YY1 KD affected a broad subset of genes associated with mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), one carbon metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and protein synthesis (Figure 5K). Collectively, these results suggest that YY1 binds and regulates a subset of genes associated with fundamental metabolic processes both during NC development and in melanoma. We next asked whether the changes in metabolism-related gene expression observed upon YY1 depletion or KD impaired cellular metabolic processes. To analyze mitochondrial bioenergetics, we measured oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in NC cells derived from E10.5 control and Yy1 cko BA cells and found that loss of Yy1 leads to reduced basal OCRs and maximal respiratory capacity (Figures 6A and 6B ). Further, the percentage of oxygen allocated to ATP production (ATP turnover) was decreased in Yy1 cko cells. Importantly, similar data were obtained with human melanoma cells subjected to YY1 KD (Figures 6C, 6D, S5B, and S5C), in agreement with previous findings (Blättler et al., 2012Blättler S.M. Verdeguer F. Liesa M. Cunningham J.T. Vogel R.O. Chim H. Liu H. Romanino K. Shirihai O.S. Vazquez F. et al.Defective mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetic function in mice lacking the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 in skeletal muscle.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Possibly, the exacerbated OCR phenotype observed in NC cells compared to melanoma cells could be partially due to a small percentage of Yy1 cko neural crest cells undergoing cell death during the experimental procedure (Figures 6A–6D, S5B, and S5C). To understand whether the metabolic changes induced by YY1 KD extended beyond mitochondrial energetics, we performed mass-spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics (Fuhrer et al., 2011Fuhrer T. Heer D. Begemann B. Zamboni N. High-throughput, accurate mass metabolome profiling of cellular extracts by flow injection-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 7074-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We detected a total of 1,358 ions with a distinct mass-to-charge ratio, which were putatively mapped to human metabolites based on accurate mass measurements (Table S2). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that several metabolic pathways were disturbed upon YY1 KD, including glucose metabolism, TCA cycle, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism (Figures 6E and S5D; Table S3), However, the extent to which specific pathways were altered varied considerably across the two cell lines analyzed, consistent with a previous study that reported metabolic heterogeneity between cancer cell lines (Dubuis et al., 2017Dubuis S.

Eng. 2017; 43: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to metabolic genes, YY1 binds and regulates a subset of genes involved in protein translation (Figures 5H–5K). Accordingly, flow cytometric analysis of OP-Puro incorporation showed th"

Up to now, its psychometric properties have not been clarified sufficiently as the nine items have not yet been presented exclusively in a representative sample. Therefore, psychometric properties, model fit values as well as norm-values were analyzed. Methods For the sample, N = 2,507 participants aged 14 to 92, n = 1,379 women and n = 1,128 men, and a mean age of 48.79 (SD = 17.91), were selected from the general population by random-route sampling. Confirmatory factor analyses applying full information maximum likelihood (FIML) tested the model fit. The reliability estimations and effect sizes were reported. Results The items’ discriminative power ranged between .49 to .65, and the Cronbach’s Alpha was α = .87, which stands for a good reliability of the SCL-K-9. Norm values as well as gender and age specificities were presented in this section. The CFA with all nine items loading on one latent factor resulted in a good fit. There was evidence of invariance across age and gender groups. Summary Based on these results, the short screening version SCL-K-9 of the Symptom-Checklist 90-R showed good reliability and good model fit; specific norm values could be determined. Further studies should evaluate the usefulness of the standardization in clinical samples."

The specimens were divided into the following groups: G1: negative control (application of water-soluble gel); G2: tooth whitening group (positive control), under application time recommended by the manufacturer (4h/14 days); G3: prolonged whitening 50%, under prolonged time recommended by the manufacturer in 50% (4h/21 days); G4: excessive whitening 100%, under exceeded manufacturer recommended time by 100% (4h/ 28 days). The results were evaluated descriptively and analytically. There were no changes in the roughness in any of the evaluated groups. However, the microhardness decreased in the G4 group. Scanning electron microscopy showed changes in the enamel surface of groups G2, G3 and G4. Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy identified changes in the concentration of chemical elements O, Mg, P, K in all groups. Thus, this study showed that prolonged home bleaching could cause changes in the ultrastructure, chemical composition and microhardness of the enamel."

Innovations generally emerge from collective intelligence and action, but innovation systems are often poorly understood. This study explores the properties of innovation systems and their contribution to increased eco-efficiency in agriculture. Using aggregate data and econometric methods, the eco-efficiency of 79 countries was computed and a range of factors relating to research, extension, business and policy was examined. Despite data limitations, the analysis produced some interesting insights. For instance public research spending has a positive significant effect for emerging economies, while no statistically significant effect was found for foreign aid for research. However, foreign aid for extension is important in less developed economies. These and other results suggest the importance of context-specific interventions rather than a “one size fits all” approach. Overall, the analysis illustrated the potential of a macro-level diagnostic approach for assessing the role of innovation systems for sustainability in agriculture."

Although the etiologic role of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in the development of CRC has been elucidated, the specific tumor molecules involved in the progression of CRC induced by F. nucleatum have not been identified. This study investigated several miRNAs and genes involved in the progression of F. nucleatum-induced CRC by Affymetrix miRNA microarray technology and GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. The results suggest that miR-4474 and miR-4717 are up-regulated in CRC tissues in response to F. nucleatum infection, compared with the control group (paracancerous tissues), while other genes associated with signaling pathways in cancer, including CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), STAT1, PRKACB, CAMK2B, JUN, TP53 and EWSR1, were dysregulated. Bioinformatic analysis identified CREBBP as the primary aberrantly expressed gene in F. nucleatum-induced CRC. Consistent with the microarray analysis results, real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of miR-4474/4717 was upregulated while that of CREBBP mRNA was downregulated in CRC patients infected with F. nucleatum. Additionally, CREBBP was identified as a novel target of miR-4474/4717. The results of this study suggest that miR-4474 and miR-4717 are involved in the progression of F. nucleatum-induced CRC by posttranscriptionally regulating the target gene CREBBP."

Because metabolism initiates at the beginning of spore germination, here we metabolically reprogrammed B. anthracis cells to understand the role of glycolytic enzymes in this process. We show that increased expression of enolase (Eno) in the sporulating mother cell decreases germination efficiency.

We found that phosphorylation also regulates Eno expression and localization, thereby controlling the overall spore germination process. Using MS analysis, we identified the sites of phosphorylation in Eno, and substitution(s) of selected phosphorylation sites helped establish the functional correlation between phosphorylation and Eno activity. We propose that PrkC-mediated regulation of Eno may help sporulating B. anthracis cells in adapting to nutrient deprivation.

https://openalex.org/W2932061020,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly and require early diagnosis to prevent vision loss, and careful treatment is essential. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), the most commonly used imaging method in the retinal area for the diagnosis of AMD, is usually interpreted by a clinician, and OCT can help diagnose disease on the basis of the relevant diagnostic criteria, but these judgments can be somewhat subjective. We propose an algorithm for the detection of AMD based on a weakly supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model to support computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Our main contributions are the following three things. (1) We propose a concise CNN model for OCT images, which outperforms the existing large CNN models using VGG16 and GoogLeNet architectures. (2) We propose an algorithm called Expressive Gradients (EG) that extends the existing Integrated Gradients (IG) algorithm so as to exploit not only the input-level attribution map, but also the high-level attribution maps. Due to enriched gradients, EG can highlight suspicious regions for diagnosis of AMD better than the guided-backpropagation method and IG. (3) Our method provides two visualization options: overlay and top-k bounding boxes, which would be useful for CAD. Through experimental evaluation using 10,100 clinical OCT images from AMD patients, we demonstrate that our EG algorithm outperforms the IG algorithm in terms of localization accuracy and also outperforms the existing object detection methods in terms of class accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2934131487,"We have generated a high-density, high-throughput genotyping array for characterizing genome-wide variation in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in charr from the Fraser, Nauyuk and Tree River aquaculture strains, which originated from northern Canada and fish from Iceland using high coverage sequencing, reduced representation sequencing and RNA-seq datasets. The array was designed to capture genome-wide variation from a diverse suite of Arctic charr populations. Cross validation of SNPs from various sources and comparison with previously published Arctic charr SNP data provided a set of candidate SNPs that generalize across populations. Further candidate SNPs were identified based on minor allele frequency, association with RNA transcripts, even spacing across intergenic regions and association with the sex determining (sdY) gene. The performance of the 86,503 SNP array was assessed by genotyping Fraser, Nauyuk and Tree River strain individuals, as well as wild Icelandic Arctic charr. Overall, 63,060 of the SNPs were polymorphic within at least one group and 36.8% were unique to one of the four groups, suggesting that the array design allows for characterization of both within and across population genetic diversity. The concordance between sdY markers and known phenotypic sex indicated that the array can accurately determine the sex of individuals based on genotype alone. The Salp87k genotyping array provides researchers and breeders the opportunity to analyze genetic variation in Arctic charr at a more detailed level than previously possible."

In the present study, re-sequencing and RNA-seq were employed to detect global DNA variations and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during meiosis stage in three neo-tetraploid rice lines compared to their parents, respectively. Here, a total of 4109881 SNPs and 640592 InDels were detected in neo-tetraploid lines compared to the reference genome, and 1805 specific presence/absence variations (PAVs) were detected in three lines. Approximately 12% and 0.5% of the total SNPs and InDels identified in three lines were located in genic regions, respectively. A total of 28 genes, harboring at least one of the large-effect SNP and/or InDel which affect the integrity of the encoded protein, were identified in the three lines. Together, 324 specific mutation genes, including 52 meiosis-related genes and 8 epigenetics-related genes were detected in neo-tetraploid rice compared to their parents. Of these 324 genes, five meiosis-related and three epigenetics-related genes displayed differential expressions during meiosis stage. Notably, 498 specific transcripts, 48 differentially expressed transposons and 245 differentially expressed ncRNAs were also detected in neo-tetraploid rice.

https://openalex.org/W2933968061,"Atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by an accumulation of macrophages, lipids, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, and, in advanced stages, necrotic debris within the arterial walls. Dietary habits such as high fat and high cholesterol (HFHC) consumption are known risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, the key metabolic contributors to diet-induced atherosclerosis are far from established. Herein, we investigate the role of a 2-year HFHC diet challenge in the metabolic changes of development and progression of atherosclerosis. We used a non-human primate (NHP) model (baboons, n = 60) fed a HFHC diet for two years and compared metabolomic profiles in serum from animals on baseline chow with serum collected after the challenge diet using two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (2D GC-ToF-MS) for untargeted metabolomic analysis, to quantify metabolites that contribute to atherosclerotic lesion formation. Further, clinical biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis, lipoprotein measures, fat indices, and arterial plaque formation (lesions) were quantified. Using two chemical derivatization (i.e., silylation) approaches, we quantified 321 metabolites belonging to 66 different metabolic pathways, which revealed significantly different metabolic profiles of HFHC diet and chow diet fed baboon sera. We found heritability of two important metabolites, lactic acid and asparagine, in the context of diet-induced metabolic changes. In addition, abundance of cholesterol, lactic acid, and asparagine were sex-dependent. Finally, 35 metabolites correlated (R2, 0.068-0.271, P < 0.05) with total lesion burden assessed in three arteries (aortic arch, common iliac artery, and descending aorta) which could serve as potential biomarkers pending further validation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting sex-specific and heritable metabolites in NHPs with diet-induced atherosclerosis using untargeted metabolomics allowing understanding of atherosclerotic disease progression in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2926410227,"Cancer tissues harbor thousands of mutations, and a given oncogene may be mutated at hundreds of sites, yet only a few of these mutations have been functionally tested. Here, we describe an unbiased platform for the functional characterization of thousands of variants of a single receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene in a single assay. Our in vitro screen for activating mutations (iSCREAM) platform enabled rapid analysis of mutations conferring gain-of-function RTK activity promoting clonal growth. The screening strategy included a somatic model of cancer evolution and utilized a library of 7,216 randomly mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) single-nucleotide variants that were tested in murine lymphoid Ba/F3 cells. These cells depend on exogenous interleukin-3 (IL-3) for growth, but this dependence can be compensated by ectopic EGFR overexpression, enabling selection for gain-of-function EGFR mutants. Analysis of the enriched mutants revealed EGFR A702V, a novel activating variant that structurally stabilized the EGFR kinase dimer interface and conferred sensitivity to kinase inhibition by afatinib. As proof of concept for our approach, we recapitulated clinical observations and identified the EGFR L858R as the major enriched EGFR variant. Altogether, iSCREAM enabled robust enrichment of 21 variants from a total of 7,216 EGFR mutations. These findings indicate the power of this screening platform for unbiased identification of activating RTK variants that are enriched under selection pressure in a model of cancer heterogeneity and evolution. Cancer tissues harbor thousands of mutations, and a given oncogene may be mutated at hundreds of sites, yet only a few of these mutations have been functionally tested. Here, we describe an unbiased platform for the functional characterization of thousands of variants of a single receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene in a single assay. Our in vitro screen for activating mutations (iSCREAM) platform enabled rapid analysis of mutations conferring gain-of-function RTK activity promoting clonal growth. The screening strategy included a somatic model of cancer evolution and utilized a library of 7,216 randomly mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) single-nucleotide variants that were tested in murine lymphoid Ba/F3 cells. These cells depend on exogenous interleukin-3 (IL-3) for growth, but this dependence can be compensated by ectopic EGFR overexpression, enabling selection for gain-of-function EGFR mutants. Analysis of the enriched mutants revealed EGFR A702V, a novel activating variant that structurally stabilized the EGFR kinase dimer interface and conferred sensitivity to kinase inhibition by afatinib. As proof of concept for our approach, we recapitulated clinical observations and identified the EGFR L858R as the major enriched EGFR variant. Altogether, iSCREAM enabled robust enrichment of 21 variants from a total of 7,216 EGFR mutations. These findings indicate the power of this screening platform for unbiased identification of activating RTK variants that are enriched under selection pressure in a model of cancer heterogeneity and evolution. A driving test for oncogenic mutationsJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 294Issue 24PreviewActivating mutations in protein kinases are a frequent cause of cancer, and selecting drugs that act on these oncogenic kinases can lead to effective therapies. Targeted or whole-genome sequencing of tumor samples can readily reveal the presence of mutations, but discerning previously uncharacterized activating “driver” mutations that will respond to drug treatment from much more abundant but inconsequential “passenger” mutations is problematic. Chakroborty et al. apply a screening approach that leverages error-prone PCR and a proliferating cell model to identify such gain-of-function mutants in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase.

(Pro)renin receptor (PRR) is a component of the RAS and has been reported to be up-regulated in some cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, PRR blockade in some cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and hypertension, has been demonstrated to reverse their pathogenesis. However, there have been few studies about the function of PRR in the pathogenesis of DCM. In this study, we hypothesized that PRR is involved in the pathogenesis of DCM and mediates myocardial injury in DCM. To explore the role of PRR in DCM, we evaluated the effects of PRR overexpression and knockdown on the DCM phenotype in vivo and in vitro. The results show that PRR overexpression exacerbates myocardial injury and the inflammatory response in rats with DCM. Conversely, PRR knockdown alleviates myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, and the inflammatory response, reversing the cardiac dysfunction in rats with DCM. In cell experiments, PRR overexpression also up-regulated the protein expression of collagen I and fibronectin, aggravated the inflammatory response, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species, whereas PRR knockdown had the opposite effect. Thus, PRR mediates myocardial injury, apoptosis, and the inflammatory response, likely through a PRR/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/reactive oxygen species pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2935376038,"Hagfishes are living representatives of the earliest-diverging vertebrates and are thus useful for the study of early vertebrate physiology. It has been previously postulated that digestive enzymes account for the majority of digestion because hagfish are agastric with notable zymogen granules in specialized cells of the hindgut. While the presence of some digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase and leucinaminopeptidase) have been confirmed with histochemistry, quantification of enzymatic activity is limited. This study sought to biochemically quantify the tissue activity of six digestive enzymes (α-amylase, maltase, lipase, trypsin, aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase) along the length of the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) alimentary canal. In addition, the effect of feeding on the rate of enzyme activity was examined. Overall, maltase and trypsin activities were unchanging with respect to location or feeding status, while the activities of α-amylase and alkaline phosphatase decreased substantially following feeding, but were consistent along the length. Lipase and aminopeptidase activities were elevated in the anterior region of the alimentary canal in comparison to the more posterior regions, but were not altered with feeding. This study indicates hagfish have an assortment of digestive enzymes that likely are the result of a varied diet. The differential expression of these enzymes along the tract and in regards to feeding may be indications of early compartmentalization of digestive function."
https://openalex.org/W2929552862,"The effects of hyperuricemia on the expression of kidney drug transporters and on the pharmacokinetics of several substrate drugs were examined. We first established a rat model of hyperuricemia without marked symptoms of chronic kidney failure by 10-day co-administration of oxonic acid (uricase inhibitor) and adenine (biosynthetic precursor of uric acid). These hyperuricemic rats showed plasma uric acid concentrations of up to 6 mg/dL, which is similar to the serum uric acid level in hyperuricemic humans, with little change of inulin clearance. The mRNA levels of multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (Mate1, Slc47a1), organic anion transporter 1 (Oat1, Slc22a6), organic cation transporter 2 (Oct2, Slc22a2), urate transporter 1 (Urat1, Slc22a12) and peptide transporter 1 (Pept1, Slc15a1) were significantly decreased in kidney of hyperuricemic rats. Since Oct2, Mate1 and Oat1 are important for renal drug elimination, we next investigated whether the pharmacokinetics of their substrates, metformin, cephalexin and creatinine, were altered. The plasma concentration of metformin was not affected, while its kidney tissue accumulation was significantly increased. The plasma concentration and kidney tissue accumulation of cephalexin and the plasma concentration of creatinine were also increased. Furthermore, the protein expression of kidney Mate1 was decreased in hyperuricemic rats. Accordingly, although multiple factors may influence renal handling of these drugs, these observations can be accounted for, at least in part, by downregulation of Mate1-mediated apical efflux from tubular cells and Oct2-mediated basolateral uptake. Our results suggest that hyperuricemia could alter the disposition of drugs that are substrates of Mate1 and/or Oct2."

Mannan-binding lectin–associated serine proteinase 2 (MASP-2) is essential for LP activation, and therefore, it is a potential drug target. We have previously developed the first two generations of MASP-2 inhibitors by in vitro evolution of two unrelated canonical serine proteinase inhibitors.

It is a network of more than 30 plasma and cell surface proteins that recognizes, labels, and eliminates microbial pathogens and dangerously altered (e.g. apoptotic) self-cells, triggers inflammation, and recruits immune cells (1Ricklin D.

The CS can be activated through three pathways. The classical pathway (CP) is activated primarily by immune complexes, but it can also recognize microbial surfaces and apoptotic and necrotic cells; it contributes to the elimination of unnecessary synapses during ontogenesis; and it is important for the clearance of immune complexes and cell debris (4Nayak A. Ferluga J. Tsolaki A.G. Kishore U. The non-classical functions of the classical complement pathway recognition subcomponent C1q.Immunol.

The lectin pathway (LP) recognizes ancient surface-exposed molecular determinants on microbes via a diverse set of pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) and provides immediate defense against microbial pathogens, which does not depend on specific antibodies (6Garred P. Genster N. Pilely K. Bayarri-Olmos R. Rosbjerg A. Ma Y.J. Skjoedt M.-O. A journey through the lectin pathway of complement-MBL and beyond.Immunol. Rev. 2016; 274 (27782323): 74-9710.1111/imr.12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway (AP) continuously challenges all surfaces by spontaneous low-level activation, but it activates productively only on those that lack protecting complement regulator molecules. Additionally, the AP provides an important amplification loop for complement activation (7Harrison R.A. The properdin pathway: an “alternative activation pathway” or a “critical amplification loop” for C3 and C5 activation?.Semin.

Danger signal recognition triggers the activation of pathway-specific serine proteinase zymogens. The activated proteinases cleave downstream complement components that form surface-bound C3 convertases: C4b2a for the CP and the LP and C3bBb for the AP. At this point, the three activation pathways converge to a common effector route leading to the labeling and lysis of the pathogens, recruitment of immune cells, and triggering of inflammation. Normally, complement activation is tightly regulated (9Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Complement regulators and inhibitory proteins.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 (19730437): 729-74010.1038/nri2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Lack of complement inhibition is responsible for the pathomechanism of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and inappropriate complement activation contributes to the development of diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), rheumatoid arthritis, age-related macular degeneration, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, there is a great need for potent and specific anti-complement drugs that could provide targeted therapies for these complement-related diseases (10Dobó J. Kocsis A. Gál P. Be on target: strategies of targeting alternative and lectin pathway components in complement-mediated diseases.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 (30135690)185110.3389/fimmu.2018.01851Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Whereas many anti-complement compounds are under development (11Ricklin D. Mastellos D.C. Reis E.S. Lambris J.D. The renaissance of complement therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2018; 14 (29199277): 26-4710.1038/nrneph.2017.156Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), there are only two molecules that have been approved for clinical use: the anti-C5 antibody Soliris® (eculizumab) and C1 inhibitor. Even of these two, only eculizumab is a dedicated complement-targeted drug. One of the most promising candidates among complement-targeted lead molecules is compstatin and its derivatives (12Berger N. Alayi T.D. Resuello R.R.G. Tuplano J.V. Reis E.S. Lambris J.D. New analogs of the complement C3 inhibitor compstatin with increased solubility and improved pharmacokinetic profile.J. Med.

These compounds effectively block the interaction of the C3 convertases with C3 to inhibit erroneous complement activation. In most complement-related diseases, the contribution of only one of the three pathways is dominant. The CP participates in Alzheimer’s disease (13Hong S. Beja-Glasser V.F. Nfonoyim B.M. Frouin A.

Pathway-specific inhibitors should be useful tools for academic research to identify individual roles of the three pathways in physiologic and pathologic processes and ideal therapeutics that selectively block the derailed pathologic pathway while leaving the protecting functions of the other two pathways undisturbed. Pathway-specific proteinases are obvious targets of pathway-selective drug development. However, as most plasma serine proteinases have trypsin-like substrate specificity, selectively targeting a single complement proteinase is a formidable challenge. Small molecules that target only the active site are rarely monospecific. Fragment-based drug discovery (21Murray C.W. Rees D.C. The rise of fragment-based drug discovery.Nat. Chem. 2009; 1 (21378847): 187-19210.1038/nchem.217Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) has been successfully applied to develop highly selective small-molecule inhibitors against factor D, a key enzyme of the AP (22Maibaum J.

These compounds target factor D in its unique, self-inhibited conformation that is characteristically different from other proteinases. Proteins such as mAbs and canonical serine proteinase inhibitors have much larger interacting surfaces and have therefore greater potential to provide monospecificity.

Therefore, MASP-2 might be a better target for the development of highly selective LP inhibitors. Nonhuman origin rendered the previously developed MASP inhibitors suboptimal for subsequent drug development. Therefore, we decided to develop a third generation of MASP-2 inhibitors based on a human scaffold to reduce the risk of immunogenicity in humans. We chose the factor Xa–inhibiting second Kunitz domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor 1 (TFPI1 D2), as it is normally present in the plasma and because it has already been shown to be a low-affinity inhibitor of MASP-2 (31Keizer M.P.

Here, we present how we developed TFPI1-based MASP-2 inhibitor (TFMI-2) variants that potently inhibit both human and rat MASP-2, enabling their use in proof-of-concept studies in rats. We followed the same strategy we already applied for developing TFPI1 D2–based MASP-3 inhibitors (32Dobó J. Szakács D. Oroszlán G. Kortvely E. Kiss B. Boros E. Szász R. Závodszky P. Gál P. Pál G.

The inhibitor-phage library of 5 × 108 clones was selected for binding to the catalytic fragment of human MASP-2 (hMASP-2cf) or that of rat MASP-2 (rMASP-2cf) in separate experiments. Target-binding clones were identified and sequenced to determine sequence patterns that enable binding to hMASP-2cf or rMASP-2cf. Amino acid and DNA sequences of hMASP-2– and rMASP-2–binding clones are listed in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. The codon bias normalized sequence pattern of the hMASP-2–binding TFPI1 D2 clones is presented in Fig. 1A as a sequence logo. We compare this logo with those we obtained previously when generating the SFTI-based (23Kocsis A. Kékesi K.A. Szász R. Végh B.M. Balczer J. Dobó J. Závodszky P. Gál P. Pál G.

The three unrelated scaffolds stabilize the canonical loop conformation through different intramolecular interactions, including disulfides that we kept intact. Therefore, only the three central loop positions, P1, P1′, and P2′, were randomized on all three scaffolds. Human MASP-2 selected only Lys and/or Arg at the P1 position on all scaffolds, but the relative frequencies of these residues are scaffold-dependent. The enzyme preferred Lys on the SGPI-2 and Arg on the SFTI, whereas it exclusively selected an Arg on the TFPI1 D2 scaffold. Similar scaffold-dependent differences are observed at the P1′ and P2′ positions. At P1′, hMASP-2 preferred Ala/Gly/Ser/Thr on TFPI1 D2, whereas it accepted only Ser/Gly on SFTI and Leu/Ala on SGPI-2. At P2′, on TFPI1 D2 hMASP-2 preferred aliphatic Val/Ala/Ile/Leu, whereas on SGPI-2, it selected only aromatic Trp/Tyr. On SFTI, the preference was a mixture of the previous two, as mostly Tyr/Phe and, to a lesser extent, Ile/Met/Leu were selected. The observed differences between the three selected sequence patterns demonstrate that each unrelated scaffold uniquely affects the side-chain preference of the same enzyme at analogous canonical loop positions. Logos derived from the sequences of unique hMASP-2– and rMASP-2–binding TFPI1 D2 clones are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. At the two energetically most important positions, the two enzymes selected the same amino acids: Arg at P1 and Ala/Gly/Ser at P1′. At P2′, both enzymes selected hydrophobic side chains; hMASP-2 preferred aliphatic, whereas rMASP-2 both aliphatic and aromatic residues. At P3′ and P4′, hMASP-2 shows a weak preference for positively charged residues, whereas rMASP-2 lacks any observable selectivity. At P3, there is a clear species-specific difference in amino acid preferences, but even here, there is an overlapping set of selected residues. Whereas rMASP-2 selected only small hydrophobic residues, Val/Pro/Ile/Gly, hMASP-2 preferred Phe/Tyr and selected smaller residues, such as Pro/Val, at lower frequencies. We designed three TFMI-2 variants along the notion that normalized amino acid frequencies generally correlate with binding energy contributions of individual amino acid residues (34Weiss G.A.

TFMI-2a carries the hMASP-2–selected consensus P3-P4′ sequence (FCRAVKR) and is expected to have the highest affinity toward hMASP-2. On the other hand, due to its bulky P3 Phe, it should be only a weak inhibitor of rMASP-2. Therefore, we designed two additional inhibitors to efficiently inhibit both hMASP-2 and rMASP-2. Such variants can serve as surrogate compounds in studies investigating the in vivo effects of MASP-2 inhibition in rats. As rMASP-2 mostly preferred a Pro or Val at P3, we substituted the P3 Phe with Pro in TFMI-2b (PCRAVKR) and Val in TFMI-2c (VCRAVKR). TFPI1 D2 and TFMI-2a-c were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity.

https://openalex.org/W2931276516,"Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in North American tortoises (Gopherus) has been the focus of numerous laboratory and field investigations, yet the prevalence and importance of this disease remains unclear across many tortoise populations. Furthermore, much research has been focused on understanding diagnostic biomarkers of two known agents of URTD, Mycoplasma agassizii and Mycoplasma testudineum, yet the reliability and importance of these diagnostic biomarkers across populations is unclear. Gopher Tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) have experienced significant declines and are currently protected range wide. Geographically, Alabama represents an important connection for Gopher Tortoise populations between the core and periphery of this species’ distribution. Herein, we systematically sampled 197 Gopher Tortoises for URTD across seven sites in south-central and south-eastern Alabama. Plasma samples were assayed for antibodies to M. agassizii and M. testudineum; nasal lavage samples were assayed for the presence of viable pathogens as well as pathogen DNA. Lastly, animals were scored for the presence of external symptoms and nasal scarring consistent with URTD. External symptoms of URTD were present in G. polyphemus in all sites sampled in Alabama. There was no relationship between active symptoms of URTD and Mycoplasma antibodies, however the presence of URTD nasal scarring was positively related to M. agassizii antibodies (P = 0.032). For a single site that was sampled in three sequential years, seroprevalence to M. agassizii significantly varied among years (P < 0.0001). Mycoplasma agassizii DNA was isolated from four of the seven sites using quantitative PCR, yet none of the samples were culture positive for either of the pathogens. An analysis of disease status and condition indicated that there was a significant, positive relationship between the severity of URTD symptoms and relative body mass (P < 0.05). This study highlights the need for continued monitoring of disease in wild populations. Specifically, focus must be placed on identifying other likely pathogens and relevant biomarkers that may be important drivers of URTD in North American tortoises. Special consideration should be given to environmental contexts that may render wild populations more susceptible to disease."
https://openalex.org/W2932441661,"Accurate estimation of the instantaneous heart rate (HR) using a reflectance-type photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is challenging because the dominant frequency observed in the PPG signal corrupted by motion artifacts (MAs) does not usually overlap the true HR, especially during high-intensity exercise. Recent studies have proposed various MA cancellation and HR estimation algorithms that use simultaneously measured acceleration signals as noise references for accurate HR estimation. These algorithms provide accurate results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 2 beats per minute (bpm). However, some of their results deviate significantly from the true HRs by more than 5 bpm. To overcome this problem, the present study modifies the power spectrum of the PPG signal by emphasizing the power of the frequency corresponding to the true HR. The modified power spectrum is obtained using a Gaussian kernel function and a previous estimate of the instantaneous HR. Because the modification is effective only when the previous estimate is accurate, a recently reported finite state machine framework is used for real-time validation of each instantaneous HR result. The power spectrum of the PPG signal is modified only when the previous estimate is validated. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by rigorous comparison of its results with those of existing algorithms using the ISPC dataset (n = 23). Compared to the method without MA cancellation, the proposed algorithm decreases the MAE value significantly from 6.73 bpm to 1.20 bpm (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the resultant MAE value is lower than that obtained by any other state-of-the-art method. Significant reduction (from 10.89 bpm to 2.14 bpm, p < 0.001) is also shown in a separate experiment with 24 subjects."

Atomistic simulations of formation of these phases and transitions between them are computationally prohibitive, hence development of coarse-grained models is an important part of the methodological development in this area. Here we apply systematic bottom-up coarse-graining to model different phase structures formed by 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) lipid molecules. We started from atomistic simulations of DOPE lipids in water carried out at two different water/lipid molar ratio corresponding to the lamellar Lα and inverted hexagonal HII structures at low and high lipid concentrations respectively. The atomistic trajectories were mapped to coarse-grained trajectories, in which each lipid was represented by 14 coarse-grained sites. Then the inverse Monte Carlo method was used to compute the effective coarse-grained potentials which for the coarse-grain model reproduce the same structural properties as the atomistic simulations. The potentials derived from the low concentration atomistic simulation were only able to form a bilayer structure, while both Lα and HII lipid phases were formed in simulations with potentials obtained at high concentration. The typical atomistic configurations of lipids at high concentration combine fragments of both lamellar and non-lamellar structures, that is reflected in the extracted coarse-grained potentials which become transferable and can form a wide range of structures including the inverted hexagonal, bilayer, tubule, vesicle and micellar structures."

https://openalex.org/W2933274605,"During CD8+ T cell response, Notch signaling controls short-lived-effector-cell (SLEC) generation, but the exact mechanisms by which it does so remains unclear. The Notch signaling pathway can act as a key regulator of Akt signaling via direct transcriptional induction of Hes1, which will then repress the transcription of Pten, an inhibitor of Akt signaling. As both Notch and Akt signaling can promote effector CD8+ T cell differentiation, we asked whether Notch signaling influences SLEC differentiation via the HES1-PTEN axis. Here, we demonstrate that HES1 deficiency in murine CD8+ T cells did not impact SLEC differentiation. Moreover, we show that Pten transcriptional repression in effector CD8+ T cells is not mediated by Notch signaling although Akt activation requires Notch signaling. Therefore, HES1 is not an effector of Notch signaling during CD8+ T cell response."

These assessments revealed that 9 of the 13 human V-ATPase subunits can partially or fully complement the function of the corresponding yeast subunits. Importantly, sequence similarity was not necessarily correlated with functional complementation. We also found that besides all Vo domain subunits, the V1 F subunit is required for proper assembly of the Vo domain at the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, the human H subunit fully restored the level of vacuolar acidification, but only partially rescued calcium-sensitive growth, suggesting a specific role of the H subunit in V-ATPase activity.

Furthermore, a population dynamics of A. gossypii and lacewing (mainly C. carnea) were highly similar in the SGK321 and SY321 treatments during 2016-2017.

The protein had a subunit molecular weight of ca. 45 kDa by SDS-PAGE and preferred short-chain esters when p-nitrophenyl alkanoate esters were used as substrates. Optimum condition for VvFrsA was found to be at pH 9.0 and 50 °C. The protein retained high esterase activity at alkaline condition and would denature slowly at over 50 °C. With p-nitrophenyl acetate as the substrate, the Km and kcat were determined to be 18.6 mM and 0.67 s-1, respectively, by steady-state kinetic assay. Molecular dynamics simulation and docking model structure revealed that p-nitrophenyl acetate could be the substrate of VvFrsA. In conclusion our results demonstrated that the protein was able to catalyze the hydrolysis of esters, especially p-nitrophenyl acetate, for the first time."

To better understand the transmission of early life circumstances, this paper analyses the effects of health and financial situation during childhood on quality of life after retirement as well as the mediating role of later life health, educational level, and income in this association. Moreover, this study is the first to compare these pathways across European regions. The analyses are based on data of 13,092 retirees aged ≥ 60 and ≤ 85 years from the fifth wave of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) with full information on childhood and later life measures of health, educational level, financial situation, and quality of life as well as relevant covariates. Five European regions are studied: Central-Western Europe (Austria, Germany), Central-Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia), Northern Europe (Denmark, Sweden), Southern Europe (Italy, Spain), and Western Europe (Belgium, France, The Netherlands). Path analysis is used to identify the direct and indirect effects of childhood measures on quality of life. We find retirees’ quality of life to be associated with childhood finances and health in all five European regions. While both the direct and indirect effects of childhood health are rather moderate and homogeneous across regions, especially the direct effects of childhood finances on quality of life after retirement display a distinct North-South gradient being strongest in Southern Europe. Potential explanations for the regional variations are differences in the countries’ welfare systems."
https://openalex.org/W2934060678,"It is a great honor for me to receive the prestigious Gairdner Award for Biomedical Research. The title of this essay might imply that it will contain advice on how to win such a major scientific prize. However, my intention is quite different. More in keeping with the famous civil rights song of the same name, my hope is to articulate a bigger picture view of what matters in the long run. Why do we do science? What is fulfilling about a career in science? Is an international prize the pinnacle of success, or are there more important outcomes? Prizes recognize fortunate scientists who have unearthed some amazing attribute of living organisms. Under slightly different circumstances and perhaps a bit later, another scientist would have uncovered the same treasure. Thus, winning a major prize is unpredictable; there are too many contingent factors beyond one’s control. Most readers of this article will not win a major prize. However, most scientists will experience the joy of discovery. Unlike awards, which are few in number, discoveries are not uncommon. Unlike international awards, discoveries are bestowed upon undergraduates as well as senior scientists. Even small discoveries can be immensely rewarding. A discovery, along with the people with whom it can be shared, is a “prize” worthy of our attention and aspiration. Such satisfaction is accessible to many people in the scientific profession, if they are cognizant about keeping their eyes on the prize. During high school, many students perform laboratory experiments that are intended mostly to reproduce known outcomes (and one’s grade might suffer if results deviate from the expected). I remember the first time I did a real experiment for a science fair project for my biology class at Hollywood High School. I read somewhere that plants and animals could tell time and that these circadian rhythms govern many of their behaviors. How amazing! I first wanted to measure a circadian rhythm myself, specifically the up-and-down motions of the leaves of a bean plant during day and night (see movie). Clearing out a space in our cluttered basement, I built a kymograph consisting of a motor that slowly rotated a coffee can with paper wrapping its exterior; an ink pen, attached via a string to the plant leaf, would trace the motion of the leaf on the rotating paper. It was not very complicated, but I was terrifically pleased that I got it to work. With this initial success under my belt, I then thought it would be fun to trick the clock and see how it responded to light-dark cycles that strayed from the 24 hour day. What would happen if I turned the lights on and off in my basement every 6 hours? It was the first time I tried to pose my own question and answer it. That was the start of my scientific career. It was a thrill to be on the hunt for knowledge, rather than just memorizing it. I have had a career of posing curiosity-driven questions ever since. When it came time to present what I thought was an awesome biology project, my biology teacher did not award me with the top grade (similar to “referee 3” of some of my latter scientific papers). However, I expressed my enthusiasm for the project to my high school counselor Ella Hogan. Ella took the initiative of calling a laboratory at UCLA working on circadian rhythms to see if they would take in a high school student who was keen on doing research. The professor (Dr. Karl Hammer) agreed to let me work in his laboratory, and I graduated from my basement to doing experiments in a real laboratory in the Department of Plant Physiology. At the start, my mother patiently drove me—before I had my independent driver's license— to UCLA. Being in high school in those days (1970s) was different than today. Students were not seeking internships and trying to amass multi-page CVs to look good for colleges. I was just doing research because it was interesting and fun (along with other things that teenage kids did in Hollywood, California, at the time). The point of this tale is that I enjoyed measuring bean plant movements. In fact, from my memory, I enjoyed doing science as much in high school as I do now. Naturally, the level of science has advanced. The home-built kymograph has been supplanted by lab-built single-molecule and light sheet microscopes. My presentations have advanced from science fairs to international conferences. Rudimentary high school results evolved into findings recognized by the Gairdner Award jury. However, I always enjoyed what I was capable of doing at the time. You don’t need to be a Gairdner Award winner to enjoy science. Setting one’s sights on answering an interesting scientific question is important. However, nature does not give up its secrets readily. As students advance from college to graduate school, one of the hardest lessons they learn is that many experiments don’t work and that science takes time. The rapid and (for achievers) positive feedback of mid-terms and finals is replaced by the real world situation of conquering the unknown. When it comes to obtaining interpretable results, nature does not grade on a bell curve. Students have to learn patience and resilience, which is as important as learning new techniques. Fortunately, my strongest attributes are patience and determination, which have served me well in my scientific career. Where is the pleasure in an endeavor that is marked by more failures than victories; where the final goal is a scientific paper that often takes years to produce; where jobs and career advancement are not guaranteed? The answer is in small victories—they are all around if you look for them. The protein preparation that finally worked; arriving at the right salt concentration for your experiment; having the microscope stay in focus for the entire time-lapse movie; etc. Not big results perhaps, but they are personal victories. A moment to congratulate oneself; a good day in the lab to savor. These small victories are the foundation of science; collectively they add up to a successful scientific career. You cannot bypass them on the way to a big result. Importantly, you don’t need to wait for years until the acceptance of a paper or decades until a Gairdner award. Fortunately, pleasure and satisfaction in a scientific project can happen more frequently and to many more people, and one should aim to recognize and acknowledge such moments when they happen. Science is all about the data. Or is it? In addition to results, science is a rich network of social interactions. A well-functioning scientific laboratory is like a family. It is a place of wonderful social interactions and an environment that provides a support structure. Beyond the laboratory, scientists establish deep friendships across the globe, bonds created by shared interests in science as well as by compatible personalities. These interactions have lasting and important value. Friendships established in a laboratory are often friendships for life. Collaborators frequently continue their friendship well beyond an initial connection made through a mutual need of obtaining results. Young scientists remember their kind mentors for their entire lives. Senior scientists are gratified when their mentees return to share their appreciation and memories. So much attention now is focused on obtaining “high impact” papers, unfortunately measured by publication in a very limited set of journals. A great paper can make a splash and influence the work of other scientists (an important mark of success). However, that high profile paper might be largely forgotten after a few years. Friendships in science, however, can easily last years and often a lifetime. Scientists who understand this and have nurtured these interactions have received a valuable “prize”. They are well-connected and valued by other individuals in the scientific community. This prize is accessible to many scientists, junior and senior, provided that they are mindful of the value of people and not just papers. If we, as scientists, manage to climb up one rung on the career ladder, it is our responsibility to reach down with the other hand and pull the next person up. In addition to being a responsibility, “paying it forward” also creates a sense of well-being and contribution. I shared a story about my high school counselor; her time and attention had an impact, as it shaped my life and career. I had little to offer her concretely at the time. However, I think that my keen interest and appreciation was rewarding to her. Now that I am older, my career has shifted from being a recipient of opportunity to one who now can focus on supporting others. I make few discoveries with my own hands these days (my last significant one being in 2013). My own hunt for discovery has evolved into vicarious enjoyment of watching trainees go through that process. That role has its own gratification. Seeing young scientists become engaged with science—that is fun! Having a postdoctoral fellow move on to their dream job—that is satisfying! You don’t need to be famous, be at prestigious university, or win the Gairdner Award to pay it forward. You don’t even need to wait to reach my ripe old age. College students can inspire and mentor high school students. Graduate students can help college students. And so on. There is always some one who will benefit from your attention. This prize in science is awarded to all who show kindness and are willing to look beyond their own career to help others. There is only so much that one can discover oneself. A year may go by without an exciting result. Fortunately, the overall scientific enterprise is creating a continuous stream of exciting results. Why not enjoy them too? I enjoy being a scientist, because of the extraordinary opportunity to keep learning. I am a student at heart, and the scientific profession embodies this philosophy in the duties of the job. I am continually amazed by the inner workings of living organisms and their seemingly limitless adaptations. These interesting features of life are being unraveled at a dizzying pace. I feel fortunate to have been trained with the appropriate knowledge and skills to allow me to appreciate the life sciences in these exciting times. It is a joy to listen to a fantastic seminar or read about a clever technique developed by another group. I am happy to hear about science being done beyond the boundaries of my own laboratory. This prize is accessible to undergraduates and Gairdner Award winners alike. We all can enjoy hearing about new results and be in awe of the wondrous attributes of life. I am very fortunate to have received the Gairdner Award in Biomedical Research, which recognizes approximately two decades of work on the motor protein kinesin from its discovery to the dissection of its mechanism of movement. Without diminishing the honor that I feel on having been selected for this award, I feel that my greatest prize has been the privilege of a life connected with science. I have enjoyed innumerable discoveries, both my own and those of others, and I have met many kind and interesting people along the way. My best advice to young scientists is to keep your eyes on these prizes. If you do, everything else will fall into place."
https://openalex.org/W2924443509,"In this paper, I aim to explore the effect of good governance on equity returns, and empirically investigate if governance at the country level has asset pricing implications and contributes to the idiosyncrasy of price jumps. Jumps are found to be far less systematic than the smooth (non-jump) component of country price indexes. Hence, if jumps are more idiosyncratic, governance should primarily affect the jump risk component. This is good news for international investors, because diversification provides insurance against jumps. Relying on an equilibrium asset-pricing model in an economy under jump diffusion, I decompose the moments of the returns of international stock markets into a diffusive (systematic) risk and a (idiosyncratic) jump risk part. For a balanced panel of 52 countries, my results suggest that governance is an important determinant of (idiosyncratic) jump risk. Stock markets in poorly governed countries are characterized by higher volatility and more negative return asymmetry, primarily driven by the higher jump risk. Regulatory quality, the government effectiveness and the control of corruption appear to be most important. Results are robust to the inclusion of various controls for other country- or market-specific characteristics."

We hypothesized that osteopontin (OPN), an inflammatory protein with enhanced activity when proteolytically cleaved, affects the number of viable T cells in adipose tissue and assessed inhibition of the interaction between T cells and thrombin and matrix metalloproteinases-cleaved OPN using antibodies and postimmune sera. Gene expression of T cell markers in adipose tissue from wild-type (wt) and Spp1-/- (OPN deficient) mice was analyzed after 16 weeks of high fat diet (HFD) or low fat diet (LFD) feeding. CD3, CD8 and OPN gene expression in omental adipose tissue from individuals with obesity was measured. OPN-T cell interactions were assessed with a fluorescence-based adhesion assay and blocked with antibodies targeting OPN. Comparison of T cell gene expression in adipose tissue from wt and Spp1-/- mice showed that OPN affected the number of T cells while in humans, levels of OPN correlated with T cell markers in omental adipose tissue. The interaction between T cells and cleaved OPN was blocked by postimmune sera following OPN peptide vaccinations and with monoclonal antibodies. In conclusion, levels of OPN affected the number of T cells in obesity and antibodies against cleaved OPN antagonize OPN-T cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2931487638,"Workers trained in STEM are generally viewed as essential for innovation-led economic growth. Yet, recent statistics suggest that a majority of STEM undergraduates do not go on to pursue innovation-focused careers in their fields of study. We investigate whether STEM students who do not self-select into innovative tasks are doing so because they are less capable than their peers who do. We find that monetary inducement among STEM students increases aggregate innovative output, but that low-GPA students who were induced significantly underperform relative to low-GPA students who self-selected; however, induced and self-selected high-GPA students perform statistically the same. In contrast, words of encouragement appears to benefit those students with the lowest GPAs. Our results highlight the value of efforts to increase the pool of STEM students who pursue innovative careers and underscore the importance of interventions targeted at specific student subgroups to maximize the returns on those efforts."
