https://openalex.org/W1991603311,"The striatum, which is the major component of the basal ganglia in the brain, is regulated in part by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. Severe movement disorders result from the loss of striatal dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease. Rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a model for Parkinson's disease and show alterations in gene expression in the two major output systems of the striatum to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Striatopallidal neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced elevation in their specific expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the D2 dopamine receptor and enkephalin, which is reversed by subsequent continuous treatment with the D2 agonist quinpirole. Conversely, striatonigral neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced reduction in their specific expression of mRNAs encoding the D1 dopamine receptor and substance P, which is reversed by subsequent daily injections of the D1 agonist SKF-38393. This treatment also increases dynorphin mRNA in striatonigral neurons. Thus, the differential effects of dopamine on striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons are mediated by their specific expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1972354503,"The mechanism by which T lymphocytes are tolerized to self or foreign antigens is still controversial. Clonal deletion is the major mechanism of tolerance for immature thymocytes; for mature T cells, tolerance is considered to reflect anergy rather than deletion, and to be a consequence of defective presentation of antigen. This paper documents a novel form of tolerance resulting when mature T cells encounter antigen in immunogenic form. Evidence is presented that exposure of mature T cells to Mlsa antigens in vivo leads to specific tolerance and disappearance of Mlsa-reactive Vβ6+ T cells. Surprisingly, the clonal elimination of Vβ6+ cells is preceded by marked expansion of these cells. Thus, tolerance induction can be the end result of a powerful immune response. These data raise important questions concerning the relationship of tolerance and memory."

https://openalex.org/W2014445311,"The gradual accumulation of cyclin in the frog egg induces an abrupt and concerted activation of p34cdc2 that initiates mitosis. Activation is delayed even after the accumulation of cyclin to a critical threshold concentration. We have reproduced these unusual kinetic properties of p34cdc2 activation in vitro using bacterially expressed cyclin proteins and extracts derived from Xenopus eggs. Abrupt activation follows a lag period, the length of which is independent of the concentration of cyclin. The threshold concentration of cyclin and the length of the lag period are regulated by INH, an inhibitor of MPF activation in oocytes recently identified as a type 2A protein phosphatase. Binding to cyclin induces both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation of the previously unphosphorylated p34cdc2, rendering it inactivated. The concerted transition into mitosis involves both a reduction in the rate of p34cdc2 phosphorylation on tyrosine and an increase in its rate of dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2043736935,"Mononuclear phagocytes (microglia, macrophages, and macrophage-like giant cells) are the principal cellular targets for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in the central nervous system (CNS). Since HIV-1 does not directly infect neurons, the causes for CNS dysfunction in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) remain uncertain. HIV-1-infected human monocytoid cells, but not infected human lymphoid cells, released toxic agents that destroy chick and rat neurons in culture. These neurotoxins were small, heat-stable, protease-resistant molecules that act by way of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Macrophages and microglia infected with HIV-1 may produce neurologic disease through chronic secretion of neurotoxic factors."

https://openalex.org/W1969219687,"We have purified the 36 and 63 kd cellular proteins known to associate with polyomavirus middle and small tumor (T) antigens and SV40 small t antigen. Microsequencing of the 36 kd protein indicated that it was probably identical to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Identity was confirmed by comigration on two-dimensional (2D) gels and by 2D analysis of complete chymotryptic digests. In addition, PP2A-like phosphatase activity was detected in immunoprecipitates of wild-type middle T. Immunoblotting experiments, comigration on 2D gels, and 2D analysis of limit chymotryptic digests demonstrated that the 63 kd protein, present in the middle T complex in approximately equimolar ratio to the 36 kd protein, is a known regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Finally, the 36 kd PP2A catalytic subunit can be immunoprecipitated by anti-pp60c-src antisera only from cells expressing wild-type middle T These results suggest that complex formation between PP2A and T antigens may be important for T antigen-mediated transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2095147188,"alpha factor is a negative growth factor and differentiation factor that induces G1 arrest and increases transcription of mating genes in S. cerevisiae a cells. We have identified a gene, FAR1 (for ""factor arrest""), which is necessary for cell cycle arrest but not for other responses to alpha factor: far1- mutants are insensitive to arrest despite having an intact signal transduction pathway. FAR1 is a nonessential gene whose expression is induced 4- to 5-fold in a cells by alpha factor. The sequence of FAR1 indicates no significant similarities to known proteins. A null mutation in the CLN2 gene, which codes for a G1 cyclin, reverses the effect of a far1 null mutation: far1- cln2- strains arrest in response to alpha factor. We thus propose that FAR1 contributes to cell cycle arrest by inhibiting CLN2. The behavior of far1- cln2- strains indicates that products other than FAR1 are responsible for inhibiting the other G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN3."
https://openalex.org/W1988110468,"A genetic system was developed in Escherichia coli to study leucine zippers with the amino-terminal domain of bacteriophage lambda repressor as a reporter for dimerization. This system was used to analyze the importance of the amino acid side chains at eight positions that form the hydrophobic interface of the leucine zipper dimer from the yeast transcriptional activator, GCN4. When single amino acid substitutions were analyzed, most functional variants contained hydrophobic residues at the dimer interface, while most nonfunctional sequence variants contained strongly polar or helix-breaking residues. In multiple randomization experiments, however, many combinations of hydrophobic residues were found to be nonfunctional, and leucines in the heptad repeat were shown to have a special function in leucine zipper dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2076474820,"Mice have an olfactory (pheromone) recognition memory located at the first relay in the sensory system. It is acquired with one-trial learning, contingent upon norepinephrine activation at mating, and lasts for several weeks. The mechanism involves Hebbian (association-dependent) changes in synaptic efficacy at dendrodendritic synapses in the accessory olfactory bulb. As a result of this memory, males made familiar by mating are recognized by the females, thereby mitigating pregnancy block. Such a memory function is biologically important to the female, as it is required to sustain pregnancy in the presence of her stud male's odors."
https://openalex.org/W1508005550,"The alpha-adrenergic receptors mediate the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on cellular signaling systems via guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). Three alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes have been cloned: the alpha 1, the alpha 2-C10, and the alpha 2-C4 adrenergic receptors. To investigate functional differences between the different subtypes, we assessed the ability of each to interact with adenylyl cyclase and polyphosphoinositide metabolism by permanently and transiently expressing the DNAs encoding the alpha 1, the alpha 2-C10, and the alpha 2-C4 adrenergic receptors in cells lacking endogenous alpha-adrenergic receptors. Both alpha 2-C10 and alpha 2-C4 couple primarily to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and to a lesser extent to stimulation of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. alpha 2-C10 inhibits adenylyl cyclase more efficiently than alpha 2-C4. Effects of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on adenylyl cyclase inhibition and on polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis are both mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. The major coupling system of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor is activation of phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein. alpha 1-Adrenergic receptor stimulation can also increase intracellular cAMP by a mechanism that does not involve direct activation of adenylyl cyclase. As with the muscarinic cholinergic receptor family our results show that each of the alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes can couple to multiple signal transduction pathways and suggest several generalities about the effector coupling mechanisms of G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2106351063,"The bovine heart F0F1-ATPase preparation (Serrano, R., Kanner, B., and Racker, E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2453-2461) has been further delipidated. The lipid-deficient preparation contained 2.5 mol of cardiolipin, 1 mol of phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 1 mol of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) per mol of F0F1. When reconstituted with asolectin the delipidated preparation exhibited an activity of 13 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein which was 88% oligomycin-sensitive. The phospholipids in this preparation were analyzed by 31P NMR spectroscopy to determine if they were immobilized by the enzyme (rendered NMR-invisible). The PC and PE were below the limits of detection under the conditions utilized and the cardiolipin was NMR-invisible until the enzyme was denatured by addition of either 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or 8 M urea. Addition of cardiolipin to the delipidated preparation and subsequent analysis by NMR spectroscopy revealed that approximately 4 mol of cardiolipin were immobilized per mol of F0F1 ATPase. The enzyme appears to have high affinity for cardiolipin exclusively, since PC (a prominent inner membrane lipid), phosphatidyl serine (an acidic phospholipid), and phosphatidyl glycerol (the precursor to cardiolipin) were not immobilized (rendered NMR-invisible) when added to the delipidated preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1551561822,"The mechanism underlying phagosomal acidification was studied in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages. The pH of the phagosomal compartment (pHp) was measured fluorimetrically in macrophage suspensions following ingestion of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Staphylococcus aureus. At 37 degrees C, pHp decreased rapidly, reaching a steady state value of 5.8-6.1, while the cytoplasmic pH remained near neutrality, pH 7.1. The phagosome to cytosol pH gradient could be collapsed by addition of nigericin, monensin, or weak bases. The substrate dependence and inhibitor sensitivity profile of phagosomal acidification were investigated in intact and permeabilized cells. Phagosomal acidification was inhibited when ATP was depleted using metabolic inhibitors or permeabilizing the plasma membrane by electroporation. In permeabilized cells, acidification could be initiated by readdition of both Mg2+ and ATP. Neither adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate nor adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate supported phagosomal acidification. Inhibitors of F1F0-type H(+)-ATPase such as oligomycin and azide, and the E1E2-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate had no effect on phagosomal acidification. In contrast, the rate of phagosomal acidification was reduced by micromolar concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In permeabilized cells, nitrate inhibited the acidification with an apparent Ki of 25 mM. Phagosomal acidification was also effectively blocked by the macrolide antibiotic bafilomycin A1, with an apparent Ki of approximately 3 mM in both intact and electroporated cells. In this concentration range, bafilomycin A1 selectively inhibits vacuolar H(+)-ATPases. The substrate requirement and inhibitor susceptibility profile of phagosomal acidification strongly suggest that proton translocation across the phagosomal membrane is mediated by a vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2079474210,"A novel modulatory site on the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor that is sensitive to sulfhydryl redox reagents was recently described. Here we report that this redox modulatory site is susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species endogenous to the CNS. Oxygen free radicals generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase were observed to decrease NMDA-induced changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations and NMDA-evoked cation currents in cortical neurons in culture. Additionally, a sublethal production of free radicals by xanthine and xanthine oxidase reversed a dithiothreitol-induced enhancement of NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro. These results show that NMDA receptor function is modulated at its redox site by endogenous substances that normally accompany tissue reperfusion following an ischemic event. This novel mechanism for NMDA receptor regulation may have profound implications in the outcome of glutamate neurotoxicity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2106355009,"The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is localized to specific subcellular environments through binding of dimeric regulatory subunits (RII) to anchoring proteins. Cytoskeletal localization occurs through RII dimer interaction with the PKA substrate molecule microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). RII alpha deletion mutants and RII alpha/endonexin chimeras retained MAP2 binding activity if they contained the first 79 residues of the molecule. Disruption of RII alpha dimerization always prevented MAP2 interaction because 1) RII delta 1-14 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-14) was unable to bind MAP2 or form dimers, and 2) a modified RII alpha monomer including residues 1-14 did not bind MAP2. Chimeric proteins containing the first 30 residues of RII alpha fused to endonexin II formed dimers but did not bind MAP2. This suggested other side-chains between residues 30-79 also participate in MAP2 interaction. Peptide studies indicate additional contact with MAP2 may occur through an acidic region (residues 68-82) close to the RII autoinhibitor domain. Therefore, anchored PKA holoenzyme topology may position the catalytic subunit and MAP2 as to allow its preferential phosphorylation upon kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2050273056,"We have developed an assay for a key step in the replication of adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA. We demonstrate the covalently joined ends of linear AAV DNA can be resolved in vitro to the open duplex configuration. Only extracts prepared from human cells that have been infected with both adenovirus and AAV are capable of carrying out the reaction. The reaction is initiated by a site-specific and strand-specific endonucleolytic cut at a terminal resolution site near the end of the AAV terminal palindrome. During resolution the orientation of the terminal palindrome is inverted, and the 3' viral strand is extended by DNA synthesis. The size of the newly synthesized 3' strand is nearly identical to that found in viral particles. These observations provide direct biochemical evidence for an essential step in the model for AAV DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1534308634,"The role of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) in the cytotoxic action of diphtheria toxin (DT) was studied by using bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase. Studies with acridine orange showed that the acidification of intracellular acidic compartments was inhibited strongly when Vero cells were treated with 500 nM bafilomycin A1, indicating that bafilomycin effectively inhibits V-ATPase when it is added to the culture medium. The toxicity of DT to Vero cells, which was determined by the inhibition of protein synthesis by DT, was inhibited partially by bafilomycin at 10 nM and inhibited completely at 500 nM. Therefore, V-ATPase is involved in the expression of the toxicity of DT. Studies using 125I-labeled DT showed that bafilomycin inhibited the degradation of internalized DT, indicating that V-ATPase is also involved in this step. Subcellular fractionation revealed that 125I-DT accumulated mainly in the endosome fraction, and not in the lysosome fraction, when the cells were incubated with 125I-DT in the presence of bafilomycin. Under the cell fractionation conditions similar to those used for the DT-treated cells, we determined the location of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor in the degradation pathway. The result suggests that bafilomycin A1 does not inhibit the transport of epidermal growth factor to lysosome."
https://openalex.org/W1507938571,"The alpha subunit of the FcERI binds IgE with high affinity. Previous studies have demonstrated that alpha subunit expression requires the presence of beta and/or gamma subunits, and it is not known how these two subunits contribute to the ability of the alpha subunit to bind IgE. In this report, we describe the expression and characterization of a human chimeric alpha subunit. The data demonstrate that high affinity IgE binding does not require the presence of the beta and/or gamma subunits and that this activity is localized to the extracellular domain (residues 26-201) of the human alpha subunit. Permanent cell lines expressing the chimeric receptor were used to characterize the binding parameters of the alpha subunit. These cell lines provide a means of identifying therapeutic agents which may be effective in the treatment/management of allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1989436343,"We examined the subcellular distribution of specific mRNAs in cultured sympathetic neurons. Under appropriate conditions, sympathetic neurons extend both axons and dendrites that are distinguishable by light microscopic and immunocytochemical criteria. In situ hybridization revealed a differential localization of mRNA within dendrites. mRNA encoding MAP2 was abundant in cell bodies and distributed nonhomogeneously throughout the dendritic compartment, but was not detected in axons. In contrast, mRNAs encoding GAP-43 and alpha-tubulin were restricted to the cell body and largely excluded from dendrites as well as axons. Detergent extraction revealed that most dendrite-associated mRNA encoding MAP2 was associated with the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of the cell. The subset of mRNAs present in the dendritic compartment may encode proteins involved in the morphogenesis and remodeling of dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2014431638,"The functional association between DNA topoisomerase I and gene activity has been analyzed using the tightly regulated c-fos proto-oncogene, which undergoes rapid transitions between active and inactive states of transcription. We show that the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin can be used to measure topoisomerase I activity throughout the transcription cycle of the c-fos gene. Upon induction of c-fos transcription in the presence of camptothecin, topoisomerase I cleavages spread through the gene in the 5' to 3' direction and concomitantly transcriptional elongation is retarded. Parallel kinetic measurements of RNA polymerase II activity and topoisomerase I activity demonstrate a quantitative and temporal link between the two enzymes. Our results argue that topoisomerase I quantitatively relieves the torsional consequences of transcriptional elongation in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1841850482,"The Na/K/2Cl cotransport system in the avian erythrocyte can be activated by agents that raise intracellular cAMP suggesting the involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) in its regulation. Another group of stimuli including fluoride and hypertonicity stimulate cotransport via cAMP-independent means. To further investigate the role of phosphorylation in these processes, we examined the effects of protein kinase inhibitors of 8 (p-Cl-phenylthio)-cAMP (cpt-cAMP), fluoride and hypertonic activation of cotransport in duck red cells, and [3H]bumetanide binding to isolated membranes. Preincubation of cells with the kinase inhibitors K-252a (Ki approximately 1.6 microM) and H-9 (Ki approximately 100 microM) blocked cpt-cAMP activation of bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb influx and bumetanide binding. These inhibitors also led to a rapid deactivation of cotransport and decrease in bumetanide binding when added to cells maximally stimulated by cpt-cAMP. K-252a and H-9 inhibited cotransport activation by cAMP-independent stimuli, but 10-fold higher concentrations were required, implying the involvement of a cAMP-independent phosphorylation process in the mechanism of action of these agents. Removal of stimuli that elevate cAMP leads to a rapid reversal of cotransport indicating the presence of active protein phosphatases in these cells. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA, EC50: 630 nM) stimulated both Na/K/2Cl cotransport and bumetanide binding to membranes. As with fluoride and hypertonic stimulation, the OA effect was inhibited only at relatively high concentrations of K-252a. Phosphorylation of the membrane skeletal protein goblin (Mr 230,000) at specific cAMP-dependent sites was used as an in situ marker for the state of activation of cAMP-PK. Goblin phosphorylation at these sites was increased by norepinephrine and cpt-cAMP and rapidly reversed by K-252a and H-9, confirming that both inhibitors do block cAMP-PK activity. While OA markedly increased overall phosphorylation of many erythrocyte membrane proteins, including goblin, it did not affect goblin phosphorylation at specific cAMP-dependent sites. These results implicate a cAMP-independent protein kinase in the mediation of the OA effect on cotransport and bumetanide binding. The bumetanide-binding component of the avian erythrocyte cotransporter, an Mr approximately 150,000 protein that can be photolabeled with the bumetanide analog [3H]4-benzoyl-5-sulfamoyl-3-(3-thenyloxy)-benzoic acid was found to be a phosphoprotein. These results strongly support the hypothesis that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, possibly of the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter itself, regulates the activity of"
https://openalex.org/W1574815731,"We have used immunoelectron microscopy to determine the location of an intermediate chain in the isolated outer arm dynein from Chlamydomonas flagella. When the purified alpha beta dimer of the outer arm was incubated with antibodies recognizing two distinct epitopes on its 69-kDa intermediate chain and then negatively stained and examined by electron microscopy, both antibodies appeared to have bound to the base of the Y-shaped stem that connects the two heads of the particle. These results indicate that this intermediate chain is located at the base of the stem. Inasmuch as this polypeptide is tightly associated with the 78-kDa intermediate chain and several light chains in an intermediate chain-light chain complex, it is likely that this entire assemblage is located at the base of the particle. Thus, these polypeptides are in a potentially important position with regard to the ATP-insensitive (structural end) binding of dynein to microtubules and to dynein-dynein interactions within the axoneme."
https://openalex.org/W1579731099,"Amino acids in three highly conserved segments of the Ca2(+)-ATPase. Asp-Pro-Pro-Arg604, Thr-Gly-Asp627, Thr-Gly-Asp703 as well as Asp707, have been proposed to participate in formation of the nucleotide binding site. We have tested this hypothesis by investigating the properties of mutants with alterations to amino acids within these segments. Most of the mutants were found to be defective in Ca2+ transport function. The inactive mutants could be separated into two classes on the basis of the kinetics of phosphoenzyme intermediate formation and decomposition. One group, Asp601----Asn, Pro603----Leu, Asp627----Glu, and Asp703----Asn, formed phosphoenzyme intermediates with ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and with inorganic phosphate only in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that both the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites and the nucleotide binding sites were intact. In each of these mutants, however, the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) decayed to the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate very slowly, relative to the wild-type enzyme. Thus the inability of these mutants to transport Ca2+ was accounted for by an apparent block of the transport reaction at the E1P to E2P conformational transition. Another group, Asp601----Glu, Pro603----Gly, Asp707----Glu, and Asp707----Asn, did not form detectable phosphoenzyme intermediates from either ATP or Pi. Although we have demonstrated an effect on Ca2+ transport of mutations in each of the highly conserved regions predicted to be involved in ATP binding, we cannot yet define their roles in ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport."
https://openalex.org/W1519297452,"In a study of the vectorial secretion of proteins by bovine aortic arch endothelial cells, we found that the extracellular matrix macromolecules collagen and fibronectin as well as several matrix-degrading metalloproteinases were secreted selectively in the basal direction. In contrast, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases showed only a weak preference for the basal direction. Three proteins at 18-35 kDa were secreted with preference apically, counter to the basal secretion of approximately 70% of the total secreted protein. As expected, rabbit synovial fibroblasts, which were used as a control, secreted proteins, including collagen, gelatin-degrading proteinases, and casein-degrading proteinases, equally in apical and basal directions. The basal secretion of collagen, fibronectin, gelatinases, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases by bovine aortic arch endothelial cells suggests that the structural and functional polarity of these cells is manifested, in part, at the level of polarized secretion of matrix-related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1547117143,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a large complex assembly of eight subunits that functions as an inhibitor of the complement cascade. A portion of the C4BP in serum exists as a complex with protein S. This study demonstrated that another protein, serum amyloid P component (SAP), also formed a calcium-dependent complex with C4BP. The C4BP.SAP complex was detected by several methods including light scattering intensity, gel filtration, and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. This complex was of high affinity relative to serum levels of these proteins so that no dissociation was detected at 3% of serum protein concentrations. The C4BP.SAP complex was also detected in normal serum and the results suggested that there was virtually no free SAP or uncomplexed C4BP in normal serum. In addition to its complex with C4BP, SAP underwent other calcium-dependent associations such as binding to phospholipid vesicles and self-aggregation. Self-aggregation was highly cooperative with kinetics corresponding to a reaction that was 6th-order with respect to calcium and required about 1.5 mM calcium. In contrast, formation of the SAP.C4BP complex and interaction of SAP with membranes required only about 0.4 and 1.0 mM calcium, respectively. Thus, selection of the correct conditions allowed study of the SAP.C4BP interaction without interference from self-aggregation. All three of these interactions of SAP were mutually exclusive and the SAP. C4BP interaction appeared to be favored over self-aggregation or binding of SAP to phospholipids. It seems likely that the biologically dominant interaction for SAP is with C4BP. The SAP.C4BP complex interacted with protein S and these binding sites appeared to be entirely independent. Furthermore, SAP had little or no effect on the ability of C4BP to bind C4b. Finally, the entire complex of proteins (C4BP, SAP, protein S, and C4b) could associate with membranes in the presence of calcium. Membrane binding occurred through the protein S component. This rather complicated assemblage of proteins probably functions in a regulatory role for the complement cascade or other biological systems. It is possible that elevated levels of SAP or nonequivalent levels of SAP and C4BP could contribute to certain pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1496201232,"Primary human monocytes and the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were induced to express receptors for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta. Treatment of primary monocytes with dexamethasone resulted in a 10-fold increase in receptor number over untreated cells, to approximately 2,000 receptors/cell. Treatment of THP-1 cells with phorbol ester followed by prostaglandin E2 and dexamethasone resulted in the expression of approximately 30,000 receptors/cell. Competitive binding assays on THP-1 cells showed that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta bind to the same receptor. The monocyte IL-1R is significantly smaller (63 kDa) than the T cell IL-1R (80 kDa) and is immunologically distinct. However, induction of monocytes and monocytic cell lines leads to the appearance of an abundant mRNA of approximately 5,000 bases which hybridizes to a cDNA probe from the T cell-type IL-1R. Sequence data obtained from a cDNA clone of this mRNA indicate that the message is identical to the T cell IL-1R mRNA throughout the coding region. A smaller mRNA, also homologous to the T cell IL-1R mRNA, accumulated in induced THP-1 cells and has a shorter 3'-untranslated region than the larger. Data are presented which suggest that neither form of this message encodes the 63-kDa IL-1R, but rather that this protein is the product of a separate nonhomologous mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1531617221,"Vacuolar H(+)-ATPase was isolated from highly purified bovine kidney brush border, using a previously described immunoaffinity method. The affinity purified enzyme had reconstitutively active ATP-induced acidification that was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. The brush border H(+)-ATPase had a single pH optimum of 7.3, and a single Km for ATP of 360 microM. The enzyme showed no lipid activation; it had a substrate preference of ATP greater than ITP greater than UTP greater than GTP much greater than CTP, with an ATP:GTP selectivity of 1.69. The brush border H(+)-ATPase required no monovalent anion or cation for activity and was inhibited by the oxyanions NO3(-1) much greater than SO4(-2); sulfite stimulated activity at low concentrations and inhibited at higher concentrations. The inhibition produced by nitrate could not be attributed to dissociation of subunits from the enzyme. The divalent or trivalent cation preference was Mn+2 much greater than Mg+2 much greater than Co+2 greater than Al+3 greater than Ca+2 much greater than Ba+2,Sr+2; 1 mM Zn+2 inhibited the enzyme completely, but Cu+2 inhibited only 49% of activity at concentrations up to 5 mM. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of the brush border H(+)-ATPase showed subunits at Mr 70,000, a doublet at 56,000, 45,000, 42,000, 38,000, 33,000, 31,000, 15,000, 14,000, and 12,000. On two-dimensional gels, the pl value for the Mr 70,000 subunit was 6.3, for the Mr 56,000 was 6.4, and for the Mr 31,000 was 7.5-8.5, and microheterogeneity was observed in the Mr 56,000 and 31,000 subunits. A comparison of kidney cortex brush border H(+)-ATPase with kidney cortex microsomal H(+)-ATPase revealed differences in pH optimum, Km for ATP, lipid dependence, substrate preference, divalent ion preference, copper sensitivity, and in microheterogeneity of the Mr 56,000 and 31,000 subunits, providing evidence that different functional and structural classes of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase are segregated to specific membrane compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1483012720,"The first characterization of the kinetics and subcellular compartmentation of adenylate kinase activity in intact muscle has been accomplished using rat diaphragm equilibrated with [18O]water. Rates of adenylate kinase-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer were measured by appearance of 18O-labeled beta-phosphoryls in ADP and ATP resulting from the transfer to AMP of newly synthesized 18O-labeled gamma-ATP. Unique features of adenylate kinase catalysis were uncovered in the intact cell not predictable from cell free analysis. This enzyme activity, which in non-contracting muscle is limited to 1/1000 of the estimated Vmax (cell free) apparently because of restricted ADP availability, is localized in subcellular compartments that increase in size and/or number with contractile frequency. Contraction also causes frequency-dependent increments in adenylate kinase velocity (22-fold at 4 Hz) as does oxygen deprivation (35-fold). These enhanced rates of adenylate kinase activity, equivalent to processing all the cellular ATP and ADP in approximately 1 min, occur when levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP are maintained very near their basal steady state. These characteristics of the dynamics of adenylate kinase catalysis in the intact cell demonstrate that rapid rates of AMP production from ADP are balanced by equally rapid rates of AMP phosphorylation with no net synthesis or accumulation of any adenine nucleotide. This rapid processing of nucleotide phosphoryls conforms to a proposed scheme whereby the adenylate kinase system provides the unique function of transferring, as beta-ADP, high energy phosphoryls generated by glycolytic metabolism to ATP-utilizing components in muscle."

The engineered monomer has a folded structure similar to wild type, is significantly more stable than wild type, and exhibits novel half-operator binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1520138138,"Human platelet lipids were enriched in vitro with different amounts of either docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) or linoleic acid (18:2n-6). Of the total fatty acid incorporated, between 82 and 95% was associated with the phospholipid (PL) fraction, with the remainder as either neutral lipid or hydroxy fatty acid. Within the PL fraction, the majority (64% of total) of each fatty acid was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine. It was found that platelet aggregation induced by the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 mimetic (15S)-hydroxy-11,9-(epoxymethano)prosta-5Z,13E-dienoic acid (U46619) was inhibited after PL enrichment with 22:6n-3 or 20:5n-3, but not after 18:2n-6 enrichment. The specificity of 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3 for U46619 activation was demonstrated by the finding that neither fatty acid significantly inhibited thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2-independent aggregation induced by A23187 or thrombin. Furthermore, enrichment with 22:6n-3 or 20:5n-3 resulted in inhibition of [3H]U46619 specific binding, while enrichment with 18:2n-6 did not affect binding. Scatchard analysis revealed that thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor affinity for [3H]U46619 decreased 4.8-fold following 22:6n-3 incorporation. These results demonstrate that platelet phospholipid enrichment with 22:6n-3 or 20:5n-3 results in a selective inhibition of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2108192408,"The process of insertion of precursor proteins into mitochondrial membranes was investigated using a hybrid protein (pSc1-c) that contains dual targeting information and, at the same time, membrane insertion activity. pSc1-c is composed of the matrix-targeting domain of the cytochrome c1 presequence joined to the amino terminus of apocytochrome c. It can be selectively imported along either a cytochrome c1 route into the mitochondrial matrix or via the cytochrome c route into the intermembrane space. In contrast to cytochrome c1, pSc1-c does not require the receptor system/GIP for entry into the matrix. The apocytochrome c in the pSc1-c fusion protein appears to exert its membrane insertion activity in such a manner that the matrix-targeting sequence gains direct access to the membrane potential-dependent step. These results attribute an essential function to the receptor system in facilitating the initial insertion of precursors into the mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1521450365,"When thrombin-mediated fibrin formation and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-mediated fibrinolysis proceed in dynamic interaction, desA-(desB beta 1-42)-fragment X polymers are shown to be the predominant fibrin derivatives present during the rapid second phase of Glu1- and Lys78-plasminogen activation. To further investigate the effect of this intermediate, a method was developed for the production and purification of fibrinogen-derived desA-(desB beta 1-42)-fragment X, deprived of both COOH-terminal A alpha-chains, but still capable of thrombin-mediated polymerization. DesA-(desB beta 1-42)-fragment X polymer was compared to intact fibrin with regard to its stimulatory effect on Glu1-, Lys78-, and Val443-plasminogen activation, and its binding of Glu1- and Lys78-plasminogen. Pure fragment X polymer gave rise to a biphasic activation pattern like that of fibrin, demonstrating similar kinetics of rapid phase activation. The dissociation constant for the binding of plasminogen to the effector decreases by a factor of 14, and the stoichiometry increases by a factor of 2 upon plasmin-catalyzed cleavage of both native Glu1- to Lys78-plasminogen, and fibrin to fragment X polymer. We conclude that desA-fibrin protofibril formation is sufficient to initiate fibrin enhancement of t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation, and that optimal stimulation depends on further plasmin-mediated modification of the fibrin effector to desA-fragment X-related moieties. Optimal stimulation is dependent on the presence of the kringle 1-4 domains of plasminogen and probably results from altered and increased binding of both plasminogen and t-PA to the modified effector."
https://openalex.org/W33440140,"A short sequence motif rich in glycine residues, Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys-Thr/Ser, has been found in many nucleotide-binding proteins including the beta subunit of Escherichia coli H(+)-ATPase (Gly-Gly-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Lys-Thr, residues 149-156). The following mutations were introduced in this region of the cloned E. coli unc operon carried by a plasmid pBWU1: Ala-151----Pro or Val; insertion of a Gly residue between Lys-155 and Thr-156; and replacement of the region by the corresponding sequence of adenylate kinase (Gly-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ser-Gly-Lys-Gly-Thr) or p21 ras protein (ras) (Gly-Ala-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly-Lys-Ser). All F0F1 subunits were synthesized in the deletion strain of the unc operon-dependent on pBWU1 with mutations, and essentially the same amounts of H(+)-ATPase with these mutant beta subunits were found in membranes. The adenylate kinase and Gly insertion mutants showed no oxidative phosphorylation or ATPase activity, whereas the Pro-151 mutants had higher ATPase activity than the wild-type, and the Val-151 and ras mutants had significant activity. It is striking that the enzyme with the ras mutation (differing in three amino acids from the beta sequence) had about half the membrane ATPase activity of the wild-type. These results together with the simulated three-dimensional structures of the wild-type and mutant sequences suggest that in mutant beta subunits with no ATPase activity projection of Thr-156 residues was opposite to that in the wild-type, and that the size and direction of projection of residue 151 are important for the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2108169205,"Glucagon-(19-29) is 1000-fold more potent that glucagon as an inhibitor of the liver plasma membrane calcium pump, which suggests that this peptide fragment is naturally occurring. Since glucagon-(19-29) is undetectable in plasma, the processing of glucagon into its (19-29) fragment may occur upon interaction of glucagon with its target tissues. The use of a specific radioimmunoassay for glucagon-(19-29) in association with the separation and identification of peptides by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that, upon incubation at 37 degrees C with hepatic plasma membranes, glucagon is processed into its (19-29) C-terminal fragment. The identity of the fragment was confirmed by amino acid sequencing. The processing activity was inhibited by reagents of the thiol group and by 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting that a thiol endopeptidase containing a catalytically active metal is involved in this processing. Following its production, glucagon-(19-29) was degraded with a half-life of less than 10 s. This degradation was inhibited by bacitracin and by the aminopeptidase inhibitors bestatin and amastatin. When glucagon was incubated with liver plasma membranes in the absence of inhibitors, the accumulation of glucagon-(19-29) reached a maximum at 2 min (1% of initial glucagon), followed by a slow decline. In the presence of bacitracin and bestatin, the amounts of glucagon-(19-29) obtained from glucagon increased continuously, 1 and 2% of glucagon being transformed after 10 and 30 min, respectively. The production of glucagon-(19-29) did not appear to be associated with the binding of glucagon to its receptors, since (i) guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, a compound which decreases the glucagon-receptor interaction, could not decrease the conversion of glucagon into glucagon-(19-29); (ii) a glucagon analogue which displays a strongly decreased affinity for the hepatic glucagon receptors was processed similarly to glucagon. The conversion also occurs upon incubation with intact hepatoma cells in monolayer culture. These observations suggest that, under physiological conditions, glucagon is processed in liver by cleavage of the Arg17-Arg18 basic doublet, leading to the production of a fragment which is known to display an original biological specificity, namely the modulation of the hepatocyte plasma membrane calcium pump."
https://openalex.org/W1604460094,"The nucleotide sequence of the operon of the ATPase complex of an acidothermophilic archaebacterium, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, has been determined. In addition to the three previously reported genes for the alpha, beta, and c (proteolipid) subunits of the ATPase complex (Denda, K., Konishi, J., Oshima, T., Date, T., and Yoshida, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7119-7121), the operon contained three other genes encoding hydrophilic proteins with molecular masses 25, 13, and 7 kDa. The 25-kDa protein is the third largest subunit (gamma), the 13-kDa protein is most likely the fourth subunit (delta), and the 7-kDa protein may correspond to an unknown subunit of the ATPase, tentatively named as epsilon subunit. They do not have significant sequence similarity to subunits in F0F1-ATPases and eukaryotic V-type ATPases, whereas the other three subunits, alpha, beta, and c, have homologous counterparts in F0F1- and V-type ATPases. The order of the genes in the operon was delta alpha beta gamma epsilon c. The S. acidocaldarius ATPase operon differed from the eucabacterial F0F1-ATPase operon in that the former contains only one gene for a hydrophobic subunit at the most downstream part of the operon whereas the latter has three hydrophobic F0 genes preceding five hydrophilic F1 genes."
https://openalex.org/W1498348866,"The purified dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel from skeletal muscle transverse tubules consists of several subunits, termed alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, gamma and delta. From its associated drug receptors, those for 1,4-dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines have been shown previously by photoaffinity labeling to reside on the alpha 1 subunit. In the present study the arylazide photo-affinity ligand, (+)-cis-azidodiltiazem ((+)-cis-(2S,3S)-5-[2-(4- azidobenzoyl)aminoethyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-hydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl )-4- oxo-1,5-benzothiazepine), and the respective tritiated derivative, (+)-cis-[3H]azidodiltiazem (45 Ci/mmol), were developed to identify directly the benzothiazepine binding subunit. (+)-cis-Azidodiltiazem binds competitively to the benzothiazepine receptor in rabbit skeletal muscle transverse tubule membranes. Upon ultraviolet irradiation of the (+)-cis-[3H]azidodiltiazem-purified calcium channel complex, the ligand photoincorporates exclusively into the alpha 1 subunit. Photoincorporation is protected by 100 microM (-)-desmethoxyverapamil and 100 microM (+)-cis-diltiazem. A polyclonal antiserum directed against (+)-cis-azidodiltiazem was employed to detect (+)-cis-azidodiltiazem immunoreactivity photoincorporated into the purified calcium channel complex, confirming the exclusive labeling of the alpha 1 subunit. Our data provide direct evidence that, together with the drug receptors for 1,4-dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines, the benzothiazepine binding domain of skeletal muscle calcium channels is located on the alpha 1 subunit. We conclude that our anti-ligand antibodies could be used successfully to affinity purify the photolabeled proteolytic fragments of the alpha 1 subunit which are expected to form part of the benzothiazepine binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1537748178,"Light microscopy, electron microscopy, and enzyme histochemistry were used to study the effects of spaceflight on metaphyseal and cortical bone of the rat tibia. Cortical cross-sectional area and perimeter were not altered by a 12.5-day spaceflight in 3-month-old male rats. The endosteal osteoblast population and the vasculature near the periosteal surface in flight rats compared with ground controls showed more pronounced changes in cortical bone than in metaphyseal bone. The osteoblasts demonstrated greater numbers of transitional Golgi vesicles, possibly caused by a decreased cellular metabolic energy source, but no difference in the large Golgi saccules or the cell membrane-associated alkaline phosphatase activity. The periosteal vasculature in the diaphysis of flight rats often showed lipid accumulations within the lumen of the vessels, occasional degeneration of the vascular wall, and degeneration of osteocytes adjacent to vessels containing intraluminal deposits. These changes were not found in the metaphyseal region of flight animals. The focal vascular changes may be due to ischemia of bone or a developing fragility of the vessel walls as a result of spaceflight."
https://openalex.org/W1546027468,"A large number of mutants that are temperature sensitive (ts) for growth have been isolated from mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cells by an improved selection method consisting of cell synchronization and short exposures to restrictive temperature. The improved method increased the efficiency of isolating DNA ts mutants, which showed a rapid decrease in DNA-synthesizing ability after temperature shift-up. Sixteen mutants isolated by this and other methods were selected for this study. Flow microfluorometric analysis of these mutants cultured at a nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C) for 16 h indicated that five clones were arrested in the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, six clones were in the S to G2 phase, and two clones were arrested in the G2 phase. The remaining three clones exhibited 8C DNA content after incubation at 39 degrees C for 28 h, indicating defects in mitosis or cytokinesis. These mutants were classified into 11 complementation groups. All the mutants except for those arrested in the G2 phase and those exhibiting defects in mitosis or cytokinesis showed a rapid decrease in DNA synthesis after temperature shift-up without a decrease in RNA and protein synthesis. The polyomavirus DNA cell-free replication system, which consists of polyomavirus large tumor antigen and mouse cell extracts, was used for further characterization of these DNA ts mutants. Among these ts mutants, only the tsFT20 strain, which contains heat-labile DNA polymerase alpha, was unable to support the polyomavirus DNA replication. Analysis by DNA fiber autoradiography revealed that DNA chain elongation rates of these DNA ts mutants were not changed and that the initiation of DNA replication at the origin of replicons was impaired in the mutant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581110026,"The nuclear extracts from HeLa cells subjected to heat shock at 43 or 46 degrees C for 2 h were unable to splice pre-mRNA in vitro. Analysis of snRNPs in the extracts revealed that the U4.U5.U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) complex was disrupted at both temperatures while U1 and U2 snRNPs remained unaffected at 43 degrees C but were disrupted to certain extent during heat shock at 46 degrees C. During splicing reaction, the extract from cells heat shocked at 43 degrees C formed intermediate splicing complexes alpha and beta but was unable to form a functional spliceosome, complex gamma. Addition of fractions from a normal nuclear extract restored splicing activity only in the extract from cells subjected to heat shock at 43 degrees C. Using this complementation assay, we have partially purified the factor(s) inactivated at this temperature. The purified factor(s) was essentially devoid of snRNAs and snRNPs and resistant to micrococcal nuclease, indicating that the factor(s) inactivated by in vivo heat shock at 43 degrees C is a protein. We have also subjected the nuclear extracts from normal HeLa cells to in vitro heat treatment at 43 or 46 degrees C. The results indicate that during in vitro heat treatment of the extracts the damage to splicing machinery is more extensive than that during in vivo heat shock. These experiments also suggest that the factor(s) inactivated by heat shock at 43 degrees C is different from previously identified thermolabile splicing factors."
https://openalex.org/W1793250993,"We have studied the chemistry, hydroxyapatite crystal size, and maturational changes in bone and dentin from rats exposed to microgravity for 12 days in a Soviet biosatellite (Cosmos 1887). Bone ash was reduced in vertebrae (L5) but not in the non-weight-bearing calvaria or mandibles. All tissues had a relatively normal percentage composition of Ca, P, and Mg. Nevertheless, flight rat calvaria and vertebral tissues tended to exhibit lower Ca/P and higher Ca/Mg ratios that any of their weight-matched control groups, and gradient density analysis (calvaria) indicated a strong shift to the fractions of lower specific gravity that was commensurate with impaired rates of matrix-mineral maturation. X-ray diffraction data were confirmatory. Bone hydroxyapatite crystal growth in the mandibles of flight rats was preferentially altered in such a way as to reduce their size (C-axis dimension). But in the mandibular diastemal region devoid of muscle attachments, flight rat bone and dentin were normal with respect to the Ca, P, Mg, and Zn concentrations and Ca/P and Ca/Mg ratios of age-matched controls. These observations affirm the concept that while microgravity most adversely affects the maturation of newly formed matrix and mineral moieties in weight-bearing bone, such effects occur throughout the skeleton.—Simmons, D.

Scatchard analysis of 125I-GM-CSF binding to the placental membrane extract disclosed that the GM-CSF receptor had a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.5-0.8 nM, corresponding to the Kd value of the GM-CSF receptor alpha-chain on the intact placental membrane. Affinity labeling of the solubilized protein using a photoreactive cross-linking agent, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate (HSAB), demonstrated a single specific band of 70-95 kDa representing a ligand-receptor complex. Approximately 2 g of the placental membrane extract was subjected to a biotinylated GM-CSF-fixed streptavidin-agarose column, resulting in a single major band at 70 kDa on a silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. The radioiodination for the purified material disclosed that the purified protein had an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa and a pI of 6.6. Binding activity of the purified material was demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling using HSAB-125I-GM-CSF, producing a similar specific band at 70-95 kDa as was demonstrated for the crude protein."
https://openalex.org/W1562934856,"The effect of the lipophilic gold compound, auranofin (AUR) on the calcium homeostasis of human neutrophils treated with or without n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) was investigated. In agreement with previous reports, FMLP induced a rapid release of intracellular Ca2+ stores followed by a smaller influx of extracellular Ca2+. AUR and staurosporine enhanced while phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate suppressed the secondary influx of Ca2+. Mn2(+)-quenching-of-fluorescence studies indicate that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate incubation blocked cation entry. AUR or staurosporine potentiation of FMLP effects on cytoplasmic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) was attributed to suppression of negative feedback effects of protein kinase C. AUR (5-45 microM) per se induced a slow release of internal Ca2+ stores followed by a delayed influx of extracellular Ca2+. Control studies showed that AUR did not induce the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, lyse cells, or promote dye leakage. Dithiothreitol suppressed the AUR effect. AUR triggered biphasic but smaller increases in [Ca2+]i of neutrophil cytoplasts. Studies with permeabilized neutrophils showed that AUR directly released Ca2+ from internal stores. By comparison, gold sodium thiomalate, which had no effect on intact cells, also released Ca2+ from permeabilized cells. Present results indicate that AUR modulated [Ca2+]i directly by mobilized Ca2+ from multiple storage sites and indirectly by inhibiting protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1515863017,"The human lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) is a glycoprotein composed of dimers of alpha- and/or beta-subunits. The subunits of the enzymes are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transported through the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome. As such, each subunit contains an amino-terminal signal peptide that directs the nascent polypeptide into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The signal peptide cleavage site of the beta-polypeptide is known, but its NH2 terminus has not been determined due to the presence of three candidate initiation codons upstream of the cleavage site. In this study, we identified the mRNA cap site, confirming the presence of all three AUGs in the majority of HEXB mRNA. To identify the site of translation initiation, we mutated the three ATGs by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis and showed that all three AUG codons can be used for translation initiation after expression in COS cells. Furthermore, in each case, a fully processed, i.e. mature lysosomal, and enzymatically active beta-hexosaminidase was produced indicating that a functional signal peptide was synthesized. However, expression of a frameshift mutation in the normal construct, created by insertion of a single nucleotide between the first and second ATG, resulted in no significant enzyme activity or beta-subunit protein. We conclude, therefore, that the first in-frame ATG is used exclusively in vivo, in keeping with the scanning model of eukaryotic translation initiation. Interestingly, substitution of all three ATGs with CTG resulted in a significant amount of mature beta-hexosaminidase, showing that under these conditions, initiation could occur from non-AUG codons. Translation initiation from the first AUG gives the prepro-beta-polypeptide a signal peptide of 42 amino acids that has an unusually long hydrophobic core more typical of membrane spanning domains. Such a large hydrophobic core has not been found in other cleavable signal peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1566982900,"A knowledge of the biochemical basis for UV-induced mutagenesis requires an understanding of the interaction of SOS-activated proteins with DNA polymerase at the replication-blocking dipyrimidine lesions. We have suggested previously that the presence of RecA in this multiprotein complex might be an important feature of induced mutagenesis because RecA associates preferentially with UV-irradiated double-stranded DNA compared to nonirradiated DNA. Previous work by others has indicated that (6-4) dipyrimidine lesions might be more mutagenic than the more common cyclobutane dimer. We have explored the possibility that RecA associates more efficiently with (6-4) lesions than with cyclobutane lesions. We have found that RecA binds DNA with (6-4) lesions much more efficiently than DNA with solely cyclobutane lesions. The distinction between substrates is probably achieved by differential nucleation of the RecA nucleoprotein filament. To investigate the structural basis for differential binding of RecA, we have estimated the unwinding of duplex DNA introduced by (6-4) and cyclobutane lesions. Our data indicate that (6-4) lesions introduce much greater distortion than cyclobutane dimers. We conclude that RecA probably binds preferentially at sites of (6-4) lesions in DNA and that this localization of RecA might target the mutagenic response more frequently to those sites."
https://openalex.org/W1603180434,"The binding of dihydropyridine (PN200-110) to skeletal muscle microsomes (which were 84% sealed inside-out vesicles) was not influenced by the addition of calcium or magnesium nor by addition of their chelators (EDTA or EGTA) unless the vesicles were pretreated with the calcium-magnesium ionophore A23187 and EDTA to remove entrapped cations. Separation of inside-out vesicles from right-side-out vesicles by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography revealed that only the right-side-out vesicles exhibited a calcium-, magnesium-, and chelator-dependent binding of PN200-110. Dihydropyridine binding to cardiac sarcolemma membranes (which were 46% inside-out) and to solubilized skeletal muscle membranes was inhibited by EDTA and could be fully restored by 10 microM calcium or 1 mM magnesium. Calcium increased PN200-110 binding to partially purified rabbit skeletal muscle calcium channels from 3.9 pmol/mg protein to 25.5 pmol/mg protein with a pK0.5 = 6.57 +/- 0.059 and a Hill coefficient of 0.56 +/- 0.04. Magnesium increased binding from 0.7 pmol/mg protein to 16.8 pmol/mg protein with a pK0.5 = 3.88 +/- 0.085 and a Hill coefficient of 0.68 +/- 0.074. These studies suggest that calcium binding to high affinity sites or magnesium binding to low affinity sites on the extracellular side of skeletal muscle T-tubule calcium channels regulates dihydropyridine binding. Further, similar calcium and magnesium binding sites exist on the cardiac calcium channel and serve to allosterically regulate dihydropyridine binding."
https://openalex.org/W1552691165,"RecA protein catalyzes homologous pairing of partially single-stranded duplex DNA and fully duplex DNA to form stable joint molecules. We constructed circular duplex DNA with various defined gap lengths and studied the pairing reaction between the gapped substrate with fully double-stranded DNA. The reaction required a stoichiometric amount of RecA protein, and the optimal reaction was achieved at a ratio of 1 RecA monomer per 4 base pairs. The length of the gap, ranging from 141 to 1158 nucleotides, had little effect on the efficiency of homologous pairing. By using a circular gapped duplex DNA prepared from the chimeric phage M13Gori1, we were able to show the formation of nonintertwined or paranemic joints in duplex regions between the gapped and fully duplex molecules. The formation of such paranemic joints occurred efficiently and included nearly all of the DNA in the reaction mixture. The reaction required negative superhelicity, and pairing was greatly reduced with linear or nicked circular DNA. We conclude that one functional role of the single-stranded gap is for facilitating the binding of RecA protein to the duplex region of the gapped DNA. Once the nucleoprotein filament is formed, homologous pairing between the gapped and fully duplex DNA can take place anywhere along the length of the nucleoprotein complex."

(Tokyo) 88, 695-703) has a defective beta subunit with serine being replaced by phenylalanine at codon 174. Four suppression mutants (RE10, RE17, RE18, and RE20) from this strain capable of growth on minimal plate agar supplemented by succinate were isolated. The original point mutation at codon 174 was intact in these strains. Additional point mutations, Ala-295 to Thr, Gly-149 to Ser, Leu-400 to Gln, Ala-295 to Pro, for RE10, RE17, RE18, and RE20, respectively, were identified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. These mutations, except for RE10, were confirmed as a single mutation conferring a suppressive phenotype by genetic suppression assay using KF11 as the host cells. The results indicated that Ser-174 has functional interaction with Gly-149, Ala-295, and Leu-400. The residues are located within the previously estimated catalytic domain of the beta subunit, indicating that this domain is indeed folded for the active site of catalytic function. Growth rates of the revertants in the minimal medium with succinate increased compared with that of KF11, showing that ATP synthesis recovered to some extent. The ATP hydrolytic activity in the revertant membranes increased in RE17 and RE20 but did not in RE10 and RE18, suggesting that synthesis and hydrolysis are not necessarily reversible in the proton-translocating ATPase (F1F0)."
https://openalex.org/W1526493971,"The genomic structure of the alpha-actinin gene from Dictyostelium discoideum has been determined. The coding region consists of three exons separated by two short introns located at either end of the gene. In an alpha-actinin mutant, HG1130, about 1% of alpha-actinin protein products are found compared to the parent strain AX2. The size of the mutant proteins are 88 and 95 kDa. In HG1130, the second intron is improperly spliced from the primary alpha-actinin transcript resulting from a mutation at the 5' splice site from a GT to an AT. The premature RNA is less efficiently cleaved at the mutated 5' splice site and the following step of the splicing reaction, ligation of exons 2 and 3, is prevented. Thus, two RNA species are generated, one in which intron 2 is not removed and one in which exon 2 is not ligated to exon 3. The two RNA species are stable, transported to the cytoplasm, bound to polysomes and translated. In vitro and in vivo, the partially spliced RNAs are translated into proteins of 88 and 95 kDa which can be immunoprecipitated with an alpha-actinin-specific monoclonal antibody. The in vivo stability of the mutant proteins is comparable to the wild type alpha-actinin."
https://openalex.org/W1488406017,"Although the Ca2(+)-ATPase is the predominant protein species of the skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, the functional significance of other minor protein species remains unresolved. The proposition has been tested that the membrane-bound 53-kDa glycoprotein (GP-53) may be required or significantly involved in regulating the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to Ca2+ transport by the Ca2(+)-ATPase. Ca2(+)-ATPases originating from preparations with and without GP-53 were reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes, and Ca2+ uptake and pumping efficiency were determined. The reconstituted Ca2+ pump from all preparations transported Ca2+ with high efficiency (Ca2+:ATP greater than 1.5). The results demonstrate that GP-53 is not required to couple ATP hydrolysis to Ca2+ transport. Additionally, the observed high coupling efficiency is inconsistent with GP-53 functioning as a substantial positive regulator of coupling."
