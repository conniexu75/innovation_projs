This sets some limitations on the types of applications for which 3D printing is suitable, such as printing around a preexisting object. Kelly et al. present a different method for manufacturing by rotating a photopolymer in a dynamically evolving light field (see the Perspective by Hart and Rao). This allowed them to print entire complex objects through one complete revolution, circumventing the need for layering. The method may be particularly useful for high-viscosity photopolymers and multimaterial fabrication. Science , this issue p. 1075 ; see also p. 1042"
https://openalex.org/W2913043267,"To provide an observational basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections of a slowing Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the 21st century, the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) observing system was launched in the summer of 2014. The first 21-month record reveals a highly variable overturning circulation responsible for the majority of the heat and freshwater transport across the OSNAP line. In a departure from the prevailing view that changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea dominate MOC variability, these results suggest that the conversion of warm, salty, shallow Atlantic waters into colder, fresher, deep waters that move southward in the Irminger and Iceland basins is largely responsible for overturning and its variability in the subpolar basin."
https://openalex.org/W2911745810,"Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by a poor prognosis and lack of targeted treatments, and thus, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Inhibitors against programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) have shown significant efficacy in various solid cancers, but their activity against TNBCs remains limited. Here, we report that human TNBCs molecularly stratified for high levels of PD-L1 (PD-L1High) showed significantly enriched expression of immune and cancer stemness pathways compared with those with low PD-L1 expression (PD-L1Low). In addition, the PD-L1High cases were significantly associated with a high stemness score (SSHigh) signature. TNBC cell lines gated for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and CD44 stemness markers exhibited increased levels of PD-L1 versus their ALDH-negative and CD44Low counterparts, and PD-L1High cells generated significantly more mammospheres than PD-L1Low cells. Murine mammary SCA-1-positive tumor cells with PD-L1High expression generated tumors in vivo with higher efficacy than PD-L1Low cells. Furthermore, treatment of TNBC cells with selective WNT inhibitors or activators downregulated or upregulated PD-L1 expression, respectively, implying a functional cross-talk between WNT activity and PD-L1 expression. Remarkably, human TNBC samples contained tumor elements co-expressing PD-L1 with ALDH1A1 and/or CD44v6. Additionally, both PD-L1-/SCA1-positive and ALDH1A1-positive tumor elements were found in close contact with CD3-, and PD-1-positive T cells in murine and human tumor samples. Overall, our study suggests that PD-L1-positive tumor elements with a stemness phenotype may participate in the complex dynamics of TNBC-related immune evasion, which might be targeted through WNT signaling inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2911432454,"The identification of isotopic labels by conventional macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolution and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements. We recorded the vibrational spectra of an α amino acid, l -alanine, with damage-free “aloof” electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to directly resolve carbon-site–specific isotopic labels in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution. An isotopic red shift of 4.8 ± 0.4 milli–electron volts in C–O asymmetric stretching modes was observed for 13 C-labeled l -alanine at the carboxylate carbon site, which was confirmed by macroscopic infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The accurate measurement of this shift opens the door to nondestructive, site-specific, spatially resolved identification of isotopically labeled molecules with the electron microscope."
https://openalex.org/W2914924652,"Adaptive evolution in new or changing environments can be difficult to predict because the functional connections between genotype, phenotype, and fitness are complex. Here, we make these explicit connections by combining field and laboratory experiments in wild mice. We first directly estimate natural selection on pigmentation traits and an underlying pigment locus, Agouti, by using experimental enclosures of mice on different soil colors. Next, we show how a mutation in Agouti associated with survival causes lighter coat color through changes in its protein binding properties. Together, our findings demonstrate how a sequence variant alters phenotype and then reveal the ensuing ecological consequences that drive changes in population allele frequency, thereby illuminating the process of evolution by natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2914373639,"Sleep remains a major mystery of biology. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms that account for the drive to sleep. In an unbiased screen of more than 12,000 Drosophila lines, we identified a single gene, nemuri, that induces sleep. The NEMURI protein is an antimicrobial peptide that can be secreted ectopically to drive prolonged sleep (with resistance to arousal) and to promote survival after infection. Loss of nemuri increased arousability during daily sleep and attenuated the acute increase in sleep induced by sleep deprivation or bacterial infection. Conditions that increase sleep drive induced expression of nemuri in a small number of fly brain neurons and targeted it to the sleep-promoting, dorsal fan-shaped body. We propose that NEMURI is a bona fide sleep homeostasis factor that is particularly important under conditions of high sleep need; because these conditions include sickness, our findings provide a link between sleep and immune function."
https://openalex.org/W2912940165,"During exon ligation, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome recognizes the 3'-splice site (3'SS) of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) through non-Watson-Crick pairing with the 5'SS and the branch adenosine, in a conformation stabilized by Prp18 and Prp8. Here we present the 3.3-angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure of a human postcatalytic spliceosome just after exon ligation. The 3'SS docks at the active site through conserved RNA interactions in the absence of Prp18. Unexpectedly, the metazoan-specific FAM32A directly bridges the 5'-exon and intron 3'SS of pre-mRNA and promotes exon ligation, as shown by functional assays. CACTIN, SDE2, and NKAP-factors implicated in alternative splicing-further stabilize the catalytic conformation of the spliceosome during exon ligation. Together these four proteins act as exon ligation factors. Our study reveals how the human spliceosome has co-opted additional proteins to modulate a conserved RNA-based mechanism for 3'SS selection and to potentially fine-tune alternative splicing at the exon ligation stage."
https://openalex.org/W2914585460,"Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2913067102,"Regulating HSC progenitors via cholesterol Atherosclerosis is characterized by the buildup of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins in the vascular wall. This increased cholesterol augments hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) counts, and the resultant increase in leukocytes is associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Gu et al. describe a mechanism orchestrating HSPC specification from the hemogenic endothelium (HE) during embryogenesis (see the Perspective by Rajan and Berman). ApoA-I binding protein accelerated cholesterol efflux from the HE, activating the transcription factor Srebp2, which in turn transactivated Notch signaling. This mechanism also appears to be important for adult HSPC expansion in hypercholesterolemia. Science , this issue p. 1085 ; see also p. 1041"
https://openalex.org/W2914425985,"Enzymes that cut proteins inside membranes regulate diverse cellular events, including cell signaling, homeostasis, and host-pathogen interactions. Adaptations that enable catalysis in this exceptional environment are poorly understood. We visualized single molecules of multiple rhomboid intramembrane proteases and unrelated proteins in living cells (human and Drosophila) and planar lipid bilayers. Notably, only rhomboid proteins were able to diffuse above the Saffman-Delbrück viscosity limit of the membrane. Hydrophobic mismatch with the irregularly shaped rhomboid fold distorted surrounding lipids and propelled rhomboid diffusion. The rate of substrate processing in living cells scaled with rhomboid diffusivity. Thus, intramembrane proteolysis is naturally diffusion-limited, but cells mitigate this constraint by using the rhomboid fold to overcome the “speed limit” of membrane diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2912637609,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading infectious cause of death in humans. Synthesis of lipids critical for Mtb’s cell wall and virulence depends on phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PptT), an enzyme that transfers 4′-phosphopantetheine (Ppt) from coenzyme A (CoA) to diverse acyl carrier proteins. We identified a compound that kills Mtb by binding and partially inhibiting PptT. Killing of Mtb by the compound is potentiated by another enzyme encoded in the same operon, Ppt hydrolase (PptH), that undoes the PptT reaction. Thus, loss-of-function mutants of PptH displayed antimicrobial resistance. Our PptT-inhibitor cocrystal structure may aid further development of antimycobacterial agents against this long-sought target. The opposing reactions of PptT and PptH uncover a regulatory pathway in CoA physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2912497870,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has emerged as a prevalent feature associated with cancer development and progression. The advantage of APA to tumor progression is to induce oncogenes through 3'-UTR shortening, and to inactivate tumor suppressor genes via the re-routing of microRNA competition. We previously identified the Mammalian Cleavage Factor I-25 (CFIm25) (encoded by Nudt21 gene) as a master APA regulator whose expression levels directly impact the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma (GBM) in vitro and in vivo. Despite its importance, the role of Nudt21 in GBM development is not known and the genes subject to Nudt21 APA regulation that contribute to GBM progression have not been identified. Here, we find that Nudt21 is reduced in low grade glioma (LGG) and all four subtypes of high grade glioma (GBM). Reduced expression of Nudt21 associates with worse survival in TCGA LGG cohorts and two TCGA GBM cohorts. Moreover, although CFIm25 was initially identified as biochemically associated with both CFIm59 and CFIm68, we observed three CFIm distinct subcomplexes exist and CFIm59 protein level is dependent on Nudt21 expression in GBM cells, but CFIm68 is not, and that only CFIm59 predicts prognosis of GBM patients similar to Nudt21. Through the use of Poly(A)-Click-Seq to characterize APA, we define the mRNAs subject to 3'-UTR shortening upon Nudt21 depletion in GBM cells and observed enrichment in genes important in the Ras signaling pathway, including Pak1. Remarkably, we find that Pak1 expression is regulated by Nudt21 through its 3'-UTR APA, and the combination of Pak1 and Nudt21 expression generates an even stronger prognostic indicator of GBM survival versus either value used alone. Collectively, our data uncover Nudt21 and its downstream target Pak1 as a potential ""combination biomarker"" for predicting prognosis of GBM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2912027260,"It is of utmost importance to research on the spatial patterns of human-wildlife conflicts to understand the underlying mechanism of such interactions, i.e. major land use changes and prominent ecological drivers. In the north eastern part of India there has been a disparity between nature, economic development and fragmentation of wildlife habitats leading to intense conflicts between humans and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in recent times. Both the elephant and human population have increased in the past few decades with large tracts of forests converted to commercial tea plantations, army camps and human settlements. We analyzed data maintained by the wildlife department on human deaths and injuries caused by elephant attacks between 2006-2016 to understand spatial and temporal patterns of human-elephant conflict, frequency and distribution. The average annual number of human deaths and injuries to elephant attacks between 2006 to 2016 was estimated to be 212 (SE 103) with the highest number of such incidents recorded in 2010-2011. Based on a grid based design of 5 km2 and 25 km2 resolution, the main spatial predictors of human-elephant conflicts identified through Maxent presence only models are annual mean precipitation, altitude, distance from protected area, area under forests, tea plantations and agriculture. Major land use changes were assessed for this region from 2008 to 2018 using satellite imageries in Arc GIS and a predicted imagery of 2028 was prepared using Idrisi Selva. Based on the 2018 imagery it was found that forest area had increased by 446 km2 within 10 years (2008-2018) and the annual rate of change was 12%. Area under agriculture had reduced by 128 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 2.5%. Area under tea plantation declined by 307 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 12% whereas area under human settlements increased by 61 km2 with an annual (-) rate of change of 44%. Hotspots of human-elephant conflicts were identified in an east west direction primarily around protected areas, tea plantations and along major riverine corridors. During informal interactions with farmers, tea estate labors it was revealed that local community members chased and harassed elephants from agriculture fields, human settlements under the influence of alcohol and thus were primary victims of fatal interactions. Our analytical approach can be replicated for other species in sites with similar issues of human-wildlife conflicts. The hotspot maps of conflict risk will help in developing appropriate mitigation strategies such as setting up early warning systems, restoration of wildlife corridors especially along dry river beds, using deterrents and barriers for vulnerable. Awareness about alcohol related incidents and basic biology of elephants should be organized regularly involving non-governmental organizations targeting the marginalized farmers and tea estate workers."

The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale crater. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale crater is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history."

When entities such as health plans and health care providers handle personal health information, they are often subject to data privacy regulation. But amid a flood of new forms of health data, some third parties have figured out ways to avoid some data privacy laws, developing what we call “shadow health records”—collections of health data outside the health system that provide detailed pictures of individual health—that allow both innovative research and commercial targeting despite data privacy rules. Now that space for regulatory arbitrage is changing. The long arms of Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California's new Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) will reach shadow health records in many companies. In this article, we lay out the contours of the GDPR's and CCPA's impact on shadow health records and health data more broadly, highlight critical remaining uncertainty, and call for increased clarity from lawmakers and industry on the use of such data for research.

From tiny algae to humpback whales, the warm patch of water that eventually stretched across much of the west coast of North America touched virtually every level of the ecosystems there. Although the Blob has now faded, its effects continue to be felt. This research comes at a time of growing scientific interest, and mounting concern, about these underwater heat waves. Scientists now predict they will become more intense, more frequent, and longer lasting over this century, because of climate change. Blob-like temperatures are expected to become the new normal in the northeast Pacific Ocean by midcentury."
https://openalex.org/W2913512374,"Strengthening district-level management may be an important lever for improving key public health outcomes in low-income settings; however, previous studies have not established the statistical associations between better management and primary healthcare system performance in such settings. To explore this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 36 rural districts and 226 health centers in Ethiopia, a country which has made ambitious investment in expanding access to primary care over the last decade. We employed quantitative measure of management capacity at both the district health office and health center levels and used multiple regression models, accounting for clustering of health centers within districts, to estimate the statistical association between management capacity and a key performance indicator (KPI) summary score based on antenatal care coverage, contraception use, skilled birth attendance, infant immunization, and availability of essential medications. In districts with above median district management capacity, health center management capacity was strongly associated (p < 0.05) with KPI performance. In districts with below median management capacity, health center management capacity was not associated with KPI performance. Having more staff at the district health office was also associated with better KPI performance (p < 0.05) but only in districts with above median management capacity. The results suggest that district-level management may provide an opportunity for improving health system performance in low-income country settings."

More often than not, the complexity of the correlations grows quickly as the system evolves and thus presents a challenge for experimental characterization and intuitive understanding. In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high harmonic generation of matter-wave jets with complex correlations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern recognition scheme, we identify a universal pattern of correlations which offers essential clues to unveiling the underlying secondary scattering processes and high-order correlations. We show that the pattern recognition offers a versatile strategy to visualize and analyze the quantum dynamics of a many-body system."
https://openalex.org/W2911635764,"No-tillage with stubble retention is a widely used cropping system for its conservation and yield benefits. The no-tillage farming system in southern Australia relies heavily on herbicides for weed management, but heavy crop residues may have a negative impact on the activity of pre-emergent herbicides applied. Any herbicide intercepted by the crop residue may not reach the soil surface without timely rainfall and may dissipate due to volatilisation, photo-degradation and/or microbial activity. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the interception of prosulfocarb, pyroxasulfone, and trifluralin herbicides by wheat residue and retention following simulated rainfall. For the first experiment, there were four simulated rainfall amounts (0, 5, 10, and 20 mm), three intensities (5, 10, and 20 mm h–1) and five application times (immediately after spraying herbicide, 6 h, 1, 7, and 14 days after spraying). In the second experiment, 20 mm of rainfall was applied at 10 mm h–1 in either 4 × 5 mm rainfall events over two days, 2 × 10 mm rainfall events over one day, or a single 20 mm rainfall event, with a no-rainfall control treatment. Bioassays were used to assess the herbicide activity/availability in the soil and remaining on the residue, using cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as indicator plants. At higher rainfall amounts, most of the herbicide leached from the stubble into the soil soon after application; more so with rain in one event rather than multiple events. However, the intensity of rainfall had no effect. Pyroxasulfone leached easily from the residue to the soil to potentially offer good weed control, prosulfocarb had an intermediary leaching effect, while only a small amount of trifluralin leached from stubble after rain. Therefore, in no-tillage situations with large amounts of crop residue present on the soil surface, herbicides that leach easily from the residue should be considered, like pyroxasulfone."
https://openalex.org/W2911875448,"Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) develops from pancreatic epithelial cells bearing activating mutant KRAS genes through precancerous lesions, i.e. acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). During pancreatic tumorigenesis, Hes1 expression starts with the transition from acinar cells to ADM, and continues during PanIN and PDAC formation, but the role of Hes1 in pancreatic tumorigenesis is not fully elucidated. Here we show that Hes1 plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of KRAS-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis. In vitro, activation of MAPK signaling due to EGF or mutant KRAS activation induced sustained Hes1 expression in pancreatic acinar cells. In vivo, acinar cell-specific activation of mutant KRAS by Elastase1-CreERT2;KrasG12D induced ADM/PanIN formation with Hes1 expression in mice, and genetic ablation of Hes1 in these mice dramatically suppressed PanIN formation. Gene expression analysis and lineage tracing revealed that Hes1 regulates acinar-to-ductal reprogramming-related genes and, in a Hes1-deficient state, mutant Kras-induced ADM could not progress into PanIN, but re-differentiated into acinar cells. In the Elastase1-CreERT2;KrasG12D;Trp53R172H mouse PDAC model, genetic ablation of Hes1 completely blocked PDAC formation by keeping PanIN lesions in low-grade conditions, in addition to reducing the occurrence of PanIN. Together, these findings indicate that mutant KRAS-induced Hes1 plays an essential role in PDAC initiation and progression by regulating acinar-to-ductal reprogramming-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W2911296807,"Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and homologous recombination (HR) cooperate during S-phase to safeguard replication forks integrity. Thus, the inhibition of TLS becomes a promising point of therapeutic intervention in HR-deficient cancers, where TLS impairment might trigger synthetic lethality (SL). The main limitation to test this hypothesis is the current lack of selective pharmacological inhibitors of TLS. Herein, we developed a miniaturized screening assay to identify inhibitors of PCNA ubiquitylation, a key post-translational modification required for efficient TLS activation. After screening a library of 627 kinase inhibitors, we found that targeting the pro-survival kinase AKT leads to strong impairment of PCNA ubiquitylation. Mechanistically, we found that AKT-mediated modulation of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) ubiquitylation after UV requires the upstream activity of DNA PKcs, without affecting PCNA ubiquitylation levels in unperturbed cells. Moreover, we confirmed that persistent AKT inhibition blocks the recruitment of TLS polymerases to sites of DNA damage and impairs DNA replication forks processivity after UV irradiation, leading to increased DNA replication stress and cell death. Remarkably, when we compared the differential survival of HR-proficient vs HR-deficient cells, we found that the combination of UV irradiation and AKT inhibition leads to robust SL induction in HR-deficient cells. We link this phenotype to AKT ability to inhibit PCNA ubiquitylation, since the targeted knockdown of PCNA E3-ligase (RAD18) and a non-ubiquitylable (PCNA K164R) knock-in model recapitulate the observed SL induction. Collectively, this work identifies AKT as a novel regulator of PCNA ubiquitylation and provides the proof-of-concept of inhibiting TLS as a therapeutic approach to selectively kill HR-deficient cells submitted to replication stress."
https://openalex.org/W2912558782,"PRRX1 is a homeodomain transcriptional factor, which has two isoforms, PRXX1A and PRRX1B. The PRRX1 isoforms have been demonstrated to be important in pancreatic cancer, especially in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in liver metastasis. In order to determine the functional underpinnings of PRRX1 and its isoforms, we have unraveled a new interplay between PRRX1 and the FOXM1 transcriptional factors. Our detailed biochemical analysis reveals the direct physical interaction between PRRX1 and FOXM1 proteins that requires the PRRX1A/B 200-222/217 amino acid (aa) region and the FOXM1 Forkhead domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the cooperation between PRRX1 and FOXM1 in the regulation of FOXM1-dependent transcriptional activity. Moreover, we establish FOXM1 as a critical downstream target of PRRX1 in pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrate a novel role for PRRX1 in the regulation of genes involved in DNA repair pathways. Indeed, we show that expression of PRRX1 isoforms may limit the induction of DNA damage in pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate that targeting FOXM1 with the small molecule inhibitor FDI6 suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induces their apoptotic cell death. FDI6 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to Etoposide and Gemcitabine induced apoptosis. Our data provide new insights into PRRX1’s involvement in regulating DNA damage and provide evidence of a possible PRRX1-FOXM1 axis that is critical for PDAC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2914380966,"Alcohol binge drinking is a dangerous drinking habit, associated with neurological problems and inflammation. The impact of a single alcohol binge on innate immunity, gut barrier and gut microbiome was studied. In this cohort study 15 healthy volunteers received 2 ml vodka 40% v/v ethanol/kg body weight. Neutrophil function was studied by flow cytometry; markers of gut permeability and inflammation (lactulose/mannitol/sucrose test, zonulin, calprotectin, diamino-oxidase) were studied with NMR spectroscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in urine, stool and serum respectively. Bacterial products in serum were quantified using different reporter cell lines. Gut microbiome composition was studied by 16S rDNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. After a single alcohol binge, neutrophils were transiently primed and the response to E.coli stimulation with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was transiently increased, on the other hand the percentage of neutrophils that did not perform phagocytosis increased. No changes in gut permeability, inflammatory biomarker, bacterial translocation and microbiome composition could be detected up to 4 hours after a single alcohol binge or on the next day. A single alcohol binge in young, healthy volunteers transiently impacts on neutrophil function. Although the exact biological consequence of this finding is not clear yet, we believe that this strengthens the importance to avoid any alcohol binge drinking, even in young, otherwise healthy persons."

The aim of this study was to determine if intraoperative loading of a clinically approved calcium phosphate (CaP) coating with gentamicin can protect from ODRI in vivo. First, CaP-coated titanium aluminium niobium (TAN) discs were used to investigate the adsorption and release kinetics of gentamicin in vitro. Gentamicin loading and subsequent release from the coating were both rapid, with maximum loading occurring following one second of immersion, and >95% gentamicin released within 15 min in aqueous solution, respectively. Second, efficacy of the gentamicin-loaded CaP coating for preventing ODRI in vivo was investigated using a CaP-coated unicortical TAN screw implanted into the proximal tibia of skeletally mature female Wistar rats, following inoculation of the implant site with S. aureus. Gentamicin-loading prevented ODRI in 7/8 animals, whereas 9/9 of the non-gentamicin treated animals were infected after 7 days. In conclusion, gentamicin can be rapidly and simply loaded onto, and released from, CaP-based implant coatings, and this is an effective strategy for preventing peri-operative S. aureus-induced ODRI in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2992078626,"Object The purpose of our study was to assess the prognostic role of early D-dimer level in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods The included patients’ D-dimer levels have to be tested within 24 hours from stroke onset. Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≥3. The endpoints included recurrence on 5-day diffusion-weighted imaging, 30-day mRS ≥3, 30-day mortality and 90-day mRS ≥3. Regarding to each endpoint, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the prognostic role of D-dimer in patients with AIS. Results A total of 2,479 patients were included. The results showed that elevated D-dimer levels were associated with recurrence on 5-day diffusion-weighted imaging (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.32–3.95), 30-day mRS≥3 (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.37–1.85), 30-day mortality (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.27–2.90) and 90-day mRS≥3 (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05–2.46). Conclusions In conclusion, for patients with AIS, higher D-dimer level within 24 hours from stroke onset was associated with recurrence on 5-day diffusion-weighted imaging, mortality at 30 days, and poor functional outcome at both 30 days and 90 days. However, more studies are warranted to clarify this issue."
https://openalex.org/W2914150265,"Brief contact interventions (BCIs) might be reliable suicide prevention strategies. BCI efficacy trials, however, gave equivocal results. AlgoS trial is a composite BCI that yielded inconclusive results when analyzed with Intention-To-Treat strategy. In order to elicit intervention strengths and weaknesses, post-hoc analyses of AlgoS data were performed.AlgoS was a randomized controlled trial conducted in 23 French hospitals. Suicide attempters were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (AlgoS) or the control group (Treatment as usual TAU). In the AlgoS arm, first-time suicide attempters received crisis cards; non first-time suicide attempters received a phone call, and post-cards if the call could not be completed, or if the participant was in crisis and/or non-compliant with the post-discharge treatment. An As Treated strategy, accounting for the actual intervention received, was combined with subgroup analyses.1,040 patients were recruited and randomized into two groups of N = 520, from which 53 withdrew participation; 15 were excluded after inclusion/exclusion criteria reassessment. AlgoS first attempters were less likely to reiterate suicide attempt (SA) than their TAU counterparts at 6 and 13-14 months (RR [95% CI]: 0.46 [0.25-0.85] and 0.50 [0.31-0.81] respectively). AlgoS non-first attempters had similar SA rates as their TAU counterparts at 6 and 13-14 months (RR [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.57-1.25] and 1.00 [0.73-1.37] respectively). SA rates were dissimilar within the AlgoS non-first attempter group.This new set of analysis suggests that crisis cards could be efficacious to prevent new SA attempts among first-time attempters, while phone calls were probably not significantly efficacious among multi-attempters. Importantly, phone calls were informative of new SA risk, thus a key component of future interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2913271452,"The demand for district level statistics has increased tremendously in Bangladesh due to existence of decentralised approach to governance and service provision. The Bangladesh Demographic Health Surveys (BDHS) provide a wide range of invaluable data at the national and divisional level but they cannot be used directly to produce reliable district-level estimates due to insufficient sample sizes. The small area estimation (SAE) technique overcomes the sample size challenges and can produce reliable estimates at the district level. This paper uses SAE approach to generate model-based district-level estimates of diarrhoea prevalence among under-5 children in Bangladesh by linking data from the 2014 BDHS and the 2011 Population Census. The diagnostics measures show that the model-based estimates are precise and representative when compared to the direct survey estimates. Spatial distribution of the precise estimates of diarrhoea prevalence reveals significant inequality at district-level (ranged 1.1–13.4%) with particular emphasis in the coastal and north-eastern districts. Findings of the study might be useful for designing effective policies, interventions and strengthening local-level governance."

Wavefront shaping techniques enable optical imaging at unprecedented depth, but attaining superresolution within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference beacon (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwavelength guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a superresolution optical focus. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals, which enable optical focusing with a subdiffraction resolution below 186 nanometers (less than half the wavelength). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a range of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual optical excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2912680380,"Objectives Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, alcohol, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) usually have different etiology, increasing incidence and often show an improved survival when compared to HPV-negative cases. The objective of the current study was to retrospectively examine the influence of HPV on the survival of OPSCC patients in a non-Western population setting. Materials and methods We determined the presence of HPV DNA and/or RNA in 99 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of OPSCC patients treated between 2002 and 2015. Patients were compared based on laboratory, demographic, clinical, life style characteristics and survival. Results HPV RNA was found in 29.3% cases. However, groups based on HPV data (either RNA, DNA or retrospectively collected p16 staining) did not show significant differences. Overall, 5-year survival was 30% with minimal influence of the HPV positivity. Conclusions The HPV influence on survival of OPSCC patients is not identical between populations probably due to other factors overshadowing the HPV effect. This should be taken into account when treatment or policy decisions are made in each particular setting."
https://openalex.org/W2912367459,"Prostate cancer disseminates primarily into the adjacent lymph nodes, which is related to a poor outcome. Atypical protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) is highly expressed in aggressive prostate cancer and correlates with Gleason score, clinical stage, and poor prognosis. Here, we report the molecular mechanisms of PKCζ in lymphatic metastasis during prostate cancer progression. Using zinc-finger nuclease technology or PKCζ shRNA lentiviral particles, and orthotopic mouse xenografts, we show that PKCζ-knockout or knockdown from aggressive prostate cancer (PC3 and PC3U) cells, decreasesd tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis in vivo. Intriguingly, PKCζ-knockout or knockdown impaired the activation of AKT, ERK, and NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells, thereby impairing the expression of lymphangiogenic factors and macrophage recruitment, resulting in aberrant lymphangiogenesis. Moreover, PKCζ regulated the expression of hyaluronan synthase enzymes, which is important for hyaluronan-mediated lymphatic drainage and tumor dissemination. Thus, PKCζ plays a crucial oncogenic role in the lymphatic metastasis of prostate cancer and is predicted to be a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2788498763,"Although cell shape can reflect the mechanical and biochemical properties of the cell and its environment, quantification of 3D cell shapes within 3D tissues remains difficult, typically requiring digital reconstruction from a stack of 2D images. We investigate a simple alternative technique to extract information about the 3D shapes of cells in a tissue; this technique connects the ensemble of 3D shapes in the tissue with the distribution of 2D shapes observed in independent 2D slices. Using cell vertex model geometries, we find that the distribution of 2D shapes allows clear determination of the mean value of a 3D shape index. We analyze the errors that may arise in practice in the estimation of the mean 3D shape index from 2D imagery and find that typically only a few dozen cells in 2D imagery are required to reduce uncertainty below 2%. Even though we developed the method for isotropic animal tissues, we demonstrate it on an anisotropic plant tissue. This framework could also be naturally extended to estimate additional 3D geometric features and quantify their uncertainty in other materials."
https://openalex.org/W2914822326,"Aim To investigate the probability of marriage and divorce among Swedish military veterans deployed to Afghanistan relative to non-deployed matched comparators. Study design and setting Matched cohort study in Sweden. Participants Military veterans were identified through Swedish military personnel registers regarding foreign deployments, and comparators from the Military Service Conscription Register (1969–2013). Of 1,882,411 eligible conscripts, 7041 had served in Afghanistan at some point in time between 2002 and 2013. To each military veteran, up to 5 non-deployed comparators who underwent conscription were matched by age, sex, psychological assessment, cognitive ability, psychiatric history and social characteristics. After matching there were 4896 (82%) unmarried and 1069 (18%) married deployed military veterans. The main outcome was marriage or divorce after deployment to Afghanistan. Data on marital status were retrieved from Statistics Sweden until December 31, 2014. Results During a median follow-up of 4.1 years after deployment of married individuals, 124 divorces were observed among deployed military veterans and 399 in the matched non-deployed comparator cohort (277 vs. 178 per 10,000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio 1.61, 95%CI 1.31–1.97). During a median follow-up of 4.7 years after deployment in the unmarried cohort, 827 new marriages were observed among deployed military veterans and 4363 in the matched non-deployed comparators cohort (399 vs. 444 per 10,000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95%CI 0.83–0.96). Conclusion Military veterans were more likely to divorce and less likely to marry after deployment compared with matched non-deployed comparators."
https://openalex.org/W2913251555,"Loss of function of the tumor suppressor p53 is known to increase the rate of migration of cells transiting the narrow pores of the traditional Boyden chamber assay. Here by contrast we investigate how p53 impacts the rate of cellular migration within a 2D confluent cell layer and a 3D collagen-embedded multicellular spheroid. We use two human carcinoma cell lines, the bladder carcinoma EJ and the colorectal carcinoma HCT116. In the confluent 2-D cell layer, for both EJ and HCT cells the migratory speeds and effective diffusion coefficients for the p53 null cells were significantly smaller than in p53-expressing cells. Compared to p53 expressers, p53-null cells exhibited more organized cortical actin rings together with reduced front-rear cell polarity. Furthermore, loss of p53 caused cells to exert smaller traction forces upon their substrates, and reduced formation of cryptic lamellipodia. In the 3D multicellular spheroid, loss of p53 consistently reduced collective cellular migration into surrounding collagen matrix. As regards the role of p53 in cellular migration, extrapolation from the Boyden chamber assay to other cellular microenvironments is seen to be fraught even in terms of the sign of the effect. Together, these paradoxical results show that the effects of p53 on cellular migration are context-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2952792091,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is an asymptomatic colonizer of the human nasopharynx but can also cause disease in the inner ear, meninges, lung and blood. Although various mechanisms contribute to the effective clearance of Spn, opsonophagocytosis by neutrophils is perhaps most critical. Upon phagocytosis, Spn is exposed to various degradative molecules, including a family of neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) that are stored within intracellular granules. Despite the critical importance of NSPs in killing Spn, the bacterial proteins that are degraded by NSPs leading to Spn death are still unknown. In this report, we identify a 90kDa protein in a purified cell wall (CW) preparation, aminopeptidase N (PepN) that is degraded by the NSP neutrophil elastase (NE). Since PepN lacked a canonical signal sequence or LPxTG motif, we created a mutant expressing a FLAG tagged version of the protein and confirmed its localization to the CW compartment. We determined that not only is PepN a CW-localized protein, but also is a substrate of NE in the context of intact Spn cells. Furthermore, in comparison to wild-type TIGR4 Spn, a mutant strain lacking PepN demonstrated a significant hyper-resistance phenotype in vitro in the presence of purified NE as well as in opsonophagocytic assays with purified human neutrophils ex vivo. Taken together, this is the first study to demonstrate that PepN is a CW-localized protein and a substrate of NE that contributes to the effective killing of Spn by NSPs and human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2914778689,"There are few acknowledged multidisciplinary quality standards for research practice and evaluation. This study evaluates the face validity of a recently developed comprehensive quality model that includes 32 defined concepts based on four main areas (credible, contributory, communicable, and conforming) describing indicators of research practice quality. Responses from 42 senior researchers working within 18 different departments at three major universities showed that the research quality model was–overall–valid. The vast majority believed all concepts in the model to be important, and did not indicate the need for further development. However, some of the sub-concepts were indicated as being slightly less important. Further, there were significant differences concerning ‘communicable’ between disciplines and academic levels, and for ‘conforming’ between genders. Our study indicates that the research quality model proposes the opportunity to move to a more systematic and multidisciplinary approach to research quality improvement, which has implications for how scientific knowledge is obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2913034827,"The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase, sirtuin (SIRT)1, in skeletal muscle is reduced in insulin-resistant states. However, whether this is an initial mechanism responsible for mediating insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle remains to be investigated. Also, SIRT1 acts as a mitochondrial gene transcriptional regulator and is induced by a short-term, high-fat diet (HFD) in human skeletal muscle. Whether saturated or unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) in the diet are important for this is unknown. We subjected 17 healthy, young men to a eucaloric control (Con) diet and 1 of 2 hypercaloric [+75% energy (E%)] HFDs for 3 d enriched in either saturated (Sat) FA (79 E% fat; Sat) or unsaturated FA (78 E% fat; Unsat). After Sat, SIRT1 protein content and activity in skeletal muscle increased ( P < 0.05; ∼40%) while remaining unchanged after Unsat. Whole-body insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated leg glucose uptake were reduced ( P < 0.01; ∼20%) to a similar extent compared to Con after both HFDs. We demonstrate a novel FA type-dependent regulation of SIRT1 protein in human skeletal muscle. Moreover, regulation of SIRT1 does not seem to be an initiating factor responsible for mediating insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle.-Fritzen, A. M., Lundsgaard, A.-M., Jeppesen, J. F., Sjøberg, K. A., Høeg, L. D., Deleuran, H. H., Wojtaszewski, J. F. P., Richter, E. A., Kiens, B.

https://openalex.org/W2913373579,"Co-diagnosis of HIV and tuberculosis presents a treatment dilemma. Starting both treatments at the same time can cause a flood of immune response called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) which can be lethal. But, how long to delay HIV treatment is less understood. In 2011, based on the conclusions of three separate studies, WHO recommended starting HIV treatment earlier for those with later HIV disease progression. This paper conducts a replication study of one of the three studies, by Havlir and colleagues. Using their publicly available data, we were able to replicate most of the results presented in the original paper. In our measurement and estimation analyses we use different estimation techniques to assess the robustness of the results. We find that adjusting for loss to follow-up does not affect the main results of the paper. However, an ANCOVA estimation and an instrumental variable model weaken the main result of the paper of better outcomes with early HIV treatment only for those who are sicker, reducing significance from the 5% to the 10% level. A change-point analysis also detects no changes in effect by timing of HIV treatment initiation or different thresholds of CD4 count for the primary outcome. This result suggests that the choice of start time for HIV treatment initiation should be based on other factors including potential drug interactions, overlapping side effects, a high pill burden and severity of illness rather than CD4 threshold and preset timeframes. While we caution against overgeneralizing, the result of this replication is aligned with more recent studies that show no evidence that early initiation of HIV treatment reduces mortality for any patients."
https://openalex.org/W2915039571,"Background Smoking is a recognized risk factor for osteoporosis. Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a novel texture parameter to evaluate bone microarchitecture. TBS and their main determinants are unknown in active and former smokers. Objective To assess TBS in a population of active or former smokers with and without Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and to determine its predictive factors. Methods Active and former smokers from a pulmonary clinic were invited to participate. Clinical features were recorded and bone turnover markers (BTMs) measured. Lung function, low dose chest Computed Tomography scans (LDCT), dual energy absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed and TBS measured. Logistic regression analysis explored the relationship between measured parameters and TBS. Results One hundred and forty five patients were included in the analysis, 97 (67.8%) with COPD. TBS was lower in COPD patients (median 1.323; IQR: 0.13 vs 1.48; IQR: 0.16, p = 0.003). Regression analysis showed that a higher body mass index (BMI), younger age, less number of exacerbations and a higher forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1%) was associated with better TBS (β = 0.005, 95% CI:0.000–0.011, p = 0.032; β = -0.003, 95% CI:-0.007(-)-0.000, p = 0.008; β = -0.019, 95% CI:-0.034(-)-0.004, p = 0.015; β = 0.001, 95% CI:0.000–0.002, p = 0.012 respectively). The same factors with similar results were found in COPD patients. Conclusions A significant proportion of active and former smokers with and without COPD have an affected TBS. BMI, age, number of exacerbations and the degree of airway obstruction predicts TBS values in smokers with and without COPD. This important information should be considered when evaluating smokers at risk of osteoporosis."

The new elements would extend the table—now seven rows deep—to an eighth row, where some theories predict exotic traits will emerge. Elements in that row might even destroy the table9s very periodicity because chemical and physical properties might not repeat at regular intervals anymore. Pushing further into the eighth row could also answer questions that scientists have wrestled with since Dmitri Mendeleev9s day: How many elements exist? And how far does the table go?"

https://openalex.org/W2912947654,"Background and objectives Nurses serve as gatekeepers of the health of long-term care facility (LTCF) residents and are key members deciding whether residents should visit an emergency department (ED). Inappropriate decisions as to ED visits may result in ED overcrowding, excessive medical expenses, and nosocomial infections. Currently, there is a lack of effective tools for assessing the barriers and level of difficulty experienced by LTCF nurses. The purposes of this study were to develop a Patient Transfer Decision Difficulty Scale (PTDDS) and test its effectiveness. Methods This study randomly sampled LTCFs in Taiwan and surveyed two or three nurses in every institution selected. Registered return envelopes were provided for participants to return self-completed questionnaires. Three steps were used to develop the scale and items: in step I, the instrument was developed; in step II, psychometric testing was conducted, which entailed performing an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to verify the construct validity and reliability of the developed items; and in step III, a confirmation study was conducted using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling to cross-validate the factors and items. Results The cumulative sum of variance explained by the measurement models of the three factors in the PTDDS was 63.54%.When deciding whether to transfer LTCF residents to EDs, the most pronounced barrier experienced by nurses were for judging the severity of “clinical episodes”, which had an explanatory power of 37.49%. The second and third pronounced barriers and decision difficulty experienced by nurses were “communication and information” and “timing of the residents’ emergency visits,” which explained 16.81% and 9.24% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions The cross-validation results obtained using the EFA and CFA showed favorable reliability and validity of the PTDDS. For future studies, this study recommends performing large-scale investigations of the level of decision difficulty and related factors experienced by nurses in LTCFs of varying levels and types."

https://openalex.org/W2911619300,"Nek2 is a dimeric serine/ threonine protein kinase that belongs to the family of NIMA-related kinases (Neks). Its N-terminal catalytic domain and its C-terminal regulatory region are bridged by a leucine zipper, which plays an important role in the activation of Nek2's catalytic activity. Unusual conformational dynamics on the intermediary/slow timescale has thwarted all attempts so far to determine the structure of the Nek2 leucine zipper by means of X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Disulfide engineering, the strategic placement of non-native disulfide bonds into flexible regions flanking the coiled coil, was used to modulate the conformational exchange dynamics of this important dimerization domain. The resulting reduction in exchange rate leads to substantial improvements of important features in NMR spectra, such as line width, coherence transfer leakage and relaxation. These effects were comprehensively analyzed for the wild type protein, two single disulfide bond-bearing mutants and another double disulfide bonds-carrying mutant. Furthermore, exchange kinetics were measured across a wide temperature range, allowing for a detailed analysis of activation energy (ΔG‡) and maximal rate constant (k'ex). For one mutant carrying a disulfide bond at its C-terminus, a full backbone NMR assignment could be obtained for both conformers, demonstrating the benefits of the disulfide engineering. Our study demonstrates the first successful application of 'kinetic' disulfide bonds for the purpose of controlling the adverse effects of protein dynamics. Firstly, this provides a promising, robust platform for the full structural and functional investigation of the Nek2 leucine zipper in the future. Secondly, this work broadens the toolbox of protein engineering by disulfide bonds through the addition of a kinetic option in addition to the well-established thermodynamic uses of disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2911273990,"Recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli are frequently purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). By means of this technique, tagged proteins containing a polyhistidine sequence can be obtained up to 95% pure in a single step, but some host proteins also bind with great affinity to metal ions and contaminate the sample. A way to overcome this problem is to include a second tag that is recognized by a preexistent monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the gene encoding the target protein, allowing further purification. With this strategy, the recombinant protein can be directly used as target in capture ELISA using plates sensitized with the corresponding mAb. As a proof of concept, in this study we engineered a Trichinella-derived tag (MTFSVPIS, recognized by mAb US9) into a His-tagged recombinant Fasciola antigen (rFhLAP) to make a new chimeric recombinant protein (rUS9-FhLAP), and tested its specificity in capture and indirect ELISAs with sera from sheep and cattle. FhLAP was selected since it was previously reported to be immunogenic in ruminants and is expressed in soluble form in E. coli, which anticipates a higher contamination by host proteins than proteins expressed in inclusion bodies. Our results showed that a large number of sera from non-infected ruminants (mainly cattle) reacted in indirect ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP after single-step purification by IMAC, but that this reactivity disappeared testing the same antigen in capture ELISA with mAb US9. These results demonstrate that the 6XHis and US9 tags can be combined when double purification of recombinant proteins is required."
https://openalex.org/W2911783723,"On Thursday nights, the yarn comes out. Every week, my fellow entomology graduate students and I get together to make insect-inspired crafts. One crochets butterflies, another makes earrings out of wings from discarded research specimens, and a third decoupages notebooks with figures and illustrations from journal articles thrown out after a lab cleanup. It may sound light or frivolous, but it's far from it. A regular social night like this—whether built around crafts or some other shared interest—can make a significant difference in our work and our lives.

The catalyst for starting craft night was the death of a friend and fellow student in the department. Following that tragedy, I started to crochet bumble bees for his family and friends in memory of him and his research. Crocheting allowed me to create something that I could give others and help comfort them, and I think it helped comfort me as well. Fashioning bees for others rather than sitting idle helped me work through my grief.

I continued to crochet bumble bees long after, and I was surprised when other students asked me to teach them how to crochet. I found out that many students in the department enjoyed crafting. After talking, we finally gathered one evening at a friend's house, where I attempted to teach 10 people how to crochet at once. There was yarn and knots and chaos, but enough people wanted to stick with it that we planned a second night so that they could finish the bees they started.

That second craft night, an experienced crafter wanted to try something new—making earrings out of insect wings. She pulled out a bag of iridescent beetle wings that shimmered green, red, and blue in the light. Immediately, everyone wanted to learn how to turn them into earrings, too. We continued to meet, and as more people brought new projects, craft night evolved into a weekly social event.

Now, 2 years in, craft night is open to everyone to do whatever they wish, crafting or not. One attendee uses the time to curate his personal beetle collection, which numbers more than 12,000 specimens so far. Another comes to socialize and catch up with students in other labs. Sometimes friends and spouses join us. We've also received support from others in the department. The Entomology Graduate Student Association has given us funding to purchase crafting supplies, and professors have given us Tupperware containers full of discarded research specimens, including monarch butterflies and spotted lanternflies—the makings of our earrings.

We've crafted so much that we've started to sell our handiwork at events, including the Entomological Society of America's annual meeting and The Great Insect Fair, a yearly event for scientists and the public hosted by our department. The proceeds help support graduate student events in the department, such as professional development seminars and socials.

I think craft night supports graduate students in other ways as well. It goes without saying that graduate school is immensely stressful and has become a breeding ground for mental health problems. But social events such as craft nights can go a long way toward helping graduate students cope with stress and build camaraderie with their fellow students. I've gained new friends and grown closer to them by teaching them my skills and asking them to teach me theirs. New students have used craft night to connect with more senior students and ask for help and advice about transitioning into graduate school. One student commented that craft night has made her feel more welcome in our department and university.

The benefits also extend to our research. At craft night, students have formed new research collaborations and come up with ideas for new projects together. One student works so closely with students from another lab—whom she connected with at craft night—that they now consider her an honorary member of their lab.

With my defense date approaching, I don't know exactly what my future holds. But I know that craft night will continue to grow and metamorphose in the hands of future entomology students.

Theodore Gray's literal periodic table of elements

PHOTO: MIKE WALKER

The United Nations has designated 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements ([www.iypt2019.org][2]) and, with it, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The organizing committee declared that “The Periodic Table of Chemical Elements is one of the most significant achievements in science, capturing the essence not only of chemistry, but also of physics and biology.” Indeed, many nonscientists recognize the periodic table simply by the distinctive shape of its border, but within this border lie many aspects of science beyond chemistry. Science is about the interplay of experimental results and theory. A sufficient number of elements needed to be discovered and their properties and reactivity understood before systematic trends could be inferred. Science is also fundamentally about making testable predictions. Part of the success of Dmitri Mendeleev's original table published in 1869 was that he left gaps for the placement of undiscovered elements. Mendeleev predicted some properties of these elements, setting off a chain of scientific testing of hypotheses. The structure of the periodic table was later understood to arise from quantum mechanics. The elements themselves are produced by a complex chain of stellar nucleosynthesis processes, and the frontier of the periodic table—the search for stable superheavy elements—tests the limits of experimental atomic physics.

A large periodic table is frequently displayed in classrooms (not just chemistry classrooms) but is often placed too high on the wall for anyone to make out more than the element symbols and atomic numbers. Periodic tables hung this way really serve as banners or flags and declare to anyone who enters the room that “We're doing science here.”
