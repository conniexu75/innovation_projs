https://openalex.org/W4283829975,"Immature dentate granule cells (imGCs) arising from adult hippocampal neurogenesis contribute to plasticity and unique brain functions in rodents1,2 and are dysregulated in multiple human neurological disorders3–5. Little is known about the molecular characteristics of adult human hippocampal imGCs, and even their existence is under debate1,6–8. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing aided by a validated machine learning-based analytic approach to identify imGCs and quantify their abundance in the human hippocampus at different stages across the lifespan. We identified common molecular hallmarks of human imGCs across the lifespan and observed age-dependent transcriptional dynamics in human imGCs that suggest changes in cellular functionality, niche interactions and disease relevance, that differ from those in mice9. We also found a decreased number of imGCs with altered gene expression in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we demonstrated the capacity for neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus with the presence of rare dentate granule cell fate-specific proliferating neural progenitors and with cultured surgical specimens. Together, our findings suggest the presence of a substantial number of imGCs in the adult human hippocampus via low-frequency de novo generation and protracted maturation, and our study reveals their molecular properties across the lifespan and in Alzheimer's disease. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis supports the presence of immature dentate granule cells throughout the human lifespan and shows that these cells are reduced in number and dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W4284885575,"Gonadal development is a complex process that involves sex determination followed by divergent maturation into either testes or ovaries1. Historically, limited tissue accessibility, a lack of reliable in vitro models and critical differences between humans and mice have hampered our knowledge of human gonadogenesis, despite its importance in gonadal conditions and infertility. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of first- and second-trimester human gonads using a combination of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility assays and fluorescent microscopy. We extracted human-specific regulatory programmes that control the development of germline and somatic cell lineages by profiling equivalent developmental stages in mice. In both species, we define the somatic cell states present at the time of sex specification, including the bipotent early supporting population that, in males, upregulates the testis-determining factor SRY and sPAX8s, a gonadal lineage located at the gonadal-mesonephric interface. In females, we resolve the cellular and molecular events that give rise to the first and second waves of granulosa cells that compartmentalize the developing ovary to modulate germ cell differentiation. In males, we identify human SIGLEC15+ and TREM2+ fetal testicular macrophages, which signal to somatic cells outside and inside the developing testis cords, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of human and mouse gonadal differentiation, which can guide in vitro gonadogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4284889206,"Transcriptomics has revealed that cortical inhibitory neurons exhibit a great diversity of fine molecular subtypes1-6, but it is not known whether these subtypes have correspondingly diverse patterns of activity in the living brain. Here we show that inhibitory subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) have diverse correlates with brain state, which are organized by a single factor: position along the main axis of transcriptomic variation. We combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of mouse V1 with a transcriptomic method to identify mRNA for 72 selected genes in ex vivo slices. We classified inhibitory neurons imaged in layers 1-3 into a three-level hierarchy of 5 subclasses, 11 types and 35 subtypes using previously defined transcriptomic clusters3. Responses to visual stimuli differed significantly only between subclasses, with cells in the Sncg subclass uniformly suppressed, and cells in the other subclasses predominantly excited. Modulation by brain state differed at all hierarchical levels but could be largely predicted from the first transcriptomic principal component, which also predicted correlations with simultaneously recorded cells. Inhibitory subtypes that fired more in resting, oscillatory brain states had a smaller fraction of their axonal projections in layer 1, narrower spikes, lower input resistance and weaker adaptation as determined in vitro7, and expressed more inhibitory cholinergic receptors. Subtypes that fired more during arousal had the opposite properties. Thus, a simple principle may largely explain how diverse inhibitory V1 subtypes shape state-dependent cortical processing."
https://openalex.org/W4284886986,"Understanding the direct transformation from graphite to diamond has been a long-standing challenge with great scientific and practical importance. Previously proposed transformation mechanisms1-3, based on traditional experimental observations that lacked atomistic resolution, cannot account for the complex nanostructures occurring at graphite-diamond interfaces during the transformation4,5. Here we report the identification of coherent graphite-diamond interfaces, which consist of four basic structural motifs, in partially transformed graphite samples recovered from static compression, using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. These observations provide insight into possible pathways of the transformation. Theoretical calculations confirm that transformation through these coherent interfaces is energetically favoured compared with those through other paths previously proposed1-3. The graphite-to-diamond transformation is governed by the formation of nanoscale coherent interfaces (diamond nucleation), which, under static compression, advance to consume the remaining graphite (diamond growth). These results may also shed light on transformation mechanisms of other carbon materials and boron nitride under different synthetic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4284878948,"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets1-5. However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W4284675830,"Social-evaluative stressors-experiences in which people feel they could be judged negatively-pose a major threat to adolescent mental health1-3 and can cause young people to disengage from stressful pursuits, resulting in missed opportunities to acquire valuable skills. Here we show that replicable benefits for the stress responses of adolescents can be achieved with a short (around 30-min), scalable 'synergistic mindsets' intervention. This intervention, which is a self-administered online training module, synergistically targets both growth mindsets4 (the idea that intelligence can be developed) and stress-can-be-enhancing mindsets5 (the idea that one's physiological stress response can fuel optimal performance). In six double-blind, randomized, controlled experiments that were conducted with secondary and post-secondary students in the United States, the synergistic mindsets intervention improved stress-related cognitions (study 1, n = 2,717; study 2, n = 755), cardiovascular reactivity (study 3, n = 160; study 4, n = 200), daily cortisol levels (study 5, n = 118 students, n = 1,213 observations), psychological well-being (studies 4 and 5), academic success (study 5) and anxiety symptoms during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (study 6, n = 341). Heterogeneity analyses (studies 3, 5 and 6) and a four-cell experiment (study 4) showed that the benefits of the intervention depended on addressing both mindsets-growth and stress-synergistically. Confidence in these conclusions comes from a conservative, Bayesian machine-learning statistical method for detecting heterogeneous effects6. Thus, our research has identified a treatment for adolescent stress that could, in principle, be scaled nationally at low cost."

https://openalex.org/W4283837016,"Abstract The hippocampal cognitive map supports navigation towards, or away from, salient locations in familiar environments 1 . Although much is known about how the hippocampus encodes location in world-centred coordinates, how it supports flexible navigation is less well understood. We recorded CA1 place cells while rats navigated to a goal on the honeycomb maze 2 . The maze tests navigation via direct and indirect paths to the goal and allows the directionality of place cells to be assessed at each choice point. Place fields showed strong directional polarization characterized by vector fields that converged to sinks distributed throughout the environment. The distribution of these ‘convergence sinks’ (ConSinks) was centred near the goal location and the population vector field converged on the goal, providing a strong navigational signal. Changing the goal location led to movement of ConSinks and vector fields towards the new goal. The honeycomb maze allows independent assessment of spatial representation and spatial action in place cell activity and shows how the latter relates to the former. The results suggest that the hippocampus creates a vector-based model to support flexible navigation, allowing animals to select optimal paths to destinations from any location in the environment."

https://openalex.org/W4284674871,"Rationale Vital signs follow circadian patterns in both healthy volunteers and critically ill patients, which seem to be influenced by disease severity in the latter. In this study we explored the existence of circadian patterns in heart rate, respiratory rate and skin temperature of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and aimed to explore differences in circadian rhythm amplitude during patient deterioration. Methods We performed a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the general ward of a tertiary hospital between April 2020 and March 2021. Patients were continuously monitored using a wireless sensor and fingertip pulse oximeter. Data was divided into three cohorts: patients who recovered, patients who developed respiratory insufficiency and patients who died. For each cohort, a population mean cosinor model was fitted to detect rhythmicity. To assess changes in amplitude, a mixed-effect cosinor model was fitted. Results A total of 429 patients were monitored. Rhythmicity was observed in heartrate for the recovery cohort (p&lt;0.001), respiratory insufficiency cohort (p&lt;0.001 and mortality cohort (p = 0.002). Respiratory rate showed rhythmicity in the recovery cohort (p&lt;0.001), but not in the other cohorts (p = 0.18 and p = 0.51). Skin temperature also showed rhythmicity in the recovery cohort (p&lt;0.001), but not in the other cohorts (p = 0.22 and p = 0.12). For respiratory insufficiency, only the amplitude of heart rate circadian pattern increased slightly the day before (1.2 (99%CI 0.16–2.2, p = 0.002)). In the mortality cohort, the amplitude of heart rate decreased (-1.5 (99%CI -2.6- -0.42, p&lt;0.001)) and respiratory rate amplitude increased (0.72 (99%CI 0.27–1.3, p = 0.002) the days before death. Conclusion A circadian rhythm is present in heart rate of COVID-19 patients admitted to the general ward. For respiratory rate and skin temperature, rhythmicity was only found in patients who recover, but not in patients developing respiratory insufficiency or death. We found no consistent changes in circadian rhythm amplitude accompanying patient deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W4284683572,"The combination of panobinostat, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PanBorDex) is available as a treatment option for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) based on the PANORAMA-1 trial which investigated this triplet in early relapse. In routine clinical care, PanBorDex is used primarily in later relapses and is commonly administered in attenuated dosing schedules to mitigate the treatment-related toxicity. We set out to evaluate efficacy and safety outcomes with PanBorDex later in the disease course and evaluate the role of attenuated dosing schedules. This was a retrospective evaluation of patients treated in routine clinical practice between 2016-2019 across seven heamatology centres in the UK; patients who received at least one dose of PanBorDex were eligible for inclusion. The dosing schedule of panobinostat (10mg, 15mg or 20mg, twice or three times a week) and bortezomib (0.7mg/m2, 1mg/m2 or 1.3mg/m2 once or twice weekly) was as per treating physician choice. Patients received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary outcome is response rates according to IMWG criteria. Key secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Other secondary endpoints include rates of adverse events according to CTCAE criteria. In total, 61 patients were eligible for inclusion and received PanBorDex primarily as ≥5th line of treatment. One third of patients received PanBorDex at full dose, for the remaining two thirds, treatment was given in reduced dose intensities. The overall response rate was 44.2%, including 14.7% very good partial response (VGPR) rates; 68.8% of patients derived clinical benefit with stable disease or better. The median PFS was 3.4 months; non-refractory patients and those who achieved VGPR benefited from prolonged PFS of 11.4 months and 17.7 months, respectively. The median OS was 9.5 months. The triplet was associated with 45% and 18% incidence of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia and diarrhea, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4284673196,"Corynebacterium spp. are frequently detected in bovine quarter milk samples, yet their impact on udder health has not been determined completely. In this longitudinal study, we collected quarter milk samples from a dairy herd of approximately 200 cows, ten times at 14 d intervals. Bacteriologically, Catalase-positive and Gram-positive rods were detected in 22.7% of the samples. For further species diagnosis, colonies were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Corynebacterium bovis , C . amycolatum , C . xerosis and 10 other Corynebacterium spp. were detected. The three aforementioned species accounted for 88.4%, 8.65% and 0.94% of all cultured Corynebacterium spp., respectively. For further evaluation of infection dynamics, the following three infection definitions were applied: A (2/3 consecutive samples positive for the same species), B (≥1000 cfu/mL in one sample), C (isolated from a clinical mastitis case). Infections according to definition B occurred most frequently and clinical mastitis with Corynebacterium spp. occurred once during sampling. Life tables were used to determine the duration of infection. According to infection definition A, infection durations of 111 d and 98 d were obtained for C . bovis and C . amycolatum , respectively. Exemplarily, longer lasting infections were examined for their strain diversity by RAPD PCR. A low strain diversity was found in the individual quarters that indicates a longer colonization of the udder parenchyma by C . bovis and C . amycolatum ."
https://openalex.org/W4284674802,"Resistance plasmids are crucial for the transfer of antimicrobial resistance and thus form a matter of concern for veterinary and human healthcare. To study plasmid transfer, foodborne Escherichia coli isolates harboring one to five known plasmids were co-incubated with a general recipient strain. Plasmid transfer rates under standardized conditions varied by a factor of almost 10 6 , depending on the recipient/donor strain combination. After 1 hour transconjugants never accounted for more than 3% of the total number of cells. Transconjugants were formed from 14 donors within 1 hour of co-incubation, but in the case of 3 donors 24 hours were needed. Transfer rates were also measured during longer co-incubation, between different species and during repeated back and forth transfer. Longer co-incubation resulted in the transfer of more types of resistance. Maximum growth rates of donor strains varied by a factor of 3. Donor strains often had higher growth rates than the corresponding transconjugants, which grew at the same rate as or slightly faster than the recipient. Hence, possessing one or more plasmids does not seem to burden the harboring strain metabolically. Transfer was species specific and repeated transfer of one plasmid did not result in different transfer rates over time. Transmission Electron microcopy was used to analyze the morphology of the connection between co-incubated strains. Connection by more pili between the cells resulted in better aggregate formation and corresponded with higher transfer rates."
https://openalex.org/W4284693731,"African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease of domestic and wild pigs of all breeds and ages, with the acute form of the disease being characterized by high fever, hemorrhages in the reticuloendothelial system and a high mortality rate. Registered safe and efficacious ASF vaccines are not available. The development of experimental ASF vaccines, particularly live attenuated, have considerably intensified in the last years. There is much variability in experimental approaches undertaken by laboratories attempting to develop first generation vaccines, rendering it difficult to interpret and make comparisons across trials. ASF virus (ASFV) genotyping does not fully correlate with available cross-protection data and may be of limited value in predicting cross-protective vaccine efficacy. Recently, ASFV strains were assigned to a respective nine groups by seroimmunotype (from I to IX): in vivo the grouping is based on results of cross protection of pigs survived after their infection with a virulent strain (bioassay), while in vitro this grouping is based on hemadsorption inhibition assay (HADIA) data. Here we demonstrate the antigenic and protective properties of two attenuated ASFV strains MK200 and FK-32/135. Pronounced differences in the HADIA and in immunological test in animals allow us to consider them and the corresponding reference virulent strains of the ASFV of Mozambique-78 (seroimmunotype III, genotype V) and France-32 (seroimmunotype IV, genotype I) as useful models for studying the mechanisms of protective immunity and evaluation of the candidate vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4284696810,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Diagnosis of ASD is complicated and there is an urgent need to identify ASD-associated biomarkers and features to help automate diagnostics and develop predictive ASD models. The present study adopts a novel evolutionary algorithm, the conjunctive clause evolutionary algorithm (CCEA), to select features most significant for distinguishing individuals with and without ASD, and is able to accommodate datasets having a small number of samples with a large number of feature measurements. The dataset is unique and comprises both behavioral and neuroimaging measurements from a total of 28 children from 7 to 14 years old. Potential biomarker candidates identified include brain volume, area, cortical thickness, and mean curvature in specific regions around the cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, and temporal-parietal junction, as well as behavioral features associated with theory of mind. A separate machine learning classifier (i.e., k-nearest neighbors algorithm) was used to validate the CCEA feature selection and for ASD prediction. Study findings demonstrate how machine learning tools might help move the needle on improving diagnostic and predictive models of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W4284709621,"Live-cell imaging has become state of the art to accurately identify the nature of mitotic and cell cycle defects. Low- and high-throughput microscopy setups have yield huge data amounts of cells recorded in different experimental and pathological conditions. Tailored semi-automated and automated image analysis approaches allow the analysis of high-content screening data sets, saving time and avoiding bias. However, they were mostly designed for very specific experimental setups, which restricts their flexibility and usability. The general need for dedicated experiment-specific user-annotated training sets and experiment-specific user-defined segmentation parameters remains a major bottleneck for fully automating the analysis process. In this work we present LiveCellMiner, a highly flexible open-source software tool to automatically extract, analyze and visualize both aggregated and time-resolved image features with potential biological relevance. The software tool allows analysis across high-content data sets obtained in different platforms, in a quantitative and unbiased manner. As proof of principle application, we analyze here the dynamic chromatin and tubulin cytoskeleton features in human cells passing through mitosis highlighting the versatile and flexible potential of this tool set."
https://openalex.org/W4284673699,"The objectives of this study were to assess the nutritional status of rural workers from a municipality in Southeastern Brazil and estimate the association of sociodemographic, labor, lifestyle, and dietary pattern factors with obesity and abdominal obesity of men and women of this rural area. This is a cross-sectional, epidemiological study of 740 farmers (51.5%, n = 381 males; 48.5%, n = 359 females). The sociodemographic, labor, lifestyle and dietary patterns determinants were assessed. Food intake data were obtained by applying three 24-hour recalls and dietary patterns were determined by Principal Component Analysis with Varimax orthogonal rotation. Poisson regression with robust variance stratified by sex was applied. The general prevalence of overweight status was 31.5% (95% CI 28.2-34.8%), 19.7% of obesity (95% CI 16.8-22.6%) and 31.5% of abdominal obesity (95% CI 28.2-34.8%), with higher rates in women (P < 0.001). Men of higher socioeconomic class had a 2.3 times higher prevalence of obesity (95% CI 1.08-4.90). In addition, the shorter travel time to purchase food increased the prevalence of abdominal obesity in males. For women, the older the age group, the greater the general and central obesity. A lower adherence to traditional dietary patterns (approximately PR [prevalence ratio] 1.6 for general obesity and PR 1.3 for abdominal obesity) and a greater number of places to buy food were associated with higher rates of obesity in women. Finally, women farmers with a higher workload had a 20% lower prevalence of central obesity (PR 0.80; 95% CI 0.65-0.97). Such findings demonstrate that obesity must be an issue in the health care of remote and rural populations. There is a need to promote healthier environments that respect traditional food culture through multiple approaches that consider the heterogeneity of rural areas and the differences between sexes."
https://openalex.org/W4284674254,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs, and their cargos have emerged as novel diagnostic markers in various diseases. We aimed to discover novel and noninvasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis by proteomic analysis using serum EVs in patients with chronic hepatitis C. We performed shotgun proteomics using serum EVs isolated from 54 patients with histologically assessed liver fibrosis. Shotgun proteomics identified a total of 974 proteins, and 445 proteins were detected in more than half of the patients. Among them, a total of 9 proteins were identified as proteins that tended to increase or decrease with liver fibrosis with a significance of p<0.005 and that were different between F1-2 patients and F3-4 patients with a significance of p<0.01. Among the 9 proteins, targeted proteomics using serum EVs isolated from the sera of another 80 patients with histologically assessed liver fibrosis verified that serum amyloid P component (SAP) and pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) levels in EVs significantly decreased with the progression of liver fibrosis and were significantly lower in F3-4 patients than in F1-2 patients. The diagnostic accuracies of SAP and PPBP in EVs for the liver fibrosis stage were comparable to those of type IV collagen 7S, hyaluronic acid, and the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4 index). Moreover, serum SAP and PPBP levels correlated with the levels in EVs, and the ability of serum SAP and PPBP to diagnose liver fibrosis stage was also comparable to the abilities of type IV collagen 7S, hyaluronic acid, and the FIB-4 index. In conclusion, proteomic analysis of serum EVs identified SAP and PPBP as candidate biomarkers for predicting liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In addition, SAP and PPBP levels in serum are strongly correlated with those in EVs and could represent markers of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4284692779,"To identify potential biomarkers in the plasma that could predict histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), using shotgun and targeted proteomic analyses.This retrospective cohort study included 78 singleton pregnant women with PPROM (24-34 gestational weeks) who delivered within 96 h of blood sampling. Maternal plasma samples were analyzed by label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for proteome profiling in a nested case-control study design (HCA cases vs. non-HCA controls [n = 9 each]). Differential expression of 12 candidate proteins was assessed by multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) analysis in individual plasma samples from cases and controls matched by gestational age at sampling (n = 40, cohort 1). A validation study was further performed in an independent study group (n = 38, cohort 2) using ELISA and turbidimetric immunoassay for three differentially expressed proteins.Shotgun proteomics analyses yielded 18 proteins that were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) between HCA cases and non-HCA controls. MRM-MS analysis of 12 differentially expressed proteins further revealed that the CRP, C4A, and SAA4 levels were significantly increased in women with HCA. A multi-marker panel comprising plasma SAA4 and C4A showed enhanced potential for differentiating HCA from non-HCA women (area under the curve = 0.899). Additional validation of these findings by ELISA assays revealed that the CRP levels were significantly higher in women with HCA than in those without HCA, whereas the plasma levels of C4A and SAA4 did not significantly differ between the two groups.Plasma C4A, SAA4, and CRP were identified as potential biomarkers for detecting HCA in women with PPROM, based on targeted and shotgun proteomic analyses, showing good accuracy when used as a combined dual-biomarker panel (C4A and SAA4). Nevertheless, ELISA validation of these proteins, except for CRP, may not yield clinically useful markers for predicting HCA."

https://openalex.org/W4284686820,"Introduction Sleep plays an essential role in every individual’s life since it contributes greatly to their well-being and health. Poor sleep quality is one of the most common consequences of hypertension (HTN), which is a leading public health problem. In Ethiopia, it is the main health concern among hypertension patients. Thus, in the study area, there is limited information regarding the investigation of sleep quality among hypertension patients. Therefore, this study aimed to assess sleep quality and associated factors among adult hypertensive patients attending a chronic follow up care clinic in northwest Amhara regional state referral hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among adult HTN patients from March 15/2021 to May 15/2021 in Northwest Amhara Regional State Referral Hospitals. A systematic random sampling method was used to select the study participants. A face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire with chart review was used. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for assessing sleep quality was used in this study. A binary logistic regression was used to see the association between dependent and independent variables. Variables having a p-value &lt; 0.05 with a 95% CI were considered statistically significant in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results In this study, 563 hypertensive patients were included, with a response rate of 96.9%. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 37.7% (95% CI: 33.4%–41.6%). Female gender (AOR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.55–4.18), age ≥ 65 years (AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.07–7.97), overweight (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 (AOR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.06–2.65), WHO stage II hypertension (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI:1.01–3.12), poor physical activity (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI:1.41–4.05), participants who had depression (AOR = 2.03,95% CI:1.24–3.34) and participants who had anxiety (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.16–3.03) were factors associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions In this study, more than one-third of the study participants had poor sleep quality. Female gender, age ≥ 65 years, overweight (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2, stage II hypertension, physical inactivity, depression, and anxiety were all associated with poor sleep quality. Managing depression and anxiety disorders, encouraging physical activity, and providing health education about weight loss are all necessary for HTN patients."

This study elicits Taiwanese medical students' perceptions of their values and preparedness to care for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender (LGBT) patients using a qualitative approach that considers broader societal changes, and more focused topics such as the provision of relevant training in medical education.Eighty-nine medical students/trainees from two southern Taiwanese medical schools (one public and one private) participated in focus groups (n = 70) and individual interviews (n = 19). Qualitative analysis was conducted using inductive thematic analysis.Participants (i) expressed wide social acceptance and openness toward LGBT individuals, but were unsure of ways to communicate with LGBT patients; (ii) confirmed that stigmatization and biases might be developed during their training; (iii) recognized gender stereotypes could have negative impacts on clinical reasoning; (iv) considered themselves prepared to care for LGBT patients, yet equated non-discriminatory attitudes to preparedness; (v) acknowledged a lack of relevant professional skills; (vi) implicated curriculum did not address LGBT issues systematically and explicitly.This study has identified the insufficiencies of current medical training and inadequate preparedness of medical students/trainees to provide better care for LGBT patients. It provides insights for medical educators to design and implement effective medical curriculum and training, and faculty development programs to equip medical students/trainees with self-awareness and competencies to more readily provide holistic care for SGM, in keeping up with social progress, and promote health equity for a more diverse patient population."
https://openalex.org/W4284710655,"Despite recent therapeutic advances, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a devastating disease with limited therapeutic options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated promising results in many cancers, but thus far have yielded little clinical benefit in PDAC. Based on recent combined targeting of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and a pilot clinical trial, we sought to elucidate potential interactions between PD-1 and CXCR4. We observed concomitant expression and direct interaction of PD-1 and CXCR4 in PDAC cells. This interaction was disrupted upon CXCR4 antagonism with AMD3100 and led to increased cell surface expression of PD-1. Importantly, CXCR4-mediated PDAC cell migration was also blocked by PD-1 inhibition. Our work provides a possible mechanism by which prior studies have demonstrated that combined CXCR4 and PD-1 inhibition leads to decreased tumor growth. This is the first report investigating PD-1 and CXCR4 interactions in PDAC cells and our results can serve as the basis for further investigation of combined therapeutic targeting of CXCR4 and PD-1."
https://openalex.org/W4284665756,"The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic significance of geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) at the time of recurrence in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer, and the relationship between GNRI and skeletal muscle mass for survival outcomes after recurrence. This study enrolled 77 patients who developed postoperative recurrence. The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was used in this study. The patients were divided into a high-GNRI group (n = 36) and a low-GNRI group (n = 41) for the GNRI, and were divided into a high-SMI group (n = 38) and a low-SMI group (n = 39) for SMI. The 2-year post-recurrence overall survival of patients in the high-GNRI group was significantly longer than that of patients in the low-GNRI group (P = 0.001). No significant difference for the 2-year post-recurrence OS curves between the high-SMI group and the low-SMI group was observed (P = 0.125). Upon stratifying the patients with high GNRI or low GNRI according to SMI, There was no significant difference in the 2-year post-recurrence OS curves between the patients with both high GNRI and high SMI and the patients with high GNRI and low SMI (P = 0.399). Similarly, There was no significant difference in the 2-year post-recurrence OS curves between the patients with low GNRI and high SMI and the patients with both low GNRI and low SMI (P = 0.256). Multivariate analysis revealed that the GNRI at the time of recurrence was an independent prognostic risk factor in patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer (P = 0.019). The GNRI at the time of recurrence is useful for predicting the prognosis in patients with recurrence pancreatic cancer. Skeletal muscle mass at the time of recurrence is not contributed to predict post-recurrence survival of patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4284676542,"Participation in valued interpersonal and community activities is a key component of rehabilitation for Veterans with amputation. The purpose of this study was to identify specific factors that promote or inhibit participation to inform development of interventions that may facilitate participation in desired life activities. A convenience sample of 408 Veterans with at least one lower limb amputation and who had received outpatient care from the Regional Amputation Center (RAC) completed a mailed survey. Participation was measured using the Community Participation Indicators (CPI) Importance, Control, and Frequency scales and the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Satisfaction with Social Participation scales. Multiple imputation procedures were used to address missing data. Correlates of participation were examined through multiple linear regression. A total of 235 participants completed the survey, a response rate of 58%. Levels of participation, measured with the PROMIS instruments, were 43.2 (SD = 8.1) for Ability and 46.4 (SD = 8.6) for Satisfaction. Regression analyses found robust amputation-specific correlates for participation, including body image and balance confidence. Generic (non-amputation specific) correlates for participation included depression and pain interference. Development of treatment approaches and devices that can address body image, balance confidence, pain, and mental health concerns such as depression have the potential to enhance the participation and rehabilitation of Veterans with lower limb amputation."
https://openalex.org/W4284681611,"Most transplant centers in the Netherlands use estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for evaluation of potential living kidney donors. Whereas eGFR often underestimates GFR, especially in healthy donors, measured GFR (mGFR) allows more precise kidney function assessment, and therefore holds potential to increase the living donor pool. We hypothesized that mGFR-based donor screening leads to acceptance of donors with lower pre-donation eGFR than eGFR-based screening.In this longitudinal cohort study, we compared eGFR (CKD-EPI) before donation in one center using mGFR-based screening (mGFR-cohort, n = 250) with two centers using eGFR-based screening (eGFR-cohort1, n = 466 and eGFR-cohort2, n = 160). We also compared differences in eGFR at five years after donation.Donor age was similar among the cohorts (mean±standard deviation (SD) mGFR-cohort 53±10 years, eGFR-cohort1 52±13 years, P = 0.16 vs. mGFR-cohort, and eGFR-cohort2 53±9 years, P = 0.61 vs. mGFR-cohort). Estimated GFR underestimated mGFR by 10±12 mL/min/1.73m2 (mean±SD), with more underestimation in younger donors. In the overall cohorts, mean±SD pre-donation eGFR was lower in the mGFR-cohort (91±13 mL/min/1.73m2) than in eGFR-cohort1 (93±15 mL/min/1.73m2, P<0.05) and eGFR-cohort2 (94±12 mL/min/1.73m2, P<0.05). However, these differences disappeared when focusing on more recent years, which can be explained by acceptance of more older donors with lower pre-donation eGFR over time in both eGFR-cohorts. Five years post-donation, mean±SD eGFR was similar among the centers (mGFR-cohort 62±12 mL/min/1.73m2, eGFR-cohort1 61±14 mL/min/1.73m2, eGFR-cohort2 62±11 mL/min/1.73m2, P = 0.76 and 0.95 vs. mGFR-cohort respectively). In the mGFR-cohort, 38 (22%) donors were excluded from donation due to insufficient mGFR with mean±SD mGFR of 71±9 mL/min/1.73m2.Despite the known underestimation of mGFR by eGFR, we did not show that the routine use of mGFR in donor screening leads to inclusion of donors with a lower pre-donation eGFR. Therefore eGFR-based screening will be sufficient for the majority of the donors. Future studies should investigate whether there is a group (e.g. young donors with insufficient eGFR) that might benefit from confirmatory mGFR testing."
https://openalex.org/W4284685201,"Wavelet transform (WT) is a commonly used method for noise suppression and feature extraction from biomedical images. The selection of WT system settings significantly affects the efficiency of denoising procedure. This comparative study analyzed the efficacy of the proposed WT system on real 292 ultrasound images from several areas of interest. The study investigates the performance of the system for different scaling functions of two basic wavelet bases, Daubechies and Symlets, and their efficiency on images artificially corrupted by three kinds of noise. To evaluate our extensive analysis, we used objective metrics, namely structural similarity index (SSIM), correlation coefficient, mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and universal image quality index (Q-index). Moreover, this study includes clinical insights on selected filtration outcomes provided by clinical experts. The results show that the efficiency of the filtration strongly depends on the specific wavelet system setting, type of ultrasound data, and the noise present. The findings presented may provide a useful guideline for researchers, software developers, and clinical professionals to obtain high quality images."
https://openalex.org/W4284688366,"Pediatric drug dosages are based on body weight, so accurate measurement thereof is essential. However, this is not possible in emergencies. When using weight-estimating tapes, World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts serve as reference weights; however, local growth charts might be more accurate. This study developed a tape based on 2017 Korean National Growth Charts, which are more suitable for the Korean population than WHO growth charts, and evaluated its performance in a Korean pediatric population. This prospective cross-sectional study analyzed 792 pediatric patients who had visited the emergency department from June 2021 to December 2021. Weights were estimated using the Broselow tape (BT), Pediatric Advanced Weight Prediction in the Emergency Room XL (PAWPER XL), and Body Habitus-based Pediatric Emergency Tape (BHPET). The performance and measurement agreement of the tapes were analyzed. Among the tapes, the BHPET had the smallest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), of 10.23%, and a root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) of 14.14%. Also, the percentage of weight estimations within 10% of the actual weight (PW10) was 59.6%, indicating better accuracy than the BT and PAWPER XL in all age groups. The intraclass correlation coefficients of the BT, PAWPER XL, and BHPET were 0.931, 0.977, and 0.985, respectively (p < 0.001). The performance and accuracy of the BHPET was similar or slightly superior to that of the other tapes. The body weight estimated using the BHPET for a local pediatric population was sufficiently correlated with the actual body weight."
https://openalex.org/W4284689200,"The stigma and negative attitudes surrounding Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reinforced by the prevalence of their negative representations. This study aimed to determine how AD framing influences attitudes towards AD and whether this influence differs between younger and older people. Additionally, the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) was used to examine the mediating role that emotions induced by different frames may have in bringing about attitude change. Posters with framed messages on AD (dualism and unity) were designed and shown to 136 participants (68 younger and 68 older adults). Both the younger and older participants were randomly divided into two sub-groups. Each sub-group was shown posters of a campaign with different AD frames: one group viewed posters with messages of the dualism frame and the other group viewed posters with messages of the unity frame. To analyse the effect of the different frames, a mixed design of repeated measures (ANOVA) was used in which attitudes towards AD were measured on two occasions. Both the impact and the emotions produced by exposure to the messages were recorded after the presentation of the posters and a MANOVA test was performed on them. Attitudes, impact and emotions experienced by the younger and older participants were compared. Older adults displayed positive attitudes towards AD but less than younger people. Unity-framed messages produced a positive change in attitudes regardless of the audience's age and led to higher levels of happiness, whereas dualism-framed messages had a greater impact and produced feelings of sadness, anger and fear but did not change attitudes. These findings suggest that reframing of AD may be essential to achieve a positive attitudinal change in both younger and older populations and foster positive emotions. The use of unity-framed messages should be considered when developing and implementing policies targeted at communication and awareness of AD in order to reduce the stigma associated with this form of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W4284691929,"The present study, in addition to molecular characterization of leptin ( lepa ) and its receptor ( lepr ) of spotted snakehead Channa punctata , is focussed on physicochemical, structural, evolutionary and selection pressure analyses which are poorly elucidated in teleosts in spite of that existence of these genes is well reported in several fish species. The putative full-length Lep and Lepr of C . punctata showed conserved structural and functional domains, especially the residues responsible for structural integrity and signal transduction. Conversely, residues predicted essential for Lep-Lepr interaction displayed divergence between teleosts and tetrapods. Impact of substitutions/deletions predicted using protein variation effect analyser tool highlighted species specificity in ligand-receptor interaction. Physicochemical properties of ligand and receptor predicted for the first time in vertebrates revealed high aliphatic and instability indices for both Lepa and Lepr, indicating thermostability of proteins but their instability under ex vivo conditions. Positive grand average of hydropathy score of Lepa suggests its hydrophobic nature conjecturing existence of leptin binding proteins in C . punctata . In addition to disulphide bonding, a novel posttranslational modification (S-126 phosphorylation) was predicted in Lepa of C . punctata . In Lepr, disulphide bond formation and N-linked glycosylation near WSXWS motif in ECD, and phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in ICD were predicted. Leptin and its receptor sequence of C . punctata cladded with its homolog from C . striata and C . argus of order Anabantiformes. Leptin system of Anabantiformes was phylogenetically closer to that of Pleuronectiformes, Scombriformes and Perciformes. Selection pressure analysis showed higher incidence of negative selection in teleostean leptin genes indicating limited adaptation in their structure and function. However, evidence of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection laid a foundation of co-evolution of Lepa and Lepr in teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W4284693100,"Falls is a common and debilitating condition among the older population, intensifying the need to educate older persons about falls. Technology advancement enables effective and efficient delivery of falls education to the older population. However, there is paucity of information on the perception of Malaysian older population on falls and their preferred website characteristics such as font size, design, layout, colour, navigation, and use of graphics or videos. Physiological changes in vision, cognition and psychomotor skills can affect how the older persons use the website. As Malaysia is a multicultural country, the needs of the website characteristics and falls perception of older persons may differ greatly. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of the older persons about falls and their desired website characteristics. Twenty-five community-living older persons (n = 25) of age 60 years and above were involved in the focus group discussions. NvivoTM software was used for data management and thematic analysis was undertaken. Emerging themes included 'Perceptions of falls in older persons', 'Actions taken when falls occurred', 'Perceived prevention strategies for falls' and 'End user requirements for falls educational website'. Falls were perceived as both an avoidable and a non-avoidable incident. Although the participants mentioned physical activity and home hazard modifications as strategies to prevent falls, they mainly discussed self-initiated precautionary approaches in falls prevention. Regarding desired website characteristics, the participants emphasized on easily readable text, appealing design, clear information, use of images/videos, and simple website navigation. Special requirements for colour selection and multi-language options were also raised. The delivery of falls education through website can be made possible by understanding the perception of older persons about falls and their requirements for the website. This is especially important as ethnic and cultural influences may play a role on their perceptions about falls and desired website characteristics."

A total of 80 samples were fabricated, including 20 of each investigated material. Among those were a nanocomposite (Ceram X Spectra ™ ST, Dentsply), a glass ionomer cement (Ketac Fill ™ , 3M ™ ), a cast metal alloy (Bio Maingold SG ® , Heraeus Kulzer) and a ceramic (HeraCeram ® Saphir, Heraeus Kulzer). Of each material, all samples were equally divided into two groups. Samples in one group were treated with AirFlow ® Plus using the AirFlow ® Prophylaxis Master (EMS, Switzerland) (Group AF) and the ones in the other group with Prophy Paste (Cleanic ™ , Kerr, Austria) (Group CL) on a rubber cup. Applied force amounted to 1.5 N at 2000 rpm. Under controlled reproduceable conditions, a 10-year interval with 4 application per year, a total of 200 seconds, was simulated. Size of each sample amounted to 6 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height. Half side of each sample were treated. While comparing the treated and untreated area of each sample, surface abrasion and roughness were measured using an optical 3D system. Roughness was measured based on the arithmetic roughness average of the surface (Ra) and root mean square of the surface roughness (Rq). The statistical evaluation of the data was carried out using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U-test, Wilcoxon-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test for group comparisons. In conclusion, the use of the rubber cup with Prophy Paste caused a significantly higher abrasion on composite, ceramic and gold compared to the AirFlow ® Plus powder (p &lt; 0.05). In group AF, the significant highest values for Ra were determined on GIC, followed by composite, gold and then ceramic in intragroup comparison. Ra on GIC was significantly higher in group AF (p &lt; 0.05)."

There is a dearth of published literature describing the extent of human rights violations among this population and their associated factors.A questionnaire was administered to 346 study participants aged 15 years and older, living in five urban cities of Bangladesh who self-identified as Hijra, in 2019. The six human rights violation indicators (Economic, Employment, Health, Education, Social and Civic and Political Right) assessed were categorized as binary. Associations between sociodemographic characteristics and the six human rights violations were tested using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.Human right violations including economic, educational, political, employment, health and social/civil right violations were reported in 73.3%, 59.3%, 58.5%, 46.4%, 42.7%, and 34.4% of the participants, respectively. Economic rights violations were associated with bisexuality (Adjusted odds ratios [AOR] 3.60, 95%CI: 1.57, 8.26) and not living with family (AOR 2.71, 95%CI: 1.21, 6.09), while Hijras who earned more than 10,000 Bangladesh Taka experienced higher odds of educational (AOR 2.77, 95%CI: 1.06, 7.19) and political rights violations (AOR 4.30, 95%CI: 1.06, 7.44). Living in Dhaka city was associated with a reduced odds for economic and political rights violation while experiencing violations of one human right could lead to violation of another in the Hijra community.Human rights violations were common in Bangladesh Hijras, particularly the Bisexual Hijras.

This study aims to evaluate the benefits and barriers of patient partnership in a healthcare setting. It is a qualitative and interventional study that implemented a patient and family partnership committee (PFPC) at a Lebanese hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. A purposeful guided approach was used for sampling, and data was collected by structured questionnaire ‎interviews. Seven PFPC team dynamics building blocks were generated: transparency, support, motivation, comfortable communication, mutual understanding, equity in positions and empowerment to participate. Both the patient partners (94%) and healthcare professionals (90%) were satisfied with the PFPC experience. The majority of the healthcare professionals (HP) reported a noticeable change in the quality improvement process (QIP) (89%) and approved to standardize the PFPC (93%). The patient partnership benefits were clear, and the PFPC was perceived positively by both patient partners (PP) and HP. PP experienced distress relief (37%), gained ideas (41%) and felt that their opinion was heard (27%) after PFPC participation. PP reported benefits to hospitalized patients, including respect and care (63%) and patient satisfaction (20%). The main challenges for PFPC implementation were time availability and conflicts. Lessons from patient partnership can be utilized to improve the patient care policies in the Lebanese healthcare system.

https://openalex.org/W4284714150,"Adopting an external focus of attention has been shown to benefit motor performance and learning. However, the potential of optimizing attentional focus for improving prosthetic motor skills in lower limb prosthesis (LLP) users has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the frequency and direction of attentional focus embedded in the verbal instructions in a clinical prosthetic training setting.Twenty-one adult LLP users (8 female, 13 male; 85% at K3 level; mean age = 50.5) were recruited from prosthetic clinics in the Southern Nevada region. Verbal interactions between LLP users and their prosthetists (mean experience = 10 years, range = 4-21 years) during prosthetic training were recorded. Recordings were analyzed to categorize the direction of attentional focus embedded in the instructional and feedback statements as internal, external, mixed, or unfocused. We also explored whether LLP users' age, time since amputation, and perceived mobility were associated with the proportion of attentional focus statements they received.We recorded a total of 20 training sessions, yielding 904 statements of instruction from 338 minutes of training. Overall, one verbal interaction occurred every 22.1 seconds. Among the statements, 64% were internal, 9% external, 3% mixed, and 25% unfocused. Regression analysis revealed that female, older, and higher functioning LLP users were significantly more likely to receive internally-focused instructions (p = 0.006, 0.035, and 0.024, respectively).Our results demonstrated that verbal instructions and feedback are frequently provided to LLP users during prosthetic training. Most verbal interactions are focused internally on the LLP users' body movements and not externally on the movement effects.While more research is needed to explore how motor learning principles may be applied to improve LLP user outcomes, clinicians should consider adopting the best available scientific evidence during treatment. Overreliance on internally-focused instructions as observed in the current study may hinder prosthetic skill learning."
https://openalex.org/W4284664689,"Unemployment is a major problem in both developed and developing countries. In Ethiopia, women unemployment is particularly high, and this makes it a grave socio-economic concern. The aim of this study is to assess the spatial distribution and identify the determinant factors of women unemployment in Ethiopia.The data used for the study is the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys of 2016. A total of 15683 women are involved in the study. Global Moran's I statistic and Poisson-based purely spatial scan statistics are employed to explore spatial patterns and detect spatial clusters of women unemployment, respectively. To identify factors associated with women unemployment, multilevel logistic regression model is used.A spatial analysis showed that there was a major spatial difference in women unemployment in Ethiopia with Global Moran's index value of 0.3 (p<0.001). The spatial distribution of women's unemployment varied significantly across the country. The major areas of unemployment were Afar and Somalia; southwest Tigray; North and west Oromia, and Eastern and southern parts of Amhara. Women with primary level of education(AOR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.80, 0.98), secondary and above level of education (AOR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.62, 0.82), women with rich wealth index (AOR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.90), pregnant women (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.5), women with a male household head(AOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.50), and urban women(AOR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.70) statistically associated with women unemployment.The unemployment rate of women in Ethiopia showed variation across different clusters.

https://openalex.org/W4284675925,"The purpose of this study is to reveal the response of multi Lane pre disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone embankment under vehicle dynamic load. In this paper, the pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone samples whose fractal dimension meets the requirements are obtained through the indoor disintegration test of carbonaceous mudstone. Geotechnical basic tests such as particle analysis experiments, compaction tests, and direct shear tests were carried out on the pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone samples, and the physical and mechanical parameters of the pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone were obtained. On this basis, a two-way 4-lane pre-disintegration carbonaceous mudstone embankment model of the expressway was established by ABAQUS numerical software. Three different working conditions are set up to study the dynamic response of multi-lane pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone embankment under vehicle load. The results show that the stress change trend on the surface of the pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone embankment without vehicles is the same as that on the side with vehicles. Under this condition, the vertical displacement of the pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone embankment surface can be as high as 4.33mm, and the vertical displacement change of the embankment in the 0–0.6s phase is basically the same as the stress amplitude distribution. When a traffic jam occurs on one side, the maximum increase in vertical stress on the surface of the embankment on the normal driving side is about 170 kPa compared to condition one, and the vertical displacement at each depth of the embankment has been significantly increased. When a traffic jam occurs on one side, it can significantly increase the vertical stress on the surface of the pre-disintegrated carbonaceous mudstone embankment in this lane. The middle part of the stress time curve of monitoring points 3 and 4 in working condition three is more stable and significant than in working condition one, and the maximum vertical displacement is increased by about 1.70mm. The research results can reference the stability analysis of carbonaceous mudstone embankments and engineering practice."
https://openalex.org/W4284676290,"Pollen grains are male gametophytes, an ephemeral haploid generation of plants, that commonly engage in competition for a limited supply of ovules. Since variation in reproductive capabilities among male gametophytes may influence the direction and pace of evolution in populations, we must be able to quantify the relative fitness of gametophytes from different sires. To explore this, we estimated the relative fitness of groups of male gametophytes in a dioecious, wind-pollinated model system, Cannabis sativa, by characterizing the non-abortion rate (measured via chemical staining) and viability (measured via in vitro germination) of pollen from multiple sires. Pollen viability quickly declined within two weeks of anther dehiscence, and pollen stored under freezer conditions did not germinate regardless of storage time. In contrast, pollen non-abortion rates declined slowly and persisted longer than the lifetime of a sporophyte plant under both room temperature and freezer conditions. Pollen samples that underwent both viability and non-abortion rate analysis displayed no significant correlation, implying that researchers cannot predict pollen viability from non-abortion rates, nor infer male gametophytic fitness from a single measure. Our work demonstrates two independent, differential approaches to measure proxies of male fitness in C. sativa."

We analyzed factors associated with its occurrence and the spectrum of culturable pathogens among patients routinely followed at the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Methods All HIV (+) patients with available URT swab culture were included into analyses. Patients were followed from the day of registration in the clinic until first positive URT swab culture or last clinical visit from January 1, 2007 to July 31, 2016. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify factors associated with positive URT swabs culture (those with p&lt;0.1 in univariate included into multivariable). Results In total 474 patients were included into the analyses, 166 with culturable URT swab. In general, 416 (87.8%) patients were male, 342 (72.1%) were infected through MSM contact, 253 (53.4%) were on antiretroviral therapy. Median follow-up time was 3.4 (1.3–5.7) years, age 35.2 (30.6–42.6) years and CD4+ count 528 (400–685) cells/μl. The most common cultured bacteria were S . aureus (40.4%) and S . pyogenes (13.9%) (Table 1). Patients with culturable URT-BI were more likely to be MSM (68.5% vs 78.9%; p&lt;0.016), have detectable viral load (20.9% vs 12.0%; p&lt;0.0001) and CD4+ cell count &lt;500 cells/μl (55.2% vs 39.0%; p = 0.003) (Table 2). In multivariate survival analyses detectable viral load (HR3.13; 95%Cl: 2.34–4.19) and MSM (1.63;1.09–2.42) were increasing, but older age (0.63;0.58–0.69, per 5 years older) and higher CD4+ count (0.90;0.85–0.95, per 100 cells/μl) decreasing the risk of culturable URT-BI (Table 2). Conclusions Culturable URT-BI are common among HIV-positive patients with high CD4+ count. Similarly to general population most common cultured bacteria were S . aureus and S . pyogenes . Risk factors identified in multivariate survival analysis indicate that younger MSM patients with detectable HIV viral load are at highest risk. In clinical practice this group of patients requires special attention."
https://openalex.org/W4284686247,The search of separation hyperplanes is an efficient way to find rules with classification purposes. This paper presents an alternative mathematical programming formulation to existing methods to find a discriminant hyperplane. The hyperplane H is found by minimizing the sum of all the distances to the area assigned to the group each individual belongs to. It results in a convex optimization problem for which we find an equivalent linear programming problem. We demonstrate that H exists when the centroids of the two groups are not equal. The method is effective dealing with low and high dimensional data where reduction of the dimension is proposed to avoid overfitting problems. We show the performance of this approach with different data sets and comparisons with other classifications methods. The method is called LPDA and it is implemented in a R package available in https://github.com/mjnueda/lpda.
https://openalex.org/W4284687848,"Breathing plays a vital role in everyday life, and specifically during exercise it provides working muscles with the oxygen necessary for optimal performance. Respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) monitors breathing through elastic belts around the chest and abdomen, with efficient breathing defined by synchronous chest and abdomen movement. This study examined if providing runners with visual feedback through RIP could increase breathing efficiency and thereby time to exhaustion. Thirteen recreational runners (8F, 5M) ran to exhaustion on an inclined treadmill on two days, with visual feedback provided on one randomly chosen day. Phase angle was calculated as a measure of thoraco-abdominal coordination. Time to exhaustion was not significantly increased when visual feedback was provided (p = 1). Phase angle was not significantly predicted by visual feedback (p = 0.667). Six participants improved phase angle when visual feedback was provided, four of whom increased time to exhaustion. Four participants improved phase angle by 9° or more, three of whom increased time to exhaustion. Participants who improved phase angle with visual feedback highlight that improving phase angle could increase time to exhaustion. Greater familiarization with breathing techniques and visual feedback and a different paradigm to induce running fatigue are needed to support future studies of breathing in runners."

In Chile, they are farming on the Chiloé island, where around 18% of the world's mussels are produced, however, their nutritional dynamics are largely unknown. For this reason, the objective of this study was to determine the proximal biochemical composition and the fatty acid profile in the Chilean oyster (Ostrea chilensis), the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and the Chilean mussel (Mytilus chilensis), to perform an intra and interspecific comparison. Shellfish sampled in winter were characterized by a high protein content, followed by medium values for lipid content and a low carbohydrate content compared to similar species in Europe. Also, oysters and mussels were found to be rich in omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA), so they can be considered excellent functional food option for a healthy human diet. Their high contribution of n-3 LC-PUFA ranged between 5.2-12.9 μg FA mg-1 dry weight with high n-3/n-6 ratios, which depends on both the species and the on-growing location. Both taxa can be considered a plausible option to promote a healthy diet of marine origin in future generations. Also, these results could benefit the projection and development of aquaculture of these mollusks."

We analysed variation over time using statistical process control to identify both trend and periods of significant change. Results We found evidence that the animation increased how frequently the articles were accessed, with a significant increase (p = &lt;0.01) during the two weeks after release of each animation. One animation was associated with an increase in positional leaders’ engagement with the research team. Conclusions Animations shared via social media can enhance dissemination. We describe lessons from the work to develop the intervention and support calls for work to increase the understanding and adoption of effective dissemination interventions. Our findings provide support for further work using randomised study designs."
https://openalex.org/W4284693798,"In financial time series there are time periods in which market indices values or assets prices increase or decrease monotonically. We call those events ""price runs"", ""elementary uninterrupted trends"" or just ""uninterrupted trends"". In this paper we study the distribution of the duration of uninterrupted trends for the daily indices DJIA, NASDAQ, IPC and Nikkei 225 during the period of time from 10/30/1978 to 08/07/2020 and we compare the simple geometric statistical model with [Formula: see text] consistent with the EMH to the empirical data. By a fitting procedure, it is found that the geometric distribution with parameter [Formula: see text] provides a good model for uninterrupted trends of short and medium duration for the more mature markets; however, longest duration events still need to be statistically characterized. Estimated values of the parameter p were also obtained and confirmed by calculating the mean value of p fluctuations from empirical data. Additionally, the observed trend duration distributions for the different studied markets are compared over time by means of the Anderson-Darling (AD) test, to the expected geometric distribution with parameter [Formula: see text] and to a geometric distribution with a free parameter p, making possible to assess and compare different market geometric behavior for different dates as well as to measure the fraction of time runs duration from studied markets are consistent with the geometric distribution with [Formula: see text] and in parametric free way."
https://openalex.org/W4284696360,"Background Female sex workers (FSWs) have a 26 times greater chance of HIV infection compared to the women in the general population. The World Health Organization recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for population groups with an HIV incidence of 3% or higher and FSWs in southern Africa fit this criteria. This study sought to understand factors that motivate FSWs to initiate PrEP, in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods We purposively selected and recruited 20 FSWs to participate in the study in-order to gain an in-depth understanding of factors that motivate FSWs to initiate PrEP in Harare, Zimbabwe. We identified FSW who had been initiated on PrEP at a specialized clinic providing comprehensive sexual reproductive health (SRH) services for sex workers including HIV prevention options. We used a descriptive phenomenological approach to collect and analyze the data. Data was analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven steps to analyze data. Findings Two broad themes were identified as intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. The two broad themes each have several sub-themes. The sub-themes under intrinsic motivation were (i) Self- protection from HIV infection and (ii) condoms bursting. Six sub-themes were identified as external motivators for initiating PrEP, these included (i) occupational risk associated with sex work, (ii) increased chance of offering unprotected sex as a motivator to initiate PrEP, (iii) positive encouragement from others (iv) need to take care of the children and (v) prior participation in HIV prevention research studies and (vi) Gender Based Violence. Conclusions Understanding the factors that motivate FSWs to initiate PrEP is critical in developing contextually appropriate strategies to promote PrEP initiation and adherence strategies within specific and eligible populations for receiving PrEP according to the WHO guidelines (2015)."
https://openalex.org/W4284697414,"Non-avian reptiles, unlike mammals and birds, have undergone numerous sex determination changes. Casque-Headed Lizards have replaced the ancestral XY system shared across pleurodonts with a new pair of XY chromosomes. However, the evolutionary forces that triggered this transition have remained unclear. An interesting hypothesis suggests that species with intermediate states, with sex chromosomes but also thermal-induced sex reversal at specific incubation temperatures, could be more susceptible to sex determination turnovers. We contrasted genotypic data (presence/absence of the Y chromosome) against the histology of gonads of embryos from stages 35-37 incubated at various temperatures, including typical male-producing (26°C) and female-producing (32°C) temperatures. Our work apparently reports for the first time the histology of gonads, including morphological changes, from stages 35-37 of development in the family Corytophanidae. We also observed that all embryos developed hemipenes, suggesting sex-linked developmental heterochrony. We observed perfect concordance between genotype and phenotype at all temperatures. However, analysis of transcriptomic data from embryos incubated at 26°C and 32°C identified transcript variants of the chromatin modifiers JARID2 and KDM6B that have been linked to temperature-dependent sex determination in other reptiles. Our work tested the validity of a mixed sex determination system in the family Corytophanidae. We found that XY chromosomes are dominant; however, our work supports the hypothesis of a conserved transcriptional response to incubation temperatures across non-avian reptiles that could be a reminiscence of an ancestral sex determination system."
https://openalex.org/W4284699262,"The mygalomorph spiders of the family Atypidae are among the most archaic spiders. The genus Atypus Latreille, 1804 occurs in Eurasia and northern Africa, with a single enigmatic species, Atypus snetsingeri Sarno, 1973, known only from a small area in southeastern Pennsylvania in eastern USA. A close relationship to European species could be assumed based on geographic proximity, but A . snetsingeri more closely resembled Asian species. This study was undertaken to learn more about the genetics of A . snetsingeri , its habitat requirements and natural history. Molecular markers (CO1 sequences) were compared to available data for other atypids and showed that A . snetsingeri is identical with A . karschi Dönitz, 1887 native to East Asia. Natural history parameters in Pennsylvania were also similar in every respect to A . karschi in Japan, therefore, we propose that the spider is an introduced species and the specific epithet snetsingeri is relegated to a junior synonym of A . karschi . Cytogenetic analysis showed an X0 sex chromosome system (42 chromosomes in females, 41 in males) and we also detected nucleolus organizing regions and heterochromatin, the latter for the first time in the Atypoidea. In Pennsylvania the spider is found in a variety of habitats, from forests to suburban shrubbery, where the above-ground webs are usually attached vertically to trees, shrubs, or walls, although other webs are oriented horizontally near the ground. Prey include millipedes, snails, woodlice, carabid beetles and earthworms. Atypus karschi is the first known case of an introduced purse-web spider. It is rarely noticed but well-established within its range in southeastern Pennsylvania."
https://openalex.org/W4284703077,"Bombyx mori is an important economic insect, its economic value mainly reflected in the silk yield. The major functional genes affecting the silk yield of B. mori have not been determined yet. Bombyx mori vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13d (BmVps13d) has been identified, but its function is not reported. In this study, BmVps13d protein shared 30.84% and 34.35% identity with that of in Drosophila melanogaster and Homo. sapiens, respectively. The expressions of BmVps13d were significantly higher in the midgut and silk gland of JS (high silk yield) than in that of L10 (low silk yield). An insertion of 9 bp nucleotides and two deficiencies of adenine ribonucleotides in the putative promoter region of BmVps13d gene in L10 resulted in the decline of promoter activity was confirmed using dual luciferase assay. Finally, the functions of BmVps13d in B. mori were studied using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the mutation of BmVps13d resulted in a 24.7% decline in weight of larvae, as well as a 27.1% (female) decline and a 11.8% (male) decline in the silk yield. This study provides a foundation for studying the molecular mechanism of silk yield and breeding the silkworm with high silk yield."
https://openalex.org/W4284703160,"Background Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine has side effects such as hypotension, respiratory depression, vomiting, and shivering. The side effects are dose-dependent, therefore different approaches have been attempted to avoid spinal-induced complications including lowering the dose of local anesthetic and mixing it with additives like Neuraxial opioids. Objective To compare the Hemodynamic and analgesic effects of intrathecal fentanyl as an adjuvant with low and conventional doses of bupivacaine in patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Methodology An institutional-based prospective cohort study was conducted on 90 patients. Data was collected with chart review, intraoperative observation, and postoperatively patient interview. Data was entered into EPI INFO and transport to SPSS version 23 for analysis of variables using one-way ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis H rank test, and chi-square. Result Hypotension but not bradycardia, was significantly frequent in a conventional dose of bupivacaine alone (CB) group and a conventional dose of bupivacaine with fentanyl (CBF) groups than that of the lower dose of bupivacaine with fentanyl (LBF) groups. Duration of analgesia was significantly longer in LBF (248± 35.6 minutes) and in CBF groups (260.3±40.3 minutes) than in CB group (167.10 ± 31.45 minutes). Time for the first analgesic request was significantly later in LBF (304±47.8 minutes) and CBF (294.6±99.5 minutes) groups than that in CB group (177±25.88 minutes). Conclusion The Lower dose of bupivacaine is associated with less risk of hypotension and faster recovery. Adding fentanyl with the lower dose of bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia for cesarean section could provide comparable anesthesia with the lower risk of hypotension and longer postoperative analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W4284703230,"Patients with hyperleukocytic (HL) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are at higher risk of early death. Initial management of these patients is challenging, not fully codified and heterogenous. Retrospective studies showed that several symptomatic measures might decrease early death rate but long-term data are scarce. We aimed to analyze whether the therapeutic measures carried out urgently at diagnosis may influence the outcome among HL AML patients having achieved who survived inaugural complications.We retrospectively reviewed all medical charts from patients admitted to Saint-Louis Hospital between January, 1st 1997 and December, 31st 2018 with newly diagnosed AML and white blood cell (WBC) count above 50x109/L. Outcome measures were cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), treatment-related mortality (TRM) defined as relapse-free death, and overall survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models.A total of 184 patients with HL AML in complete remission (CR) were included in this study. At 2 years after CR. 62.5% of patients were alive, at 5 years, cumulated incidence of relapse was 55.8%. We found that every therapeutic measure, including life-sustaining therapies carried out in the initial phase of the disease, did not increase the relapse risk. The use of hydroxyurea for more than 4 days was associated with a higher risk of relapse. At the end of the study, 94 patients (51.1%) were still alive including 23 patients out of 44 aged less than 60 yo that were able to return to work.We show that the use of emergency measures including life sustaining therapies does not come at the expense of a higher risk of relapse or mortality, except in the case of prolonged use of hydroxyurea. Patients with HL AML should be able to benefit from all available techniques, regardless of their initial severity."
