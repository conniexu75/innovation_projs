https://openalex.org/W1979514172,"Development of the appropriate CD4+ T helper (TH) subset during an immune response is important for disease resolution. With the use of naïve, ovalbumin-specific alpha beta T cell receptor transgenic T cell, it was found that heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes induced TH1 development in vitro through macrophage production of interleukin-12 (IL-12). Moreover, inhibition of macrophage production of IL-12 may explain the ability of IL-10 to suppress TH1 development. Murine immune responses to L. monocytogenes in vivo are of the appropriate TH1 phenotype. Therefore, this regulatory pathway may have evolved to enable innate immune cells, through interactions with microbial pathogens, to direct development of specific immunity toward the appropriate TH phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2138576404,"HeLa cells in early S phase were encapsulated in agarose microbeads, permeabilized, and incubated with biotin-11-dUTP in a “physiological” buffer. Sites of DNA synthesis were then immunolabeled. As others have found, ∼ 150 focal sites of synthesis were visible in each nucleus by light microscopy; they also contained DNA polymerase α and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Electron microscopy of thick resinless sections from which ∼ 90% of the chromatin had been removed revealed a similar number of dense, morphologically discrete ovoid bodies strung along a nucleoskeleton. The ovoids remained morphologically and functionally intact despite the removal of most of the chromatin. After 2.5 min of incubation with biotin-11-dUTP, the incorporated analog was associated only with ovoids; after 5 min it began to spread into the adjacent chromatin, which became extensively labeled after 1 hr. This provides visual evidence for polymerization “factories” fixed to a skeleton, with replication occurring as the template moves through them."
https://openalex.org/W2060509660,"The reinforcing properties of cocaine are probably mediated by the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathways in the central nervous system, but not all of the dopamine receptor subtypes involved in cocaine's reinforcing actions have been clearly identified. Recently, the D-3 receptor has been cloned, and its distribution in the brain has been found to be relatively restricted to limbic projections of the midbrain dopamine system. The D-3-selective compounds 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OHDPAT) and quinpirole potently decreased cocaine self-administration in the rat at doses that were not by themselves reinforcing. Moreover, three dopamine receptor agonists had affinities for binding to the D-3 receptor that correlated highly with their relative potencies in decreasing cocaine self-administration. The D-3 receptor may be involved in the reinforcing effects of cocaine and may be a useful target for the development of new pharmacotherapies for cocaine abuse."

https://openalex.org/W2096859263,"Two Hoxb-4 (Hox-2.6) mutations were introduced into the mouse germline. The overt phenotype caused by one of the mutations was assayed on two different genetic backgrounds, an inbred 129SvEv and a hybrid 129SvEv-C57BL/6J. The allele hoxb-4' is a disruption of the first exon and causes two obvious skeletal changes: a partial homeotic transformation of the second cervical vertebra from axis to atlas and a defective morphogenesis of the sternum. Both phenotypes have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity when assayed in the hybrid genetic background, but the sternum defect is completely penetrant in the inbred background. The mutant allele hoxb-4s has a premature stop codon, introduced by the ""hit and run"" method in the second exon, that disrupts the third helix of the homeodomain. This allele also causes the partial homeotic transformation of axis to atlas, but it does not affect the sternum."
https://openalex.org/W2021489997,"Transgenic mice expressing chimeric prion protein (PrP) genes derived from Syrian hamster (SHa) and mouse (Mo) PrP genes were constructed. One SHa/MoPrP gene, designated MH2M PrP, contains five amino acid substitutions encoded by SHaPrP, while another construct, designated MHM2 PrP, has two substitutions. Transgenic (Tg) (MH2M PrP) mice were susceptible to both Syrian hamster and mouse prions, whereas three lines expressing MHM2 PrP were resistant to Syrian hamster prions. The brains of Tg(MH2M PrP) mice dying of scrapie contained chimeric PrPSc and prions with an artificial host range favoring propagation in mice that express the corresponding chimeric PrP and were also transmissible, at reduced efficiency, to nontransgenic mice and hamsters. Our findings provide genetic evidence for homophilic interactions between PrPSc in the inoculum and PrPc synthesized by the host."
https://openalex.org/W1977004097,"The mRNAs of six C. elegans genes are known to be trans-spliced to SL2. We report here that a similarly oriented gene is located 100-300 bp upstream of each. We present evidence that the genes in these clusters are cotranscribed and downstream mRNAs are formed by cleavage at the polyadenylation site and trans-splicing. From one three-gene cluster we isolated cDNA clones representing both polycistronic RNAs and mRNAs polyadenylated at the free 3' end created by trans-splicing, suggesting that polycistronic RNAs can be processed by trans-splicing. Several experiments indicate that SL2 trans-splicing is a consequence of a gene's downstream location in an operon. In particular, when an SL1-accepting gene was moved to a downstream location, its mRNA was trans-spliced largely to SL2. The possible regulatory significance of cotranscription of C. elegans genes is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1971150396,"Thymocyte commitment to the CD4 helper versus CD8 cytotoxic lineage has not been satisfactorily established. Two models have been elaborated: one based on instruction, the other on selection. Most previous results support the instructive model, but our comparison of thymocyte differentiation in MHC class II-, class I- and double-deficient mice provides data challenging it. There exists a significant population of CD4 single positive cells in class II-deficient animals that is intermediate in maturity between CD4+CD8+ and end-stage CD4+CD8- thymocytes and is selected on class I molecules; an equivalent CD8+CD4- population occurs in class I-deficient animals. We propose a selective model entailing two TCR-MHC molecule engagements: the first provokes random down-modulation of either CD4 or CD8 and a degree of differentiation; the second, requiring participation of the appropriate coreceptor, permits end-stage differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2003523284,"ALTHOUGH anatomical and neurochemical studies suggest that endogenous opioids act as neurotransmitters1–7, their roles in normal and pathophysiological regulation of synaptic transmission are not defined. Here we examine the actions of prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides in the guinea-pig hippocampus and show that physiological stimulation of the dynorphin-containing dentate granule cells can release endogenous dynorphins, which then activate κ1 opioid receptors present in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Activation of κ1 receptors by either pharmacologically applied agonist or endogenously released peptide reduces excitatory transmission in the dentate gyrus, as shown by a reduction in the excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by stimulation of the perforant path, a principal excitatory afferent. In addition, released dynorphin peptides were found to block the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the granule cell-perforant path synapse. The results indicate that endogenous dynorphins function in this hippocampal circuit as retrograde, inhibitory neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2045332245,"Cardiac hypertrophy in response to systolic pressure loading frequently results in contractile dysfunction of unknown cause. In the present study, pressure loading increased the microtubule component of the cardiac muscle cell cytoskeleton, which was responsible for the cellular contractile dysfunction observed. The linked microtubule and contractile abnormalities were persistent and thus may have significance for the deterioration of initially compensatory cardiac hypertrophy into congestive heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2064336505,"Thymocytes that coexpress the CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins differentiate into mature CD4+ helper or CD8+ cytotoxic cells depending on whether their antigen receptors are specific for MHC class II or class I molecules, respectively. The mechanism of this decision process was investigated in mice whose T cell development was biased toward the class II-specific lineage. We found that constitutive expression of CD4 allows a developmentally arrested population of thymocytes that have mismatched class II-specific TCRs and the CD8 coreceptor to be rescued and to acquire a cytotoxic phenotype. This result is consistent with a two-step process of thymocyte maturation, in which there is stochastic down-regulation of either CD4 or CD8 and subsequent selection based on the ability of the TCR and remaining coreceptor to engage the same MHC molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2038327233,"Many different types of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels inactivate when intracellular ATP declines or intracellular Ca2+ rises. An inside-out, patch-clamp technique was applied to the Ca2+ channels of Lymnaea neurons to determine the mechanism(s) underlying these two phenomena. Although no evidence was found for a phosphorylation mechanism, agents that act on the cytoskeleton were found to alter Ca2+ channel activity. The cytoskeletal disrupters colchicine and cytochalasin B were found to speed Ca2+ channel decline in ATP, whereas the cytoskeletal stabilizers taxol and phalloidin were found to prolong Ca2+ channel activity without ATP. In addition, cytoskeletal stabilizers reduced Ca(2+)-dependent channel inactivation, suggesting that both channel metabolic dependence and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation result from a cytoskeletal interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2047460038,"CD4+ helper T cells mediate resistance to tuberculosis, presumably by enhancing the antimicrobial activity of macrophages within which the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism grows. A first step in resistance should be the presentation of mycobacterial antigens by macrophages to CD4+ T cells. However, when the antigenic stimulus is limited to organisms growing in human monocytes, the organisms become sequestered from immune CD4+ T cells. This block in presentation is selective for growing mycobacteria and not for other stimuli. Sequestration would allow replicating organisms to persist in infected individuals and may contribute to virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1591356314,"P-glycoprotein can mediate multidrug resistance in tumor cells and is hypothesized to be an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. The protein is composed of two cassettes; each cassette contains six transmembrane domains followed by a nucleotide binding fold. The [125I]iodoaryl azidoprazosin photoaffinity drug binding sites in P-glycoprotein have been mapped by immunological analysis. After complete digestion of P-glycoprotein with trypsin, two major photolabeled fragments have been mapped. The 5- and 4-kDa fragments are located within, or immediately C-terminal to, the last transmembrane domain of each cassette: transmembranes 6 and 12 of P-glycoprotein, respectively. The 4-kDa fragment maximally extends up to, but not including, the Walker A motif of the second nucleotide binding fold, whereas the 5-kDa fragment maximally extends a few residues beyond the Walker A motif of the first nucleotide binding fold. A minor photolabeling domain is also found between transmembrane domain 4 and up to, but not including, transmembrane domain 6. These data suggest that a portion of the drug binding site in P-glycoprotein is in close proximity to ATP binding regions. Furthermore, symmetrical regions in each cassette of P-glycoprotein are likely to participate in drug efflux."
https://openalex.org/W1514587909,"Deletion of the vaccinia virus K3L gene, a homologue of the alpha subunit of protein synthesis initiation factor 2, has been reported to reduce the ability of the virus to grow in interferon-treated cells (Beattie, E., Tattaglia, J., and Paoletti, E. (1991) Virology 183, 419-422). Purified recombinant K3L gene product, pK3r, has potent effects on activation of double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent, initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF-2 alpha)-specific protein kinase (PKR) in in vitro reactions. Recombinant pK3 prevents the inhibition of protein synthesis by dsRNA in a cell-free translation system from rabbit reticulocytes at levels equal to, or lower than, the level of endogenous eIF-2 alpha. In the cell-free translation system, pK3r exerts its effects at all dsRNA concentrations tested, by preventing phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. In addition, pK3r reduces the autophosphorylation of immunopurified PKR, as well as its ability to phosphorylate the alpha subunit of purified eIF-2. At 400 mM NaCl, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-radiolabeled pK3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with human PKR, using a monoclonal antibody to PKR. This tight binding is consistent with a role for pK3 as a pseudosubstrate for the kinase, and identifies the amino-terminal 30% of eIF-2 alpha as the domain recognized by the eIF-2 alpha-specific protein kinases. In addition, the tight binding opens up the possibility of using binding assays to identify functional domains within the kinase and pK3. Recombinant pK3 also prevents activation of the heme-sensitive eIF-2 alpha-specific protein kinase, eIF-2 alpha-PKh, in both cell-free translation systems as well as in partially purified preparations. This suggests some similarity between the eIF-2 alpha binding domains of the two eIF-2 alpha specific protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1685356864,"A highly conserved position of negatively charged amino acids is present in the SS2 segments of the S5-S6 linker regions among calcium channels. We report here that replacing Glu residues at this position alters the ion selectivity of the human cardiac calcium channel. Substituting Glu334 in motif I or Glu1086 in motif III with Lys produced mutant calcium channels that permeated sodium ions 10-fold more effectively than barium ions. More conservative changes such as substitution of Glu1086 with Gln or substitution of Glu1387 with Ala also increased sodium permeation through the mutant calcium channels. Sodium currents through the mutant calcium channels could be modulated by dihydropyridines and blocked by external divalent cations. These results suggest that Glu334, Glu1086, and Glu1387 are part of a ring of glutamate residues formed in the pore-lining SS1-SS2 region and are critical in determining ion selectively and permeability of a human cardiac calcium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1557265671,"The three isozymes of isocitrate dehydrogenase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae differ in subunit structure, subcellular location, and cofactor specificity. The two mitochondrial isozymes, IDH and IDP1, are NAD- and NADP-specific, respectively. Several lines of evidence presented here confirm the importance of IDH to respiratory processes. Expression of IDH RNA and protein is low with growth on glucose and is elevated with growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, a pattern of expression similar to that seen for other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. In addition, a disruption mutant lacking IDH activity exhibits reduced growth rates on non-fermentable carbon sources, and mitochondria isolated from this mutant are incapable of respiration with added citrate. In contrast, IDP1 expression levels appear to be unresponsive to carbon source, and an IDP1 disruption mutant is not significantly impaired for growth or mitochondrial respiration. These results strongly suggest that IDP1 is incapable of participating in tricarboxylic acid cycle-based respiration despite its mitochondrial location. Analysis of the IDP1 and IDH disruption mutants for glutamate auxotrophy showed that either enzyme can contribute alpha-ketoglutarate for endogenous glutamate synthesis. IDH expression levels were found to be repressed in response to added glutamate during growth on glucose, while IDP1 expression levels remained unchanged. A double mutant lacking both IDP1 and IDH activities proved to be auxotrophic for glutamate during growth on glucose, but was capable of growth independent of added glutamate on non-fermentable carbon sources. These results suggest that the cytosolic NADP-specific IDP2 isozyme may provide alpha-ketoglutarate both for tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon flux and for cytosolic glutamate synthesis during growth on non-fermentable carbon sources in the absence of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1544352682,"The interaction of the SRIF receptor subtype SSTR2 with pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins was investigated using an immunoprecipitation approach employing peptide-directed antisera against Gi alpha and G(o) alpha. Antisera directed against either the COOH terminus of Gi alpha or Go alpha uncoupled SSTR2-G protein complexes from CHO cells stably expressing the cloned receptor indicating that both G proteins form complexes with SSTR2. Chinese hamster ovary cells primarily express Gi alpha 3 and G(o) alpha 2 immunoreactivity, with much lower levels of the other pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Antiserum against Gi alpha 3 uncoupled SSTR2/G protein complexes to a similar extent as Gi alpha common antiserum while antisera against Gi alpha 1 and Gi alpha 2 did not. These findings indicate that SSTR2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells predominantly associates with Gi alpha 3 and G(o) alpha 2. In HEK 293 cells which endogenously express low densities of SSTR2 and similar levels of Gi alpha 1 and Gi alpha 3 immunoreactivity but no G(o) alpha, only antiserum directed against Gi alpha 3 immunoprecipitated SSTR2-G protein complexes, indicating that in these cells SSTR2 primarily associates with Gi alpha 3. SRIF can not inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in wild-type HEK 293 cells nor in HEK 293 cells transfected with SSTR2. In contrast, SRIF can inhibit cAMP formation in HEK 293 cells expressing the cloned SRIF receptor SSTR3, which requires the presence of Gi alpha 1 to functionally couple to adenylyl cyclase. The lack of efficient association of SSTR2 with Gi alpha 1 may be the cause of its inability to mediate inhibition of cAMP formation. Differences in the G protein-coupling domains of the cloned SRIF receptors may be responsible for their differences in G protein association and ability to effect various signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1768532341,"The use of recombinant human tropoelastin (rTE) and selected variants thereof as substrates for the assay of lysyl oxidase activity in vitro was explored. The possibility was also assessed that an insoluble elastin-like product could be generated from this elastin precursor in the absence of other macromolecules found associated with elastin in vivo. rTE was more efficiently oxidized by lysyl oxidase than the insoluble chick aorta elastin substrate conventionally used. Anionic amphiphilic elastin ligands strongly inhibited rTE oxidation consistent with the importance of electrostatic enzyme-substrate interactions previously noted with the insoluble elastin substrate. An rTE variant, rTE delta 26A, lacking the hydrophilic sequence coded by exon 26A, was a less effective substrate than rTE, largely due to an increase in Km, while the kinetic parameters for the oxidation of rTE delta 36, lacking the C-terminal polybasic sequence coded by exon 36, were quite similar to those for rTE. Incubation of rTE delta 26A with lysyl oxidase not only resulted in the generation of peptidyl alpha-aminoadipic-delta-semialdehyde and lysine-derived cross-linkages, but also yielded a product insoluble in hot 0.1 N NaOH, consistent with the properties of insoluble elastin. Thus, oxidation, cross-linking and insolubilization of elastin substrates by lysyl oxidase can occur in the absence of other macromolecules implicated as being involved in this process in vivo, although such macromolecules may be essential to obtain the proper alignment between tropoelastin units for specifically placed cross-linkages and optimally functional elastic fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1535298549,"In the pancreatic acinar cell, hormonal stimulation causes a rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration by activating the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Berridge, M. J., and Irvine, R. F. (1989) Nature 341, 197-205). The released Ca2+ is, for the most part, extruded from the cell, necessitating a mechanism for Ca2+ entry and reloading of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Putney, J. W., Jr. (1990) Cell Calcium 11, 611-624; Rink, T. J. (1990) FEBS Lett. 268, 381-385). However, neither the mechanism of depletion-activated Ca2+ entry nor the signal that activates it is known. We report here that a sustained inward current of depletion-activated Ca2+ entry can be measured in pancreatic acinar cells using patch-clamp recording methods. Furthermore, the current can be blocked by an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, can be reactivated by 8-bromo-cGMP after inhibition, and can be activated in the absence of Ca2+ depletion by perfusing the cell with cGMP, but not cAMP. Intracellular perfusion with 1,3,4,5-inositol tetrakisphosphate did not activate an inward current, whereas perfusion with 2,4,5-inositol trisphosphate did activate an inward current. We conclude that cGMP may be an intracellular messenger that regulates depletion-activated Ca2+ entry."
https://openalex.org/W1525625647,"The Bacillus subtilis multidrug transporter Bmr effluxes structurally diverse toxic compounds out of bacterial cells. Antihypertensive alkaloid reserpine reverses Bmr-mediated multidrug resistance by inhibiting drug transport. We have obtained a mutant of the bmr gene that provides a normal level of multidrug resistance, which can, however, only be reversed by very high concentrations of reserpine. Reduction of Bmr sensitivity to reserpine has been caused by the substitution of Leu for Val286 in the Bmr molecule. This mutation also led to a dramatic decrease of [3H]reserpine binding to membrane vesicles prepared from the Bmr-overexpressing bacteria. Leucine is larger than valine by one methylene group. Substitution of Val286 with a smaller residue, glycine, had an opposite effect. It led to increased sensitivity of Bmr to reserpine and increased affinity of reserpine binding to the membranes prepared from Bmr-overexpressing bacteria. Neither of the mutations significantly changed the sensitivity of Bmr to rescinnamine, a structural analog of reserpine. The results suggest that Val286 is involved in the formation of the reserpine-binding site of the Bmr molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1502844529,"In an attempt to further assess the role of S-fimbriae in the pathogenesis of Escherichia coli meningitis, the adherence of E. coli strains with or without S-fimbriae were examined for this study to purified glycolipids using thin layer chromatography overlay assays. Only S-fimbriated E. coli strains bound to sulfatide, seminolipid, galactosyl ceramide, and lactosyl ceramide but not to gangliosides including sialyl neolacto-series and other neutral glycolipids. The binding of S-fimbriated E. coli to sulfatide was temperature dependent (i.e. maximal at 37 degrees C) and inhibited by S-fimbriae, anti-S-fimbriae, and anti-S-adhesin antibodies as well as by sulfatide, galactosyl ceramide, and lactosyl ceramide. E. coli transformants which lack the sfaA gene from the Sfa gene cluster showed no binding to the glycolipids, while other transformants lacking the adhesin gene sfaS or sfaG or H and mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis in the sfaS gene exhibited a similar binding to the glycolipids compared to the parent S-fimbriated strain. A large amount of sulfated glycolipids was demonstrated on brain endothelial cells and the binding of S-fimbriated E. coli to brain endothelial cells was inhibited by these glycolipids. These findings suggest that the binding of S-fimbriated E. coli to brain endothelial cells occurs in part via glycolipids containing terminal Gal(3SO4)beta-1 residues and in part by S-fimbriae protein SfaA. S-adhesin was not involved in the binding of S-fimbriae to these glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1589243674,"The linked equilibria involved in the binding of phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11, ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase) to tubulin and microtubules were studied at high ionic strength in vitro. The concentration-dependent dissociation of phosphofructokinase was analyzed in the absence and presence of tubulin or microtubules, and the binding of kinase to the tubulin dimer and microtubules was compared. Enzyme activity of phosphofructokinase was inhibited by both tubulin and microtubules: the relative inhibition increased with decreasing enzyme concentration. The complex formation between phosphofructokinase and tubulin was demonstrated by means of fluorescent anisotropy. Concentration-dependent copelleting of the kinase with taxol-stabilized microtubules revealed binding of the enzyme to microtubules as well as phosphofructokinase-enhanced pelleting of microtubules. The binding data agree with the enzyme kinetic findings that the inactive dissociated forms of phosphofructokinase (monomer-dimer) are involved in the heterologous complex formation. Microtubule reorganization (bundle formation) by phosphofructokinase was established by turbidity measurements and sedimentation experiments. The binding data are consistent with a simple molecular model for the interactions in phosphofructokinase-tubulin/microtubules systems."
https://openalex.org/W2092380488,"Norepinephrine (NE) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibit N -type calcium channels in embryonic chick sensory neurons. We demonstrate here that the modulatory actions of the two transmitters are mediated through distinct biochemical pathways. Intracellular application of the pseudosubstrate inhibitor for protein kinase C blocks the inhibition produced by NE (and the protein kinase C activator oleoylacetylglycerol), but not that produced by GABA. Calcium current inhibition produced by oleoylacetylglycerol occludes inhibition by subsequent application of NE; GABA-mediated inhibition, however, is not eliminated by prior activation of protein kinase C. These results demonstrate that multiple biochemical pathways converge to control N-type calcium channel function."
https://openalex.org/W1587132435,"The functional interaction of simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T antigen) with DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha)-primase complex, human single-stranded DNA binding protein (HSSB), and DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) holoenzyme, which includes pol delta, activator I (also called replication factor C), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, at the replication fork was examined using the purified components that support SV40 DNA replication. Dilution of reaction mixtures during RNA primer synthesis revealed that T antigen remained associated continuously with the fork, while the pol alpha-primase complex dissociated from the complex during oligoribonucleotide synthesis. T antigen unwound duplex DNA from the SV40 core origin at a rate of 200 base pairs/min. Pol alpha-primase complex inhibited the rate of the unwinding reaction, and HSSB, pol alpha, and primase were all required for this effect. These requirements are the same as those essential for DNA primase-catalyzed oligoribonucleotide synthesis (Matsumoto, T., Eki, T., and Hurwitz, J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 9712-9716). This result suggests that the pol alpha-primase complex interacts with T antigen and HSSB during the unwinding reaction to synthesize RNA primers and that the interaction decreases the rate of T antigen movement. While pol delta holoenzyme can elongate primed DNA chains at a rate of 400-600 nucleotides/min on singly primed phi X174 DNA, the rate of the leading strand synthesis catalyzed by pol delta holoenzyme in the SV40 replication system in vitro was about 200 nucleotides/min. This rate was similar to the unwinding rate catalyzed by T antigen. Thus, the rate of leading strand synthesis catalyzed by pol delta holoenzyme in vitro appears to be limited by the unwinding reaction catalyzed by T antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1569212329,"Phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) is a spin trap commonly employed in free radical research. PBN has been shown to have adverse and beneficial effects on various biological systems. We report here evidence that photolysis (or even ambient light) decomposes PBN to nitric oxide in aqueous solutions. Non-heme and heme proteins have been employed to form nitrosyl complexes, which were detected using EPR spectroscopy. Concomitantly, nitrite formation was detected after light-induced decomposition of PBN. In addition, we found that tert-nitrosobutane and decomposed PBN caused an activation of guanylate cyclase. We propose a mechanism where PBN is decomposed by light to tert-nitrosobutane. The latter compound is, in turn, decomposed to nitric oxide. This study suggests the possibility that PBN or PBN radical adducts may be sources of nitric oxide in biological environments. When using PBN as a spin trap in biological samples, not only is the trapping of reactive free radicals operative, but nitric oxide produced from PBN decomposition may play an important role in altering biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1972997375,"Nerve-muscle cocultures were used to study the relationship between neuronal Ca2+ level and the earliest nerve-muscle interaction. Xenopus spinal cord neurons were loaded with Ca2+ indicators and monitored by digital video microscopy as a myoball was manipulated into contact with it.

Fifty percent of the pairs showing Ca2+ elevation were also positive for neurotransmission. This Ca2+ rise was suppressed by lifting away the myoball, by Ca2+-free solution, or by suramin, a polyanionic compound that interferes with cell surface receptors. This suppression was accompanied by a reduction in transmitter release. The specificity of the nerve-muscle contact-induced Ca2+ rise was shown by its absence upon neuron-neuron contact. Naturally formed nerve-muscle contacts also showed an elevation in presynaptic Ca2+ level. Thus, this elevation appears to be a physiological step in the early stage of synaptogenesis and is likely mediated by muscle-derived molecules.

https://openalex.org/W1518270672,"We have reported recently that colchicine and other microtubule-disrupting agents stimulated interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta synthesis in human monocytes. In this study we found that unexpectedly colchicine failed to stimulate the expression of two other potent immune mediators, namely tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Remarkably, taxol which induces stable microtubule bundles, antagonized the colchicine but not the LPS-induced IL-1 synthesis. These results suggested that the colchicine-mediated IL-1 induction was generated by microtubule disassembly. We next demonstrated that microtubule disruption triggered an elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP and a subsequent stimulation of protein kinase A. The use of different protein kinase inhibitors supported a role of the PKA, but not the PKC, in the colchicine-induced IL-1 production. Furthermore, elevation of intracellular cAMP levels by 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, or cholera toxin potentiated the effect of suboptimal concentration of colchicine on IL-1 synthesis. However, these agents alone were unable to induce IL-1 synthesis. Therefore, our data indicate that the cAMP/protein kinase A-signaling pathway is necessary but not sufficient to generate IL-1 synthesis by microtubule disruption. Thus, microtubule-disrupting drugs appear as useful tools to further characterize the molecular events which regulate IL-1 production in human monocytes."

The purified enzyme converted gp160 to gp120 and gp41, showing a pH optimum of 6.5-7.0. Direct amino acid sequencing of the amino terminus of the product gp41 revealed that the cleavage site of gp160 was between Arg511 and Ala512. The enzyme activity was inhibited by trypsin-type protease inhibitors, but was not affected by CaCl2, MgCl2 or chelating agents. The properties of the purified enzyme are clearly distinct from those of processing proteases reported previously. Although the significance of the enzyme in vivo is not currently certain, judging from its cleavage specificity and subcellular localization, this endopeptidase appears to be a processing enzyme for the human immunodeficiency virus type I gp160 precursor protein in human T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2082431284,"Protocols that induce long-term potentiation (LTP) typically involve afferent stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that LTP induction does not require presynaptic activity. The significance of this hypothesis is underscored by results suggesting that LTP expression may involve activity-dependent presynaptic changes. An induction protocol using glutamate iontophoresis was developed that reliably induced LTP in hippocampal slices without afferent stimulation. Iontophoresis LTP was Ca2+ dependent, was blocked by ME-801, and occluded tetanus-induced LTP. Iontophoresis LTP was induced when excitatory postsynaptic potentials were completely blocked by adenosine plus tetrodotoxin. Our results suggest constraints on the involvement of presynaptic mechanisms and putative retrograde messengers in LTP induction and expression; namely, these processes must function without many forms of activity-dependent presynaptic processes.

https://openalex.org/W2036717175,"The modulation of high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents by l-glutamate and its agonists was investigated in cultured rat hypothalamic neurons. l-Glutamate and agonists selective for NMDA or non-NMDA receptors reversibly inhibited HVA Ca2+ currents. The putative presynaptic glutamate receptor agonist l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid and the selective metabotropic agonist trans-ACPD were ineffective. Inhibition was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and blocked by internal perfusion of the cells with BAPTA. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and calmida-zolium completely prevented the inhibition. Increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration due to Ca2+ influx through non-NMDA receptor channels were visualized using fura-2. These results indicate that not only NMDA but also non-NM DA receptor channels in these neurons are permeable for Ca2+ and that Ca2+ influx through these channels activates a calmodulin-dependent mechanism, which leads to HVA Ca2+ current inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W1494624912,"A polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis band-mobility shift assay was developed to study the binding of synthetic oligonucleotides by DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). As measured by this assay, neither calf thymus pol delta core enzyme nor PCNA alone bind DNA stably. However, mammalian PCNA but not Drosophila PCNA promotes the formation of a distinct pol delta.PCNA.template-primer complex. Appearance of this complex is primer-dependent but does not require Mg2+. Complex stability is also influenced by the presence or absence of individual dNTPs. A model for the ordered sequential interaction of pol delta, PCNA, and DNA template-primers is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1666241486,"The propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF) was found to serve as a substrate for Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa). FXIIIa catalyzed polymerization of pp-vWF as well as the incorporation of monodansylcadaverine and [14C]putrescine into pp-vWF in a Ca(2+)- and time-dependent manner. The amount of putrescine incorporated into pp-vWF was increased as a function of putrescine concentration and reached a maximum of 3 mol/mol of pp-vWF, indicating that there are at least 3 glutamine residues in the pp-vWF molecule responsible for the reaction. 125I-pp-vWF was incubated with FXIIIa in the presence of various adhesive glycoproteins. Laminin, among the proteins tested, specifically formed a large molecular weight complex with 125I-pp-vWF in a Ca(2+)- and time-dependent manner. It was also found that FXIIIa catalyzed polymerization of laminin as well as the incorporation of monodansylca-daverine into laminin. The high molecular weight complexes of 125I-pp-vWF (or 125I-laminin) formed in the presence of laminin (or pp-vWF) were immunoprecipitated with anti-laminin (or anti-pp-vWF) antibodies. Taking all the data together it can be concluded that both pp-vWF and laminin have glutamine and lysine residues responsive to FXIIIa and make copolymers by virtue of FXIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1606892232,"Sequence information was obtained from low picomole amounts of nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA) 160 (M(r) 160,000), a granulocyte membrane glycoprotein. Following affinity purification and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protein was electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, digested with trypsin, and the peptides were isolated using capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Analysis of these peptides by Edman microsequencing and mass spectrometry established that NCA-160 was identical to biliary glycoprotein I, a protein that we previously cloned from a human colon library (1). NCA-160 from human granulocytes is a CD15-positive glycoprotein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen family and possesses putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Previous efforts to characterize this antigen at the protein level were hampered by a blocked NH2 terminus. In this study, we confirmed 20% of the deduced amino acid sequence starting with approximately 50 pmol of sample. Carbohydrate structural data is also presented on a single N-linked oligosaccharide moiety located in the A' domain. The capillary high performance liquid chromatography techniques used here, as well as mass spectrometry, were essential for high sensitivity analysis of the blotted, digested glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1492552744,"In this study, we investigated the biochemical basis for the induction of sialomucin production in HT-29 LMM human colon carcinoma cells. Previous studies showed that conditioned medium from organ cultures of normal human colonic connective tissues (NCCM) stimulated the biosynthesis of high molecular weight sialoglycoproteins (M(r) 740,000 and 450,000) by colon carcinoma cells in vitro. Using monoclonal antibodies specific for human milk mucin, we determined that the polypeptide core of these sialomucins was the polymorphic epithelial mucin core peptide coded by the MUC1 gene. Northern analysis showed that cells treated with NCCM expressed a higher level of MUC1 poly(A)+ mRNA than untreated cells. The UDP-GalNAC: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity in microsomal fractions from these cells did not change upon NCCM treatment. The ratios of oligosaccharides with various negative charges secreted by HT-29 LMM cells in the presence of benzyl-alpha-D-N-acetylgalactosaminide were not affected by NCCM treatment indicating that the degree of sialylation of O-linked carbohydrate chains is not influenced by NCCM treatment. [3H]Glucosamine pulse-chase labeling studies using antibodies specific for a COOH-terminal unglycosylated region of the MUC1 mucin core peptides suggested that NCCM treatment of HT-29 LMM cells did not change the rate of MUC1-related sialomucin processing."
https://openalex.org/W1556771462,"A major mechanism of regulation of mammalian protein synthesis initiation is accomplished by the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2. This modification inhibits the activity of another initiation factor, guanine nucleotide exchange factor, preventing conversion of eIF-2.GDP to eIF-2.GTP and hence binding of initiator tRNA and formation of ternary complex (eIF-2.GTP.Met-tRNAf). Inhibition of protein synthesis and phosphorylation of eIF-2 occurs in Ehrlich cells when they are amino acid- or serum-deprived or heat-shocked as well as in other nucleated cells under similar conditions. This paper describes the purification of two eIF-2 alpha kinases from Ehrlich cells. Unlike the two well characterized eIF-2 alpha kinases, HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor from reticulocytes) and P68 (double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase found in interferon-treated cells), the Ehrlich cell kinases do not appear to autophosphorylate. The two kinases chromatograph differently on DEAE-cellulose and Mono Q. Furthermore, their Michaelis constants (Km values) for ATP are different. Both kinases can inhibit purified guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) from stimulating ternary complex formation. However, only one kinase inhibits reticulocyte lysate cell free protein synthesis. The other kinase co-purifies with a factor that suppresses inhibition of protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates by eIF-2 alpha kinases. This suppressing activity is probably guanine nucleotide exchange factor."
https://openalex.org/W1575711528,"6-Hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase, an enzyme with FAD covalently attached to the protein, contains 6 cysteine residues in positions 45 (Cys1), 59 (Cys2), 136 (Cys3), 173 (Cys4), 260 (Cys5) and 433 (Cys6). Cys2, 3, 5, and 6 were replaced with serine by site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of these exchanges on enzyme activity, the autocatalytic incorporation of the cofactor, and the interaction of the mutant proteins with molecular chaperones were analyzed. The flavinylation of 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase is dependent on the presence of allosteric effectors, e.g. glycerol 3-phosphate or other phosphorylated tricarbon compounds. Replacement of Cys2 or Cys5 abolished this dependence. Covalent incorporation of FAD was reduced to an undetectable level in the Cys3 and Cys5 mutants. Replacement of Cys6 by Ser had no significant effect on enzyme activity and cofactor attachment. Deletion of two amino acids, Phe and Arg, situated 12 and 11 amino acid residues, respectively, from the carboxyl terminus of the protein, resulted in an inactive enzyme with no covalently bound FAD. This result indicates that almost the entire protein chain has to be synthesized before the cofactor can be incorporated, making a cotranslational flavinylation step rather unlikely. The distribution of the 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase polypeptide between the high molecular weight complexes and the free soluble form was analyzed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The wild-type holoenzyme as well as the wild-type apoenzyme were recovered in the eluent fraction of the column while the mutant proteins were retained in high molecular weight complexes, predominantly in those associated with GroEL, as revealed by immunoprecipitation. The extent of complex formation with this molecular chaperone depended on the position of the mutated Cys residue within the protein. Complex formation was highest with protein from the mutants Cys2 and Cys3, less with the Cys5, and absent with the Cys6 mutant protein. Thus, alterations in the amino-terminal part of the 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase appear more important for the interaction with molecular chaperones than alterations situated in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1533736100,"trans-2-Phenylcyclopropylamine hydrochloride (tranylcypromine; TCP) was found to be both an inhibitor and a substrate of lysyl oxidase, the enzyme which oxidizes peptidyl lysine in elastin and collagen to initiate cross-linking in these proteins. The reaction of TCP with this enzyme was further characterized in view of the potential interference that chronic administration of this antidepressant compound may exert on the development and repair of connective tissues. In contrast to the irreversible and/or competitive inhibitors of lysyl oxidase previously described, TCP noncompetitively and reversibly inhibited the oxidation of both alkylamine and elastin substrates with Ki values of 386 and 375 microM, respectively. The noncompetitive mode of interaction affected the accessibility of the active site to productive amine substrates since the reductive trapping of n-hexylamine to lysyl oxidase was largely prevented by the presence of TCP. It was of additional interest that lysyl oxidase catalyzed a limited degree of conversion of TCP to cinnamaldehyde accompanied by the production of hydrogen peroxide. The lack of significant incorporation of protein-bound tritium accompanying reduction of the enzyme-TCP complex with [3H]NaBH4 argued against the formation of a Schiff base between the enzyme and the cinnamaldehyde product as the basis of the inhibitory effect. Spectral evidence was also obtained for an additional interaction between TCP and lysyl oxidase that was independent of the inhibitory effect of TCP. Cyclopropylamine, lacking the benzene moiety of TCP, inhibited lysyl oxidase irreversibly and competitively, and was not a substrate, pointing toward a defining role for the benzene moiety in the interaction of TCP with lysyl oxidase."
