https://openalex.org/W2008791719,"The etiological agent of AIDS, LAV/HTLV-III, is common in Central Africa but is not endemic in other areas of that continent. A novel human retrovirus, distinct from LAV/HTLV-III, has now been isolated from two AIDS patients from West Africa. Partial characterization of this virus revealed that it has biological and morphological properties very similar to LAV but that it differs in some of its antigenic components. Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, the West African AIDS retrovirus and LAV differ substantially in their envelope glycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognized by serum from a macaque with simian AIDS infected by the simian retrovirus termed STLV-IIImac, suggesting that the West African AIDS virus may be more closely related to this simian virus than to LAV. Hybridization experiments with LAV subgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to as LAV-II, is distantly related to LAV and distinct from STLV-IIImac."
https://openalex.org/W1984648137,"Basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (FGF's) are potent mitogens for capillary endothelial cells in vitro, stimulate angiogenesis in vivo, and may participate in tissue repair. An oligonucleotide probe for bovine basic FGF was designed from the nucleotide sequence of the amino-terminal exon of bovine acidic FGF, taking into account the 55 percent amino acid sequence homology between the two factors. With this oligonucleotide probe, a full length complementary DNA for basic FGF was isolated from bovine pituitary. Basic FGF in bovine hypothalamus was shown to be encoded by a single 5.0-kilobase messenger RNA; in a human hepatoma cell line, both 4.6- and 2.2-kilobase basic FGF messenger RNA's were present. Both growth factors seem to be synthesized with short amino-terminal extensions that are not found on the isolated forms for which the amino acid sequences have been determined. Neither basic nor acidic FGF has a classic signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2040096357,The gene that is abnormal in the X-linked form of the phagocytic disorder chronic granulomatous disease has been cloned without reference to a specific protein by relying on its chromosomal map position. The transcript of the gene is expressed in the phagocytic lineage of haematopoietic cells and is absent or structurally abnormal in four patients with the disorder. The nucleotide sequence of complementary DNA clones predicts a polypeptide of at least 468 amino acids with no homology to proteins described previously.
https://openalex.org/W1633066991,"We examined the effect of brefeldin A, an antiviral antibiotic, on protein synthesis, intracellular processing, and secretion in primary culture of rat hepatocytes. The secretion was strongly blocked by the drug at 1 microgram/ml and higher concentrations, while the protein synthesis was maintained fairly well. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine demonstrated that brefeldin A completely blocked the proteolytic conversion of proalbumin to serum albumin up to 60 min of chase, although its conversion was observed as early as 20 min in the control cells. The drug also inhibited the terminal glycosylation of oligosaccharide chains of alpha 1-protease inhibitor and haptoglobin. These two modifications have been shown to occur at the trans region of the Golgi complex. The drug, however, had no effect on the proteolytic processing of the haptoglobin proform which takes place within the endoplasmic reticulum. Such an effect by brefeldin A is very similar with that induced by the carboxylic ionophore monensin. However, in contrast to evidence that monensin causes a delayed secretion of the unprocessed forms of these proteins, brefeldin A allowed the completely processed forms to be secreted after a prolonged accumulation of the unprocessed forms. Morphological observations demonstrated that the endoplasmic reticulum was markedly dilated by treatment with the drug at 10 micrograms/ml which continuously blocked the secretion. On the other hand, brefeldin A caused no inhibitory effect on the endocytic pathway as judged by cellular uptake and degradation of 125I-asialofetuin. These results indicate that brefeldin A is a unique agent which primarily impedes protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex by a mechanism different from those considered for other secretion-blocking agents so far reported."

Single-channel recordings from human airway epithelial cells showed that beta-adrenergic stimulation evoked apical membrane chloride channel activity, but this response was absent in cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, when membrane patches were excised from CF cells into media containing sufficient free calcium (approximately 180 nanomolar), chloride channels were activated. The chloride channels of CF cells were similar to those of normal cells as judged by their current-voltage relations, ion selectivity, and kinetic behavior. These findings demonstrate the presence of chloride channels in the apical membranes of CF airway cells. Their regulation by calcium appears to be intact, but cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent control of their activity is defective."

https://openalex.org/W1969746584,"The ninth component of complement (C9) and the pore-forming protein (PFP or perforin) from cytotoxic T lymphocytes polymerize to tubular lesions having an internal diameter of 100 Å and 160 Å, respectively, when bound to lipid bilayers. Polymerized C9, assembled by slow spontaneous or rapid Zn2+-induced polymerization, and polyperforin, which is assembled only in the presence of Ca2+, constitute large aqueous pores that are stable, nonselective for solutes, and insensitive to changes of membrane potential. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies to purified C9 and PFP show cross-reactivity, suggesting structural homology between the two molecules. The structural and functional homologies between these two killer molecules imply an active role for pore formation during cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1515935875,"We have determined whether expression of the c-sis gene product, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), is regulated in cultured renal microvascular endothelial cells by factors to which vascular endothelial cells may be exposed at sites of perivascular cellular proliferation. Thrombin exposure increased endothelial cell levels of c-sis message by 3-5-fold over a time course that peaked at 4 h after exposure. Similarly, thrombin-exposed microvascular endothelial cells released increased amounts of PDGF activity into their media. The thrombin effect was not mediated through the proteolytic activity of thrombin, as proteolytically inactive thrombin stimulated the c-sis expression as well as native thrombin. This stimulation was mimicked by exposure of cells to biologically active phorbol esters, suggesting that thrombin action may be mediated through activation of kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme). Thus, thrombin regulates the expression and release of PDGF activity from endothelial cells in culture and may act in vivo to stimulate mitogen release from endothelial cells, thereby inducing proliferation of perivascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987374673,"The sodium channel from rat brain is a complex of alpha (260 kd), beta 1 (36 kd), and beta 2 (33 kd) subunits. The alpha and beta 2 subunits are linked by disulfide bonds. The earliest biosynthetic precursor of the alpha subunit is a 203 kd core polypeptide with sufficient high-mannose carbohydrate chains to increase its apparent size to 224 kd. It is processed to 224 kd and 249 kd precursor forms containing complex carbohydrate chains before it achieves the mature size of 260 kd. Most newly synthesized alpha subunits are not disulfide-linked to beta 2 subunits, but remain as a metabolically stable pool of intracellular subunits. alpha subunits disulfide-linked to beta 2 are found preferentially at the cell surface. A possible role for this intracellular pool as a rate-limiting step in the regulation of the cell surface density and localization of sodium channels in developing neurons is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1546511617,"The effects of submaximal doses of AlF4- to mobilize hepatocyte Ca2+ were potentiated by glucagon (0.1-1 nM) and 8-p-chlorophenylthio-cAMP. A similar potentiation by glucagon of submaximal doses of vasopressin, angiotensin II, and alpha 1-adrenergic agonists has been previously shown (Morgan, N. G., Charest, R., Blackmore, P. F., and Exton, J. H. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 4208-4212). When hepatocytes were pretreated with the protein kinase C activator 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA), the effects of AlF4- to mobilize Ca2+, increase myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and activate phosphorylase were attenuated. Treatment of hepatocytes with PMA likewise inhibits the ability of vasopressin, angiotensin II, and alpha 1-adrenergic agonists to increase IP3 and mobilize Ca2+ (Lynch, C. J., Charest, R., Bocckino, S. B., Exton, J. H., and Blackmore, P. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2844-2851). In contrast, the ability of AlF4- or angiotensin II to lower cAMP or inhibit glucagon-mediated increases in cAMP was unaffected by PMA. The ability of AlF4- to lower cAMP was attenuated in hepatocytes from animals treated with islet-activating protein, whereas Ca2+ mobilization was not modified. These results suggest that the lowering of cAMP induced by AlF4- and angiotensin II was mediated by the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase, whereas Ca2+ mobilization was not. Addition of glucagon, forskolin, or 8CPT-cAMP to hepatocytes raised IP3 and mobilized Ca2+. Both effects were blocked by PMA pretreatment, whereas cAMP and phosphorylase a levels were only minimally affected by PMA. The mobilization of Ca2+ induced by cAMP in hepatocytes incubated in low Ca2+ media was not additive with that induced by maximally effective doses of vasopressin, angiotensin II, or alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, indicating that the Ca2+ pool(s) affected by agents which increase cAMP is the same as that affected by Ca2+-mobilizing hormones which do not increase cAMP. These findings support the proposal that AlF4- mimics the effects of the Ca2+-mobilizing hormones in hepatocytes by activating a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Np) which couples the hormone receptors to a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-specific phosphodiesterase. They also suggest that Np, PIP2 phosphodiesterase, or a factor involved in their interaction is activated following phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and inhibited after phosphorylation by protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1598873313,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a plasma apolipoprotein produced by the liver in response to inflammatory stimuli. The murine SAA gene family is made up of three genes, SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3, plus a pseudogene. The SAA1 and SAA2 genes are highly homologous while the SAA3 gene has diverged substantially from the other two genes. Using small fragments from the cloned genes, we have analyzed the expression of each gene in the SAA family. Within 12 h after endotoxin administration, total liver SAA mRNA increases by 2000-fold, reaching approximately 20,000 transcripts/cell. Each gene accounts for approximately one-third of total SAA mRNA transcripts at this time. The increase is specific, since the levels of the mRNAs encoding albumin and apolipoprotein A-I in liver decrease 2-fold by 24 h. This correlates with a 2-fold decrease of the serum concentrations of these two proteins as well as their in vitro protein synthesis in primary hepatocytes. SAA1+2 mRNAs maintain their maximum levels until 36 h after lipopolysaccharide administration, while SAA3 mRNA is degraded to 20% its maximal level. As assayed by in vitro transcription in isolated hepatocyte nuclei, total SAA gene transcription increases at least 300-fold during the inflammatory response. The transcription rates of the individual SAA genes are similar during the initial stages of this response, reaching peak levels at 3 h. A comparison of the rates of SAA gene transcription and SAA mRNA accumulation suggests that SAA mRNA levels are regulated during the acute phase response by increased transcription and mRNA stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2088806037,"Electrophysiological recordings of inward currents from whole cells showed that vascular muscle cells have one type of sodium channel and two types of calcium channels. One of the calcium channels, the transient calcium channel, was activated by small depolarizations but then rapidly inactivated. It was equally permeable to calcium and barium and was blocked by cadmium, but not by tetrodotoxin. The other type, the sustained calcium channel, was activated by larger depolarizations, but inactivated very little; it was more permeable to barium than calcium. The sustained calcium channel was more sensitive to block by cadmium than the transient channel, but also was not blocked by tetrodotoxin. The sodium channel inactivated 15 times more rapidly than the transient calcium channel and at more negative voltages. This sodium channel, which is unusual because it is only blocked by a very high (60 microM) tetrodotoxin concentration but not by cadmium, is the first to be characterized in vascular muscle, and together with the two calcium channels, provides a basis for different patterns of excitation in vascular muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2092896974,"Excitability is generated in developing skeletal muscle by the incorporation of sodium-selective ion channels into the surface membrane. Whole-cell and patch voltage-clamp recording from myotubes and their embryologic precursors, myoblasts, indicated that voltage-activated sodium current in myoblasts was more resistant to block by tetrodotoxin (TTX) than that in myotubes. Single-channel recording from both cell types showed two classes of sodium channels. One class had a lower single-channel conductance, activated at more hyperpolarized voltages, and was more resistant to TTX than the other. The proportion of TTX-resistant to TTX-sensitive sodium channels was higher in myoblasts than in myotubes. Thus, the difference in TTX sensitivity between myoblasts and myotubes can be explained by a difference in the proportion of the two classes of sodium channels. In addition, the lower conductance of TTX-resistant channels provides insight into the relationship between the TTX binding site and the external mouth of the sodium channel."

https://openalex.org/W1497503028,"In inside-out red cell membrane vesicles active calcium transport and the formation of the enzyme-phosphate complex (EP) of the calcium pump were simultaneously investigated and the effects of a limited proteolytic digestion examined. In order to visualize the proteolyzed EP forms we have induced the formation of a maximum level EP from [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ + La3+ and applied a good-resolution acidic discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. Proteolysis of inside-out vesicle membranes by trypsin, Pronase, papain, or chymotrypsin produces a calmodulin-like activation of the calcium pump, abolishes its calmodulin sensitivity, and decreases the original 140-kDa EP complex to a limit polypeptide of 80 kDa. Trypsin digestion produces another major intermediary fragment of 90 kDa, which is still a low-activity calmodulin-sensitive form of the pump. The red cell calcium pump is activated by trypsin both in the absence and presence of Ca2+ during digestion although the rate of activation and the appearance of the 80-kDa polypeptide are enhanced by Ca2+. If proteolytic digestion is carried out by chymotrypsin, a calmodulin-insensitive maximum activation of the calcium pump coincides with the formation of a 125-130-kDa EP-forming polypeptide. Chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase A have synergistic effects on the formation of this latter high-activity species. Based on these data we suggest a probable molecular arrangement for the functional parts of the red cell membrane calcium pump."
https://openalex.org/W1591138259,"The egg peptide speract increases intracellular pH (pHi) and cyclic nucleotides in sperm of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus by a mechanism dependent on seawater Na+ but not Ca2+ (Hansbrough, J. R., and Garbers, D. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2235-2241; Repaske, D. R., and Garbers, D. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6025-6029). Using the Ca2+ indicators quin2 and indo-1, we show that speract stimulates a transient rise in intracellular [Ca2+] ([a2+]i) when millimolar Ca2+ is present in seawater. The rise is increased and extended by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX), which also enhances 22Na+ uptake with or without Ca2+. Without MIX, speract initiates a rise in [Ca2+]i that peaks within approximately 5 s and decreases with a t1/2 of approximately 9 s. Activation of Na+:H+ exchange without speract by either Na+ addition to sperm in Na+-free seawater (NaFASW) or by monensin also increases [Ca2+]i, but neither change is transient. Inhibition of Na+:H+ exchange by increased seawater [K+] prevents the rise in [Ca2+]i initiated by either speract or Na+ addition to sperm in NaFASW. Increasing pHi by adding 10 mM NH4+ or by addition of Li+ to sperm in NaFASW does not increase [Ca2+]i. The data suggest that speract binding leads to rapid activation of Na+:H+ exchange; and, as a consequence, [Ca2+] entry increases transiently through either Na+:Ca2+ exchange or else through a verapamil-insensitive Ca2+ channel. MIX prevents the inactivation of this entry mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1677443113,"Pulse-chase experiments were performed to follow the export of the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA. Besides the pro-OmpA protein, which carries a 21-residue signal sequence, three species of ompA gene products were distinguishable. One probably represented an incomplete nascent chain, another the mature protein in the outer membrane, and the third, designated imp-OmpA (immature processed), a protein which was already processed but apparently was still associated with the plasma membrane. The pro- and imp-OmpA proteins could be characterized more fully by using a strain overproducing the ompA gene products; pro- and imp-OmpA accumulated in large amounts. It could be shown that the imp- and pro-OmpA proteins differ markedly in conformation from the OmpA protein. The imp-OmpA, but not the pro-OmpA, underwent a conformational change and gained phage receptor activity upon addition of lipopolysaccharide. Utilizing a difference in detergent solubility between the two polypeptides and employing immunoelectron microscopy, it could be demonstrated that the pro-OmpA protein accumulated in the cytoplasm while the imp-OmpA was present in the periplasmic space. The results suggest that the pro-OmpA protein, bound to the plasma membrane, is processed, and the resulting imp-OmpA, still associated with the plasma membrane, recognizes the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide. The resulting conformational change may then force the protein into the outer membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1564223124,"The trm1 mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single nuclear mutation that affects a specific base modification of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA. Transfer RNA isolated from trm1 cells lacks the modified base N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, and extracts from these cells do not have detectable N2,N2-dimethylguanosine-specific tRNA methyltransferase activity. As part of our efforts to determine how this mutation affects enzyme activities in two different cellular compartments we have isolated the TRM1 locus by genetic complementation. The TRM1 locus restores the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine modification to both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA in trm1 cells. An open reading frame in this TRM1 gene is essential for complementation of the trm1 phenotype. Expression of this open reading frame in Escherichia coli converts the organism from one that neither makes N2,N2-dimethylguanosine nor has N2,N2-dimethylguanosine-specific tRNA methyltransferase activity into one that does. This result suggests that the TRM1 locus is the structural gene for the tRNA modification enzyme and that both nuclear/cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of the methyltransferase are produced from the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1530640749,"The effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclic nucleotides, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and interferons on interleukin 1 (IL 1) production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated C3H/HeNCrl mouse peritoneal macrophages were studied. IL 1 production was inhibited by PGE2, the adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate analog dibutyryl cAMP, the cAMP agonist isoproterenol, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine. These agents were more inhibitory when added early in the latent phase of IL 1 synthesis following stimulation with LPS rather than just prior to release of IL 1 into the medium. Production of both the intracellular and extracellular forms of IL 1 was blocked by PGE2 and cAMP. Suppression of LPS-induced IL 1 production by PGE2 was prevented by leukocyte alpha-interferon. Moreover, alpha-interferon augmented LPS-induced IL 1 production but did not stimulate IL 1 production in the absence of LPS. Immune gamma-interferon markedly inhibited LPS-stimulated IL 1 production. The lipoxygenase inhibitor eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid suppressed, whereas 3-amino-1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-pyrazoline augmented, LPS-induced IL 1 production. The opposing effects of these agents suggested that lipoxygenase metabolites do not act as inducers of IL 1 production. Purified LTB4 did not stimulate base-line or augment LPS-induced IL 1 production (both intracellular and extracellular forms). Moreover, calcium ionophore A23187 (a lipoxygenase activator) did not stimulate IL 1 production, alone or in combination with LTB4. Thus, net IL 1 production by macrophages may be regulated by a balance between the effects of PGE2, cAMP, alpha-interferon, and gamma-interferon, but not LTB4."
https://openalex.org/W2028869643,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein carrying the surface antigen (HBsAg) is assembled with cellular lipids in mammalian cells into empty viral envelopes. In a study to evaluate the capacity of such particles to present foreign peptide sequences in a biologically active form, in-phase insertions were created in the S gene encoding the major envelope protein. One of the sequences inserted was a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a poliovirus neutralization epitope. Mammalian cells expressing the modified gene secreted hybrid particles closely resembling authentic 22-nanometer HBsAg particles. These particles reacted with a poliovirus-specific monoclonal antibody and induced neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus. The results indicate that empty viral envelopes of HBV may provide a means for the presentation of peptide sequences and for their export from mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551561338,"Limited proteolysis of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) by a novel bacterial proteinase resulted in the isolation of a soluble 20-kDa domain. The isolated fragment contained the receptor recognition site, expressed on alpha 2M complexes, as it competed effectively with alpha 2M-trypsin for binding to the receptor on skin fibroblasts. The fragment also reacted with two monoclonal antibodies which define epitopes that are part of the receptor recognition site. Characterization of the 20-kDa domain showed it to contain an intact disulfide bridge, while its susceptibility to N-glycanase and reaction with concanavalin A indicated the presence of N-linked carbohydrate. The NH2-terminal sequence (Glu-Glu-Phe-Pro-Phe-Ala-Leu-Gly-Val-Glu-Thr-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Cys-Asp-Glu -Pro) proved this fragment to constitute the COOH terminus of human alpha 2M. Proteolysis occurred at Lys1313-Glu which together with the observation that tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone was an effective inhibitor of the bacterial proteinase, would indicate the latter to hydrolyze preferentially peptide bonds carboxyl-terminal to lysine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1501458107,"A protein preparation that specifically binds insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II was purified from medium conditioned by rat liver BRL-3A cells using molecular sieve chromatography in 1 M acetic acid followed by affinity chromatography on IGF-II-agarose. The affinity-purified IGF-binding protein exhibits a single major band with apparent Mr = 36,300 under reducing conditions on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The IGF-binding protein is efficiently and specifically cross-linked to either 125I-IGF-I (human) or 125I-IGF-II (rat) using disuccinimidyl suberate. An IGF-binding protein of similar apparent molecular weight was also affinity purified from rat hepatoma H-35 cell conditioned medium and found to differ from the BRL-3A protein such that potent polyclonal antisera prepared in rabbits against the purified BRL-3A IGF-binding protein exhibited a much lower titer for the H-35 protein in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and upon immunoblotting. In order to determine whether a single BRL-3A IGF-binding protein is present in the affinity-purified preparation, the protein was prepared for sequencing on a Sephacryl S-300 column in 6 M guanidine HCl after reduction and alkylation. The amino acid composition (expressed in percentages) of this IGF-binding protein was determined to be: Cys = 5.5, Lys = 4.8, His = 2.8, Arg = 7.8, Asx = 10.2, Thr = 5.1, Ser = 3.9, Glx = 15.7, Gly = 17.4, Ala = 7.3, Val = 4.6, Met = 1.4, Ile = 2.4, Leu = 8.3, Tyr = 1.0, Phe = 1.9. Sequencing of the NH2-terminal portion of this protein led to the identification of 31 amino acids in the following order: Phe-Arg-Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys-Thr-Pro-Glu-Arg-Leu-Ala-Ala-Cys-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro- Asp-Ala-Pro-Cys-Ala-Glu-Leu-Val-Arg-Glu-Pro-Gly-Cys. We conclude that rat liver BRL-3A cells secrete a single major IGF-binding protein capable of binding both IGF-I and IGF-II."
https://openalex.org/W1507578999,"We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone of 872 base pairs from the 3' end of the mRNA for the large cartilage specific proteoglycan from rat. Identification was confirmed by a comparison with published protein sequence. Hybridization analysis shows the presence of an 8-9-kilobase mRNA for this proteoglycan in rat and chick sternal chondrocytes and rat chondrosarcoma cells, but not in RNA from rat fibroblasts, vitamin A-treated chick chondrocytes, chick crop, or bone. The carboxyl portion of the proteoglycan is deduced to terminate in a globular domain, which includes a region homologous to a chick hepatic lectin, and is possibly involved in binding to N-acetylglucosamine. The clone extends into a region where serines are clustered, probably the start of the chondroitin sulfate-rich region."
https://openalex.org/W1566217656,"Antibodies directed against the major apoprotein of rabbit lung surfactant, a 29-36-kDa glycoprotein, were used to study changes in the levels of translatable surfactant apoprotein mRNA in rabbit lung tissue during development, as well as the effects of cortisol and cyclic AMP analogues on the levels of surfactant apoprotein and its mRNA in fetal rabbit lung tissue in organ culture. The major surfactant apoprotein and its mRNA were undetectable in lung tissues of 21-day gestational age fetal rabbits. Translatable mRNA specific for the major surfactant apoprotein was first detectable in lung tissues of 26-day fetuses, increased 25-fold on day 28, reached peak levels at day 31, and declined after birth. Incubation of 21-day fetal rabbit lung explants with cortisol in serum-free medium resulted in an increase in the specific content of the 29-36-kDa apoprotein. Cyclic AMP analogues and forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, also caused a marked increase in the accumulation of surfactant apoprotein. When fetal lung explants were incubated with cortisol and dibutyryl cyclic AMP in combination, the specific content of the surfactant apoprotein was increased to levels greater than that of explants treated with either cortisol or dibutyryl cyclic AMP alone. These effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and cortisol on surfactant apoprotein accumulation were associated with comparable changes in the levels of translatable surfactant apoprotein mRNA. Thus, we have shown for the first time that the induction of pulmonary surfactant apoprotein synthesis during differentiation in vitro and in vivo is associated with an increase in the level of translatable mRNA and that cortisol and cyclic AMP increase both the accumulation of the major surfactant apoprotein and the corresponding mRNA in fetal rabbit lung tissue in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1575322130,"Stereospecific saturable and reversible binding of d-cis-diltiazem has been demonstrated in cardiac sarcolemmal membrane vesicles. Analysis of binding by either equilibrium or kinetic techniques indicates the presence of a single class of benzothiazepine receptors which bind diltiazem with a KD of 80 nM at 25 degrees C. Benzothiazepine receptors copurify with other sarcolemmal marker activities and exist in a complex with distinct receptors for dihydropyridine and aralkylamine Ca2+ entry blockers in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Ligand binding to one receptor of this complex influences binding reactions at the other two sites in a manner that depends on ambient temperature. Binding of either dihydropyridine agonists or antagonists causes partial inhibition of diltiazem binding at 25 degrees C (Bmax effect), while most dihydropyridine antagonists stimulate and agonists inhibit diltiazem binding at 37 degrees C (both are KD effects). This temperature-dependent change in receptor coupling was confirmed by Scatchard analyses and study of diltiazem dissociation kinetics. Verapamil, interacting at the aralkylamine receptor, inhibits diltiazem binding equivalently at 25 and 37 degrees C (KD effects). In addition, both classes of dihydropyridines inhibit verapamil binding in a temperature-independent fashion, as does diltiazem (all are KD effects). Allosteric coupling between benzothiazepine and dihydropyridine receptors is manifested in cardiac muscle since the negative inotropic potency of diltiazem is increased by nitrendipine and decreased by 4-(O-trifluromethy(phenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-1,4-dihydropyridin e-3- carboxylic acid, methyl ester. These results suggest a model in which the Ca2+ entry blocker receptor complex undergoes a change between 25 and 37 degrees C so that at the latter temperature all sites are directly coupled. Allosteric coupling may have important consequences in vivo since it can be detected in functional assays of Ca2+ channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1526493499,"We have previously proposed a three-site model for the elongation cycle. The model is characterized by the presence of two tRNAs on the ribosome before and after translocation. We have already shown a first consequence of the model, namely that the translocation reaction is not coupled with a release of deacylated tRNA. Here we demonstrate the following conclusions. Occupation of the A site triggers the tRNA release from the E site, i.e. the A site occupation induces a drastic decrease in the affinity of the E site for deacylated tRNA. In the concentration range of deacylated tRNA in which a ribosome binds a second tRNA in addition to that one already present at the P site the deacylated tRNA does not compete for one and the same binding site with an A site ligand (AcPhe-tRNA) at 37 degrees C. It follows that the second deacylated tRNA binds to a site, the E site, which is physically distinct from the A site. When the ribosome binds a deacylated tRNA at the E site (in addition to a tRNA at the P site), the A site cannot be occupied by AcPhe-tRNA at 0 degree C and only poorly by the ternary complex elongation factor Tu . Phe-tRNA . guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. At 37 degrees C a significant A site binding is observed, with a corresponding tRNA release from the E site. In contrast, if the E site is free and only the P site occupied, the A site can bind significant amounts of charged tRNA already at 0 degree C. It follows that an occupied E site induces a low-affinity state of the A site. Thus, the ribosome always contains two high-affinity binding sites, which are A and P sites before and P and E sites after translocation. A and E sites are allosterically linked in a bidirectional manner."
https://openalex.org/W2094339131,"The switch from fetal to adult globin synthesis in man was studied using heterospecific cell hybrids between human fetal erythroblasts and mouse erythroleukemia cells. When erythroblasts from first trimester fetuses were used the hybrids expressed a fetal program of human globin expression. While in continuous culture, these hybrids switched from predominantly fetal to almost exclusively adult globin expression, providing direct evidence that switching can occur within a single cell lineage. Sequential studies of globin expression at a single cell level and subcloning experiments suggested that the switch reflects a progressive increase in the generation of β+ cells from γ+ cells. Hybrids formed with erythroblasts of second trimester fetuses switched faster than those produced with cells of first trimester fetuses. The findings suggest that the human γ to β switch is controlled by a developmental clock-like mechanism, which appears to be associated with chromosome 11."
https://openalex.org/W1523790501,"The roles of calcium ions and voltage-sensitive calcium channels in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) release were investigated in rat anterior pituitary cells. The calcium ionophores A23187 and ionomycin stimulated LH release from cultured pituitary cells, in which ionomycin (5 X 10(-5) M) was as effective as a maximal concentration of GnRH (10(-8) M). In addition, a concentration of the calcium channel agonist methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-pyridine- 5-carboxylate (BK 8644) (10(-8) M), which did not alter basal LH release, potentiated the ability of submaximal (10(-10) and 10(-9) M) doses of GnRH to increase LH secretion. Furthermore, concentrations of the calcium channel antagonist nitrendipine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) that did not alter basal LH release, inhibited GnRH-stimulated LH secretion by 30-40%. Nitrendipine (10(-8) M) also blocked the potentiation of GnRH-induced LH secretion by BK 8644. During column perifusion of pituitary cells, 10(-8) M nitrendipine reduced the LH response to a 2-min pulse of 10(-8) M GnRH by about 40%. In Quin-2-loaded pituitary cells, supramaximal doses (10(-6) M) of a potent GnRH agonist rapidly elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ by 50-100 nM. Concomitant treatment with nitrendipine decreased the GnRH agonist-induced Ca2+ signal by 40-60%. These results indicate that increases in intracellular Ca2+ via voltage-sensitive calcium channels partially reproduce GnRH action, and also that GnRH causes activation of such channels. However, the increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration during GnRH action must originate in part from mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores, and its relatively small magnitude may be consistent with the concomitant activation of protein kinase C as an intermediate step in GnRH action."
https://openalex.org/W2441335220,"The rat liver epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was assessed for EGF-dependent autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of a defined exogenous substrate in purified plasmalemma and Golgiendosome fractions isolated from rat liver homogenates. While EGF-dependent kinase activity was readily detected in plasmalemma the corresponding activity in Golgi-endosome fractions required detergent. Consequent to the systemic injection of EGF in vivo, the majority (approximately 60%) of receptor as evaluated by 125I-EGF binding was rapidly lost (T 1/2 approximately 8 min) from the plasmalemma and correspondingly accumulated in the Golgi-endosome fraction in a dose-dependent manner. Electron microscope radioautography of 125I-EGF uptake into Golgi-endosome fractions identified internalization into lipoprotein-filled vesicles of heterogenous size and shape but not into stacked saccules of the Golgi apparatus. Evaluation of receptor kinase activity in plasmalemma fractions isolated at various times after EGF injection in vivo showed more rapid loss of EGF-dependent autophosphorylation activity (T 1/2 approximately 10 s) than of receptor content (T 1/2 approximately 8 min). In contrast to the EGF receptor kinase of the plasmalemma fraction, kinase activity accumulating in endosomes was activated, i.e. maximally stimulated, in the absence of EGF or Triton X-100 in vitro. Furthermore, following the peak time of accumulation of EGF receptor kinase in endosomes (5-15 min) EGF-dependent autophosphorylation activity and EGF receptor content were lost more slowly (T 1/2 approximately 27 and 87 min for the loss of autophosphorylation activity and receptor content, respectively). The rapidity of translocation of activated EGF receptor into endosomes (30 s) and the dose response to low levels (1 microgram) of EGF injected are consistent with a physiological role for internalized EGF receptor kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1646029847,"Membrane vesicles from human platelets were prepared by various disruption and isolation techniques reported in the literature to yield fractions of predominantly surface or intracellular membrane origin. ATP + Mg2+-dependent Ca2+ accumulation and the formation of acylphosphate intermediates of the calcium pump(s) were followed in parallel experiments, and the consequences of a limited proteolysis of the membranes examined. In all types of preparations active Ca2+ uptake had both oxalate-sensitive and insensitive fractions and calmodulin had no effect on the rate of Ca2+ uptake. Limited proteolysis by trypsin eliminated oxalate-sensitive Ca2+ uptake while it had no effect on the oxalate-insensitive fraction. The Ca2+-induced EP complex had an apparent molecular mass of 100-110 kDa in all of the preparations, the EP showing a broad or even duplicated line in most autoradiographies. Mild trypsin digestion resulted in the formation of 80-, 55-, and 35-kDa phosphorylated fragments. The 80-kDa fragment corresponded to the limit polypeptide found in the proteolyzed erythrocyte membrane Ca2+ pump, its phosphorylation was stimulated by lanthanum, and it appeared in a different time course than the smaller fragments. The molecular mass and the formation pattern of the latter species corresponded to the tryptic fragments in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump. Based on these results we suggest that platelet membrane preparations contain two types of Ca2+ pump proteins, one similar to the sarcoplasmic reticulum-type and the other to the erythrocyte-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1608146890,"The LH-I structural genes are located 5' of the RC-L and -M structural genes on what has been designated as the puf operon of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Analysis of puf operon expression in R. sphaeroides by Northern hybridization with probes specific for individual structural gene has identified two transcripts encoded by this operon. The large (2.6 kilobase pairs (kb] transcript contains sequences for all four polypeptides of the puf operon, whereas the small (0.5 kb) transcript, which is more abundant (10-15-fold) than the large transcript under photosynthetic growth, is homologous only to the two LH-I structural genes. Transcription of the puf operon during photosynthetic growth under saturating light conditions is increased approximately 3-fold relative to growth in the presence of oxygen while the relative ratio of these two transcripts is independent of the incident light intensity. Analysis of the turnover of the two transcripts (t1/2 of 9 and 20 min for the large and small transcripts, respectively) indicates that 5' processing is the initial step in the degradation of the large transcript and that the molar excess of the small transcript cannot be accounted for by differences in the rates of turnover of these two mRNA species. Analysis of the 5' ends of the 2.6- and 0.5-kb transcripts, their relative abundance, and stabilities indicates that these two transcripts have different 5'-ends corresponding to 75 and 104 base pairs upstream from the start of the LH-I beta structural gene, respectively. Northern hybridization analysis with specific synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide probes confirmed that the two transcripts differ by 29 bases at their 5'-ends, suggesting that differential transcript initiation may be involved in regulating the relative levels of these two mRNA species in vivo, although we cannot rule out complex mechanisms of post-transcriptional processing."
https://openalex.org/W1548856527,"Immunization of mice with Ley-active trifucosylnonaosylceramide (III3FucV3FucVI2FucnLc6) isolated from human colonic adenocarcinoma (Nudelman, E., Levery, S. B., Kaizu, T., and Hakomori, S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11247-11253) followed by selection of hybridoma by positive reaction with this antigen and negative reaction with two other Ley antigens (III3FucIV2FucnLc4 and V3FucVI2FucnLc6) resulted in successful isolation of the hybridoma producing IgM antibody, termed KH1, specific to Ley-active trifucosylnonaosylceramide, which does not cross-react with Ley-active hexaosyl- or octaosylceramides (III3FucIV2FucnLc4 and V3FucVI2FucnLc6) without internal fucosyl substitution. The three-dimensional structure of the trifucosylnonaosylceramide was simulated based on previously published glycosidic torsion angles for fucosyl type 2 chain (Lex and Ley) and for GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta as predicted by hard sphere exo-anomeric calculations (Thogersen, H., Lemieux, R. U., Bock, K., and Meyer, B. (1982) Can. J. Chem. 60, 44-57). The picture thus constructed showed a broad nonpolar area consisting of the hydrophobic surface of the pyranosyl ring and acetamido group of N-acetylglucosamine and three CH3 groups of L-fucose; this hydrophobic area is adjacent to a hydrophilic area. In analogy to the detailed structure of Leb or Ley involved in their interactions with antibodies and lectins (Spohr, U., Hindsgaul, O., and Lemieux, R. U. (1985) Can. J. Chem. 63, 2644-2652), such a wide hydrophobic area adjacent to a hydrophilic region could be recognized by the antibody KH1, as shown in the model illustrated in the text. Since the axis of ceramide, which is inserted in the lipid bilayer, is perpendicular to the plane of type 2 chain, the epitope recognized by the antibody KH1 is located at the external nonpolar surface of the carbohydrate chain that is overlaid on the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1673032436,"Calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase from bovine brain and heart was assayed for phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine phosphatase activity using several substrates: 1) smooth muscle myosin light chain (LC20) phosphorylated on tyrosine or serine residues, 2) angiotensin I phosphorylated on tyrosine, and 3) synthetic phosphotyrosine- or phosphoserine-containing peptides with amino acid sequences patterned after the autophosphorylation site in Type II regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphatase was activated by Ni2+ and Mn2+, and stimulated further by calmodulin. In the presence of Ni2+ and calmodulin, it exhibited similar kinetic constants for the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosyl LC20 (Km = 0.9 microM, and Vmax = 350 nmol/min/mg) and phosphoseryl LC20 (Km = 2.6 microM, Vmax = 690 nmol/min/mg). Dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosyl LC20 was inhibited by phosphoseryl LC20 with an apparent Ki of 2 microM. Compared to the reactions with phosphotyrosyl LC20 as the substrate, reactions with phosphotyrosine-containing oligopeptides exhibited slightly higher Km and lower Vmax values. The reaction with the phosphoseryl peptide based on the Type II regulatory subunit sequence exhibited a slightly higher Km (23 microM), but a much higher Vmax (4400 nmol/min/mg) than that with its phosphotyrosine-containing counterpart. Micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ inhibited the phosphatase activity; vanadate was less potent, and 25 mM NaF was ineffective. The study provides quantitative data to serve as a basis for comparing the ability of the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase to act on phosphotyrosine- and phosphoserine-containing substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2077411436,"Determination of the molecular structure and properties of allergens that elicit severe immediate-type hypersensitivity diseases in humans and a knowledge of the structure of their antibody-binding sites should provide new insight into the pathogenetic mechanisms of allergic diseases. Monomeric and homodimeric hemoglobins (CTT I to X) have been identified as potent allergenic components of Chironomidae, a family of Diptera. Immunologic investigations of peptides of three of these hemoglobins (CTT IV, CTT VI, and CTT VIII) showed that human antibodies of the E and G classes recognize at least two different sites within each molecule. Individual hemoglobin peptides were aligned with homologous regions of chironomid hemoglobin CTT III, whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray analysis at a resolution of 1.4 angstroms. The antigenic site CTT IV(91 to 101) showed the following characteristics: (i) seven polar or hydroxylated amino acids, from a total of eleven, occupying predominantly superficial regions; (ii) the property of linkage to other molecules by hydrogen bonds or solvent clusters; and (iii) high thermal mobility factors. In contrast, peptide CTT IV(102 to 108), which does not bind human antibodies, contained no polar amino acids and had low thermal mobility factors. These results support the idea that the antigenicity of clinically relevant proteins is related to regions with a predominance of polar amino acids and with low energy barriers between different conformations, which allow high flexibility, including site-specific adaptation in antibody binding."
https://openalex.org/W1504063281,"Methods have been developed for kinetic studies of the inhibition of exogenous unmodified thrombin in human plasma containing normal levels of fibrinogen and calcium ion. To prevent interference by other proteases, factor VIII-deficient plasma was used and contained 50 nM Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone and 1 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin; neither inhibited thrombin at these levels. Two independent assays were used. The first was the discontinuous amidolytic assay of thrombin activity, which measures both free thrombin and thrombin-alpha 2-macroglobulin complex, and was used to estimate the rates of inhibition both by inactivating inhibitors, such as anti-thrombin and alpha 1-protease inhibitor, and by alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). The contribution of alpha 2M was confirmed by a second method, which measured with time the generation of amidolytic activity due to the thrombin-alpha 2M complex. The total rate of thrombin inhibition in plasma containing 4 mM free Ca2+ was of the order of 1.9 min-1, of which 0.4 min-1 was due to alpha 2M and 0.9 min-1 was due to inhibitors that were removed when plasma was passed through heparin-agarose. Thrombin inhibition was also measured in varying dilutions of plasma and confirmed that total inhibition rate is approximately linearly related to plasma (and thus inhibitor) concentration. Negatively charged phospholipid micelles had very little effect on thrombin inhibition rate, but platelets accelerated inhibition to more than 2.5 min-1."
https://openalex.org/W1571994760,"Several cDNA clones complementary to a chicken phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 have been isolated and sequenced, representing the first non-mammalian eukaryotic cytochrome P-450 sequence to be analyzed. The cDNA clones hybridized to two mRNAs of 3.5 and 2.5 kilobases in length, but further analysis indicated that the clones were derived from the larger mRNA. The sequence contains a 5'-noncoding region of 39 nucleotides and an open reading frame of 1473 nucleotides. The remainder of the sequence is due to the 3'-noncoding region and poly(A) tail. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 491 amino acids with a molecular weight of 56,196. The chicken cytochrome P-450 shows an overall homology of 45-54% compared with the mammalian phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P-450s. The degree of homology is not uniform, with some short regions showing much greater levels of sequence conservation. In particular, the chicken cytochrome P-450 contains the conserved cysteinyl domain near the carboxyl terminus, found in all cytochrome P-450s and which is thought to be involved in heme binding. Using the chicken sequence, a more accurate estimate of the evolutionary rates of cytochrome P-450s has been made. It is suggested that the phenobarbital-, 3-methylcholanthrene, and pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile-induced cytochrome P-450 gene families diverged from a common ancestral gene 600 million years ago. Furthermore the phenobarbital-inducible gene apparently underwent gene duplication events at about the time of the divergence of the chicken and mammalian lineages. The results imply that most mammals should have at least four rather distantly related phenobarbital-inducible gene subfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W1552229310,"The yeast DNA primase-DNA polymerase activities catalyze de novo oligoribonucleotide primed DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA templates (Singh, H., and Dumas, L. B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7936-7940). In the presence of ATP substrate and poly(dT) template, the enzyme preparation synthesizes discrete-length oligoribonucleotides (apparent length 8-12) and multiples thereof. The unit length primers are the products of de novo processive synthesis and are precursors to the synthesis of the multimers. Multimeric length oligoribonucleotides are not generated by continuous processive extension of the de novo synthesis products, however, nor do they arise by ligation of unit length oligomers. Instead, dissociation and rebinding of a factor, possibly the DNA primase, results in processive extension of the RNA synthesis products by an additional modal length. Thus, catalysis by the yeast DNA primase can be viewed as repeated cycles of processive unit length RNA chain extension. Inclusion of dATP substrate results in three distinct transitions: (i) coupling of RNA priming to DNA synthesis, (ii) suppression of multimer RNA synthesis, and (iii) attenuation of primer length. The less than unit length RNA primers appear to result from premature DNA chain extension, not degradation from either end of the unit length primer. We discuss possible roles of DNA polymerase and DNA primase in RNA primer attenuation."
https://openalex.org/W1547976244,"The role of calcium in the parathyroid hormone-mediated increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) production was evaluated using isolated proximal tubules from rats fed a low calcium diet (0.002% Ca) for 14 days. Tubules were prepared by collagenase digestion and centrifugation through Percoll. Tubules from rats fed a low calcium diet produced 1,25-(OH)2D3 at rates 10 times that of tubules from rats fed normal calcium diet (1.2% Ca). In vitro 1,25-(OH)2D3 biosynthesis was highly dependent upon extracellular calcium with inhibition in the absence of medium calcium and maximal production at 0.25 mM medium calcium (0.9 +/- 0.25 versus 15.1 +/- 2.3 nmol/mg protein/5 min, p less than 0.03). Inhibition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 production was partly due to depressed ATP content (0 versus 1.2 mM calcium, 6.8 +/- 0.6 versus 12.7 +/- 0.6 nmol/mg protein, p less than 0.006). EGTA reduced 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis and total cell calcium and ATP production. Ruthenium red blocked the inhibitory effects of EGTA on 1,25-(OH)2D3 production. Barium (1.0 mM) inhibited 1,25-(OH)2D3 production (7.2 +/- 0.5 versus 3.4 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.001) without altering ATP production. The calcium ionophore A23187 increased 1,25-(OH)2D3 production in a calcium-dependent manner. It is concluded that parathyroid hormone-mediated increases in 1,25-(OH)2D3 production, as during low calcium diet, require extracellular calcium. Extracellular calcium maintains mitochondrial calcium at optimal concentrations for normal ATP production, a requirement for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase (25-OH-D3-1-hydroxylase) activity. Inhibition of 25-OH-D3-1-hydroxylase activity by barium without an alteration of ATP suggests calcium may also control 1,25-(OH)2D3 production independent of its effects on oxidative phosphorylation, perhaps through a direct interaction with one or more components of the 25-OH-D3-1-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1498217422,"The question of whether or not the tRNA at the third ribosomal binding site specific for deacylated tRNA (E site) undergoes codon-anticodon interaction was analyzed as follows. Poly(U)-programmed ribosomes each carrying two [14C]tRNAPhe molecules were subjected to a chasing experiment using various tRNA species. At 0 degree C Ac[3H]Phe-tRNAPhe did not trigger any chasing whereas deacylated cognate tRNAPhe provoked a strong effect; non-cognate tRNALys was totally ineffective. This indicates that the second [14C]tRNAPhe cannot be present at the A site but rather at the E site (confirming previous observations). In the presence of poly(U) or poly(A) ribosomes bound the cognate tRNA practically exclusively as second deacylated tRNA, i.e. [14C]tRNAPhe and [14C]tRNALys, respectively. Thus, the second deacylated tRNA binds in a codon-dependent manner. [14C]tRNALys at the P site and Ac[3H]Lys-tRNALys at the A site of poly(A)-primed ribosomes were translocated to the E and P sites, respectively, by means of elongation factor G. The E site-bound [14C]tRNALys could be significantly chased by cognate tRNALys but not by non-cognate tRNAPhe, indicating the coded nature of the E site binding. Additional evidence is presented that the ribosome accommodates two adjacent codon-anticodon interactions at either A and P or P and E sites."
https://openalex.org/W1542549940,"Undifferentiated PC12 cell produce high levels of apamin receptors (measured with 125I-apamin) after 7 days in culture. These levels are at least 50 times higher than those found in other cellular types which are also known to have apamin receptors and apamin-sensitive Ca2+-activated K+ channels in their membranes. Treatment of undifferentiated PC12 cells with nerve growth factor maintains these cells in a state having a low level (10 times less after 7 days of culture) of apamin receptors. Ca2+ injection into PC12 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 has been used to monitor the activity of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel following 86Rb+ efflux. A large component of this Ca2+-activated 86Rb+ efflux is inhibited by apamin. Half-maximum inhibition by apamin of both 86Rb+ efflux and 125I-apamin binding was observed at 240 pM apamin. Another component of 86Rb+ efflux is due to another type of Ca2+-activated K+ channel which is resistant to apamin and sensitive to tetraethylammonium. The Ca2+ channel activator Bay K8644 also triggers an apamin-sensitive Ca2+-dependent 86Rb+ efflux. Bay K8644 has been used to analyze the internal Ca2+ concentration dependence of the apamin-sensitive channel activity. Under normal conditions, the internal Ca2+ concentration is 109 +/- 17 nM, and the apamin-sensitive channel is not activated. The channel is fully activated at an internal Ca2+ concentration of 320 +/- 20 nM."
https://openalex.org/W1484204974,"We have determined several kinetic parameters for the reaction of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes with ternary complexes of elongation factor Tu, GTP, and yeast Phe-tRNA analogs with different bases substituted for uridine in position 33. These analogs test whether disruption of the hydrogen bonds normally formed by uridine 33 and steric crowding in the anticodon loop are detrimental to tRNA function on the ribosome. Single-turnover kinetic studies of the reaction of these ternary complexes with ribosomes show that these Phe-tRNA analogs decrease the apparent rate of GTP hydrolysis (kGTP) and the ratio of peptide formed to GTP hydrolyzed. Thus, the substitution of uridine 33 affects not only the selection of a ternary complex by the ribosome but also the selection of an aminoacyl-tRNA in the proofreading reaction. The effects become greater as first one, and then the other, H-bond is disrupted. Steric crowding in the anticodon loop is also important, but does not have as great an effect on the rate constants. An analysis of the elementary rate constants which comprise the rate constant, kGTP, demonstrates that the reduction in kGTP results from a decreased rate of ternary complex association with the ribosome (k1) and that there is little or no effect on the rate of GTP cleavage (k2). An analysis of the rate constants involved in proofreading shows that all the modified (tRNAs have increased rates of aminoacyl-tRNA rejection (k4) but that the rate of peptide bond formation (k3) is unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W1539913524,"A major protein component of the gel-like, embryonic hyaline layer of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus has been purified and characterized. The protein retains the ability to form an insoluble gel in the presence of specific divalent cations, a property characteristic of the hyaline material. Using a light scattering assay developed to measure the initial rate of hyalin gelation, we have been able to show that calcium alone is capable of initiating this reaction but that calcium and magnesium are synergistic in their effect. In the absence of divalent cations, the major hyalin protein has a molecular weight of 9.2 +/- 0.5 X 10(5) and a sedimentation coefficient of 11.6 S; these and other data indicate that the protein assumes a very elongated, rod-like structure in solution. Smaller amounts of two additional proteins, 8.8 and 6.5 S, are present in the hyalin fraction when the jelly coat and vitelline layer are subjected to a more stringent acid treatment early in the isolation procedure."

The following findings were of particular interest. About 25-35% of cFN and tFN carried a binary sialosyl type 2 chain (NeuAc alpha 2----3/or 6Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) linked beta 1----3/beta 1----6 to the galactose residue and defined by monoclonal antibody C6. This structure was not detected in pFN. In cFN, the C6-defined structure was localized within the gelatin-binding domain, whereas in tFN the same structure was absent from this domain but was located at the NH2-terminal region of the central domain. Other carbohydrate determinants, defined by Ricinus communis lectin and concanavalin A before and after sialidase treatment, showed essentially identical domain distribution patterns among cFN, tFN, and pFN and were all located at the gelatin-binding domain (44 kDa), its precursor (60 kDa), and the Cell/Hep-2 domain (155/145 kDa). Although both cFN and tFN were reactive with lentil lectin, pFN was not. Fibronectin from transformed cells (tFN) showed much greater reactivity than cFN and pFN with wheat germ lectin before sialidase treatment and showed enhanced reactivity with R. communis lectin and peanut lectin after sialidase treatment, indicating that tFN is more highly sialylated than cFN and pFN. All fibronectins examined were strongly reactive with monoclonal antibody AH8-28, which binds to Gal beta 1----3GalNAc residues, and this reactivity was localized to both the NH2-terminal half and COOH-terminal half of the S-cyanylation-cleaved fibronectin molecule."

The major species of displacing strands has a length of 1670 nucleotides, approximately 3 times the length of mouse or human D-loop mtDNA strands. We report experiments that precisely map the termini of the D-loop strand within a revised sequence of the origin region. Analysis of D-loop mtDNA strands labeled in vitro at the 5' end using polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP reveals microheterogeneity at the 5' end. The ends detected by this technique are located in the vicinity of several matches to a sequence element, denoted CSB-1, that is conserved in this location in several vertebrate mtDNA genomes. The 3' ends of D-loop mtDNA strands labeled in vitro by limited extension with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and [gamma-32P] ATP are homogeneous. The sequence signals that may help specify the arrest of DNA replication at this site are discussed. The nucleotide sequence that we report for this region contains 53 discrepancies in comparison with a previously published sequence of this region of the Xenopus laevis mtDNA genome (Roe, B. A., Ma, D.-P., Wilson, R. K., and Wong, J.F.-H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9759-9774).

These compounds affect several metabolic processes. The first is the inhibition of GMP reductase by the IMP analogues allopurinol ribonucleoside monophosphate and thipurinol ribonucleoside monophosphate which reduces the organism's ability to synthesize ATP from guanine. Second, interconversion of adenine nucleotides to guanine nucleotides, is curtailed by the inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase by these same IMP analogues. Third, the IMP analogues reduce intracellular UTP content. The fourth affect is increased catabolism of RNA and consequent reduction of protein synthesis. This latter effect is due to the adenine nucleotide analogues aminopurinol ribonucleoside mono-, di-, and/or triphosphates, metabolic products of both allopurinol and aminopurinol."
https://openalex.org/W1647311677,"The domain structure of human complement protein C9 was investigated by determining the functional activities of the NH2-terminal (C9a) and COOH-terminal (C9b) fragments obtained by cleavage of C9 with alpha-thrombin. The two fragments were separated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and renatured by dialysis against buffers containing zwitterionic detergents. The C9b fragment produced membranolytic activities in three independent assays. First, it produced single, ion-conducting channels of varying conductances in planar lipid membranes. Most of the channels had an average conductance of 11 picoSiemens and an average lifetime of about 30 s. The channels showed lipid specificity and a 3-fold preference for conducting K+ over Na+. Second, the fragment also caused specific marker release from liposomes which was inhibitable by a C9b-specific monoclonal antibody, and third, it lysed erythrocytes in the absence of a fully assembled C5b-8 complex. The isolated C9a fragment did not produce single channels in planar lipid membranes but was also effective in releasing markers from liposomes and in lysing erythrocytes. Secondary structure predictions indicate the presence of several amphiphilic, surface-seeking segments in the primary structure of C9 which are mainly alpha-helices in C9b and beta-sheets in C9a. These results may indicate the presence of surface-binding domains in the NH2-terminal half and channel-forming domains in the COOH-terminal portion of native, monomeric C9."
https://openalex.org/W1500663188,"We previously demonstrated that the rate-limiting step in 5 S RNA transcription involves the ordered assembly of a preinitiation complex on the 5 S gene that requires magnesium and ATP for its formation and contains stoichiometric amounts of transcription factors IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC and RNA polymerase III. In this paper, we have characterized the nucleotide requirement in a number of ways by taking advantage of our ability to monitor each step in this ordered assembly of transcription components and by direct isolation of transcription complexes. By kinetic analyses, we demonstrate that the lag in transcription can be eliminated by the presence of any nucleoside triphosphate and does not require an energy-yielding event and that the nucleotide is required stoichiometrically. By competition analysis of factor IIIB interaction, we demonstrate that a complete stable complex (which includes factors IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC) can form on the 5 S gene in the absence of nucleotide. Finally, by direct isolation of functional transcription complexes via gel filtration, we demonstrate that RNA polymerase III can also associate with the DNA template in the absence of nucleotide. Thus, the nucleotide requirement for elimination of the rate-limiting step is uncoupled from the actual binding of the transcription components. Further analyses indicate that, consistent with its stoichiometric requirement, the nucleotide can be found associated with the isolated complexes. These results raise the interesting possibility that the nucleotide interaction may be activating the transcription complex via induction of a conformational change in one of the factors or by a general rearrangement of the transcriptional complex on the 5 S gene."
