Understanding the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia is of particular significance because they are highly predictive for the long-term prognosis of the disease, and at present they are essentially resistant to treatment (Green, 1996Green M.F. What are the functional consequences of neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia?.Am. J. Psychiatry. 1996; 153: 321-330PubMed Google Scholar). Cognitive symptoms include deficits in working memory and behavioral flexibility (Forbes et al., 2009Forbes N.F. Carrick L.A. McIntosh A.M. Lawrie S.M.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have consistently shown an association between impaired executive function and altered activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients, leading to the influential hypothesis that prefrontal dysfunction underlies the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (Weinberger and Berman, 1996Weinberger D.R. Berman K.F. Prefrontal function in schizophrenia: confounds and controversies.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Due to its dense excitatory reciprocal connection with the PFC (Jones, 2007Jones E.G. The Thalamus.2nd Edition. Cambridge University Press, New York2007Google Scholar), the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) has become a focus of attention in the study of cognitive symptoms. Imaging studies have repeatedly shown decreased activation of the MD in patients under a variety of test conditions that address executive functions (Andrews et al., 2006Andrews J. Wang L. Csernansky J.G. Gado M.H. Barch D.M. Abnormalities of thalamic activation and cognition in schizophrenia.Am. J.

Meta-analysis of 41 functional neuroimaging studies of executive function in schizophrenia.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2009; 66: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Altered correlation between activity in the MD and the PFC at rest or during cognitive testing has also been observed (Minzenberg et al., 2009Minzenberg M.J. Laird A.R. Thelen S. Carter C.S.

These findings suggest that altered MD activity and/or impaired communication between the MD and PFC could play a role in the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia patients. A major limitation of brain imaging studies is that they cannot draw causal relationships between measured physiological alterations and specific symptoms. As such, it remains unclear whether decreased MD activity is a cause or a consequence of schizophrenia and its associated cognitive dysfunction. Lesion studies in animal models have made a first step toward a better understanding of the roles of the PFC and the MD in executive function. While such studies clearly involved the PFC in executive function in humans (Bechara et al., 1998Bechara A. Damasio H. Tranel D. Anderson S.W.

Whereas a number of groups have reported an impairment in working memory and reversal learning tasks in MD lesioned rats (Bailey and Mair, 2005Bailey K.R. Mair R.G.

Lack of effect of dorsomedial thalamic lesions on automated tests of spatial memory in the rat.Behav. Brain Res. 1993; 55: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The interpretation of lesion studies is difficult in the context of imaging studies. Indeed, imaging studies have merely reported a decrease in the activity of the MD, while lesion studies physically and irreversibly ablate the entire structure. Imaging studies further suggest that the MD cooperates with the PFC during cognitive processes, but the nature of this relationship cannot be addressed by lesion studies in which both structures do not remain intact. To address these questions and to circumvent these limitations, we therefore used a recently developed pharmacogenetic approach, the DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug) system (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dymecki S.M. Impaired respiratory and body temperature control upon acute serotonergic neuron inhibition.Science. 2011; 333: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) to selectively and reversibly decrease neuronal activity in the MD of mice performing cognitive tasks. We found that a relatively mild decrease in the activity of MD neurons is sufficient to trigger selective impairments in two prefrontal-dependent cognitive tasks: an operant-based reversal learning task and a delayed nonmatching to sample (DNMS) working memory task. To investigate the nature and the role of MD-PFC communication in working memory, we recorded simultaneously from both structures in mice performing the DNMS task. We found that synchronous activity between MD and medial PFC (mPFC) increased hand in hand with choice accuracy during the learning of the task and that reducing MD activity delayed both learning and the strengthening of synchrony. Interestingly, in trained animals, the strength of MD neurons phase-locking to medial prefrontal oscillations in the beta frequency range (13–30 Hz) increased specifically during the choice phase of the task associated with peak mnemonic demand, suggesting a role for MD-PFC beta synchrony in working memory. Strikingly, a primary decrease in the firing of MD neurons selectively disrupted this task-specific increase in MD-PFC beta-synchrony. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a causal relationship between decreased MD activity and deficits in executive function. They further suggest thalamofrontal beta synchrony as a potential mechanism contributing to working memory. A modified human muscarinic receptor, hM4D, was coexpressed along with humanized renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) selectively in the MD using an adenoassociated virus expression system (AAV2-hM4D-IRES-hrGFP) (Figure 1A). The hM4D receptor is activated solely by a pharmacologically inert compound, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), and not by endogenous acetylcholine or any other neurotransmitter. Upon CNO activation, hM4D hyperpolarizes neurons through a G protein mediated activation of inward-rectifying potassium channels (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Stereotactic injection of AAV2-hM4D-IRES-hrGFP virus into the MD induced coexpression of both GFP (green) and hM4D as assessed by anti-HA immunostaining (red) (Figure 1B). At higher magnification, we observed that the hM4D is localized in the plasma membrane as well as in neuronal processes (Figures 1B and 1D). Costaining with anti-NeuN antibodies revealed that GFP expression was exclusively neuronal (Figure 1C, top panel). Due to the absence of interneurons in rodent MD (Kuroda et al., 1998Kuroda M. Yokofujita J. Murakami K. An ultrastructural study of the neural circuit between the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus.Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 417-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), all infected neurons should be relay projection neurons. Using AAV2.2, an average of 27% ± 6% of the MD neurons expressed the GFP with a peak at 66% ± 9.6% at the site of injection (Figure 1C, bottom panel). The virus spread almost entirely among the anterioposterior axis of the MD whereas it stayed constrained within the dorsoventral and lateromedial axis of the MD (Figure 1C and see Figure S1A available online). Consistent with the known anatomy of the MD (Kuroda et al., 1998Kuroda M. Yokofujita J. Murakami K. An ultrastructural study of the neural circuit between the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus.Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 417-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), infected neurons projected to layers I and III/V of prelimbic and orbitofrontal cortices (Figure 1D). To determine whether activation of hM4D will hyperpolarize thalamic neurons as has been shown for hippocampal neurons (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from thalamic slices. Fluorescently-identified neurons expressing hM4D were significantly hyperpolarized after CNO bath application, while the resting membrane potential of cells infected with a control virus expressing only hrGFP were not (Figure 2A). To determine whether activation of hM4D reduces the activity of MD neurons in vivo, we performed multiple single-unit recordings from the MD of freely moving mice injected with AAV2-hM4D-IRES-hrGFP (MDhM4D mice). For this experiment, mice were exploring a familiar environment, specifically a T-maze to which they had been previously habituated. 63 single units were recorded both after systemic injection of saline and 2 mg/kg CNO. The dose of CNO was chosen based on a previous study reporting high in vivo efficacy at doses between 1 and 5 mg/kg on locomotor activity and stereotypy in a transgenic mouse expressing the hM3Dq receptor within the forebrain (Alexander et al., 2009Alexander G.M. Rogan S.C. Abbas A.I. Armbruster B.N. Pei Y. Allen J.A. Nonneman R.J. Hartmann J. Moy S.S. Nicolelis M.A. et al.Remote control of neuronal activity in transgenic mice expressing evolved G protein-coupled receptors.Neuron. 2009; 63: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). CNO reduced the firing rate of a substantial portion of the MD units (Figures 2B–2D). To quantify this effect, we first calculated the ratio of firing rates after saline and CNO for each unit; the distribution of ratios in the sample was significantly different than that expected by chance (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Figure 2C). We next compared firing rates after saline and CNO injections for each neuron independently. CNO decreased firing rate significantly (p < 0.05 by paired t test) in 30 neurons (48%). In an additional 11 units (17%), CNO increased the firing rate. Using a more stringent Bonferroni correction (p < 0.0008) 16 (25%) and 6 (9.5%) units were inhibited or activated by CNO, respectively. For both analyses neurons with decreased firing rate were overrepresented as a consequence of CNO treatment (Binomial test: p < 0.01, p < 0.05 for Bonferroni-corrected values). Importantly, CNO treatment did not completely silence MD neurons; the neurons with decreased firing rate showed an average decrease of 38.7% ± 5.3%. This decrease in firing rate was not related to changes in locomotor activity or to differences in the isolation of single units (Figures S2A–S2C). The CNO-mediated decrease in firing rate was not observed in wild-type mice that do not express hM4D, demonstrating its dependence on hM4D (Figure 2C, inset). While hyperpolarization of thalamic cells can induce a shift in the firing pattern from a tonic to a bursting mode due to the activation of T-type Ca2+ channels (Jahnsen and Llinás, 1984Jahnsen H. Llinás R. Ionic basis for the electro-responsiveness and oscillatory properties of guinea-pig thalamic neurones in vitro.J. Physiol. 1984; 349: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), we did not observe a significant change in the fraction of burst firing in vivo after CNO injection (Figure S2D). Due to the strong projections of the MD to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Figure 1D), we first tested whether decreasing MD activity affects reversal learning, a cognitive process of executive function that is sensitive to orbitofrontal lesions (Schoenbaum et al., 2002Schoenbaum G. Nugent S.L. Saddoris M.P. Setlow B. Orbitofrontal lesions in rats impair reversal but not acquisition of go, no-go odor discriminations.Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To address reversal learning, we developed an operant-based reversal learning task for the mouse in which lever presses are rewarded in the presence of one visual cue (S+), but not in the presence of another visual cue (S−) (discrimination phase). After mice reached criterion the contingencies were reversed (reversal phase) (Figure 3A). The acquisition of the discrimination phase was not affected by decreasing MD activity (repeated ANOVA p = 0.17) though CNO-treated MDhM4D mice showed a tendency for a delay in learning during the first three days of acquisition (Figure 3B). In contrast, reversal learning was clearly impaired in CNO-treated MDhM4D mice when compared to the three control groups (repeated ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for group comparisons ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01) (Figure 3C). As has been observed for OFC lesions, these deficits were likely due to preservative behavior, as mice with reduced MD activity made significantly more S responses (previously rewarded during the discrimination phase) than the control groups over the seven sessions of the reversal phase (repeated ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for group comparisons ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001) (Figure 3D). This preservative behavior was evident even within the first trials of the first reversal session, in which control mice were able to repress their number of S- responses while CNO-treated MDhM4D mice were not (Figures S3A and S3B). To address working memory, we performed a delayed non-matched to sample (DNMS) T maze task commonly used in rodents (Figure 4A). Deficits in both acquisition and performance of this task have been observed after lesioning or silencing the mPFC in rats and mice (Dias and Aggleton, 2000Dias R. Aggleton J.P. Effects of selective excitotoxic prefrontal lesions on acquisition of nonmatching- and matching-to-place in the T-maze in the rat: differential involvement of the prelimbic-infralimbic and anterior cingulate cortices in providing behavioural flexibility.Eur.

Okada J. Jung M.W. Kim J.J. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus subserve different components of working memory in rats.Learn. Mem. 2008; 15: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similarly, decreasing MD activity with CNO led to a deficit in the acquisition of the task, as CNO-treated MDhM4D mice took longer to reach learning criterion than controls (ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls correction for group comparisons, ∗p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). To determine whether decreasing MD activity also affects working memory performance, a second cohort of hM4D- and GFP-expressing mice was trained without CNO until they reached criterion (Figure S4A). Working memory performance was then tested after CNO or saline treatment at delays ranging from 6 to 120 s. In this cohort the number of animals was underpowered for a statistical comparison of all four groups. Since the three control groups did not differ in their performance (Figure S4B), they were combined for their comparison with CNO-treated MDhM4D mice. CNO-treated MDhM4D mice performed as well as the controls on the shorter delays (6 and 30 s) but showed significantly poorer performance on longer delays (repeated ANOVA group effect, ∗∗p < 0.01) (Figure 4C). The observed deficits were not due to a general attention deficit or deficits in learning the spatial contingencies of the task, as mice with decreased MD activity showed performance comparable to that of control mice in a T maze based spatial reference memory task (Figure 4D). Moreover, we did not observe any general alterations of locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior as assessed in open field and elevated plus maze tests that may interfere with performance in the reversal learning or in the DNMS T-maze task (Figures S4C and S4D). Based on imaging studies reporting deficits in functional connectivity between different areas of the brain in patients, the disconnection theory (Pettersson-Yeo et al., 2011Pettersson-Yeo W. Allen P. Benetti S. McGuire P. Mechelli A. Dysconnectivity in schizophrenia: where are we now?.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2011; 35: 1110-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) posits schizophrenia as a subtle but pernicious syndrome of decreased long-range connectivity. In agreement with this theory, alterations in functional connectivity between MD and PFC have been observed in patients engaged in executive function tasks, including working memory (Minzenberg et al., 2009Minzenberg M.J. Laird A.R. Thelen S. Carter C.S. Glahn D.C. Meta-analysis of 41 functional neuroimaging studies of executive function in schizophrenia.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2009; 66: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar; Mitelman et al., 2005Mitelman S.A. Byne W. Kemether E.M. Hazlett E.A. Buchsbaum M.S. Metabolic disconnection between the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and cortical Brodmann’s areas of the left hemisphere in schizophrenia.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2005; 162: 1733-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether spatial working memory in mice involved MD-PFC synchrony, we recorded neural activity simultaneously in the MD and mPFC of mice performing the T maze DNMS task. If MD-PFC synchrony is involved in working memory, it should specifically be modulated during the choice phase of the DNMS T-Maze task, when the mnemonic requirement is high. For example, recent studies have shown that theta-frequency synchrony between the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and mPFC is modulated by the DNMS task (Jones and Wilson, 2005Jones M.W. Wilson M.A. Theta rhythms coordinate hippocampal-prefrontal interactions in a spatial memory task.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e402Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar; Sigurdsson et al., 2010Sigurdsson T. Stark K.L. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Impaired hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony in a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia.Nature. 2010; 464: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These studies found that phase-locking of PFC units to the theta-frequency component of the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) was enhanced during the choice phase of the DNMS task (which requires working memory) compared to the sample phase (which does not). We therefore examined MD unit phase-locking to mPFC LFPs across multiple frequency ranges in trained animals performing the DNMS T-maze task. In saline treated mice, the phase-locking of MD units to beta frequency (13–30 Hz), but not theta (4–12 Hz) or gamma frequency (40–60 Hz) PFC oscillations, was strengthened in the choice phase (two-tailed paired t test, ∗∗p < 0.01) (Figure 5A) suggesting that MD-PFC synchrony in the beta range is selectively modulated by working memory. Looking at individual units, about half of units (17/40; 42.5%) noticeably increased their phase-locking to mPFC beta oscillations during choice phase while phase-locking did not change or decreased in 18/40 (47.5%) and 4/40 (10%) units, respectively (Figure S5A). Strikingly, the increase in MD-PFC beta synchrony was selectively disrupted in CNO-treated MDhM4D mice (repeated ANOVA, task phase × treatment interaction, #p < 0.05) (Figure 5A). This was observed as well in mice that never received CNO injection prior the recording ruling out that these effects could be due to chronic effects of the drug (Figure S5E). Phase-locking to other frequency ranges was unaffected. Examining individual cells, we observed a significant reduction (Odd ratio = 0.09, p < 0.001) of the percentage of neurons increasing their phase-locking (2/33; 6.1%) and a significant increase (Odd ratio = 5.5, p < 0.01) of the percentage of cells showing no changes (27/33; 81.8%) in CNO-treated mice compared to controls (Figure S5A). The effects of decreasing MD activity on the sample/choice difference in phase-locking was also confirmed using the pairwise phase consistency measure that controls for spike history effects such as bursting (Figure S5F; Vinck et al., 2012Vinck M.

To rule out the possibility that CNO-treatment affected the quality of unit isolation, we confirmed that this disruption in MD-PFC beta synchronization was not due to differences in unit quality (Figures S5B and S5C). To examine the specificity of disrupted communication between the MD and mPFC we also measured synchrony between the MD and the dHPC, a structure that is also important for spatial working memory.

https://openalex.org/W2003176741,"Corticothalamic slow oscillations of neuronal activity determine internal brain states. At least in the cortex, the electrical activity is associated with large neuronal Ca2+ transients. Here we implemented an optogenetic approach to explore causal features of the generation of slow oscillation-associated Ca2+ waves in the in vivo mouse brain. We demonstrate that brief optogenetic stimulation (3–20 ms) of a local group of layer 5 cortical neurons is sufficient for the induction of global brain Ca2+ waves. These Ca2+ waves are evoked in an all-or-none manner, exhibit refractoriness during repetitive stimulation, and propagate over long distances. By local optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that evoked Ca2+ waves initially invade the cortex, followed by a secondary recruitment of the thalamus. Together, our results establish that synchronous activity in a small cluster of layer 5 cortical neurons can initiate a global neuronal wave of activity suited for long-range corticothalamic integration."
https://openalex.org/W2126614737,"Retrograde signals from postsynaptic targets are critical during development and plasticity of synaptic connections. These signals serve to adjust the activity of presynaptic cells according to postsynaptic cell outputs and to maintain synaptic function within a dynamic range. Despite their importance, the mechanisms that trigger the release of retrograde signals and the role of presynaptic cells in this signaling event are unknown. Here we show that a retrograde signal mediated by Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4) is transmitted to the postsynaptic cell through anterograde delivery of Syt4 via exosomes. Thus, by transferring an essential component of retrograde signaling through exosomes, presynaptic cells enable retrograde signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2044404835,"Altered inflammatory cytokine profiles are often observed in individuals suffering from major depression. Recent clinical work reports on elevated IL-6 and decreased IL-10 in depression. Elevated IL-6 has served as a consistent biomarker of depression and IL-10 is proposed to influence depressive behavior through its ability to counterbalance pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Clinical and animal studies suggest a role for IL-10 in modifying depressive behavior. Murine restraint stress (RST) is regularly employed in the study of behavioral and biological symptoms associated with depressive disorders. While responses to acute RST exposure have been widely characterized, few studies have examined the ongoing and longitudinal effects of extended RST and fewer still have examined the lasting impact during the post-stress period. Consistent with clinical data, we report that a protocol of prolonged murine RST produced altered cytokine profiles similar to those observed in major depressive disorder. Parallel to these changes in circulating cytokines, IL-10 mRNA expression was diminished in the cortex and hippocampus throughout the stress period and following cessation of RST. Moreover, chronic RST promoted depressive-like behavior throughout the 28-day stress period and these depressive-like complications were maintained weeks after cessation of RST. Because of the correlation between IL-10 suppression and depressive behavior and because many successful antidepressant therapies yield increases in IL-10, we examined the effects of IL-10 treatment on RST-induced behavioral changes. Behavioral deficits induced by RST were reversed by exogenous administration of recombinant IL-10. This work provides one of the first reports describing the biological and behavioral impact following prolonged RST and, taken together, this study provides details on the correlation between responses to chronic RST and those seen in depressive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2018983025,"Dental decay is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. A variety of factors, including microbial, genetic, immunological, behavioral and environmental, interact to contribute to dental caries onset and development. Previous studies focused on the microbial basis for dental caries have identified species associated with both dental health and disease. The purpose of the current study was to improve our knowledge of the microbial species involved in dental caries and health by performing a comprehensive 16S rDNA profiling of the dental plaque microbiome of both caries-free and caries-active subjects. Analysis of over 50,000 nearly full-length 16S rDNA clones allowed the identification of 1,372 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the dental plaque microbiome. Approximately half of the OTUs were common to both caries-free and caries-active microbiomes and present at similar abundance. The majority of differences in OTU's reflected very low abundance phylotypes. This survey allowed us to define the population structure of the dental plaque microbiome and to identify the microbial signatures associated with dental health and disease. The deep profiling of dental plaque allowed the identification of 87 phylotypes that are over-represented in either caries-free or caries-active subjects. Among these signatures, those associated with dental health outnumbered those associated with dental caries by nearly two-fold. A comparison of this data to other published studies indicate significant heterogeneity in study outcomes and suggest that novel approaches may be required to further define the signatures of dental caries onset and progression."
https://openalex.org/W1997335954,"The effect of temperature on insect biology is well understood under constant temperature conditions, but less so under more natural, fluctuating conditions. A fluctuating temperature profile around a mean of 26°C can alter Aedes aegypti vector competence for dengue viruses as well as numerous life-history traits, however, the effect of fluctuations on mosquitoes at critical thermal limits is unknown.We investigated the effects of large and small daily temperature fluctuations at low (16°C) and high (35-37°C) mean temperatures, after we identified these temperatures as being thresholds for immature development and/or adult reproduction under constant temperature conditions. We found that temperature effects on larval development time, larval survival and adult reproduction depend on the combination of mean temperature and magnitude of fluctuations. Importantly, observed degree-day estimates for mosquito development under fluctuating temperature profiles depart significantly (around 10-20%) from that predicted by constant temperatures of the same mean. At low mean temperatures, fluctuations reduce the thermal energy required to reach pupation relative to constant temperature, whereas at high mean temperatures additional thermal energy is required to complete development. A stage-structured model based on these empirical data predicts that fluctuations can significantly affect the intrinsic growth rate of mosquito populations.Our results indicate that by using constant temperatures, one could under- or over-estimate values for numerous life-history traits compared to more natural field conditions dependent upon the mean temperature. This complexity may in turn reduce the accuracy of population dynamics modeling and downstream applications for mosquito surveillance and disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2005465545,"Cornichon-2 and cornichon-3 (CNIH-2/-3) are AMPA receptor (AMPAR) binding proteins that promote receptor trafficking and markedly slow AMPAR deactivation in heterologous cells, but their role in neurons is unclear. Using CNIH-2 and CNIH-3 conditional knockout mice, we find a profound reduction of AMPAR synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. This deficit is due to the selective loss of surface GluA1-containing AMPARs (GluA1A2 heteromers), leaving a small residual pool of synaptic GluA2A3 heteromers. The kinetics of AMPARs in neurons lacking CNIH-2/-3 are faster than those in WT neurons due to the fast kinetics of GluA2A3 heteromers. The remarkably selective effect of CNIHs on the GluA1 subunit is probably mediated by TARP γ-8, which prevents a functional association of CNIHs with non-GluA1 subunits. These results point to a sophisticated interplay between CNIHs and γ-8 that dictates subunit-specific AMPAR trafficking and the strength and kinetics of synaptic AMPAR-mediated transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2058969167,"A key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) species in the brain, derived from the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. Based on a systems biology study to repurpose drugs for AD, we explore the effect of lansoprazole, and other proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), on Aβ production in AD cellular and animal models. We found that lansoprazole enhances Aβ37, Aβ40 and Aβ42 production and lowers Aβ38 levels on amyloid cell models. Interestingly, acute lansoprazole treatment in wild type and AD transgenic mice promoted higher Aβ40 levels in brain, indicating that lansoprazole may also exacerbate Aβ production in vivo. Overall, our data presents for the first time that PPIs can affect amyloid metabolism, both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2045848640,"The presence of amyloid aggregates of the 42 amino acid peptide of amyloid beta (Aβ42) in the brain is the characteristic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Aβ deposition is also found in muscle fibers of individuals affected by inclusion body myositis (sIBM), a rare muscular degenerative disease affecting people over 50. Both conditions are presently lacking an effective therapeutic treatment. There is increasing evidence to suggest that natural polyphenols may prevent the formation of toxic amyloid aggregates; this applies also to oleuropein aglycone (OLE), the most abundant polyphenol in extra virgin olive oil, previously shown to hinder amylin and Aβ aggregation. Here we evaluated the ability of OLE to interfere with Aβ proteotoxicity in vivo by using the transgenic CL2006 and CL4176 strains of Caenorhabditis elegans, simplified models of AD and of sIBM, which express human Aβ in the cytoplasm of body wall muscle cells. OLE-fed CL2006 worms displayed reduced Aβ plaque deposition, less abundant toxic Aβ oligomers, remarkably decreased paralysis and increased lifespan with respect to untreated animals. A protective effect was also observed in CL4176 worms but only when OLE was administered before the induction of the Aβ transgene expression. These effects were specific, dose-related, and not mediated by the known polyphenolic anti-oxidant activity, suggesting that, in this model organism, OLE interferes with the Aβ aggregation skipping the appearance of toxic species, as already shown in vitro for Aβ42."
https://openalex.org/W2018460596,"Background and Aims Liver stiffness is increasingly used in the non-invasive evaluation of chronic liver diseases. Liver stiffness correlates with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in patients with cirrhosis and holds prognostic value in this population. Hence, accuracy in its measurement is needed. Several factors independent of fibrosis influence liver stiffness, but there is insufficient information on whether meal ingestion modifies liver stiffness in cirrhosis. We investigated the changes in liver stiffness occurring after the ingestion of a liquid standard test meal in this population. Methods In 19 patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices (9 alcoholic, 9 HCV-related, 1 NASH; Child score 6.9±1.8), liver stiffness (transient elastography), portal blood flow (PBF) and hepatic artery blood flow (HABF) (Doppler-Ultrasound) were measured before and 30 minutes after receiving a standard mixed liquid meal. In 10 the HVPG changes were also measured. Results Post-prandial hyperemia was accompanied by a marked increase in liver stiffness (+27±33%; p<0.0001). Changes in liver stiffness did not correlate with PBF changes, but directly correlated with HABF changes (r = 0.658; p = 0.002). After the meal, those patients showing a decrease in HABF (n = 13) had a less marked increase of liver stiffness as compared to patients in whom HABF increased (n = 6; +12±21% vs. +62±29%,p<0.0001). As expected, post-prandial hyperemia was associated with an increase in HVPG (n = 10; +26±13%, p = 0.003), but changes in liver stiffness did not correlate with HVPG changes. Conclusions Liver stiffness increases markedly after a liquid test meal in patients with cirrhosis, suggesting that its measurement should be performed in standardized fasting conditions. The hepatic artery buffer response appears an important factor modulating postprandial changes of liver stiffness. The post-prandial increase in HVPG cannot be predicted by changes in liver stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W1981880937,"Photosynthetic diatoms that live suspended throughout the water column will constantly be swept up and down by vertical mixing. When returned to the photic zone after experiencing longer periods in darkness, mechanisms exist that enable the diatoms both to survive sudden light exposure and immediately utilize the available energy in photosynthesis and growth. We have investigated both the response to prolonged darkness and the re-acclimation to moderate intensity white irradiance (E = 100 µmol m(-2) s(-1)) in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using an integrated approach involving global transcriptional profiling, pigment analyses, imaging and photo-physiological measurements. The responses were studied during continuous white light, after 48 h of dark treatment and after 0.5 h, 6 h, and 24 h of re-exposure to the initial irradiance. The analyses resulted in several intriguing findings. Dark treatment of the cells led to 1) significantly decreased nuclear transcriptional activity, 2) distinct intracellular changes, 3) fixed ratios of the light-harvesting pigments despite a decrease in the total cell pigment pool, and 4) only a minor drop in photosynthetic efficiency (Φ(PSII_max)). Re-introduction of the cells to the initial light conditions revealed 5) distinct expression profiles for nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis and those involved in photoprotection, 6) rapid rise in photosynthetic parameters (α and rETR(max)) within 0.5 h of re-exposure to light despite a very modest de novo synthesis of photosynthetic compounds, and 7) increasingly efficient resonance energy transfer from fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding protein complexes to photosystem II reaction centers during the first 0.5 h, supporting the observations stated in 6). In summary, the results show that despite extensive transcriptional, metabolic and intracellular changes, the ability of cells to perform photosynthesis was kept intact during the length of the experiment. We conclude that P. tricornutum maintains a functional photosynthetic apparatus during dark periods that enables prompt recovery upon re-illumination."
https://openalex.org/W2086317348,"The organization of spinal reflex circuits relies on the specification of distinct classes of proprioceptive sensory neurons (pSN), but the factors that drive such diversity remain unclear. We report here that pSNs supplying distinct skeletal muscles differ in their dependence on the ETS transcription factor Etv1 for their survival and differentiation. The status of Etv1-dependence is linked to the location of proprioceptor muscle targets: pSNs innervating hypaxial and axial muscles depend critically on Etv1 for survival, whereas those innervating certain limb muscles are resistant to Etv1 inactivation. The level of NT3 expression in individual muscles correlates with Etv1-dependence and the loss of pSNs triggered by Etv1 inactivation can be prevented by elevating the level of muscle-derived NT3-revealing a TrkC-activated Etv1-bypass pathway. Our findings support a model in which the specification of aspects of pSN subtype character is controlled by variation in the level of muscle NT3 expression and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2089089781,"PI(3,4,5)P3 is a low-abundance lipid thought to play a role in the regulation of synaptic activity; however, the mechanism remains obscure. We have constructed novel split Venus-based probes and used superresolution imaging to localize PI(3,4,5)P3 at Drosophila larval neuromuscular synapses. We find the lipid in membrane domains at neurotransmitter release sites, where it concentrates with Syntaxin1A, a protein essential for vesicle fusion. Reducing PI(3,4,5)P3 availability disperses Syntaxin1A clusters and increasing PI(3,4,5)P3 levels rescues this defect. In artificial giant unilamellar vesicles, PI(3,4,5)P3 also induces Syntaxin1A domain formation and this clustering, in vitro and in vivo, is dependent on positively charged residues in the Syntaxin1A-juxtamembrane domain. Functionally, reduced PI(3,4,5)P3 causes temperature-sensitive paralysis and reduced neurotransmitter release, a phenotype also seen in animals expressing a Syntaxin1A with a mutated juxtamembrane domain. Thus, our data indicate that PI(3,4,5)P3, based on electrostatic interactions, clusters Syntaxin1A at release sites to regulate neurotransmitter release."

The extent to which these changes alter the properties of individual neurons and the operation of neuronal networks remains unknown. Here, we show that the locomotor-like activity in the isolated neonatal rodent spinal cord reduces the extracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]o) to 0.9 mM and increases the extracellular potassium ([K(+)]o) to 6 mM. Such changes in [Ca(2+)]o and [K(+)]o trigger pacemaker activities in interneurons considered to be part of the locomotor network. Experimental data and a modeling study show that the emergence of pacemaker properties critically involves a [Ca(2+)]o-dependent activation of the persistent sodium current (INaP). These results support a concept for locomotor rhythm generation in which INaP-dependent pacemaker properties in spinal interneurons are switched on and tuned by activity-dependent changes in [Ca(2+)]o and [K(+)]o."

A binocular VF was created from monocular VFs by using the integrated VF (IVF) method. VRQoL score was predicted using the 'Random Forest' method, based on visual acuity (VA) of better and worse eyes (better-eye and worse-eye VA) and total deviation (TD) values from the IVF. For comparison, VRQoL scores were regressed (linear regression) against: (i) mean of TD (IVF MD); (ii) better-eye VA; (iii) worse-eye VA; and (iv) IVF MD and better- and worse-eye VAs. The rank of importance of IVF test points was identified using the Random Forest method.The root mean of squared prediction error associated with the Random Forest method (0.30 to 1.97) was significantly smaller than those with linear regression models (0.34 to 3.38, p<0.05, ten-fold cross validation test). Worse-eye VA was the most important variable in all VRQoL tasks. In general, important VF test points were concentrated along the horizontal meridian. Particular areas of the IVF were important for different tasks: peripheral superior and inferior areas in the left hemifield for the 'letters and sentences' task, peripheral, mid-peripheral and para-central inferior regions for the 'walking' task, the peripheral superior region for the 'going out' task, and a broad scattered area across the IVF for the 'dining' task.The VRQoL prediction model with the Random Forest method enables clinicians to better understand patients' VRQoL based on standard clinical measurements of VA and VF."

However, this has not yet been experimentally proven. In this study, we explored the anatomical and functional architecture of glomerular modules using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Surprisingly, the deep portions of the glomerular modules showed considerable spatial overlap with other modules. Juxtaglomerular cells showed similar excitatory odorant response profiles to presynaptic olfactory sensory neuron inputs. Mitral cells exhibited a more sharply tuned molecular receptive range compared to juxtaglomerular cells, and their odorant response profiles varied depending on their interneuronal horizontal distances. These data suggest that glomerular modules are composed of functionally distinct neurons, and that homogenous odor inputs to each glomerulus may be parsed and processed in different fashions within the modules before being sent to higher olfactory centers."

This study intended to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of Echium plantagineum L. bee pollen to support its claimed health beneficial effects. The hydromethanol extract efficiently scavenged nitric oxide (•NO) although against superoxide (O2•−) it behaved as antioxidant at lower concentrations and as pro-oxidant at higher concentrations. The anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The levels of •NO and L-citrulline decreased for all extract concentrations tested, while the levels of prostaglandins, their metabolites and isoprostanes, evaluated by UPLC-MS, decreased with low extract concentrations. So, E. plantagineum bee pollen extract can exert anti-inflammatory activity by reducing •NO and prostaglandins. The extract is able to scavenge the reactive species •NO and O2•− and reduce markers of oxidative stress in cells at low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2064739762,"A cation channel NCA/UNC-79/UNC-80 affects neuronal activity. We report here the identification of a conserved endoplasmic reticulum protein NLF-1 (NCA localization factor-1) that regulates neuronal excitability and locomotion through the NCA channel. In C. elegans, the loss of either NLF-1 or NCA leads to a reduced sodium leak current, and a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential in premotor interneurons. This results in a decreased premotor interneuron activity that reduces the initiation and sustainability of rhythmic locomotion. NLF-1 promotes axonal localization of all NCA reporters. Its mouse homolog mNLF-1 functionally substitutes for NLF-1 in C. elegans, interacts with the mammalian sodium leak channel NALCN in vitro, and potentiates sodium leak currents in primary cortical neuron cultures. Taken together, an ER protein NLF-1 delivers a sodium leak channel to maintain neuronal excitability and potentiates a premotor interneuron network critical for C. elegans rhythmic locomotion."

The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning and memory performance. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to analyze the hippocampal histopathological damage. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time PCR were used to detect Aβ(1-42), PPARγ, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression in the hippocampus.Injection of soluble Aβ(1-42) into the hippocampus led to significant dysfunction of learning and memory, hippocampal histopathological abnormalities and increased Aβ(1-42) levels in the hippocampus. Rg1 treatment significantly improved learning and memory function, attenuated hippocampal histopathological abnormalities, reduced Aβ(1-42) levels and increased PPARγ and IDE expression in the hippocampus; these effects of Rg1 could be effectively inhibited by GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist.Given that PPARγ can upregulate IDE expression and IDE can degrade Aβ(1-42), these results indicate that Rg1 can increase IDE expression in the hippocampus by upregulating PPARγ, leading to decreased Aβ levels, attenuated hippocampal histopathological abnormalities and improved learning and memory in a rat model of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2015832890,"Chronic inflammation in the stomach induces metaplasia, the pre-cancerous lesion that precedes inflammation-driven neoplastic transformation. While Hedgehog signaling contributes to the initiation of some cancers, its role in gastric transformation remains poorly defined. We found that Helicobacter-infected C57BL/6 mice develop extensive mucous cell metaplasia at 6 month but not at 2 months post-infection. Gastric metaplasia coincided with the appearance of CD45+MHCII+CD11b+CD11c+ myeloid cells that were normally not present in the chronic gastritis at 2 months. The myeloid regulatory gene Schlafen-4 was identified in a microarray analysis comparing infected WT versus Gli1 null mice and was expressed in the CD11b+CD11c+ myeloid population. Moreover this same population expressed IL-1β and TNFα pro-inflammatory cytokines. By 6 months, the mucous neck cell metaplasia (SPEM) expressed IL-6, phosphorylated STAT3 and the proliferative marker Ki67. Expression was not observed in Gli1 mutant mice consistent with the requirement of Gli1 to induce this pre-neoplastic phenotype. Ectopic Shh ligand expression alone was not sufficient to induce SPEM, but with Helicobacter infection synergistically increased the histologic severity observed with the inflammation. Therefore Hedgehog signaling is required, but is not sufficient to generate pre-neoplastic changes during chronic gastritis. Gli1-dependent myeloid cell differentiation plays a pivotal role in the appearance of myeloid cell subtypes ostensibly required for SPEM development. Moreover, it suggests that therapies capable of targeting this phenotypic switch might prevent progression to metaplasia, the pre-neoplastic change that develops prior to dysplasia and gastric cancer, which also occurs in other epithelial-derived neoplasias initiated by chronic inflammation."

However, the way the habitual pattern of breakfast consumption influences body composition and risk of obesity in adolescents is not well defined. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess any associations between breakfast consumption practices and body composition profiles in 236 apparently healthy adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. A self-administered questionnaire on dietary behaviour and lifestyle practices and a dietary food frequency questionnaire were used. Body composition and adiposity indices were determined using standard anthropometric measurement protocols and dual energy χ-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Mean age of the participants was 15.3±1.9 years. The majority of participants (71.2%) fell in the normal body mass index (BMI) ranges. Breakfast consumption patterns showed that only half of the participants (50%) were consuming breakfast daily. Gender-specific multivariate analyses (ANCOVA) showed that in both boys and girls, those eating breakfast at least 5 times a week had significantly lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-scores, waist circumference, body fat mass and percent body fat (%BF) compared to infrequent breakfast eaters, after adjustment for age, household income, pubertal status, eating-out and snacking practices, daily energy intakes, and daily physical activity levels. The present findings indicate that infrequent breakfast consumption is associated with higher body adiposity and abdominal obesity. Therefore, daily breakfast consumption with healthy food choices should be encouraged in growing children and adolescents to prevent adiposity during these critical years of growth."

New genetically encoded indicator to quantify vesicle cycling in intact tissue Schaffer collateral boutons strongly increase endocytic capacity during development Resting pool size is developmentally regulated and scales with synaptic output Mature Schaffer collateral boutons essentially lack a resting pool Information transfer at chemical synapses relies on the availability of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles. Classically, these vesicles have been divided into two major pools (Rizzoli and Betz, 2005Rizzoli S.O. Betz W.J. Synaptic vesicle pools.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar): the recycling pool encompasses all functional vesicles that can be mobilized upon action potential (AP) firing. The release-ready subset of these vesicles can be rapidly exocytosed and supports transmission during sporadic AP firing (Murthy et al., 2001Murthy V.N. Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Zhu Y.

Synaptic vesicle pools.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The second major pool—the so-called resting pool—contains all vesicles that are incapable of AP-evoked exocytosis. Pool definitions are operational; they depend on the measurement procedure. Glutamate released to the synaptic cleft, the most relevant parameter for synaptic function, cannot be compared reliably to the total vesicular glutamate reserve on a single synapse level. As a proxy, staining and destaining of vesicles by lipophilic FM dyes has been used. This method labels vesicles that collapse fully in the bouton membrane and remain exposed to the extracellular space for several seconds, until the membrane patch is recycled by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. If, however, some vesicles release transmitter without full collapse, they are not detectable by FM staining (Harata et al., 2006Harata N.C. Choi S. Pyle J.L. Aravanis A.M. Tsien R.W.

The function of such a large nonreleasable pool is highly controversial. The resting pool could act as a reservoir of vesicles that can be mobilized after periods of synaptic disuse (Kim and Ryan, 2010Kim S.H. Ryan T.A.

Soria van Hoeve J. The calyx of held synapse: from model synapse to auditory relay.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The immature calyx contains a large fraction of nonreleasable vesicles (de Lange et al., 2003de Lange R.P. de Roos A.D. Borst J.G. Two modes of vesicle recycling in the rat calyx of Held.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10164-10173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is unreliable, and shows pronounced short-term depression (Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000Taschenberger H. von Gersdorff H.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9162-9173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After hearing onset (P12–P14), it becomes very reliable and fast, driving the postsynaptic cell at high frequencies (Lorteije et al., 2009Lorteije J.A. Rusu S.I. Kushmerick C. Borst J.G.

At the calyx, this altered short-term plasticity results from changes in synaptic release probability (Pr), vesicle pool sizes, and endocytic capacity (Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007Renden R. von Gersdorff H.

Whether similar developmental changes also take place at much smaller cortical synapses is unclear. Experiments on acute hippocampal and neocortical slices suggested that short-term plasticity and Pr at small synapses develop similar to the calyx (Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1995Bolshakov V.Y.

In dissociated culture, on the other hand, endocytosis has been reported to be stable over time (Armbruster and Ryan, 2011Armbruster M. Ryan T.A. Synaptic vesicle retrieval time is a cell-wide rather than individual-synapse property.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 824-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the vesicle retrieval rate at saturating stimulation intensity (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), that is, endocytic capacity, remains low compared to the mature calyx (Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007Renden R. von Gersdorff H.

Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The total number of vesicles increases during development (Mozhayeva et al., 2002Mozhayeva M.G. Sara Y. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Development of vesicle pools during maturation of hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 654-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unclear if partitioning into functional and nonfunctional pools is also developmentally regulated. We set out to study the maturation of presynaptic function at Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses in slice cultures of rat hippocampus, a preparation that closely recapitulates postnatal development (De Simoni et al., 2003De Simoni A. Griesinger C.B. Edwards F.A. Development of rat CA1 neurones in acute versus organotypic slices: role of experience in synaptic morphology and activity.J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To measure the fraction of released and recycling vesicles, we developed a dual-color release indicator (ratio-sypHy) for use in intact tissue. In immature slice cultures, after 5–7 days in vitro (DIV 5–7), a sizable fraction of vesicles could not be released. In 2–4 week cultures, however, essentially all vesicles were mobilized in response to either high-frequency AP trains or typical CA3 cell place field activity. The rate of vesicle retrieval increased about 7-fold during maturation. Chronic depolarization induced a sizable resting pool at mature SC boutons. Therefore, SC boutons are capable of reducing their output by removing vesicles from the recycling pool, but this homeostatic mechanism seems to be activated only during periods of pathologically high activity. We conclude that synapses in CA1 undergo a pronounced refinement of vesicle use and recycling during early postnatal development. Our indicator is based on a fusion protein of the pH-sensitive GFP variant superecliptic pHluorin (Miesenböck et al., 1998Miesenböck G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin I (sypI), a combination known as sypHy (Granseth et al., 2006Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To create a dual emission indicator suitable for ratiometric two-photon microscopy, we fused the extraluminal C terminus of sypHy with the dimeric red fluorescent protein tdimer2 (ratio-sypHy; Figure 1A). The C-terminal tdimer2-tag faces the cytoplasm, providing a red fluorescence signal proportional to the total amount of ratio-sypHy present at a synapse. Because of the fixed stoichiometry, the green-to-red fluorescence ratio of ratio-sypHy was independent of expression level and depth of the synapse in the tissue and could be compared across cells. To selectively transfect cells in hippocampal slice cultures, we aimed a Helios Gene Gun through an adjustable pinhole centered above CA3. A few days after transfection, we observed red fluorescent somata in CA3 and bright fluorescent puncta in CA1 (Figure 1B). Ratio-sypHy was effectively targeted to boutons, which were 23-fold brighter than the axonal shafts (Figure S1A available online). The probe showed a variable level of surface expression (median fsurf = 0.20, quartile coefficient of variation, QCV: 0.59, n = 922 boutons, 25 slices), which was correlated with its expression level (R2 = 0.43, p = 0.0024, n = 19 cells; Figures S1C and S1D). We stimulated individual ratio-sypHy expressing CA3 pyramidal cells and their axons by current injection in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. To release a sizable fraction of the total recycling pool at both high and low release probability (Pr) synapses, we evoked trains of 200 APs at 30 Hz by brief somatic current injections. This stimulation led to a robust increase in green but not in red fluorescence at individual boutons along single CA3 axons (Figure 1C). Differential bleaching of the red fluorescence by the imaging laser meant that only one ratiometric measurement per bouton could be performed. However, the fixed stoichiometry of green and red fluorescent proteins permitted sequential measurements to be calibrated on a separate set of boutons. To activate green fluorescence in all vesicles for calibration, we neutralized the pH of intracellular compartments by NH4Cl or protonophores (see below) at the end of every experiment (Figures 1A and S1B). We corrected for photobleaching (Figures S1E and S1F), surface-stranded protein (see the Experimental Procedures), and calculated the released fraction (RF), that is, the number of released vesicles divided by the total number of vesicles present at the synapse (Figure 1D). This method of separating release measurements and calibration allowed us to quantify vesicle cycle parameters at a large number of consecutive boutons along individual axons irrespective of their depth in tissue. The large distance between optically recorded boutons and their somata (973 ± 109 μm, n = 12 cells) minimized potential artifacts from whole-cell dialysis. The median RF at mature SC boutons (DIV 14–28) in response to 200 APs was 28.6% ± 3.3% (average of 12 cells). In all cells tested, RFs were variable between individual boutons (average QCV 0.30 ± 0.04; n = 12 cells, 5–90 boutons each) with a distribution skewed toward smaller RFs (Figures 1E and 1F). This high variability was not due to unreliable stimulation or measurement noise because response amplitudes were reproducible for repeated trials (trial-to-trial QCV: 0.12 ± 0.01, n = 12 cells, 3 trials per bouton, 1–5 boutons each). In dissociated culture, neighboring boutons show similar release parameters (Branco et al., 2008Branco T. Staras K. Darcy K.J. Goda Y. Local dendritic activity sets release probability at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2008; 59: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; Murthy et al., 1997Murthy V.N.

Parsons T.D. Balice-Gordon R.J. Determinants of synaptic strength vary across an axon arbor.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 2430-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and RF scales with distance from the soma (Peng et al., 2012Peng X. Parsons T.D. Balice-Gordon R.J. Determinants of synaptic strength vary across an axon arbor.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 2430-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We therefore tested SC boutons for local and global spatial correlations. RFs of directly neighboring boutons were not correlated (Figure 2A) (R2 = 0.06 ± 0.04, n = 7 cells, not different from the correlation between random bouton pairs: R2 = 0.01 ± 0.01, p = 0.46). Imaging conditions were near identical for adjacent boutons; we therefore could gain additional information by comparing absolute fluorescence signals of the two-color channels independently. Total vesicle content (integrated red fluorescence, corrected for surface-stranded protein) and the absolute number of released vesicles (change of integrated green fluorescence) were also not correlated between neighbors (Figure 2B). None of the individual axons showed significant neighborhood correlations (data not shown). Furthermore, RF did not change as a function of distance along the axons (Figures 2C and 2D; average axon length studied: 338 ± 78 μm, range: 107–729 μm; n = 7 cells, 14–89 boutons each). Therefore, in contrast to dissociated culture (Branco et al., 2008Branco T. Staras K. Darcy K.J. Goda Y. Local dendritic activity sets release probability at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2008; 59: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; Murthy et al., 1997Murthy V.N.

Parsons T.D. Balice-Gordon R.J. Determinants of synaptic strength vary across an axon arbor.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 2430-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), mature SC boutons do not display systematic modulation of presynaptic parameters along the axon, locally or globally. Given that multiple synaptic connections between one axon and one dendritic branch are frequently formed in dissociated culture, but not in organotypic culture (Figure S2) or in vivo (Sorra and Harris, 1993Sorra K.E. Harris K.M. Occurrence and three-dimensional structure of multiple synapses between individual radiatum axons and their target pyramidal cells in hippocampal area CA1.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3736-3748PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of neighborhood correlations in organotypic culture is not surprising. SC axons traverse CA1 dendrites perpendicular (Figure S2), an arrangement that prevents retrograde comodulation of neighboring boutons by the same target cell (Branco et al., 2008Branco T. Staras K. Darcy K.J. Goda Y. Local dendritic activity sets release probability at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2008; 59: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Synaptic Pr scales linearly with the number of vesicles docked to the active zone (Branco et al., 2010Branco T. Marra V. Staras K.

Biol. 2010; 172: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar; Murthy et al., 2001Murthy V.N. Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Zhu Y. Inactivity produces increases in neurotransmitter release and synapse size.Neuron. 2001; 32: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). How release scales with the total vesicle number is less clear, given that not all vesicles are thought to be functional (Branco et al., 2010Branco T. Marra V. Staras K. Examining size-strength relationships at hippocampal synapses using an ultrastructural measurement of synaptic release probability.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 172: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taking the integrated red fluorescence of ratio-sypHy as an estimate of total vesicle content (corrected for surface fraction), we were able to compare total vesicle pool size and RF at individual boutons along SC axons (Figure 3). We confirmed (Shepherd and Harris, 1998Shepherd G.M. Harris K.M. Three-dimensional structure and composition of CA3—>CA1 axons in rat hippocampal slices: implications for presynaptic connectivity and compartmentalization.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8300-8310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that total vesicle content is highly variable (average QCV: 0.49 ± 0.02, n = 12 cells). The average RF in response to 200 APs at 30 Hz was nearly constant for the largest quartile (Q75%) of boutons (Figure 3B). The smallest quartile (Q25%), however, released on average an almost 2-fold larger fraction of their vesicles (Q25%/Q75% = 1.8 ± 0.12, p < 0.0001, 74 boutons per quartile, n = 12 cells). Our data suggest that release scales with total vesicle content like bouton surface with bouton volume (i.e., 2/3 power; Figure 3B; also see the Experimental Procedures). Thus, during periods of high activity, small synapses are more prone to deplete their vesicles than large synapses. Part of the heterogeneity in RF (Figures 1E and 1F) can therefore be explained by differences in total vesicle content. To investigate the functional maturation of SC synapses, we recorded responses from boutons in immature slice cultures (DIV 5–7). At this developmental stage, we frequently observed axonal growth cones in stratum radiatum (Figure 4A) but could already see clear AP-induced fluorescence transients in boutons. The decay of the fluorescence transient reflects the combined rates of endocytosis and subsequent vesicular reacidification (Atluri and Ryan, 2006Atluri P.P. Ryan T.A. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle reacidification at hippocampal nerve terminals.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar; Granseth et al., 2006Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In an attempt to separate these two steps, we fit our data with an established model that represents reacidification and endocytosis as two consecutive and irreversible first-order kinetic processes (Granseth et al., 2006Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A good fit, however, was only possible under the assumption of rapid reacidification (τ ∼ 0.5 s; Figures S3C and S3D). Thus, under our conditions (25 mM NaHCO3, 25°C), the speed of endocytosis limited the rate of fluorescence decay (Gandhi and Stevens, 2003Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Three modes of synaptic vesicular recycling revealed by single-vesicle imaging.Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the remainder of the study, to avoid overfitting, we used single exponential fits to estimate the time constant of endocytosis (τ). In immature SC boutons, we found τ = 39.0 ± 8.5 s (n = 6 cells; Figure 4B), more than threefold slower than in mature boutons (τ = 12.1 ± 1.7 s, n = 12 cells). In addition to the slow decay, peak amplitudes of the fluorescence ratio change triggered by 200 APs were small in immature slice culture. The median RF was only half as big as in mature boutons (16.6% ± 3.4% of the total pool, n = 8 cells, p = 0.02; Figure 4C). Together with the low rate of endocytosis, this corresponds to a 7-fold increase in the maximum vesicle retrieval rate approximated as RF/τ (retrieved SVs per second in percent of the total vesicle pool: mature slices RF/τ = 2.8%/s ± 0.4%/s versus immature slices RF/τ = 0.4%/s ± 0.1%/s, p = 0.0008). To test the new indicator in a more established preparation, we also transfected dissociated hippocampal cultures with ratio-sypHy. Even after 2–4 weeks in the incubator, RFs were still significantly lower in this system (p = 0.003) (Figure 4C) and near identical to RFs in immature slice culture (p = 0.68). This corresponds well to the lower number of docked vesicles in dissociated culture (Schikorski and Stevens, 1997Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis of hippocampal excitatory synapses.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytic time constants were also significantly slower compared to mature synapses in tissue (p = 0.023) but not different from immature SC boutons (p = 0.16). The size-dependent"

Our interest is in understanding how human bone marrow stromal-derived cells (MSC) and their relatives, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), interact with their environment through novel receptors. We found, through a proteomics screen, that MSC express the bitter taste receptor, TAS2R46, a protein more typically localized to the taste bud. Expression was also confirmed in VSMCs. A prototypical bitter compound that binds to the bitter taste receptor class, denatonium, increased intracellular calcium release and decreased cAMP levels as well as increased the extracellular release of ATP in human MSC. Denatonium also bound and activated rodent VSMC with a change in morphology upon compound exposure. Finally, rodents given denatonium in vivo had a significant drop in blood pressure indicating a vasodilator response. This is the first description of chemosensory detection by MSC and VSMCs via a taste receptor. These data open a new avenue of research into discovering novel compounds that operate through taste receptors expressed by cells in the marrow and vascular microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W1989695920,"The tumor suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis coli (APC) gene is mutated or lost in most colon cancers. Alterations in Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme expression and aberrant regulation also comprise early events in intestinal carcinomas. Here we show that PKCδ expression levels are decreased in colon tumor cell lines with respect to non-malignant cells. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies revealed that PKCδ interacts specifically with both full-length (from non-malignant cells) and truncated APC protein (from cancerous cells) at the cytoplasm and at the cell nucleus. Selective inhibition of PKCδ in cancer SW480 cells, which do not possess a functional β-catenin destruction complex, did not affect β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. However, in human colon carcinoma RKO cells, which have a normal β-catenin destruction complex, negatively affected β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity, cell proliferation, and the expression of Wnt target genes C-MYC and CYCLIN D1. These negative effects were confirmed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCδ and by the expression of a dominant negative form of PKCδ in RKO cells. Remarkably, the PKCδ stably depleted cells exhibited augmented tumorigenic activity in grafted mice. We show that PKCδ functions in a mechanism that involves regulation of β-catenin degradation, because PKCδ inhibition induces β-catenin stabilization at the cytoplasm and its nuclear presence at the C-MYC enhancer even without Wnt3a stimulation. In addition, expression of a dominant form of PKCδ diminished APC phosphorylation in intact cells, suggesting that PKCδ may modulate canonical Wnt activation negatively through APC phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1966192235,"The present paper describes a method for the identification of intact high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), the quality determining proteins from the wheat storage proteome. The method includes isolation of HMW-GS from wheat flour, further separation of HMW-GS by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and their subsequent molecular identification with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass analyzer. For HMW-GS isolation, wheat proteins were reduced and extracted from flour with 50% 1-propanol containing 1% dithiothreitol. HMW-GS were then selectively precipitated from the protein mixture by adjusting the 1-propanol concentration to 60%. The composition of the precipitated proteins was first evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie staining and RP-HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Besides HMW-GS (≥65%), the isolated proteins mainly contained ω5-gliadins. Secondly, the isolated protein fraction was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Optimal chromatographic separation of HMW-GS from the other proteins in the isolated fraction was obtained when the mobile phase contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as ion-pairing agent. Individual HMW-GS were then identified by determining their molecular masses from the high-resolution mass spectra and comparing these with theoretical masses calculated from amino acid sequences. Using formic acid instead of trifluoroacetic acid in the mobile phase increased protein peak intensities in the base peak mass chromatogram. This allowed the detection of even traces of other wheat proteins than HMW-GS in the isolated fraction, but the chromatographic separation was inferior with a major overlap between the elution ranges of HMW-GS and ω-gliadins. Overall, the described method allows a rapid assessment of wheat quality through the direct determination of the HMW-GS composition and offers a basis for further top-down proteomics of individual HMW-GS and the entire wheat glutenin fraction."

To this purpose, rats and mice were trained on the treadmill for 10 (D10) and 30 (D30) days and tested with exercise to exhaustion, and muscles were used for immunoblotting, RT-PCR, and fiber-type distribution analysis. Taking advantage of the AQP4 KO murine model, functional analysis of AQP4 was performed on dissected muscle fibers and sarcolemma vesicles. Moreover, WT and AQP4 KO mice were subjected to both voluntary and forced activity. Rat fast-twitch muscles showed a twofold increase in AQP4 protein in D10 and D30 rats compared to sedentary rats. Such increase positively correlated with the animal performance, since highest level of AQP4 protein was found in high runner rats. Interestingly, no shift in muscle fiber composition nor an increase in AQP4-positive fibers was found. Furthermore, no changes in AQP4 mRNA after exercise were detected, suggesting that post-translational events are likely to be responsible for AQP4 modulation. Experiments performed on AQP4 KO mice revealed a strong impairment in osmotic responses as well as in forced and voluntary activities compared to WT mice, even though force development amplitude and contractile properties were unvaried. Our findings definitively demonstrate the physiological role of AQP4 in supporting muscle contractile activity and metabolic changes that occur in fast-twitch skeletal muscle during prolonged exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2081303721,"Curcumin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, is known to possess diverse pharmacological properties. There is a scarcity of literature documenting the exact mechanism by which curcumin modulates its biological effects. In the present study, we have used yeast as a model organism to dissect the mechanism underlying the action of curcumin. We found that the yeast mutants of histone proteins and chromatin modifying enzymes were sensitive to curcumin and further supplementation of iron resulted in reversal of the changes induced by curcumin. Additionally, treatment of curcumin caused the iron starvation induced expression of FET3, FRE1 genes. We also demonstrated that curcumin induces degradation of Sml1p, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor involved in regulating dNTPs production. The degradation of Sml1p was mediated through proteasome and vacuole dependent protein degradation pathways. Furthermore, curcumin exerts biological effect by altering global proteome profile without affecting chromatin architecture. These findings suggest that the medicinal properties of curcumin are largely contributed by its cumulative effect of iron starvation and epigenetic modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2093678821,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is a significant cause of degenerative spinal diseases. Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells reportedly fail to survive in large degenerated discs with limited nutrient availability. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanism of the molecular response of NP cells to nutrient deprivation may reveal a new strategy to treat disc degeneration. This study aimed to identify genes related to nutrient deprivation in NP cells on a global scale in an experimental nutrient deprivation model.Rat NP cells were subjected to serum starvation. Global gene expression was profiled by microarray analysis. Confirmation of the selected genes was obtained by real-time polymerase chain reaction array analysis. Western blotting was used to confirm the expression of selected genes. Functional interactions between p21(Cip1) and caspase 3 were examined. Finally, flow cytometric analyses of NP cells were performed. Microarray analysis revealed 2922 differentially expressed probe sets with ≥1.5-fold changes in expression. Serum starvation of NP cells significantly affected the expression of several genes involved in DNA damage checkpoints of the cell cycle, including Atm, Brca1, Cdc25, Gadd45, Hus1, Ppm1D, Rad 9, Tp53, and Cyclin D1. Both p27(Kip1) and p53 protein expression was upregulated in serum-starved cells. p21(Cip1) expression remained in NP cells transfected with short interfering RNA targeting caspase 3 (caspase 3 siRNA). Both G1 arrest and apoptosis induced by serum starvation were inhibited in cells transfected with caspase 3 siRNA.Nutrient deprivation in NP cells results in the activation of a signaling response including DNA damage checkpoint genes regulating the cell cycle. These results provide novel possibilities to improve the success of intervertebral disc regenerative techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2010149098,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, short (18–22 nts), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of mRNAs. While numerous cellular microRNAs have been associated with the progression of various diseases including cancer, miRNAs associated with retroviruses have not been well characterized. Herein we report identification of microRNA-like sequences in coding regions of several HIV-1 genomes. Results Based on our earlier proteomics and bioinformatics studies, we have identified 8 cellular miRNAs that are predicted to bind to the mRNAs of multiple proteins that are dysregulated during HIV-infection of CD4+ T-cells in vitro. In silico analysis of the full length and mature sequences of these 8 miRNAs and comparisons with all the genomic and subgenomic sequences of HIV-1 strains in global databases revealed that the first 18/18 sequences of the mature hsa-miR-195 sequence (including the short seed sequence), matched perfectly (100%), or with one nucleotide mismatch, within the envelope (env) genes of five HIV-1 genomes from Africa. In addition, we have identified 4 other miRNA-like sequences (hsa-miR-30d, hsa-miR-30e, hsa-miR-374a and hsa-miR-424) within the env and the gag-pol encoding regions of several HIV-1 strains, albeit with reduced homology. Mapping of the miRNA-homologues of env within HIV-1 genomes localized these sequence to the functionally significant variable regions of the env glycoprotein gp120 designated V1, V2, V4 and V5. Conclusions We conclude that microRNA-like sequences are embedded within the protein-encoding regions of several HIV-1 genomes. Given that the V1 to V5 regions of HIV-1 envelopes contain specific, well-characterized domains that are critical for immune responses, virus neutralization and disease progression, we propose that the newly discovered miRNA-like sequences within the HIV-1 genomes may have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading innate immune responses and therefore influencing persistence, replication and/or pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2059837941,"The Machiavellian/Social Intelligence Hypothesis proposes that a complex social environment selected for advanced cognitive abilities in vertebrates. In primates it has been proposed that sophisticated social strategies like obtaining suitable coalition partners are an important component of social intelligence. Knowing the rank relationships between group members is a basic requirement for the efficient use of coalitions and the anticipation of counter-coalitions. Experimental evidence for such knowledge currently exists in only few species. Here, we conducted rank reversal playback experiments on adult females belonging to three different groups of free-ranging vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus) to test their knowledge of the female hierarchy. Playbacks simulating rank reversals (subordinate aggressing a dominant) induced longer looking times than playbacks simulating a dominant aggressing a subordinate. Vervet monkey females therefore seem to compute the rank relationships between other females. Our results suggest that detailed social knowledge about rank relationships may be widespread in primates and potentially also in other species living in stable groups."
https://openalex.org/W1986426704,"Background Emotional and interpersonal impairments associated with alcohol-dependence have been recently explored, but the distorted cognitive representations underlying these deficits remain poorly understood. The present study aims at exploring the presence of maladaptive social self-beliefs among alcohol-dependent individuals, as these biased self-beliefs have been recently shown to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of other psychopathological states (social anxiety and depression). Methodology/Principal findings Twenty-five recently detoxified alcohol-dependent participants and 25 matched controls filled in self-report questionnaires evaluating maladaptive social self-beliefs, interpersonal problems and several comorbid states (anxiety, social anxiety, depression). As compared to controls, alcohol-dependent individuals showed higher scores than controls for the three subcategories of maladaptive social self-beliefs (high standards, conditional beliefs and unconditional beliefs). Our key finding was that when comorbidities were controlled for, alcohol-dependence was associated with a specific bias towards exaggerated high standards in social contexts. Moreover, these high standards beliefs were strongly correlated with interpersonal problems. Conclusions/Significance These results provide the first insights into the influence of cognitive biases on interpersonal problems in addictive states, and suggest that maladaptive self-beliefs could have a central influence on the development and maintenance of alcohol-dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2006688720,"Invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections are frequently associated with bacteraemia. To support clinical decisions on antibiotic therapy, there is an urgent need for reliable markers as predictors of infection outcome. In the present study in mice, bacteraemia was established by intravenous inoculation of a clinical S. aureus isolate at the LD50 inoculum. As potential biomarkers for fatal outcome, blood culture (qualitative and quantitative), serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as 31 selected cytokines and chemokines were assessed during the first three days of infection. A positive S. aureus blood culture, the quantitative blood culture, CRP levels, and levels of eight cytokines were indicative for the presence of S. aureus bacteraemia. However, only tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL) 1α, and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC; a functional homologue of human IL-8) were each significantly elevated in eventually non-surviving infected mice versus eventually surviving infected mice. In severe S. aureus bacteraemia in mice, TNF-α, IL-1α, and KC are biomarkers predicting fatal outcome of infection. KC was a biomarker elevated irrespective the progression of infection, which is very interesting regarding clinical application in view of the heterogeneity of patients experiencing bacteraemia in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W2163093032,"The heterotrimeric G-protein complex in Arabidopsis thaliana consists of one α, one ß and three γ subunits. While two of the γ subunits, AGG1 and AGG2 have been shown to provide functional selectivity to the Gßγ dimer in Arabidopsis, it is unclear if such selectivity is embedded in their molecular structures or conferred by the different expression patterns observed in both subunits. In order to study the molecular basis for such selectivity we tested genetic complementation of AGG1- and AGG2 driven by the respectively swapped gene promoters. When expressed in the same tissues as AGG1, AGG2 rescues some agg1 mutant phenotypes such as the hypersensitivity to Fusarium oxysporum and D-mannitol as well as the altered levels of lateral roots, but does not rescue the early flowering phenotype. Similarly, AGG1 when expressed in the same tissues as AGG2 rescues the osmotic stress and lateral-root phenotypes observed in agg2 mutants but failed to rescue the heat-stress induction of flowering. The fact that AGG1 and AGG2 are functionally interchangeable in some pathways implies that, at least for those pathways, signaling specificity resides in the distinctive spatiotemporal expression patterns exhibited by each γ subunit. On the other hand, the lack of complementation for some phenotypes indicates that there are pathways in which signaling specificity is provided by differences in the primary AGG1 and AGG2 amino acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1972804111,"Through the past 60 years, forests, now of various age classes, have been established in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula through nationwide efforts to reestablish forests since the Korean War (1950–53), during which more than 65% of the nation's forest was destroyed. Careful evaluation of long-term changes in vegetation growth after reforestation is one of the essential steps to ensuring sustainable forest management. This study investigated nationwide variations in vegetation phenology using satellite-based growing season estimates for 1982–2008. The start of the growing season calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) agrees reasonably with the ground-observed first flowering date both temporally (correlation coefficient, r = 0.54) and spatially (r = 0.64) at the 95% confidence level. Over the entire 27-year period, South Korea, on average, experienced a lengthening of the growing season of 4.5 days decade−1, perhaps due to recent global warming. The lengthening of the growing season is attributed mostly to delays in the end of the growing season. The retrieved nationwide growing season data were used to compare the spatial variations in forest biomass carbon density with the time-averaged growing season length for 61 forests. Relatively higher forest biomass carbon density was observed over the regions having a longer growing season, especially for the regions dominated by young (<30 year) forests. These results imply that a lengthening of the growing season related to the ongoing global warming may have positive impacts on carbon sequestration, an important aspect of large-scale forest management for sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W2033004121,"Social cognitive mechanisms are central to understanding developmental abnormalities, such as autistic spectrum disorder. Peer relations besides parent-infant or pair-bonding interactions are pivotal social relationships that are especially well developed in humans. Cognition of familiarity forms the basis of peer socialization. Domestic chick (Gallus gallus) studies have contributed to our understanding of the developmental process in sensory-motor cognition but many processes remain unknown. In this report, we used chicks, as they are precocial birds, and we could therefore focus on peer interaction without having to consider parenting. The subject chick behavior towards familiar and unfamiliar reference peers was video-recorded, where the subject and the reference were separated by either an opaque or transparent wall. Spectrogram and behavior correlation analyses based on principal component analysis, revealed that chicks elicited an intermediate contact call and a morphologically different distress call, more frequently towards familiar versus unfamiliar chicks in acoustic only conditions. When both visual and acoustic cues were present, subject chicks exhibited approaching and floor pecking behavior, while eliciting joyful (pleasant) calls, irrespective of whether reference peers were familiar or unfamiliar. Our result showed that chicks recognized familiarity using acoustic cues and expressed cognition through modified distress calls. These finding suggests that peer affiliation may be established by acoustic recognition, independent of visual face recognition, and that eventually, both forms of recognition are integrated, with modulation of acoustic recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2112799145,"Nutrient recycling by consumers in streams can influence ecosystem nutrient availability and the assemblage and growth of photoautotrophs. Stream fishes can play a large role in nutrient recycling, but contributions by other vertebrates to overall recycling rates remain poorly studied. In tributaries of the Pacific Northwest, coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) occur at high densities alongside steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and are top aquatic predators. We surveyed the density and body size distributions of D. tenebrosus and O. mykiss in a California tributary stream, combined with a field study to determine mass-specific excretion rates of ammonium (N) and total dissolved phosphorus (P) for D. tenebrosus. We estimated O. mykiss excretion rates (N, P) by bioenergetics using field-collected data on the nutrient composition of O. mykiss diets from the same system. Despite lower abundance, D. tenebrosus biomass was 2.5 times higher than O. mykiss. Mass-specific excretion summed over 170 m of stream revealed that O. mykiss recycle 1.7 times more N, and 1.2 times more P than D. tenebrosus, and had a higher N:P ratio (8.7) than that of D. tenebrosus (6.0), or the two species combined (7.5). Through simulated trade-offs in biomass, we estimate that shifts from salamander biomass toward fish biomass have the potential to ease nutrient limitation in forested tributary streams. These results suggest that natural and anthropogenic heterogeneity in the relative abundance of these vertebrates and variation in the uptake rates across river networks can affect broad-scale patterns of nutrient limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2032047761,"The aim of this study was to assess the cryoprotective effect of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on human erythrocytes during the slow cooling procedure. Human erythrocytes suspended in 20% glycerol were slowly frozen with a 0.4-T or 0.8-T SMF and then moved to a -80°C freezer for 24 hr. The changes in survival rate, morphology, and metabolites of the thawed erythrocytes were examined. To understand possible cryoprotective mechanisms of SMF, membrane fluidity and dehydration stability of SMF-exposed erythrocytes were tested. For each test, sham-exposed erythrocytes were used as controls. Our results showed that freezing coupled with 0.4-T or 0.8-T SMFs significantly increased the relative survival ratios of the frozen-thawed erythrocytes by 10% and 20% (p<0.001), respectively. The SMFs had no effect on erythrocyte morphology and metabolite levels. However, membrane fluidity of the samples exposed to 0.8-T SMF decreased significantly (p<0.05) in the hydrophobic regions. For the dehydration stability experiments, the samples exposed to 0.8-T SMF exhibited significantly lower (p<0.05) hemolysis. These results demonstrate that a 0.8-T SMF decreases membrane fluidity and enhances erythrocyte membrane stability to resist dehydration damage caused by slow cooling procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2124083993,"The grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans subsp. plorans harbors a very widespread polymorphism for supernumerary (B) chromosomes which appear to have arisen recently. These chromosomes behave as genomic parasites because they are harmful for the individuals carrying them and show meiotic drive in the initial stages of population invasion. The rapid increase in B chromosome frequency at intrapopulation level is thus granted by meiotic drive, but its spread among populations most likely depends on interpopulation gene flow. We analyze here the population genetic structure in 10 natural populations from two regions (in the south and east) of the Iberian Peninsula. The southern populations were coastal whereas the eastern ones were inland populations located at 260–655 m altitude. The analysis of 97 ISSR markers revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations (average GST = 0.129), and the Structure software and AMOVA indicated a significant genetic differentiation between southern and eastern populations. There was also significant isolation by distance (IBD) between populations. Remarkably, these results were roughly similar to those found when only the markers showing low or no dropout were included, suggesting that allelic dropout had negligible effects on population genetic analysis. We conclude that high gene flow helped this parasitic B chromosome to spread through most of the geographical range of the subspecies E. plorans plorans."
https://openalex.org/W2016583946,"The diagnosis of Chagas disease in humans is generally limited to the detection of specific antibodies. Detection of T. cruzi antigens in urine has been reported previously, but is not used in the diagnosis. In this study, soluble T. cruzi antigens and DNA were detected in urine samples and were associated with kidney injury and systemic detection of the parasite. We used 72 guinea pigs infected with T. cruzi Y strain and 18 non-infected guinea pigs. Blood, kidney, heart and urine samples were collected during the acute phase and chronic phase. Urine samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Antigens were detected by Western Blot using a polyclonal antibody against trypomastigote excretory-secretory antigen (TESA). T. cruzi DNA was detected by PCR using primers 121/122 and TcZ1/TcZ2. Levels of T. cruzi DNA in blood, heart and kidney were determined by quantitative PCR. T. cruzi antigens (75 kDa, 80 kDa, 120 kDa, 150 kDa) were detected in the acute phase (67.5%) and the chronic phase (45%). Parasite DNA in urine was detected only in the acute phase (45%). Kidney injury was characterized by high levels of proteinuria, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and urea, and some histopathological changes such as inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis and scarce parasites. The detection of antigens and DNA in urine was associated with the presence of parasite DNA in blood and heart and with high levels of parasite DNA in blood, but not with the presence of parasite in kidney or kidney injury. These results suggest that the detection of T. cruzi in urine could be improved to be a valuable method for the diagnosis of Chagas disease, particularly in congenital Chagas disease and in immunocompromised patients."
https://openalex.org/W1990266236,"Although both glucose deprivation and hypoxia have been reported to promote cascades of biological alterations that lead to induction of inflammatory mediators, we hypothesized that glucose deprivation and hypoxia might show neutral, synergistic or antagonistic effects to each other on gene expression of inflammatory mediators depending on the regulatory components in their promoters. Gene expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) was analyzed by real-time PCR, ELISA, or Western blot. Effects of glucose deprivation and/or hypoxia on activation of signaling pathways were analyzed by time-dependent phosphorylation patterns of signaling molecules. We demonstrate that hypoxia antagonized the effects of glucose deprivation on induction of IL-6 gene expression in microglia, macrophages, and monocytes. Hypoxia also antagonized thapsigargin-induced IL-6 gene expression. Hypoxia enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, and inhibition of Akt was able to reverse the effects of hypoxia on IL-6 gene expression. However, inhibition of HIF-1/2α did not reverse the effects of hypoxia on IL-6 gene expression. In addition, phosphorylation of p38, but not JNK, was responsible for the effects of glucose deprivation on IL-6 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2001584155,"Whereas accumulating evidence indicates that a number of inflammatory genes are induced by activation of nuclear factor-κB and other transcription factors, less is known about genes that are suppressed by proinflammatory stimuli. Here we show that expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is dramatically suppressed both in mRNA and protein levels upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in mouse and human macrophages. In addition to lipopolysaccharide, a Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, stimulation with other Toll-like receptor ligands such as CpG DNA also suppressed Txnip expression. Not only the Toll-like receptor ligands, but also other proinflammatory stimulators, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α elicited the similar response in fibroblasts. Suppression of Txnip by lipopolysaccharide is accompanied by a decrease of the glucose sensing transcription factor MondoA in the nuclei and dissociation of the MondoA:Mlx complex that bound to the carbohydrate-response elements in the Txnip promoter in unstimulated cells. Lipopolysaccharide-mediated decrease of nuclear MondoA was inhibited in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose. Furthermore, blockage of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by iodoacetate alleviated the suppression of Txnip mRNA by lipopolysaccharide, suggesting the involvement of glucose-metabolites in the regulation. Since Txnip is implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism, this observation links between inflammatory responses and metabolic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2019208312,"Mammalian cells require iron to satisfy metabolic needs or to accomplish specialized functions, and DNA viruses, like bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), require an iron-replete host to efficiently replicate, so that iron bioavailability is an important component of viral virulence. Cellular iron metabolism is coordinately controlled by the Iron Regulatory Proteins (IRP1 and IRP2), whose activity is affected by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a current and persistent environmental contaminant. Considering that TCDD enhances BHV-1 replication, herein we analyzed the effects of TCDD on iron metabolism during BHV-1 infection in MDBK cells, and presented evidences of a divergent modulation of IRP1 and IRP2 RNA-binding capacity. Moreover, an up-regulation of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and a concomitant down-regulation of ferritin were observed. This scenario led to an expansion of the labile iron pool (LIP) and induces a significant enhance of viral titer, as confirmed by increased levels of BHV-1 infected cell protein 0 (bICP0), the major transcriptional regulatory protein of BHV-1. Taken together, our data suggest that TCDD increases the free intracellular iron availability thereby promoting the onset of BHV-1 infection and rendering bovine cells more vulnerable to the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2068235636,"The movement of organisms is subject to a multitude of influences of widely varying character: from the bio-mechanics of the individual, over the interaction with the complex environment many animals live in, to evolutionary pressure and energy constraints. As the number of factors is large, it is very hard to build comprehensive movement models. Even when movement patterns in simple environments are analysed, the organisms can display very complex behaviours. While for largely undirected motion or long observation times the dynamics can sometimes be described by isotropic random walks, usually the directional persistence due to a preference to move forward has to be accounted for, e.g., by a correlated random walk. In this paper we generalise these descriptions to a model in terms of stochastic differential equations of Langevin type, which we use to analyse experimental search flight data of foraging bumblebees. Using parameter estimates we discuss the differences and similarities to correlated random walks. From simulations we generate artificial bumblebee trajectories which we use as a validation by comparing the generated ones to the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2151675610,"Chronic sleep loss has been associated with increased daytime sleepiness, as well as impairments in memory and attentional processes. In the present study, we evaluated the neuronal changes of a pre-attentive process of wake auditory sensory gating, measured by brain event-related potential (ERP)--P50 in eight normal sleepers (NS) (habitual total sleep time (TST) 7 h 32 m) vs. eight chronic short sleeping individuals (SS) (habitual TST ≤6 h). To evaluate the effect of sleep extension on sensory gating, the extended sleep condition was performed in chronic short sleeping individuals. Thus, one week of time in bed (6 h 11 m) corresponding to habitual short sleep (hSS), and one week of extended time (∼ 8 h 25 m) in bed corresponding to extended sleep (eSS), were counterbalanced in the SS group. The gating ERP assessment was performed on the last day after each sleep condition week (normal sleep and habitual short and extended sleep), and was separated by one week with habitual total sleep time and monitored by a sleep diary. We found that amplitude of gating was lower in SS group compared to that in NS group (0.3 µV vs. 1.2 µV, at Cz electrode respectively). The results of the group × laterality interaction showed that the reduction of gating amplitude in the SS group was due to lower amplitude over the left hemisphere and central-midline sites relative to that in the NS group. After sleep extension the amplitude of gating increased in chronic short sleeping individuals relative to their habitual short sleep condition. The sleep condition × frontality interaction analysis confirmed that sleep extension significantly increased the amplitude of gating over frontal and central brain areas compared to parietal brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2019558660,"The parasubiculum (PaS) is a component of the hippocampal formation that sends its major output to layer II of the entorhinal cortex. The PaS receives strong cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is likely to modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to theta-frequency network activity. The present study used whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings to determine the effects of cholinergic receptor activation on layer II PaS neurons. Bath application of carbachol (CCh; 10-50 µM) resulted in a dose-dependent depolarization of morphologically-identified layer II stellate and pyramidal cells that was not prevented by blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 µM), but not the M2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1 µM), blocked the depolarization, suggesting that it is dependent on M1 receptors. Voltage-clamp experiments using ramped voltage commands showed that CCh resulted in the gradual development of an inward current that was partially blocked by concurrent application of the selective Kv7.2/3 channel antagonist XE-991, which inhibits the muscarine-dependent K(+) current I M. The remaining inward current also reversed near EK and was inhibited by the K(+) channel blocker Ba(2+), suggesting that M1 receptor activation attenuates both I M as well as an additional K(+) current. The additional K(+) current showed rectification at depolarized voltages, similar to K(+) conductances mediated by Kir 2.3 channels. The cholinergic depolarization of layer II PaS neurons therefore appears to occur through M1-mediated effects on I M as well as an additional K(+) conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2067774414,"Background Treatment as prevention is a paradigm in HIV medicine which describes the public health benefit of antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is based on research showing substantial reductions in the risk of HIV transmission in persons with optimally suppressed HIV-1 Viral Loads (VL). The present study describes ten year VL trends at the national HIV treatment unit and estimates VL suppression at a population level in Barbados, a Caribbean island with a population of 277,000, an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.2%, and served by a single treatment unit. Methods The national HIV treatment centre of the Barbados Ministry of Health has a client VL database extending back to inception of the clinic in 2002 (n = 1,462 clients, n = 17,067 VL measurements). Optimal VL suppression was defined at a threshold value of ≤200 viral copies/mL. Results Analysis of VL trends showed a statistically significant improvement in VL suppression between 2002 to 2011, from 33.6% of clients achieving the 200 copies/mL threshold in 2002 to 70.3% in 2011 (P<0.001). Taking into account the proportion of clients alive and in care and on ART, the known diagnosed HIV population in Barbados, and estimates of unknown HIV infections, this translates into an estimated 26.2% VL suppression at a population level at the end of 2010. Conclusions We have demonstrated a significant trend towards optimal VL suppression in clients utilizing the services of the national HIV treatment program in Barbados over a 10-year period. Estimates of VL suppression at a population level are similar to reports in developed countries that applied similar methodologies and this could suggest a public health benefit of ART in minimizing the risk of sexual transmission of HIV. Continued efforts are warranted to extend HIV testing to hidden populations in Barbados and linking infected persons to care earlier in their disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033490568,"Recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are known to safely and efficiently transduce the retina. Among the various AAV serotypes available, AAV2/5 and 2/8 are the most effective for gene transfer to photoreceptors (PR), which are the most relevant targets for gene therapy of inherited retinal degenerations. However, the search for novel AAV serotypes with improved PR transduction is ongoing. In this work we tested vectors derived from five AAV serotypes isolated from porcine tissues (referred to as porcine AAVs, four of which are newly identified) for their ability to transduce both the murine and the cone-enriched pig retina. Porcine AAV vectors expressing EGFP under the control of the CMV promoter were injected subretinally either in C57BL/6 mice or Large White pigs. The resulting retinal tropism was analyzed one month later on histological sections, while levels of PR transduction were assessed by Western blot. Our results show that all porcine AAV transduce murine and porcine retinal pigment epithelium and PR upon subretinal administration. AAV2/po1 and 2/po5 are the most efficient porcine AAVs for murine PR transduction and exhibit the strongest tropism for pig cone PR. The levels of PR transduction obtained with AAV2/po1 and 2/po5 are similar, albeit not superior, to those obtained with AAV2/5 and AAV2/8, which evinces AAV2/po1 and 2/po5 to be promising vectors for retinal gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1969697654,"Progress in personalised psychiatry is dependent on researchers having access to systematic and accurately acquired symptom data across clinical diagnoses. We have developed a structured psychiatric assessment tool, OPCRIT+, that is being introduced into the electronic medical records system of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust which can help to achieve this. In this report we examine the utility of the symptom data being collected with the tool. Cross-sectional mental state data from a mixed-diagnostic cohort of 876 inpatients was subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA). Six components, explaining 46% of the variance in recorded symptoms, were extracted. The components represented dimensions of mania, depression, positive symptoms, anxiety, negative symptoms and disorganization. As indicated by component scores, different clinical diagnoses demonstrated distinct symptom profiles characterized by wide-ranging levels of severity. When comparing the predictive value of symptoms against diagnosis for a variety of clinical outcome measures (e.g. 'Overactive, aggressive behaviour'), symptoms proved superior in five instances (R(2) range: 0.06-0.28) whereas diagnosis was best just once (R(2):0.25). This report demonstrates that symptom data being routinely gathered in an NHS trust, when documented on the appropriate tool, have considerable potential for onward use in a variety of clinical and research applications via representation as dimensions of psychopathology."

As an adhesion molecular of I-type lectins, Siglec-1 is highly expressed on circulating monocytes and plaque macrophages of atherosclerotic patients, but the exact role of Siglec-1 has not been elucidated. Methods In this study, oxLDL was used to stimulate Siglec-1 and some oxLDL receptors (SR-BI, CD64, CD32B, LOX-1 and TLR-4) expression on bone marrow-derived macrophages, whereas small interfering RNA was used to down-regulate Siglec-1. Meanwhile, an ELISA-based assay for Siglec-1-oxLDL interaction was performed, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to determine the role of Siglec-1 in oxLDL uptake by macrophages. Results We found that oxLDL could up-regulate the expression of various potential oxLDL receptors, including Siglec-1, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, down-regulation of Siglec-1 could attenuate oxLDL uptake by Oil red O staining. LSCM revealed that Siglec-1 and CD64/SR-BI may colocalize on oxLDL-stimulated macrophage surface, whereas co-IP showed that Siglec-1 and SR-BI can be immunoprecipitated by each other. However, no direct interaction between Siglec-1 and oxLDL was found in the in vitro protein interaction system. Conclusions Thus, Siglec-1 can interact with SR-BI in the phagocytosis of oxLDL by macrophages, rather than act as an independent receptor for oxLDL."
https://openalex.org/W2016100280,"Members of social groups face a trade-off between investing selfish effort for themselves and investing cooperative effort to produce a shared group resource. Many group resources are shared equitably: they may be intrinsically non-excludable public goods, such as vigilance against predators, or so large that there is little cost to sharing, such as cooperatively hunted big game. However, group members' personal resources, such as food hunted individually, may be monopolizable. In such cases, an individual may benefit by investing effort in taking others' personal resources, and in defending one's own resources against others. We use a game theoretic ""tug-of-war"" model to predict that when such competition over personal resources is possible, players will contribute more towards a group resource, and also obtain higher payoffs from doing so. We test and find support for these predictions in two laboratory economic games with humans, comparing people's investment decisions in games with and without the options to compete over personal resources or invest in a group resource. Our results help explain why people cooperatively contribute to group resources, suggest how a tragedy of the commons may be avoided, and highlight unifying features in the evolution of cooperation and competition in human and non-human societies."
