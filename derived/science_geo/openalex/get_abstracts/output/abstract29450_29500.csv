https://openalex.org/W2077674356,"Two questions concerning the effect of physical abuse in early childhood on the child's development of aggressive behavior are the focus of this article. The first is whether abuse per se has deleterious effects. In earlier studies, in which samples were nonrepresentative and family ecological factors (such as poverty, marital violence, and family instability) and child biological variables (such as early health problems and temperament) were ignored, findings have been ambiguous. Results from a prospective study of a representative sample of 309 children indicated that physical abuse is indeed a risk factor for later aggressive behavior even when the other ecological and biological factors are known. The second question concerns the processes by which antisocial development occurs in abused children. Abused children tended to acquire deviant patterns of processing social information, and these may mediate the development of aggressive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2010648543,"Within the framework of neo-Darwinism, with its focus on fitness, it has been hard to account for altruism behavior that reduces the fitness of the altruist but increases average fitness in society. Many population biologists argue that, except for altruism to close relatives, human behavior that appears to be altruistic amounts to reciprocal altruism, behavior undertaken with an expectation of reciprocation, hence incurring no net cost to fitness. Herein is proposed a simple and robust mechanism, based on human docility and bounded rationality that can account for the evolutionary success of genuinely altruistic behavior. Because docility-receptivity to social influence-contributes greatly to fitness in the human species, it will be positively selected. As a consequence, society can impose a ""tax"" on the gross benefits gained by individuals from docility by inducing docile individuals to engage in altruistic behaviors. Limits on rationality in the face of environmental complexity prevent the individual from avoiding this ""tax."" An upper bound is imposed on altruism by the condition that there must remain a net fitness advantage for docile behavior after the cost to the individual of altruism has been deducted."

The host provided an overall hydrophobic binding site, but one that could recognize the positive charge of the quaternary ammonium group of ACh through a stabilizing interaction with the electron-rich pi systems of the aromatic rings (cation-pi interaction). Similar interactions may be involved in biological recognition of ACh and other choline derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2033158324,"Rewarding properties of psychostimulants result from reduced uptake and/or increased release of dopamine at mesolimbic synapses. As exemplified by cocaine, many psychostimulants act by binding to the dopamine uptake transporter. However, this does not explain the action of other psychostimulants, including amphetamine. As most psychostimulants are weak bases and dopamine uptake into synaptic vesicles uses an interior-acidic pH gradient, we examined the possibility that psychostimulants might inhibit acidification. Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of amphetamine as well as cocaine and phencyclidine rapidly reduced pH gradients in cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons. To examine direct effects on vesicles, we used chromaffin granules. The three psychostimulants, as well as fenfluramine, imipramine, and tyramine, reduced the pH gradient, resulting in reduced uptake and increased release of neurotransmitter. Inhibition of acidification by psychoactive amines contributes to their pharmacology and may provide a principal molecular mechanism of action of amphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W1990431872,"Human growth hormone (hGH) elicits a diverse set of biological activities including lactation that derives from binding to the prolactin (PRL) receptor. The binding affinity of hGH for the extracellular binding domain of the hPRL receptor (hPRLbp) was increased about 8000-fold by addition of 50 micromolar ZnCl2. Zinc was not required for binding of hGH to the hGH binding protein (hGHbp) or for binding of hPRL to the hPRLbp. Other divalent metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) at physiological concentrations did not support such strong binding. Scatchard analysis indicated a stoichiometry of one Zn2+ per hGH.hPRLbp complex. Mutational analysis showed that a cluster of three residues (His18, His21, and Glu174) in hGH and His188 from the hPRLbp (conserved in all PRL receptors but not GH receptors) are probable Zn2+ ligands. This polypeptide hormone.receptor ""zinc sandwich"" provides a molecular mechanism to explain why nonprimate GHs are not lactogenic and offers a molecular link between zinc deficiency and its association with altered functions of hGH."
https://openalex.org/W2085383734,"The liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein DBP accumulates in hepatocytes of adult rats according to a strictly controlled circadian rhythm. DBP is not detectable in liver nuclei during the morning hours. Its level raises sharply during the afternoon and reaches a maximum at about 8 p.m. During the night the cellular DBP concentration decreases below detectability. This oscillation is ""free running,"" transcriptionally regulated, and may be under the negative control of glucocorticoid hormones. In keeping with the rhythmicity of DBP accumulation, the albumin gene, a putative target of DBP, is transcribed more efficiently in the evening than in the morning."
https://openalex.org/W1511792975,"The recently-described p59 protein has been shown to be associated with untransformed steroid receptors present in rabbit uterus and rat liver cytosols (Tai, P. K., Maeda, Y., Nakao, K., Wakim, N. G., Duhring, J. L., and Faber, L. E. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5269-5275; Renoir, J.-M., Radanyi, C., Faber, L. E., and Baulieu, E.-E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10740-10745), while a smaller version of this protein (p56) interacts with glucocorticoid receptors in human IM-9 cell cytosols (Sanchez, E. R., Faber, L. E., Henzel, W. J., and Pratt, W. B. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 5145-5152). In addition to interacting with glucocorticoid receptors, the p56 protein of IM-9 cell cytosol is also found as part of a large heteromeric complex that contains both the 70-kDa and 90-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90, respectively). Given this association of p56 with the two major stress proteins, I have speculated that p56 may itself be a heat shock protein. In this paper, the effect of heat stress on the rate of synthesis of p56 is determined. Intact IM-9 cells were exposed to 37 or 43 degrees C for 4 h, followed by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine. Analysis of whole cytosolic extracts by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography reveal an increased rate of radiolabeling for hsp70, hsp90, hsp100, ad hsp110, but no heat-inducible protein of smaller relative molecular mass is detected. However, immune-purification of p56 from normal and heat-stressed cytosols with the EC1 monoclonal antibody results in the presence of a 56-kDa protein that exhibits an increased rate of synthesis in response to heat stress. The results of two-dimensional gel Western blots employing the EC1 antibody demonstrate that this heat-inducible protein is indeed the EC1-reactive p56 protein and that the induction effect is not due to unequal yields of p56 during immune-purification. Heat stress has no effect on the composition of the p56.hsp.70.hsp90 complex, except that the complex derived from heat shocked-cells contains both the constitutive and heat-inducible forms of hsp70. Induction of p56 also occurs in IM-9 cells subjected to chemical stress (sodium arsenite). It is proposed that p56 is a steroid receptor-associated heat shock protein which can now be termed hsp56. Like hsp90, hsp56 likely serves in some vital cellular role apart from any specific function it provides in steroid receptor action."
https://openalex.org/W2094208631,"Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant (""peak E""). Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde. Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]. This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent."
https://openalex.org/W1987026072,"The chemotaxis signal transduction pathway allows bacteria to respond to changes in concentration of specific chemicals (ligands) by modulating their swimming behavior. The pathway includes ligand binding receptors, and the CheA, CheY, CheW, and CheZ proteins. We showed previously that phosphorylation of CheY is activated in reactions containing receptor, CheW, CheA, and CheY. Here we demonstrate that this activation signal results from accelerated autophosphorylation of the CheA kinase. Evidence for a second signal transmitted by a ligand-bound receptor, which corresponds to inhibition of CheA autophosphorylation, is also presented. We postulate that CheA can exist in three forms: a ""closed"" form in the absence of receptor and CheW; an ""open"" form that results from activation of CheA by receptor and CheW; and a ""sequestered"" form in reactions containing ligand-bound receptor and CheW. The system's dynamics depends on the relative distribution of CheA among these three forms at any time."
https://openalex.org/W2032866646,"Transient transfection into L8 myoblasts has been used to study the rat alpha-actin gene promoter. Demodification of specific sites occurs in two stages, with a hemimethylated intermediate formed within a few hours after entry of the alpha-actin gene construct into the cell. The removal of the methyl moiety from the complementary strand takes place after a delay of at least 48 hr, and both events are actively carried out in the absence of DNA replication. By assaying gene activity during the course of the transfection, it was possible to demonstrate that demethylation of both strands at the critical CpG loci is essential to activate transcription. Genetic analysis revealed the existence of cis-acting elements required for demethylation. The recognition of these sites early in the differentiation process probably leads to the demodification events required to make the gene accessible to its transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2103334091,"Muscle dystrophin mRNAs from Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) patients with internal deletion of the DMD gene were quantitated and sequenced. In all cases (eight DMD and three BMD), truncated mature transcripts were found, and their amount was correlated to the clinical phenotype and to the reading frame. We focused on four cases that were apparently not in agreement with the reading frame rule. In two DMD cases, slightly reduced amounts of in-frame truncated mRNA are present but no dystrophin is detected, suggesting impaired translation and/or instability of the protein. In two BMD patients with out-of-frame deletions, the presence of minor in-frame alternatively spliced mRNA species is congruent with the observed truncated dystrophin and the mild phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2026973552,"Chick myelomonocytic cells transformed by the v-myb oncogene-containing viruses E26 and AMV differ in that the former resemble myeloblasts and express the v-myb-regulated granulocyte-specific mim-1 gene, while the latter resemble monoblasts and are mim-1 negative. We constructed a series of AMV-E26 chimeras and localized the critical differences between these viruses to three point mutations within the second repeat of the v-myb DNA binding domain. These three positions are altered in the v-myb protein of AMV relative to the proteins encoded by c-myb or E26 v-myb. Back mutating AMV v-myb at any of these three sites restored the oncogene's ability to activate the mim-1 gene. Surprisingly, two of these changes led to the transformation, in vitro and in vivo, of cells having a promyelocyte-like phenotype. These results indicate that different forms of v-myb impose alternate phenotypes of differentiation on transformed myeloid cells, probably by regulating unique sets of differentiation-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W2031174462,"Hepatitis B virus (HVB) is the prototype member of the hepadnaviridae, a family of small enveloped DNA viruses that replicate by reverse transcription. Assembly of replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids is based on specific interactions between the core protein, the product(s) of the P gene, and the RNA pregenome, which is marked for encapsidation by containing a sequence near its 5' end that acts in cis as an encapsidation signal. However, HBV produces several additional, almost identical, genomic transcripts that also bear the encapsidation sequence, but that are not encapsidated. The mechanism underlying this selection process has remained mysterious. Here we demonstrate that translating 80S ribosomes (but not scanning 40S ribosomal subunits) advancing into the encapsidation signal prevent its functioning. This finding reveals translational modulation of RNA function as a further regulatory mechanism employed by hepadnaviruses to utilize efficiently the restricted coding capacity of their extremely compact genome."
https://openalex.org/W1510367374,"We have investigated the vacuolar delivery of alpha-mannosidase, a marker enzyme of the vacuolar membrane in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found that the enzyme has several unique characteristics in its biosynthesis and vacuolar delivery. alpha-Mannosidase has no typical signal sequence (Yoshihisa, T., and Anraku, Y. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 163, 908-915) but is located on the inner surface of the vacuolar membrane. The enzyme is synthesized as a 107-kDa polypeptide and converted to a 73-kDa polypeptide. Although the conversion depends on a vacuolar processing protease, proteinase A, it is much slower (t1/2 = 10 h) than the proteinase A-dependent processing of other vacuolar proteins. None of Asn-X-Thr/Ser sites on the 107-kDa alpha-mannosidase or on two alpha-mannosidase-invertase fusion proteins that are localized inside the vacuole receives N-linked oligosaccharide, whereas those sites on a carboxypeptidase Y-alpha-mannosidase fusion protein are N-glycosylated. The newly synthesized alpha-mannosidase is normally delivered to the vacuole and converted to the 73-kDa polypeptide even when the secretory pathway is blocked by a subset of sec mutations. These characteristics are different from those of other vacuolar proteins targeted to the vacuole via the secretory pathway. We conclude that alpha-mannosidase is delivered to the vacuole in a novel pathway separate from the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1499692647,"Recently a new growth factor was purified to homogeneity, and its bioactivity seemed to be restricted to vascular endothelial derived cells. As it was also angiogenic in vivo, it was provisionally named vasculotropin (VAS). As an iodination procedure used to label VAS did not damage the molecule, it was possible to undertake binding studies. The binding of iodinated vasculotropin to bovine adrenal cortex-derived capillary endothelial cells was saturable at 250 pM, and half-maximal binding occurred at 47 pM. Scatchard's analysis of the data demonstrated two apparent classes of binding sites with apparent dissociation constants of 2 and 82 pM displaying 280 and 3400 binding sites, respectively. The binding was specific; half-displacement was observed with a 2-fold excess of unlabeled VAS. The structurally related platelet-derived growth factor did not compete in a radioreceptor assay. 125I-VAS was displaced by suramin and not by heparin. 125I-VAS was covalently cross-linked to its cell surface receptor on intact bovine adrenal cortex-derived capillary endothelial cells using the homobifunctional agents ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) or disuccinimidyl tartarate. A major macromolecular species with an apparent molecular mass of 230,000 Da was labeled under reducing and nonreducing conditions. These data demonstrate the existence of a specific binding protein for VAS and an estimation of the size at 185,000 Da."
https://openalex.org/W2022059833,"Previous studies have emphasized that genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is rare and is expressed primarily as premenopausal breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or both. Proliferative breast disease (PBD) is a significant risk factor for the development of breast cancer and appears to be a precursor lesion. PBD and breast cancer were studied in 103 women from 20 kindreds that were selected for the presence of two first degree relatives with breast cancer and in 31 control women. Physical examination, screening mammography, and four-quadrant fine-needle breast aspirates were performed. Cytologic analysis of breast aspirates revealed PBD in 35% of clinically normal female first degree relatives of breast cancer cases and in 13% of controls. Genetic analysis suggests that genetic susceptibility causes both PBD and breast cancer in these kindreds. This study supports the hypothesis that this susceptibility is responsible for a considerable portion of breast cancer, including unilateral and postmenopausal breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1592830109,"Gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase catalyzes the oxygenolytic ring cleavage of gentisate (2,5-dihydroxybenzoate) between carbons 1 and 2 to form maleylpyruvate. The essential active site Fe2+ of the enzyme binds NO to yield an EPR-active (S = 3/2) complex. Hyperfine broadening from 17O (I = 5/2) is observed in the spectrum of the enzyme-nitrosyl complex prepared in 17O-enriched water, demonstrating that water is an iron ligand. Association of gentisate with the enzyme-nitrosyl complex causes the broadening due to [17O]water to disappear, suggesting that water is displaced. Hyperfine broadening of the EPR spectrum for the gentisate-bound complex is observed when 17O is incorporated into either the carbon 1 carboxylate or carbon 2 hydroxyl substituents of gentisate, but not when it is placed in the carbon 5 hydroxyl substituent. Thus, substrate apparently binds directly to the iron through the carbon 1 carboxylate and carbon 2 hydroxyl substituents, thereby bringing the site of ring cleavage close to the active site iron. Since NO must bind to the iron to elicit an EPR signal, a total of three sites in the iron coordination appear to be available for exogenous ligands. The role of the substrate functional groups in catalysis is investigated through comparison of the reaction kinetics of gentisate analogs using the gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases isolated from Pseudomonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas testosteroni. Turnover is either eliminated or substantially reduced on replacement of any of the functional groups of gentisate. Furthermore, an electron-donating group that can tautomerize (hydroxyl or amine) is required in a ring position either ortho or para to the carbon 2 substituent for turnover. The best alternate substrate of this group is 5-aminosalicylate, which is turned over at approximately 7% of the rate of gentisate by the enzyme from P. testosteroni. Both atoms from O2 are shown to be incorporated into the product of 5-aminosalicylate turnover. This is the first direct demonstration of dioxygenase stoichiometry in the reaction of any ferrous, non-heme, aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase. It is proposed that the enzyme-catalyzed O2 attack on the aromatic ring of gentisate is initiated from a complex in which O2 and substrate are simultaneously coordinated to the active site iron. Subsequent dioxygen bond cleavage and insertion are proposed to be promoted by a resonance shift involving ketonization of the carbon 5 hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1494606787,"In humans, apolipoprotein (apo) B48 is synthesized in the intestine as an obligatory constituent of chylomicrons. Apolipoprotein B48 is identical to the amino-terminal 2152 amino acids (240 kDa) of apoB100 and is translated from an edited apoB mRNA in which codon 2153 has been converted from glutamine (CAA) to what is recognized as a premature stop codon (UAA). To determine whether the apoB mRNA editing in fact converts cytosine 6666 in codon 2153 to uracil, we incubated a synthetic apoB RNA containing 32P-labeled cytosines in an in vitro editing system prepared from rabbit enterocytes. The in vitro edited RNA was purified and digested to nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, which were analyzed on two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. We found that the edited base co-migrated with authentic uridine 5'-monophosphate. Thus, cytosine 6666 is converted to uracil, most likely by a nucleotide-specific cytosine deaminase. To determine whether apoB mRNA editing occurs in cell lines that do not synthesize apoB, we stably transfected a high expression vector containing 354 base pairs of apoB sequence into 18 different cell lines. We found apoB mRNA editing activity in five osteosarcoma cell lines and one epidermoid cell line, none of which synthesizes any detectable apoB. Thus, apoB mRNA editing occurs in cell lines that do not synthesize apoB, which suggests that mRNA editing may be a common biological phenomenon in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020130139,"The tra-1 gene plays a central role in C. elegans sex determination. XX animals develop as hermaphrodites when tra-1 is active and as males when it is not. By analyzing a large number of tra-1 genetic mosaics we have shown that, with the expected exception of vulval induction by the hermaphrodite gonad, tra-1 functions cell-autonomously, consistent with a role as an intracellular component of a signaling pathway. Moreover, all the sexual differentiation genes under tra-1 control must also function cell-autonomously. Our results have additional implications for several aspects of postembryonic development, including mechanisms of sex-specific directed cell migrations and the question of an organizer in the male tail."
https://openalex.org/W1560062497,"A protein composed of the external domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is secreted by A431 human tumor cells. The soluble receptor protein was isolated in bulk quantities from cell culture supernatants. It has an intact ligand binding site, exists in a 93-kDa monomeric form, and does not undergo oligomerization upon ligand binding; thus the receptor dimerization reported for the EGF holoreceptor appears not to be a function of its external domain. The unique system of a physiological soluble receptor was utilized for a crystallization study. Crystals were obtained but only in the presence of the ligand. They contained (in equimolar amounts) receptor as well as EGF. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P4(3)2(1)2 or P4(1)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 118 A, c = 202 A. The packing density parameter was 3.55 A3/dalton, indicating the asymmetric unit to consist of one receptor-ligand complex."
https://openalex.org/W1563724581,"Two recently identified structural elements important for glycosaminoglycan-mediated activation of human leuserpin-2 (hLS2) were investigated in detail by functional analysis of variants secreted by transiently transfected COS cells. Highly specific requirements with respect to the nature of the involved amino acids as well as to their spatial arrangements were found to be crucial for efficient activation of hLS2 by dermatan sulfate. In contrast, binding and activation of hLS2 by heparin seem to be determined mainly by the positive charge density of the involved inhibitor segment. A dimeric repeat enriched in acidic amino acids turned out to exert a dual role with respect to structure and function of hLS2. First, in the absence of functional activators the negatively charged dimer interacts intramolecularly with the glycosaminoglycan-binding site. Second, the acidic dimer is instrumental in glycosaminoglycan-mediated activation of hLS2. The monomers constituting the acidic dimer are functionally not equivalent."

This evidence indicates that this species may serve as an arbovirus vector in the United States. The urban-suburban distribution, aggressive biting behavior, and broad viral susceptibility of Ae. albopictus may lead to the transmission of viruses of known public health importance and perhaps of viruses hitherto not transmitted to humans because of the feeding pattern of their usual vectors."
https://openalex.org/W1529675618,"The native architectures of the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes have been investigated by cryoelectron microscopy of unstained, frozen-hydrated specimens. In pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex the transacylase (E2) components exist as 24-subunit, cube-shaped assemblies that form the structural cores of the complexes. Multiple copies (12-24) of the alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (E1) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) components bind to the surface of the cores. Images of the frozen-hydrated enzyme complexes do not appear consistent with a symmetric arrangement of the E1 and E3 subunits about the octahedrally symmetric E2 core. Often the E1 or E3 subunits appear separated from the surface of the E2 core by 3-5 nm, and sometimes thin bridges of density appear in the gap between the E2 core and the bound subunits; studies of subcomplexes consisting of the E2 core from 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and E1 or E3 show that both E1 and E3 are bound in this manner. Images of the E2 cores isolated from pyruvate dehydrogenase complex appear surrounded by a faint fuzz that extends approximately 10 nm from the surface of the core and likely corresponds to the lipoyl domains of the E2."
https://openalex.org/W1497531311,The amino-terminal fragment of beta-lipotropin (i.e. beta-lipotropin (1-40)) and joining peptide portions of pro-opiomelanocortin have been purified from extracts of bovine posterior pituitaries. Peptides were purified using a combination of reversed-phase and ion-exchange batch extraction procedures followed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. beta-Lipotropin (1-40) was found to consist of four major components while joining peptide was found to consist of two major components. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric analysis of the tryptic fragments of both peptides revealed that the observed heterogeneity could be explained in terms of post-translational modifications. beta-Lipotropin (1-40) was found to be sulfated at tyrosine residue 28 to an extent of about 50%. The tyrosine residue in beta-lipotropin (1-40) is situated within an amino acid sequence with a preponderance of glutamate residues. Sulfation of this amino acid residue is entirely compatible with the known primary structure requirements of the sulfotransferase enzyme located in the trans-Golgi fraction. Both beta-lipotropin (1-40) and joining peptide were found to have pyroglutamate at their amino termini to an extent of about 50%. The cDNA sequence for bovine pro-opiomelanocortin predicts the presence of glutamic acid at position 1 of both peptides. Pyroglutamate is normally formed through the cyclization of glutamine. This reaction is thought to be catalyzed by a pyroglutamate forming enzyme located within the secretory granule fraction. Under certain circumstances peptides with glutamate at their amino termini may act as substrates for this enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1593424947,"Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is required for the survival and proliferation of mouse bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC). Although interleukin 4 (IL-4) has no direct effect on growth activity, it synergizes with IL-3 in promoting the growth of these cells. The intracellular mechanism by which these ligand-receptor interactions promote mast cell growth are not well documented in the literature. Here we present evidence that both IL-3 and IL-4 have been found to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatidylinositol turnover in BMMC, in a similar time- and dose-dependent manner, indicating that activation of PKC is not sufficient to induce proliferation in these cells. In this work we addressed the question as to whether the activation of PKC is necessary for mast cell proliferation. Activation of PKC by phorbol myristate acetate causes inhibition of IL-3-mediated growth for the first 72 h of incubation. The inhibition in IL-3-mediated proliferation gradually lessens with the stages of PKC depletion, which is complete after 72 h. The enhancement in phorbol myristate acetate-treated cells grows as PKC is depleted. The inactive phorbol ester, 4-alpha-phorbol, had no effect on proliferation of BMMC. Cells, PKC-depleted by chronical phorbol ester treatment, responded to IL-3 or IL-4 with a significant increase in [3H] thymidine uptake over PKC containing cells stimulated with the same lymphokine. Use of antibodies to these lymphokines showed that the enhanced response of the PKC-depleted BMMC was not due to the additional autocrine production of IL-3 or IL-4 by these cells. The PKC-depleted cells retain the capacity to return to almost normal levels of PKC activity and sensitivity to IL-3 and IL-4, after 72 and 120 h, respectively. These results indicate that PKC plays an important inhibitory role in IL-3- and IL-4-mediated proliferation of BMMC."
https://openalex.org/W1535974818,"Hirudin, a thrombin-specific inhibitor, comprises a compact amino-terminal core domain (residues 1-52) and a disordered acidic carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 53-65). An array of core fragments were prepared from intact recombinant hirudin by deletion of various lengths of its carboxyl-terminal tail on selective enzymatic cleavage. Hir1-56 and Hir1-53 were produced by pepsin digestion at Phe56-Glu57 and Asp53-Gly54. Hir1-52 was generated by Asp-N cleavage at Asn52-Asp53. Hir1-49 was prepared by cleavage of Gln49-Ser50 by chymotrypsin, elastase, and thermolysin. In addition, Hir1-62 (containing part of the carboxyl-terminal tail) was derived from Hir1-65 by selective removal of the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids using carboxypeptidase A. Hirudin amino-terminal core fragments were stable at extreme pH (1.47 and 12.6), high temperature (95 degrees C), and resistant to attack by various proteinases. For instance, following 24-h incubation with an equal weight of pepsin, the covalent structure of Hir1-52 remained intact and its anticoagulant activity unaffected. Unlike intact hirudin (Hir1-65) the inhibitory potency of which is a consequence of concerted binding of its amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains to the active site and the fibrinogen recognition site of thrombin, the core fragments block only the active site of thrombin with binding constants of 19 nM (Hir1-56), 35 nM (Hir1-52), and 72 nM (Hir1-49). As an anticoagulant Hir1-56 is about 2-, 4-, and 30-fold more potent (on a molar basis) than Hir1-52, Hir1-49, and Hir1-43, respectively. Hir1-56 was also about 15-fold more effective than the most potent carboxyl-terminal fragment of hirudin, sulfated-Hir54-65, although they bind to independent sites on thrombin. The potential advantages of hirudin core fragments as antithrombotic agents are discussed in this report."

https://openalex.org/W1578297955,"Vaccinia virus is a highly cytocidal virus, but the steps that lead to virus penetration into cells, the first event in virus pathogenesis, have not been elucidated. We have shown that a 14-kDa envelope protein of vaccinia virus might play a major role in virus-penetration acting at the level of cell fusion (Rodriguez, J. F., Paez, E., and Esteban, M. (1987) J. Virol. 61, 395-404; Gong, S., Lai, C., and Esteban, M. (1990) Virology 178, 81-91). To carry out structural and functional studies on the vaccinia 14-kDa protein, it would be desirable to have a high level expression system, since the amount of protein that can be obtained from purified virus or from infected cells is very limited. In this investigation we demonstrate that the 14-kDa envelope protein of vaccinia virus is expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble form and at high levels. We establish, by several criteria, that the 14-kDa vaccinia virus protein expressed in E. coli is similar to the protein found in the virus particle based on apparent molecular mass, occurrence of disulfide-linked oligomers, reactivity against specific monoclonal antibody, and identity in amino-terminal sequence with the predicted DNA sequence of the gene. We define several structural and functional properties concerning the 14-kDa envelope protein of vaccinia virus. 1) 14 kDa is a trimer of identical subunits. 2) A monomer binds to itself more strongly than to a dimer or a trimer. 3) Oligomerization does not require cellular factors. 4) Trimers induce high titer neutralizing antibodies in animals which correlate with overall immunogenicity. 5) 14-kDa binds with specificity to the cell surface of cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608344860,"Mature, confluent monolayer cultures of IEC-6 rat intestinal epithelial cells in conventional growth media express both Na(+)-linked, concentrative nucleoside transport (NT) activity and equilibrative, inhibitor-sensitive NT activity, but do not show morphologic differentiation. Na(+)-dependent fluxes of Ado and formycin B were minor in early subconfluent IEC-6 monolayers, but increased severalfold to become the major component of influx of these agents in confluent monolayers grown in medium containing Nu-Serum, a commercial medium supplement with a low serum content. In monolayers cultured in medium with fetal bovine serum, cell proliferation rates were similar to those in medium supplemented with Nu-Serum, but expression of Na(+)-linked NT activity was 6-8-fold lower than in monolayers grown in the latter medium. Inclusion of hydrocortisone in growth medium with Nu-Serum caused a 2-fold increase in the expression of Na(+)-linked NT activity. Experiments in which components of medium supplementation were withheld showed that insulin and epidermal growth factor were important in expression of the Na(+)-linked NT activity. Because the Na(+)-linked NT system has a brush border location in fresh intestinal epithelium, it is concluded that the regulated expression of this activity in the IEC-6 monolayers is a differentiative change."

https://openalex.org/W1494497684,"We had earlier identified a 110/120-kDa protein specific to nuclear matrix of rat pachytene spermatocytes (Behal, A., Prakash, K., and Rao, M.R.S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10898-10902). This protein is now shown to be a disulfide-linked homodimer of a 60-kDa polypeptide. Indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses using anti-120-kDa polyclonal antibodies have shown that this protein is a component of the pore-complex lamina structure of spermatogonia. As germ cells enter meiotic prophase and the lamina structure disassembles, this polypeptide is redistributed in the nucleus and can be isolated as a component of synaptonemal complexes. Following meiotic division, this 60-kDa protein is relocalized in the lamina, then representing the sole major component of the lamina structure of round spermatids. The identity of the 60-kDa protein in the pore-complex lamina fraction and synaptonemal complexes was further confirmed by two-dimensional analysis of iodinated tryptic peptides. Such an analysis has also shown that the germ cell-specific 60-kDa protein is related but not identical to somatic lamin B."

All of the compounds were substrates, but their activities diminished as the size and bulk of the 3-alkyl substituent increased. Several differences were observed between the alkyl-substituted analogues and the corresponding aryl-substituted compounds previously reported (Silverman, R. B., Invergo, B. J., and Levy, M. A.

https://openalex.org/W1493828862,"We have studied the elements involved in the tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA)-mediated extinction of erythroid-specific genes. We show that transcription driven by a -714/+78-base pair DNA fragment of the erythroid promoter of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene is down-regulated upon TPA treatment of erythroleukemic cells. Examination of the DNA binding activity of trans-acting factors involved in the expression of the porphobilinogen deaminase erythroid promoter showed (i) a constitutive expression of the CACC binding proteins and (ii) a decrease in DNA binding activity of two tissue-specific factors, NF-E1 and NF-E2. Kinetics experiments indicated that NF-E2 was down-regulated after 1 h of TPA treatment whereas NF-E1 was down-regulated at the protein and mRNA levels only after 5 h of TPA treatment. These results suggest that different pathways, acting via different transcription factors, are involved in the TPA-mediated extinction of erythroid-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1577538796,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) may be important autocrine and paracrine mediators of organ growth. We used solution-hybridization/ribonuclease protection assays to examine IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA abundance during hypertrophy or the rat adrenal gland induced by unilateral adrenalectomy or by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) infusion. Adrenal IGF-I mRNA did not change during the period of rapid organ growth at 18 or 66 h after unilateral adrenalectomy. ACTH infusion induced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in adrenal IGF-I mRNA despite significant increases in gland size. IGF-II mRNA also remained unchanged after unilateral adrenalectomy and decreased after ACTH infusion, to a greater extent than IGF-I mRNA. Liver IGF-I mRNA did not change with ACTH exposure, indicating an effect specific to the adrenal. We also measured adrenal P450scc mRNA as a marker of steroidogenic capacity. P450scc mRNA was unchanged after unilateral adrenalectomy and increased with ACTH infusion. Thus IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs respond in parallel, but in different fashions with different stimuli for adrenal growth. The decrease in IGF mRNA after exposure to ACTH may be a factor in the ACTH-induced inhibition of compensatory hypertrophy after unilateral adrenalectomy."
https://openalex.org/W1506041087,"The method used here to assess the contribution of liver to plasma acylcarnitine is based on the idea that in rat, shortly after administration of [3H]butyrobetaine the [3H]carnitine appearing in the plasma derives from the liver and so does the acyl moiety of [acyl-3H] carnitine. In the perchloric acid extracts of plasma and liver, the ester fraction of total carnitine was determined by enzymatic analysis and that of [3H]carnitines was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The ester fraction of total carnitine in the plasma of fed rats was 32.6% while that of [3H]carnitines was 67.9%, 1 h following injection of [3H]butyrobetaine. For 48 h starved rats the equivalent values were 54.2 and 84.0%, respectively. 24 h after the administration of [3H]butyrobetaine, the ester content became the same in the total and [3H]carnitines. That the newly synthesized carnitine was more acylated (67.9 versus 32.6%, fed) indicates that liver exports acyl groups with carnitine as carrier. The observation that the ester fraction in the newly synthesized plasma carnitine increased with fasting (84.0 versus 67.9%) indicates that the surplus plasma acylcarnitine in fasting ketosis derives from the liver. Perfused livers, however, released carnitine with the same ester content (60-61%) whether they were from fed or fasted animals. Probably, the increased plasma [acylcarnitine] in fasting develops not by an increased ester output from the liver but by an altered handling in extrahepatic tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1535571695,"Simultaneous measurements of potassium influx and binding of [3H]bumetanide were performed in endothelial cells cultured from bovine aortas to determine how bradykinin regulates Na-K-2Cl cotransport. [3H]Bumetanide displayed saturable binding and was displaced by low concentrations of unlabeled bumetanide. All three transported ions were required for binding and high concentrations of chloride inhibited binding, consistent with binding of bumetanide to the second chloride site of the transporter. Scatchard analysis of binding under maximal conditions (100 mM sodium, 30 mM potassium, 30 mM chloride) revealed a single class of binding sites with a binding constant of 112 nM and a density of 22 fmol/cm2 or approximately 122,000 sites/cells. Na-K-2Cl cotransport, measured as bumetanide-sensitive potassium influx, was stimulated 118 +/- 30% by bradykinin (p less than 0.01) at physiologic ion concentrations. Stimulation was inhibited by increased potassium or decreased external chloride concentrations and was not seen in conditions required for maximal binding of bumetanide. Simultaneous measurement of the binding of tracer [3H]bumetanide and its inhibition of potassium influx in medium containing 10 mM potassium and 130 mM chloride revealed a turnover number for the cotransporter of 293 +/- 68 s-1 which increased to 687 +/- 105 s-1 with bradykinin (p less than 0.001). There was no change in cell volume and only a 5.6 mM increase in intracellular sodium concentration associated with this stimulation. Bradykinin also increased the affinity of the cotransporter for bumetanide as indicated by a decrease in the Ki for potassium influx from 464 +/- 46 nM to 219 +/- 19 nM (p less than 0.005). Our results show that [3H]bumetanide can be used to quantitate Na-K-2Cl cotransporter sites in aortic endothelial cells and to determine the mechanism by which cotransport is regulated. The stimulation of cotransport in aortic endothelial cells by bradykinin is due to an increase in the activity of existing transporters rather than to an increase in the number of transporters. This, together with the increased affinity for bumetanide, strongly suggests that a change in cotransporter structure is occurring in response to bradykinin."
https://openalex.org/W1552808843,"Activation parameters for each reaction step in the kinetic mechanism of liver alcohol dehydrogenase have been measured for the oxidation of ethanol and the reduction of acetaldehyde. In the oxidation process, the highest enthalpy of activation, 9.7 kcal/mol, occurs for the turnover of the liver alcohol dehydrogenase-NAD(+)-ethanol ternary complex. To investigate if this enthalpy requirement represents a change in the ionization state of ethanol bound in the ternary complex, inhibition of ethanol oxidation was determined using the following series of small, electronegative alcohols with pKa values ranging from 12.37 to 15.5: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 2,2-dichloroethanol, 2,2-difluoroethanol, propargyl alcohol, 3-hydroxypropionitrile, 2-chloroethanol, 2-iodoethanol, 2-methoxyethanol, ethylene glycol, and methanol. The observed inhibition patterns were analyzed according to several kinetic inhibition models; in each case, the best fit model was used to determine the substrate competitive inhibition constant. A plot of the logarithm of these inhibition constants is shown to be dependent on the pKa values of the inhibiting alcohols with a slope approaching -1, indicating that inhibition is controlled by a proton loss from the alcohol. The observed competitive inhibition behavior, coupled with crystallographic studies depicting a direct ligation of an alcohol oxygen to the catalytic zinc ion, indicates that inhibition is controlled by the formation of a zinc-bound alkoxide. Because the inhibiting alcohols are structurally homologous to ethanol, a relationship between the inhibition constant and the inhibiting alcohol's pKa can be derived to show that the pKa of an alcohol bound in a ternary complex is also dependent on its pKa as a free alcohol. Ternary complex pKa values have been determined for ethanol and the inhibiting alcohols."
https://openalex.org/W1498581603,"A synthetic tRNA precursor analog containing the structural elements of Escherichia coli tRNA(Phe) was characterized as a substrate for E. coli ribonuclease P and for M1 RNA, the catalytic RNA subunit. Processing of the synthetic precursor exhibited a Mg2+ dependence quite similar to that of natural tRNA precursors such as E. coli tRNA(Tyr) precursor. It was found that Sr2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+ ions promoted processing of the dimeric precursor at Mg2+ concentrations otherwise insufficient to support processing; very similar behavior was noted for E. coli tRNA(Tyr). As noted previously for natural tRNA precursors, the absence of the 3'-terminal CA sequence in the synthetic precursor diminished the facility of processing of this substrate by RNase P and M1 RNA. A study of the Mg2+ dependence of processing of the synthetic tRNA dimeric substrate radiolabeled between C75 and A76 provided unequivocal evidence for an alteration in the actual site of processing by E. coli RNase P as a function of Mg2+ concentration. This property was subsequently demonstrated to obtain (Carter, B. J., Vold, B.S., and Hecht, S. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7100-7103) for a mutant Bacillus subtilis tRNAHis precursor containing a potential A-C base pair at the end of the acceptor stem."
https://openalex.org/W1594345523,"Acylation of exogenously added galactosylsphingosine was demonstrated in intact NCB-20 neuroblastoma cells, a cell line that normally does not synthesize galactosylceramide. Labeling of cells with [3H]palmitic acid for 6 h in the presence of 100 microM exogenous galactosylsphingosine (GalSph) resulted in a more than 3-fold increase in the incorporation of label into the ceramide monohexoside fraction relative to controls. This increase, which was almost entirely due to the incorporation of labeled nonhydroxy fatty acid into galactosylceramide, was linear over a concentration range of 1-100 microM galactosylsphingosine and for the first 5 h after the addition of galactosylsphingosine. Similarly, the addition of 100 microM glucosylsphingosine resulted in a 3-fold increase of label incorporated into glucosylceramide. Incubation of cells with 100 microM GalSph and labeled fatty acids of various chain lengths revealed that the acylation of GalSph was specific for medium chain (C16-C18) nonhydroxy fatty acids, suggesting that this was an enzyme-mediated reaction. The enzymatic nature of GalSph acylation was further demonstrated when cells were incubated for 72 h with 15 microM [3H]galactosylsphingosine labeled in the galactose moiety. [3H]Galactosylceramide containing only medium chain non-hydroxy fatty acids accumulated linearly with time reaching a maximum at 48 h and was observed to be further metabolized to ceramide dihexoside. This acylation reaction may be potentially important for the removal of glycosylsphingosines in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1566936747,"ATP concentrations in the perfused rat liver during normoxic perfusion, transient ischemia, and recovery from transient ischemia were measured using the modified 31P cryo-NMR method (Chance, B., Nakase, Y., Bond, M., Leigh, J. S., Jr., and McDonald, G. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 4925-4929). Transient ischemia was induced in the perfused livers of starved rats, and multiple freeze-trapped tissue samples were taken from each liver at short intervals (15-30 s) during ischemia or following reperfusion. The freeze-trapped tissue was pulverized together with an antifreezing agent and high energy metabolites were measured by 31P NMR at 243 K after thawing. By using the cryo-NMR technique, a biochemical time resolution of 2 s could be achieved. Absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated by comparing the peak areas with internal standards mixed into the samples. Good time resolution and reliable concentration measurements provided by the cryo-NMR method enable us to estimate the ATP synthesis rate in the perfused liver during reperfusion following transient ischemia. The rate of ATP synthesis in the normoxic perfusion was 1.95 mumol/min/g wet weight; the maximal ATP synthesis rate during the recovery phase from ischemia was 5.75 mumol/min/g wet weight."
https://openalex.org/W1590425733,"Abstract Several tRNA molecules were constructed as potential substrates for ribonuclease P (RNase P) and for M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of RNase P. Construction was affected by the T4 RNA ligase-mediated coupling of a mature Escherichia coli tRNA (acceptor substrate) and nucleotides 1-36 of yeast tRNAPhe (donor substrate), followed by annealing of the 3'-half of yeast tRNAPhe (nucleotides 38-76). E. coli RNase P and M1 RNA were both found to cleave the dimeric tRNA precursor model constructed from E. coli tRNAPhe (5'-tRNA) and yeast tRNAPhe (3'-tRNA) in a reaction that was dependent on the presence of the annealed 3'-half molecule derived from yeast tRNAPhe, or on some conformation imposed by the presence of this species; the product had the same mobility as authentic E. coli tRNAPhe on a polyacrylamide gel. By utilizing tRNA precursor models radiolabeled at phosphodiesters immediately preceding or following the putative site of processing, cleavage of the substrate by both M1 RNA and the holoenzyme was demonstrated to occur at the expected phosphate ester linkage. The results obtained here suggest that the endonucleolytic separation of two tRNAs by RNase P is dependent on one or more structural features in the 3'-half of the 3'-tRNA, and thus are consistent with the report of McClain et al. (McClain, W. H., Guerrier-Takada, C., and Altman, S. (1987) Science 238, 527-530) that identifies the T stem and loop as a possible recognition site."

https://openalex.org/W2074117084,"7,8-Disubstituted guanine ribonucleosides are known to be potent intracellular modulators of immune responses. These compounds trigger and modulate a wide variety of lymphocyte responses including effects exerted directly on B cells. However, little is known about their mechanism of action. The current paper describes studies undertaken to evaluate whether binding components specific for these bioactive molecules exist in splenic B lymphocytes. After exposure of cells to labeled nucleoside, two different pools of nucleoside can be distinguished: a rapidly exchangeable nucleoside pool and a slowly exchangeable pool. The material in the latter pool consists of authentic unaltered nucleoside that is complexed to a relatively hydrophobic cellular component with an apparent Mr of 30,000-40,000; binding appears to interfere with free interaction of the nucleoside's cis hydroxyls with a boronate affinity resin. The slowly exchangeable nucleoside pool is seen to localize predominantly to the nucleus in electron microscopic autoradiographs. This pool is maximally bound by 30 min of incubation. Specific, saturable binding is demonstrable, with an apparent Kd of approximately 7 microM. This value correlates well with concentrations at which half-maximal biological activity occurs and suggests that the binding component likely mediates antigen-dependent immunomodulatory activity. Splenic B cells express approximately 2 x 10(4) binding sites/cell, whereas thymic lymphocytes, which do not respond functionally to nucleosides, do not display a measurable number of nucleoside binding sites. Ligand specificity of the binding interaction is confirmed by binding inhibition studies, in which binding inhibitory activity of unlabeled agonistic structural analogs recapitulate their degree of immunobiological activity. These data are most consistent with the existence of a saturable binding component with apparent specificity for 7,8-disubstituted guanine ribonucleosides in splenic B cells."

The PiZ gene has a Z-specific point mutation in exon V together with a point mutation in exon III which is also present in some normal (PiM) individuals. There has thus far been no system to study the effects of PiZ point mutations in tissue culture. We constructed plasmids containing alpha 1-antitrypsin cDNA synthetically altered at either exon III or exon V mutation sites and linked to simian virus 40 promoter sequences. Such constructs with the exon V mutation were transfected into monkey COS1 cells followed by analysis of expression of alpha 1-antitrypsin gene products. COS1 cells normally synthesize virtually no alpha 1-antitrypsin mRNA or protein. alpha 1-Antitrypsin mRNA is transcribed at high levels in cells transfected with either M or Z plasmids. Immunologic staining of COS1 cells within 48 h of transfection localizes alpha 1-antitrypsin protein to specific regions of the cytoplasm. This extranuclear localization is also observed with human HepG2 hepatoma cells, which synthesize alpha 1-antitrypsin at high levels, and with human SK-Hep1 hepatoma cells transfected with an M plasmid. The cloned synthetically altered alpha 1-antitrypsin genes provide a system for dissecting contributions of distinct point mutations to the pathological effects of the PiZ protein."

We have synthesized six 37-base pair DNAs consisting of 21 base pair natural operator and its modifications in which certain symmetrically situated GC base pairs were replaced systematically with ATs to understand their importance. The binding interaction studies of Mnt repressor to such natural and modified operator DNAs reported here indicate that the GCs close to the center of symmetry make major contacts with the protein whereas, GCs nearer to the periphery form weak contacts. Methylation protection experiments indicated that when the GCs near the center of symmetry were replaced with AT, the central GC became more accessible for dimethyl sulfate methylation with possible conformational change in DNA. The circular dichroism studies indicated that upon repressor binding conformational changes in DNA takes place with a possible increase in helicity of the repressor protein."
