https://openalex.org/W3011413344,"Genomes from around the globe Genomic sequencing of diverse human populations to understand overall genetic diversity has lagged behind in-depth examination of specific populations. To add to our understanding of human genetic diversity, Bergström et al. generated whole-genome sequences surveying individuals in the Human Genome Diversity Project, which is a panel of global populations that has been instrumental in understanding the history of human populations. The authors' study adds data about African, Oceanian, and Amerindian populations and indicates that diversity tends to result from differences at the single-nucleotide level rather than copy number variation. An analysis of archaic sequences in modern populations identifies ancestral genetic variation in African populations that likely predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations.

BET proteins contain two nearly identical bromodomains, BD1 and BD2, structural modules that have attracted great interest as targets for drug development. First-generation drugs that inhibited both BD1 and BD2 showed promising therapeutic activity in preclinical models but proved to be less efficacious in clinical trials. Gilan et al. took a different approach and designed drugs that selectively inhibited BD1 or BD2 (see the Perspective by Filippakopoulos and Knapp). They found that BD1 and BD2 inhibitors altered gene expression in different ways and that BD2 inhibitors had greater therapeutic activity than BD1 inhibitors in preclinical models of inflammation and autoimmune disease.

However, they are also widely used off-label to enhance cognitive performance, and their mechanisms of action remain elusive. Westbrook et al. studied the effects of these drugs and concurrently measured striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in young, healthy participants (see the Perspective by Janes). They administered a placebo, methylphenidate (a dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake blocker), and sulpiride (a selective D2 receptor antagonist) while participants made explicit cost-benefit decisions about whether to engage in cognitive effort. Higher dopamine synthesis capacity in the caudate nucleus was associated with greater willingness to allocate cognitive effort. In addition, methylphenidate and sulpiride increased subjective values and motivation to work specifically for people with low dopamine synthesis capacity. Cognition-enhancing drugs may thus act at the motivational level rather than directly boosting cognition per se. Science , this issue p. 1362 ; see also p. 1300"

Arakawa et al. describe how the spacecraft's Small Carry-on Impactor was fired into the asteroid's surface, producing an artificial impact crater. Analysis of the resulting plume of ejecta, recorded by a remote camera, sets an upper limit on the strength of the rubble-pile surface. The crater has a semicircular shape, probably due to a large boulder buried close to the impact location. The crater exposed material from Ryugu's subsurface, which has not been subjected to space weathering, that is suitable for collection by Hayabusa2. Science , this issue p. 67"

Mitochondrial division is driven by the recruitment of a constricting guanosine triphosphatase protein at sites of contact with the endoplasmic reticulum, but other factors, including lysosomes, are also involved. Nagashima et al. now document an essential role for Golgi-derived vesicles bearing a specific lipid—phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, or PI(4)P—in the final steps of mitochondrial division. Disruption of PI(4)P production results in mitochondrial morphological defects indicative of an inability to complete fission. Science , this issue p. 1366"

Plants make up most of the planet’s biomass and sustain global economic and environmental systems. Despite increasing numbers of sequenced plant genomes, biochemical characterization of encoded plant proteins captures a relatively small portion of the expected breadth of biological functions. The best-characterized dicotyledonous plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, encodes approximately 35,000 protein-coding genes, but the functions of the majority of these proteins remain uncharacterized, even by homology (Rhee and Mutwil, 2014Rhee S.Y. Mutwil M. Towards revealing the functions of all genes in plants.Trends Plant Sci. 2014; 19: 212-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This trend is similar for Oryza sativa (rice), a critical food crop and the best-characterized monocotyledonous plant (Kawahara et al., 2013Kawahara Y. de la Bastide M. Hamilton J.P. Kanamori H.

In marked contrast to other model organisms, it is estimated that only 5% of Arabidopsis proteins and considerably fewer proteins in other plants have had biochemical activity, localization, and biological roles determined by direct experimentation (Niehaus et al., 2015Niehaus T.D.

Revealing this class of biochemical information for plants will dramatically advance efforts in fundamental plant research as well as guide practical applications such as improvements in crop yields, disease/stress resistance, and biofuel production. Unfortunately, many of the techniques that have been used to discover protein complexes at scale in animals and yeast (e.g., high-throughput affinity purification-mass spectrometry [AP-MS]) are prohibitively expensive or even intractable at large scale in plants because of complex genomes, polyploidy, and transformation efficiency. Consequently, AP-MS experiments in plants have been limited to targeted protein families, primarily in Arabidopsis and rice (Bassel et al., 2012Bassel G.W. Gaudinier A. Brady S.M. Hennig L. Rhee S.Y.

Such approaches for studying protein-protein interactions are disproportionately difficult in less well-characterized plant species, necessitating new strategies for comparative studies. Co-fractionation MS (CF-MS) is a high-throughput method to detect interacting proteins, applicable to any organism, without the need for antibodies or transgenic epitope tagging of individual proteins. CF-MS involves chromatographically separating a native protein extract and then identifying proteins in each biochemical fraction using MS. Co-elution (CF) of proteins in a separation serves as evidence of physical association, which, when measured over multiple distinct separations, is a rigorous signal of protein interaction (Wan et al., 2015Wan C. Borgeson B. Phanse S. Tu F. Drew K. Clark G. Xiong X. Kagan O. Kwan J. Bezginov A. et al.Panorama of ancient metazoan macromolecular complexes.Nature. 2015; 525: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Observation of repeated co-elution in multiple different species reduces species-specific artifacts and adds power to discover conserved—and thus more likely functional—interactions. Furthermore, use of machine learning methods allows strong control over false discovery rates of protein interactions. Several papers have classified candidate Arabidopsis protein complexes using native (non-denaturing) separations, such as gels (Takabayashi et al., 2017Takabayashi A. Takabayashi S. Takahashi K.

A Label-Free Mass Spectrometry Method to Predict Endogenous Protein Complex Composition.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2019; 18: 1588-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in a single or small set of experiments, two proteins can coincidentally co-elute without a physical association. In comparison, repeated co-elution using multiple distinct species, tissues, and biochemical separations provides increasing confidence in a protein interaction (Wan et al., 2015Wan C. Borgeson B. Phanse S. Tu F. Drew K. Clark G. Xiong X. Kagan O. Kwan J. Bezginov A. et al.Panorama of ancient metazoan macromolecular complexes.Nature. 2015; 525: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). As with genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or recombination mapping of a single mutation by phenotype, large amounts of data are required to build a statistically strong observation. In this largest survey to date of expressed plant proteins as well as their physical assemblies, we collected a massive and diverse plant co-elution dataset to define high-confidence protein-protein interactions in a statistical computational framework, recovering known complexes and identifying novel complexes conserved across plants for over a billion years. Multiple newly discovered complexes have direct relevance to agronomically important traits. Collectively, the resulting set of protein abundances and map of stable protein interactions will help interpret plant gene functions in a mechanistic, evolutionary, and biochemical framework. We generated a large, diverse, and representative proteomics dataset from 13 species spanning 1.1 billion years of green plant evolution (Figure 1A). Our compendium incorporates proteomic data from Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica oleracea (broccoli), Glycine max (soy), Cannabis sativa (hemp), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa), Zea mays (maize), Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (rice), Triticum aestivum (wheat), Cocos nucifera (coconut), Ceratopteris richardii (fern), Selaginella moellendorffii (spikemoss), and the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We chose crop and model plants important to the research community, including species that overcome specific technical challenges (e.g., high yields of nuclei from broccoli and coconut and embryonic tissue from wheat and hemp). We included vascular plants that branched off before the split of seed-bearing plants (fern and spikemoss) and single-celled green algae (Chlamydomonas) for their ancestral characteristics. Our dataset combines multiple species and cell types to give a broad view of expressed proteins across Viridiplantae. We separated each native, non-denatured protein extract by some biophysical property, either size exclusion chromatography (SEC), ion exchange chromatography (IEX), or isoelectric focusing (IEF) (Figures 1B and 1C), and analyzed each biochemical fraction by MS. In all, we collected 14,520,970 interpretable peptide mass spectra from 2,111 individual fractions, each capturing distinct subsets of native plant proteins and protein assemblies. This deep proteome profiling will be valuable for addressing diverse questions of plant biochemistry and function, including protein modifications, expression, and determining which species or tissue contains a high abundance of any particular protein. Integrating protein observations from different organisms is complicated because of orthology mapping. This long-standing problem is even more extreme in plants because of their often complex and polyploid genomes as well as past whole-genome duplications (Jiao et al., 2011Jiao Y. Wickett N.J. Ayyampalayam S. Chanderbali A.S. Landherr L. Ralph P.E. Tomsho L.P. Hu Y. Liang H. Soltis P.S. et al.Ancestral polyploidy in seed plants and angiosperms.Nature. 2011; 473: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). For example, most farmed wheat is hexaploid and contains over 100,000 genes, which complicates comparison with model diploids, such as Arabidopsis with its approximately 35,000 genes. The existence of multiple near-identical proteins also reduces the number of peptides that uniquely match a single protein, reducing protein recovery by standard proteomics methods. Current protein-grouping statistical methods for assigning peptides to proteins tend to perform erratically for highly redundant genomes, in practice allocating shared peptides semi-randomly across similar proteins. We thus developed an evolution-informed protein-grouping approach that is generally applicable to proteomics data from any arbitrary number of different species. Our strategy was to interpret mass spectral observations in terms of orthogroups rather than individual proteins. An orthogroup (OG) is a set of genes in modern organisms that derives from the same original gene in those organisms’ last common ancestor. We began by assigning all protein-coding genes in each plant species to predetermined OGs (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017Huerta-Cepas J. Forslund K. Coelho L.P. Szklarczyk D. Jensen L.J. von Mering C. Bork P. Fast Genome-Wide Functional Annotation through Orthology Assignment by eggNOG-Mapper.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34: 2115-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), organizing highly related protein sequences into sets (Figure 1D). We then considered mass spectra from any OG member protein as evidence of the abundance of their OG (Figure 1E), which allows peptides shared by multiple proteins in an OG (but not unique to a single protein) to now contribute to quantification. Importantly, OGs, unlike proteins, have consistent identifiers that can be used as a key to integrate data from multiple species. Thus, we collapse the three proteins in the ribosomal protein L36 OG in Arabidopsis to a set directly comparable with the behavior of that OG in other species; for example the set of seven proteins in this OG in wheat. (We refer to OGs by available Arabidopsis common gene names throughout; Table S1 provides additional identifiers.) Figure 1F visually summarizes our over two million protein abundance measurements across plant species integrated into this comparative phylogenetic framework (described in Table S2; data at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3666942), and Figure 1G highlights specific examples of complexes from the data in Figure 1F. Consistent with ploidy levels (Figure 2A), diploid organisms such as Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas exhibited a peak of one protein per OG. In contrast, tetraploid quinoa and soy each showed a peak of two proteins per OG (one from each of two subgenomes), and, in the same manner, hexaploid wheat showed a peak of three proteins. Interestingly, the spikemoss (Selaginella moellendorfii) genome, a likely greenhouse hybrid (Banks et al., 2011Banks J.A. Nishiyama T. Hasebe M. Bowman J.L. Gribskov M. dePamphilis C. Albert V.A. Aono N. Aoyama T. Ambrose B.A. et al.The Selaginella genome identifies genetic changes associated with the evolution of vascular plants.Science. 2011; 332: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), has a peak of two proteins per OG or one protein per parent genome. This OG-based proteomics interpretation strategy increased the recovery of unique spectral counts for the highly redundant proteome of hexaploid wheat by over 300% while not strongly affecting organisms with small diploid genomes, e.g., Chlamydomonas (Figure 2B). Similarly, coverage of observed OGs is less variable than coverage of observed proteins across species. (Figure 2C). Collapsing sets of evolutionarily related proteins into OGs is thus a flexible and broadly applicable solution for cross-species proteomics analyses, especially across plants with varying ploidy levels. Our data represent over 141,910 unique proteins and 23,896 OGs from diverse species and extracts, the largest proteomic survey of plants performed to date, covering broad areas of function (Figure S1). We sufficiently capture the proteome observable by native fractionation MS, as evidenced by saturating the number of new OGs observed per additional experiment (Figure 2D), suggesting that more samples are unlikely to markedly improve conserved proteome coverage. In all, we observed 96.7% of the 11,339 most conserved Viridiplantae OGs (see details in STAR Methods). Our dataset, therefore, provides a meaningful snapshot of the conserved and expressed proteome of green plants. Collapsing sets of proteins to OGs masks individual protein behavior, so we examined the behavior of paralogs within OGs. We found that about half of the OGs with three or more member proteins contain one dominant protein that is highly expressed relative to other members (Figure 2E). An approximately equal set has protein expression more evenly shared across members. These trends were consistent across multiple species with widely varying genome sizes (Figure 2E). Thus, some degree of functional divergence, as measured by differential expression, was evident in about 50% of multi-gene OGs. The proteins we observed also tended to be products of more abundant mRNAs (Figure 2F). Work in other organisms has shown that there is an imperfect correlation between protein abundance and RNA transcript levels, largely attributable to post-transcriptional, translational, and degradation rate effects on steady-state protein levels (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012Vogel C. Marcotte E.M. Insights into the regulation of protein abundance from proteomic and transcriptomic analyses.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). Our data here similarly illustrate this point (Spearman r = 0.45; Figure 2G). One notable outlier is the enzyme RuBisCo, the most abundant protein on earth (Feller et al., 2008Feller U. Anders I. Mae T. Rubiscolytics: fate of Rubisco after its enzymatic function in a cell is terminated.J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the most abundant protein in 16 of 35 of our experiments. RuBisCo is substantially more abundant at the protein level than would be expected based on its transcript levels; e.g., in Chlamydomonas (Figure 2G) or Arabidopsis tissues (Figure S1). In many cases, subunits of known complexes show co-elution patterns easily detected by the eye, as for subunits of the 20S proteasome, prefoldin, and TSET/TPLATE complexes that, respectively, coelute with distinct, complex-specific elution patterns (Figure 1G). However, a computational framework is necessary to identify co-eluting proteins systematically and at high throughput. To quantitatively score co-elution behavior indicative of stably interacting (not transient) proteins, we employed a supervised machine learning approach based on observed data for known complexes. Protein-protein interactions were derived solely from the coordinated separation behavior of proteins over multiple, orthogonal biochemical fractionation experiments. The classifier assigned a probabilistic CF-MS score between 0 and 1 to each potential protein-protein interaction, with 1 indicating a high likelihood of physical association, based on observing strongly coordinated protein elution profiles, and 0 indicating no evidence of interaction (see details in STAR Methods; scores at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3666940). We next aimed to rigorously assess statistical confidence for physical protein-protein interactions, evaluating against a fully withheld test set of 886 known protein interactions that were not used at any point during model training. Ranking protein interactions by their CF-MS scores accurately recapitulated this withheld test set (Figure 3A) and allowed us to measure classifier error rates. For interactions with CF-MS scores over 0.50, we observed 90% precision (i.e., ≤10% false positive interactions) and 23% recall. Interactions with a CF-MS score above 0.2 exhibited 50% precision at 51% recall and, thus, were still informative in many cases (Figure 3B). Interactions tended to be highly conserved, but known interactions were less likely to be found when either partner had fewer than 200 spectral counts (Figure S2). Nonetheless, our performance compares well with human MS complex maps, which range from less than 5% to 38% recall at 90% precision (Drew et al., 2017Drew K. Lee C. Huizar R.L. Tu F. Borgeson B.

While we required a Pearson r > 0.3 in at least two species, a majority of interactions recovered exhibited high correlations in at least ten species. (C) Gold standard interactions were far less likely to be found if either of the interacting proteins had fewer than ~200 peptide spectral matches (denoted by dashed lines) across the 1,942 mass spectrometry experiments employed for machine learning. Thus, CF/MS requires robust observation of both proteins in a protein interaction. Our measured high-confidence protein interactions agree with independent protein interaction observations. As a direct test of our method, we asked whether CF-MS-supported interactions were concordant with an independent biochemical separation of maize, a species that was not used to train the model. Ortholog pairs with a high CF-MS score (>0.5, derived from non-maize plants) co-elute strongly in maize shoots (Figure 3C). We also compared our observed interactions with other independent plant protein interaction datasets, finding that protein pairs with higher CF-MS scores were more likely to affinity-purify together, to interact by yeast 2-hybrid, and to exhibit coordinated mRNA expression in Arabidopsis and in rice (Figure 3D). Our high-confidence scores align with and provide orthogonal support for biologically interesting interactions discovered previously by AP-MS and yeast 2-hybrid assays.

This process requires specificity both in ligand binding to GPCRs and in coupling between GPCRs and their intracellular partners, G proteins. Qiao et al. determined the structure of the human glucagon receptor (GCGR), a type B GPCR, bound to glucagon and one of two heterotrimeric G proteins, G s or G i1 . GCGR signals mainly through G s , and the structures provide a basis for this specificity. Conformational changes in GCGR, relative to the inactive state, create a binding cavity for the G proteins. The pocket is opened sufficiently to accommodate a bulky binding motif in G s . G i1 can still bind but the pocket does not close around it, so there is a smaller interaction interface.

This measure was taken to prevent vaccine-associated disease outbreaks caused by mutation in the live attenuated vaccine. Children around the world now have poor immunity to serotype 2 poliovirus because the inactivated vaccine is far less effective and a new oral vaccine is not yet ready. Using a statistical model, Macklin et al. discovered that most current outbreaks of polio in several countries across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are likely associated with the serotype 2 vaccine strain (see the Perspective by Donlan and Petri). To block transmission when poliovirus outbreaks occur requires deployment of the only tool in the box: the existing live attenuated serotype 2 oral vaccine, which increases the risk of vaccine-derived disease.

https://openalex.org/W3011994965,"Macrophages cFLIP out Pathogens have evolved to survive within hosts in part by interfering with host signaling cascades. Yersinia bacteria use the effector protein YopJ to thwart MAP kinase signaling downstream of Toll-like receptor activation. In response to YopJ, host cells can release interleukin-1β and initiate pyroptosis by inhibition of the kinase TAK1 and subsequent caspase-8–directed cleavage of gasdermin D, a protein that forms cell membrane pores. Muendlein et al. report that cFLIP, a major antiapoptotic regulator, plays a central role in this process. Knockdowns of the long but not short cFLIP isoform in macrophages removes the requirement for TAK1 inhibition. Rather, deficiency of the long isoform fuels caspase-8 activation, mitochondrial complex II formation, pyroptosis, and interleukin-1β secretion in response to lipopolysaccharide alone, underscoring its importance for cell death and inflammation.

In this study, we investigated the clinicopathological properties of tumors that shed ctDNA in surgically resected NSCLC patients.Consecutive cases of NSCLC with matching surgically resected tissue specimens and peripheral or specimen blood samples were eligible for this study. EGFR and KRAS mutations in plasma ctDNA and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were analyzed using peptide nucleic acid clamping-assisted method. The plasma and tissue results were compared according to clinicopathological features.Mutation analyses were available for 36 cases. EGFR and KRAS mutations were present in 41.7% (15/36) and 16.7% (6/36) of tissue samples, respectively. Among EGFR and KRAS-mutant tumors, plasma mutation detection sensitivity was 13.3% (2/15) for EGFR and 33.3% (2/6) for KRAS. The presence of ctDNA in plasma was significantly associated with higher pathological tumor stage (p = 0.028), nodal metastasis (p = 0.016), solid adenocarcinoma pattern (p = 0.003), tumor necrosis (p = 0.012), larger primary tumor diameter (p = 0.002) or volume (p = 0.002), and frequent mitosis (p = 0.018) in tissue specimens. All tumors larger than 4 cm in maximal diameter or 25 cm3 in volume shed ctDNA in plasma. In subgroup analysis among EGFR mutated adenocarcinoma, ctDNA was significantly associated with nodal metastasis (p = 0.029), vascular invasion (p = 0.029), solid adenocarcinoma pattern (p = 0.010), and tumor necrosis (p = 0.010), high mitotic rate (p = 0.009), large pathological tumor size (p = 0.027), and large tumor volume on CT (p = 0.027).We suggest that primary or total tumor burden, solid adenocarcinoma morphology, tumor necrosis, and frequent mitosis could predict ctDNA shedding in pulmonary adenocarcinoma."

Although vegetation can hold soils in place mechanically, root systems can also loosen soils or even help to fracture rock. These processes can increase erosion, especially because areas of heavy vegetation tend to be in areas with high precipitation rates. Starke et al. tackled this issue using a large set of observations that span 3500 km of the Andes mountain range. They found a complex set of interactions where increasing vegetation decreases erosion in more arid regions but can accelerate erosion in vegetation dense regions. Science , this issue p. 1358"

We explore different machine learning (ML) approaches to predict whether a patient will shift from the initial Relapsing-Remitting (RR) to the Secondary Progressive (SP) form of the disease, using only ""real world"" data available in clinical routine. The clinical records of 1624 outpatients (207 in the SP phase) attending the MS service of Sant'Andrea hospital, Rome, Italy, were used. Predictions at 180, 360 or 720 days from the last visit were obtained considering either the data of the last available visit (Visit-Oriented setting), comparing four classical ML methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours and AdaBoost) or the whole clinical history of each patient (History-Oriented setting), using a Recurrent Neural Network model, specifically designed for historical data. Missing values were handled by removing either all clinical records presenting at least one missing parameter (Feature-saving approach) or the 3 clinical parameters which contained missing values (Record-saving approach). The performances of the classifiers were rated using common indicators, such as Recall (or Sensitivity) and Precision (or Positive predictive value). In the visit-oriented setting, the Record-saving approach yielded Recall values from 70% to 100%, but low Precision (5% to 10%), which however increased to 50% when considering only predictions for which the model returned a probability above a given ""confidence threshold"". For the History-oriented setting, both indicators increased as prediction time lengthened, reaching values of 67% (Recall) and 42% (Precision) at 720 days. We show how ""real world"" data can be effectively used to forecast the evolution of MS, leading to high Recall values and propose innovative approaches to improve Precision towards clinically useful values."

Deciphering the effect of opioids in the VTA is a complex task, however, as the relative suppression by opioids differs among GABAergic sources (Matsui et al., 2014Matsui A. Jarvie B.C. Robinson B.G.

This is further complicated by the divergent roles that VTA dopamine cells themselves play in regulating reward or aversion (Lammel et al., 2011Lammel S. Ion D.I. Roeper J. Malenka R.C.

To place the relative contribution of opioid effects into context, it is essential to understand the heterogeneous properties of different VTA afferents using genetic and anatomical isolation of afferent populations (Lammel et al., 2014Lammel S.

Here, we characterize the opiate sensitivity, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral output of two distinct GABAergic projections that inhibit VTA dopamine neurons. One major source of GABAergic inhibition to the VTA originates in a neighboring midbrain region, the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) (Jhou et al., 2009bJhou T.C. Geisler S. Marinelli M.

Neurol. 2009; 513: 566-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The RMTg receives excitatory glutamatergic projections from the lateral habenula, which are required for behavioral responses reflecting strong aversion, including passive, active, and conditioned avoidance (Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012Stamatakis A.M.

The aversive nature of this stimulation results in part from inhibition by the RMTg cells of the VTA dopamine cells they innervate (Jhou et al., 2009aJhou T.C. Fields H.L. Baxter M.G. Saper C.B.

Activating the ventrolateral PAG induces quiescence—in other words, reduced spontaneous activity (Depaulis et al., 1994Depaulis A. Keay K.A. Bandler R. Quiescence and hyporeactivity evoked by activation of cell bodies in the ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray of the rat.Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 99: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study reported that the GABAergic vPAG cells also enhance anxiety phenotypes and inhibit conditioned fear responses, without affecting freezing per se (Lowery-Gionta et al., 2018Lowery-Gionta E.G. DiBerto J. Mazzone C.M. Kash T.L. GABA neurons of the ventral periaqueductal gray area modulate behaviors associated with anxiety and conditioned fear.Brain Struct. Funct. 2018; 223: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Despite these intriguing findings, the functional relevance of PAGGABA→VTA synapses is poorly defined and has received far less attention than the RMTgGABA→VTA pathway. Here, using an optogenetic approach to compare the physiological, plastic, and behavioral properties of these two GABAergic afferent pathways to the VTA, we found striking differences. Recent reports from our lab and others have demonstrated that the plasticity of GABAergic synapses in the VTA is afferent specific; both groups independently found that the RMTg afferents do not exhibit nitric oxide-dependent LTP (LTPGABA) (Simmons et al., 2017Simmons D.V.

Synaptic function and plasticity in identified inhibitory inputs onto VTA dopamine neurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2018; 47: 1208-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We asked whether RMTg synapses can exhibit another form of plasticity: low-frequency stimulation-induced LTD (LFS-LTDGABA), first reported using local electrical stimulation (Dacher and Nugent, 2011Dacher M. Nugent F.S. Morphine-induced modulation of LTD at GABAergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We used an optogenetic strategy, injecting an adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the RMTg of a VGAT-IRES-Cre mouse to express channelrhodopsin (AAV2-DIO-ChR2-mCherry). Several weeks later, we prepared acute midbrain slices and selectively drove RMTg afferents while recording in VTA cells (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). We optically evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents using brief light-emitting diode (LED) pulses (oIPSCs) in VTA cells that had a hyperpolarization-induced current (Ih); in a subset of experiments, cells were additionally validated using a Pitx3:GFP line in which dopamine cells can be identified (Figure S1D) (Maxwell et al., 2005Maxwell S.L. Ho H.Y. Kuehner E. Zhao S. Li M. Pitx3 regulates tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra and identifies a subgroup of mesencephalic dopaminergic progenitor neurons during mouse development.Dev. Biol. 2005; 282: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After establishing a stable baseline of oIPSCs, delivery of optical LFS (oLFS: 1 Hz, 6 min during depolarization to −40 mV) modestly depressed RMTg GABAergic oIPSCs recorded in VTA cells (77% ± 8% of baseline, n = 13 cells; Figures 1B–1E). Furthermore, this LTD persisted in the presence of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, d-APV (Figures 1C–1E). The baseline amplitude was not correlated with depression magnitude (Figure S1C). LFS-LTDGABA was previously shown to be attenuated by dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (Dacher and Nugent, 2011Dacher M. Nugent F.S. Morphine-induced modulation of LTD at GABAergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), most likely as a result of somatodendritic dopamine release activating D2 receptors and opening G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels (Beckstead et al., 2004Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T. Vesicular dopamine release elicits an inhibitory postsynaptic current in midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2004; 42: 939-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To minimize local dopamine release, we voltage clamped the cells at −70 mV during oLFS and found that RMTg oIPSC amplitude was no longer depressed after 6 min of 1-Hz stimulation (103% ± 14% of baseline, n = 7 cells; Figures S1E–S1G), suggesting that presynaptic stimulation alone is insufficient to induce this form of plasticity, consistent with mechanisms underlying LTDGABA (Dacher and Nugent, 2011Dacher M. Nugent F.S. Morphine-induced modulation of LTD at GABAergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Synaptic alterations within circuits that govern opiate-related behavior could represent a mechanism for critical early changes in the reward pathway in the development of addiction. A single in vivo exposure to morphine alters known forms of synaptic plasticity in the VTA, including LTP at excitatory synapses (Saal et al., 2003Saal D. Dong Y. Bonci A. Malenka R.C. Drugs of abuse and stress trigger a common synaptic adaptation in dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2003; 37: 577-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) and LTPGABA and LTDGABA at inhibitory synapses (Nugent et al., 2007Nugent F.S.

Nugent F.S. Morphine-induced modulation of LTD at GABAergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). RMTg cells are hyperpolarized by a μOR agonist (d-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol)-enkephalin (DAMGO) (Matsui and Williams, 2011Matsui A. Williams J.T. Opioid-sensitive GABA inputs from rostromedial tegmental nucleus synapse onto midbrain dopamine neurons.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 17729-17735Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and RMTg IPSCs in the VTA are depressed by μOR activation (Matsui et al., 2014Matsui A. Jarvie B.C. Robinson B.G.

Separate GABA afferents to dopamine neurons mediate acute action of opioids, development of tolerance, and expression of withdrawal.Neuron. 2014; 82: 1346-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Opioids, therefore, can acutely increase VTA dopamine cell firing by hyperpolarizing RMTg GABAergic cells and reducing GABA release from their synapses on VTA dopamine cells (Johnson and North, 1992Johnson S.W. North R.A. Opioids excite dopamine neurons by hyperpolarization of local interneurons.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 483-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Gysling and Wang, 1983Gysling K. Wang R.Y.

As reported previously, DAMGO depressed oIPSC amplitude from RMTg afferents in VTA cells (40% ± 5% of baseline; Figures 1F and 1G). To test whether acute exposure to opiates also regulates the induction of LTD at RMTgGABA→VTA synapses, we measured LTD induced in the presence of DAMGO and found that LTD was unaffected (LTD: 75% ± 9% of baseline; Figures 1H–1J). RMTg synapses undergo LTD with LFS paired with mild postsynaptic depolarization, independently of μOR activation. Silencing local GABAergic interneurons in the VTA induces appetitive behaviors (Jennings et al., 2013Jennings J.H. Sparta D.R. Stamatakis A.M. Ung R.L. Pleil K.E. Kash T.L. Stuber G.D. Distinct extended amygdala circuits for divergent motivational states.Nature. 2013; 496: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), while the activation of these interneurons is aversive and disrupts reward consumption (Tan et al., 2012Tan K.R. Yvon C. Turiault M. Mirzabekov J.J. Doehner J. Labouèbe G. Deisseroth K. Tye K.M. Lüscher C.

Similarly, optogenetic activation of lateral habenula excitatory inputs on RMTg cells at 60 Hz in vivo results in robust place aversion (Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012Stamatakis A.M. Stuber G.D. Activation of lateral habenula inputs to the ventral midbrain promotes behavioral avoidance.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1105-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We therefore measured place aversion to stimulation of RMTgGABA terminals in the VTA using a real-time place preference procedure (RTPP; Figure 2A). We injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry in the RMTg of VGAT-IRES-Cre mice and implanted a light fiber above the VTA (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B). The RMTg typically has a high spontaneous firing rate, reportedly 3–9 Hz in vitro and 10–30 Hz in vivo (Lecca et al., 2011Lecca S. Melis M. Luchicchi A. Ennas M.G. Castelli M.P. Muntoni A.L.

Bourdy R. Courtin J. Veinante P. Manzoni O.J. Barrot M. Georges F. Neuronal circuits underlying acute morphine action on dopamine neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 16446-16450Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but the firing rate can increase to ≥50 Hz during the presentation of aversive stimuli, such as a strong footshock or mechanical stimulation (Lecca et al., 2011Lecca S. Melis M. Luchicchi A. Ennas M.G. Castelli M.P. Muntoni A.L. Pistis M. Effects of drugs of abuse on putative rostromedial tegmental neurons, inhibitory afferents to midbrain dopamine cells.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2011; 36: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We used 60 Hz optical stimulation in the VTA to drive RMTg synapses at a frequency that produced robust IPSCs in VTA neurons in vitro (Figures S2E and S2F), and found that ChR2-expressing mice reduced the time spent in the light-paired chamber compared with mice expressing the reporter only (F(1,10) = 10.66, p = 0.009; 60 Hz light test: reporter-only 38 ± 13 s, ChR2 −67 ± 22 s; n = 6 mice per group; p = 0.02; Figures 2B and 2E; Video S1). Avoidance persisted in a posttest conducted 24 h later without light stimulation (reporter-only 6 ± 27 s, ChR2 −95 ± 37 s, n = 6 mice; p = 0.02; Figure 2B). During the light tests and posttests, ChR2 mice decreased the number of entries into the light chamber compared to pretest values (Figure S2C), while the mean velocity in the light versus pretest and total distance traveled versus pretest were not significantly different (velocity: F(1,10) = 1.89, p = 0.20, distance: F(1,10) = 0.64, p = 0.44; Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, gross locomotor activity was unaffected by light stimulation, as performance on a rotarod test with and without 60 Hz light stimulation did not differ between ChR2 and reporter-only mice (Figure S2D). These data support our hypothesis that the activation of GABAergic RMTg synapses in the VTA is aversive. As in all such studies, our in vivo optical stimulation must be interpreted conservatively, given the possibility of the activation of axon collaterals to other brain regions or of fibers of passage. RMTg projections are strongest to the VTA and substantia nigra, so a light fiber placed above the VTA could in theory provide some activation of axons to the neighboring substantia nigra. However, our observation of aversion is consistent with previous observ"

The demand for creativity, however, exceeds the degree to which it is available and developed. The current project aimed to test the effectiveness of a one-year creativity training program for higher education. The creativity of students following the training was measured before, halfway, and after the training. In addition to the within-subjects comparison across time, performance was compared to a matched control group. At each of the measurement points, different versions of seven well-validated creativity tasks (capturing divergent and convergent creative thinking skills) were employed. The creativity training increased students' ideation skills and, more importantly their cognitive flexibility. However, no difference in originality was observed. Finally, an increase in performance was observed for one of the convergent creativity tasks, the Remote Associate Test. Implications for educational settings and directions for future research are discussed."

By construction, the new family contains a myriad of new flexible lifetime distributions having strong physical interpretations (lifetime system, biological studies…). We discuss the characteristics and properties of the EPGWPS family, including its probability density and hazard rate functions, quantiles, moments, incomplete moments, skewness and kurtosis. The main vocation of the EPGWPS family remains to be applied in a statistical setting, and data analysis in particular. In this regard, we explore the estimation of the model parameters by the maximum likelihood method, with accuracy supported by a detailed simulation study. Then, we apply it to two practical data sets, showing the applicability and competitiveness of the EPGWPS models in comparison to some other well-reputed models."
https://openalex.org/W3011780274,"Background Anemia, which is a major public health problem worldwide, represents a decline in the oxygenation function, and can therefore be related to low strength. However, hemoglobin cannot repair muscles directly, but is beneficial only in a supportive role. Previous studies on the relationship between handgrip strength and anemia have been controversial. Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between handgrip strength and anemia in Korean adults. Methods This cross-sectional study used the 2013–2017 data from the 6th and 7th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) that included 16,638 Korean adults, aged ≥19 years, who met the inclusion or exclusion criteria. Differences in sociodemographic factors (sex, age, education, income, and employment), lifestyle factors (alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity), and illness and health factors [body mass index (BMI), vitamin intake, iron intake, comorbid illnesses, and handgrip strength] by existence of anemia, were analyzed using the Chi square test. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to measure the association between handgrip strength and anemia, while adjusting for other possible confounders. Subgroup analysis, stratified by sex and age, was performed. Results Among Korean adults aged ≥19 years, 745,296 (7.7%) had anemia. A higher odds ratio, adjusted for other covariates/factors (OR) of anemia occurred in the weak handgrip strength group than in the strong handgrip strength group (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.58–2.33). The subgroup analysis showed a higher OR adjusted for other covariates/factors of anemia in the weak handgrip strength group than in the strong handgrip strength group, regardless of sex or age. However, the association was greater for males (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.35–3.34) and for those aged ≥65 years (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.42–2.58). Conclusion This study showed a strong association between handgrip strength and anemia that was particularly strong for males and those aged ≥65 years."
https://openalex.org/W3011681679,"Antibodies are widely used as cancer therapeutics, but their current use is limited by the low number of antigens restricted to cancer cells. A receptor tyrosine kinase, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), is normally expressed only during embryogenesis and is tightly down-regulated in postnatal healthy tissues. However, it is up-regulated in a diverse set of hematologic and solid malignancies, thus ROR2 represents a candidate antigen for antibody-based cancer therapy. Here we describe the affinity maturation and humanization of a rabbit mAb that binds human and mouse ROR2 but not human ROR1 or other human cell-surface antigens. Co-crystallization of the parental rabbit mAb in complex with the human ROR2 kringle domain (hROR2-Kr) guided affinity maturation by heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3)-focused mutagenesis and selection. The affinity-matured rabbit mAb was then humanized by complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting and framework fine tuning and again co-crystallized with hROR2-Kr. We show that the affinity-matured and humanized mAb retains strong affinity and specificity to ROR2 and, following conversion to a T cell-engaging bispecific antibody, has potent cytotoxicity toward ROR2-expressing cells. We anticipate that this humanized affinity-matured mAb will find application for antibody-based cancer therapy of ROR2-expressing neoplasms."

We examine the extent to which the changes that accompany economic growth will ""solve"" water and sanitation problems in SSA and, if so, how long it will take. Our simulations suggest that WASH-related mortality will continue to differ markedly across countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, expected economic growth alone will not be sufficient to eliminate WASH-related mortality or eliminate the economic losses associated with poor access to water and sanitation infrastructure by 2050. In other countries, WASH-related mortality will sharply decline, although the economic losses associated with the time spent collecting water are forecast to persist. Overall, our findings suggest that in a subset of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Angola, Niger, Sierra Leone, Chad and several others), WASH-related investments will remain a priority for decades and require a long-term, sustained effort from both the international community and national governments."

The offspring of this preferred hybrid mating event have higher fitness than nonhybrids in the same environment.

https://openalex.org/W3010993174,"Contact between inflammatory cells and endothelial cells (ECs) is a crucial step in vascular inflammation. Recently, we demonstrated that the cell-surface level of endomucin (EMCN), a heavily O-glycosylated single-transmembrane sialomucin, interferes with the interactions between inflammatory cells and ECs. We have also shown that, in response to an inflammatory stimulus, EMCN is cleared from the cell surface by an unknown mechanism. In this study, using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a tagged EMCN in human umbilical vein ECs, we found that treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or the strong oxidant pervanadate leads to loss of cell-surface EMCN and increases the levels of the C-terminal fragment of EMCN 3- to 4-fold. Furthermore, treatment with the broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat (BB94) or inhibition of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) and ADAM17 with two small-molecule inhibitors, GW280264X and GI254023X, or with siRNA significantly reduced basal and TNFα-induced cell-surface EMCN cleavage. Release of the C-terminal fragment of EMCN by TNF-α treatment was blocked by chemical inhibition of ADAM10 alone or in combination with ADAM17. These results indicate that cell-surface EMCN undergoes constitutive cleavage and that TNF-α treatment dramatically increases this cleavage, which is mediated predominantly by ADAM10 and ADAM17. As endothelial cell-surface EMCN attenuates leukocyte–EC interactions during inflammation, we propose that EMCN is a potential therapeutic target to manage vascular inflammation."

Populations were generated by sampling PIs from the US, the Republic of Korea, and the full collection of PIs maintained by the USDA. Additionally, a meta-analysis of QDRL reported from bi-parental studies was done to compare past and present findings. Twenty-four significant marker-trait associations were identified from the 478 PIs phenotyped with OH.121, and an additional 24 marker-trait associations were identified from the 495 PIs phenotyped with C2.S1. In total, 48 significant markers were distributed across 16 chromosomes and based on linkage analysis, represent a total of 44 QDRL. The majority of QDRL were identified with only one of the two isolates, and only a region on chromosome 13 was consistently identified. Regions on chromosomes 3, 13, and 17 were identified in previous GWA-analyses and were re-identified in this study. Five QDRL co-localized with P. sojae meta-QDRL identified from QDRL reported in previous biparental mapping studies. The remaining regions represent novel QDRL, in the soybean-P. sojae pathosystem and were primarily identified in germplasm from the Republic of Korea. Overall, the number of loci identified in this study highlights the complexity of QDR to P. sojae."

The use of captive bats in research has intensified over the past decade as researchers aim to examine the virus-reservoir host interface. In this study, we investigated the effects of captivity on the fecal bacterial microbiome of an insectivorous microbat, Mops condylurus, a species that roosts in close proximity to humans and has likely transmitted viral infections to humans. Using amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized changes in fecal bacterial community composition for individual bats directly at the time of capture and again after six weeks in captivity. We found that microbial community richness by measure of the number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in bat feces increases in captivity. Importantly, we found the similarity of microbial community structures of fecal microbiomes between different bats to converge during captivity. We propose a six week-acclimatization period prior to carrying out infection studies or other research influenced by the microbiome composition, which may be advantageous to reduce variation in microbiome composition and minimize biological variation inherent to in vivo experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W3012135608,"Despite calls to engage men in HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention efforts, effective approaches to reach and engage men in low-resource, high-HIV prevalence settings are limited. We identified and engaged social networks of mostly young men in a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a combined microfinance and peer health leadership intervention to prevent HIV and IPV. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial among 60 social networks locally referred to as “camps” within Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Camps were randomly assigned (1:1) to a microfinance and peer health leadership intervention or a control condition that received a brief delayed intervention after the study’s conclusion. Allocation was not masked to participants or researchers. Behavioral assessments were conducted at baseline and 30-months post-intervention launch, with biological samples drawn at 30-months to test for sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Primary outcomes included prevalence of STIs and past-year IPV perpetration. Secondary outcomes included STI sexual risk behaviors and past-year HIV testing. Proximal intervention targets included inequitable gender norm attitudes and hope. A modified Poisson regression approach was used to estimate intention-to-treat intervention effects on outcomes assessed at the 30-month follow-up. We enrolled 1,258 men within 60 camps. Of these men, 1,029 (81.8%) completed the 30-month follow-up. There were no differences by condition in STI prevalence, IPV perpetration, or sexual risk behaviors at the 30-month follow-up. Intervention participants reported greater levels of past-year HIV testing, controlling for baseline testing (aRR 1.13 95% CI 1.005–1.28). They also reported significantly lower levels of inequitable gender norm attitudes (adjusted effect -0.11, 95% CI -0.21–0.003). We successfully engaged and retained social networks of men in this multilevel intervention study. While we did not see an effect on the primary outcomes, our intervention successfully improved HIV testing and reduced inequitable gender norm attitudes."

Combinations of ETO-Cur and TRF were used to determine the combinatorial effects of ETO-Cur and TRF-mediated inhibition of growth of CRC cells in vitro and HCT-116 cells xenograft in SCID mice. 16S rRNA gene sequence profiling was performed to determine the outcome of gut microbial communities in mice feces between control and ETO-Cur-TRF groups. Bacterial identifications were validated by performing SYBR-based Real Time (RT) PCR. For metagenomics analysis to characterize the microbial communities, multiple software/tools were used, including Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) processing tool. We found ETO-Cur and TRF to synergize and that the combination of ETO-Cur-TRF significantly inhibited growth of HCT-116 xenografts in SCID mice. This was associated with a marked alteration in microbial communities and increased microbial OTU (operation taxonomic unit) number. The relative abundance of taxa was increased and the level of microbial diversity after 34 days of combinatorial treatment was found to be 44% higher over the control. Shifting of microbial family composition was observed in ETO-Cur-TRF treated mice as evidenced by marked reductions in Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, Firmicutes and Parabacteroids families, compared to controls. Interestingly, during the inhibition of tumor growth in ETO-Cur treated mice, probiotic Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae were increased by 20-fold and 6-fold, respectively. The relative abundance of anti-inflammatory Clostridium XIVa was also increased in ETO-Cur-TRF treated mice when compared with the control. Our data suggest that ETO-Cur-TRF show synergistic effects in inhibiting colorectal cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in mouse xenografts in vivo, and might induce changes in microbial diversity in mice."

TP53mut, CDKN2Amut and QuadWT mutational status did not impact clinical outcomes including median TTP, median OS, 6-month and 12-month OS, 6-month and 12-month without progression, ORR and DCR. There was a trend towards improved median TTP and DCR in CDKN2Amut cohort and a trend towards worsened median TTP in the QuadWT cohort.Cell cycle regulators such as TP53 and CDKN2A do not appear to significantly alter clinical outcomes when immune checkpoint inhibitors are used."
https://openalex.org/W3011769569,"Many Lactobacillus species are frequently isolated from dairy products, animal guts, and the vaginas of healthy women. However, sequencing-based identification of isolated Lactobacillus strain is time/cost-consuming and lobor-intensive. In this study, we developed a multiplex PCR method to distinguish six closely related species in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group (L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. jensenii, L. crispatus, and L. gallinarum), which is based on species-specific primer sets. Altogether, 86 genomes of 9 Lactobacillus species from the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database were compared to detect species-specific genes and design six species-specific primer sets. The PCR conditions of the individual primer sets were optimized via gradient PCR methods. A final multiplex PCR condition was also optimized for a mixture of all six primer sets mixed. When identifying a single strain, the optimized multiplex PCR method can specifically detect one of the six species, but no band was amplified at least from the other Lactobacillus and Enterococcus species. These results indicated that species-specific primer sets designed from the genome comparison could identify one strain within the six Lactobacillus species by a single PCR reaction. Using the method described here, we will be able to save time, cost, and labor during species identification and screening of commercially important probiotic lactobacilli."
https://openalex.org/W3011966254,"This study assessed the prevalence of concurrently wasted and stunted (WaSt) children, their characteristics, treatment outcomes and response; and factors associated with time to recovery among children aged 6-59 months admitted to Outpatient Therapeutic Care (OTC) in Karamoja, Uganda. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with data from January 2016 to October 2017 for children admitted to nine OTCs in Karamoja. We defined wasted, stunted and underweight as 2.0 Z-scores below the median per WHO growth standards and < 12.5 cm for low Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). WaSt was defined as concurrently wasted and stunted. Out of 788 eligible children included in the analysis; 48.7% (95% CI; 45.2-52.2) had WaSt. WaSt was common among males; 56.3% (95% CI; 51.3-61.3). Median age was 18 months in WaSt versus 12 months in non-WaSt children (p < 0.001). All WaSt children were underweight; and more severely wasted than non-WaSt children. During recovery, WaSt children gained weight more rapidly than non-WaSt children (2.2g/kg/day vs. 1.7g/kg/day). WaSt children had lower recovery rate (58.0% vs. 65.4%; p = 0.037). The difference in median time of recovery between WaSt and non-WaSt children (63 days vs. 56 days; p = 0.465) was not significant. Factors associated with time to recovery were children aged 24-59 months (aHR = 1.30; 95% CI;1.07-1.57;), children with MUAC 10.5-11.4 cm (aHR = 2.03; 95% CI; 1.55-2.66), MUAC ≥ 11.5 cm at admission (aHR = 3.31; 95% CI; 2.17-5.02) and living in Moroto (aHR = 3.34; 95% CI; 2.60-4.30) and Nakapiripirit (aHR = 1.95; 95% CI; 1.51-2.53) districts. The magnitude of children with WaSt in OTC shows that existing therapeutic feeding protocols could be used to detect and treat WaSt children. Further research is needed to identify and address the factors associated with sub-optimal recovery in WaSt children for effective OTC programming in Karamoja."
https://openalex.org/W3011076650,"In the Amazon basin, indigenous forest-dwelling communities typically suffer from a high burden of infectious diseases, including malaria. Difficulties in accessing these isolated ethnic groups, such as the semi-nomadic Yanomami, make official malaria data largely underestimated. In the current study, we longitudinally surveyed microscopic and submicroscopic malaria infection in four Yanomami villages of the Marari community in the northern-most region of the Brazilian Amazon. Malaria parasite species-specific PCR-based detection of ribosomal and non-ribosomal targets showed that approximately 75% to 80% of all malaria infections were submicroscopic, with the ratio of submicroscopic to microscopic infection remaining stable over the 4-month follow-up period. Although the prevalence of malaria infection fluctuated over time, microscopically-detectable parasitemia was only found in children and adolescents, presumably reflecting their higher susceptibility to malaria infection. As well as temporal variation, the prevalence of malaria infection differed significantly between villages (from 1% to 19%), demonstrating a marked heterogeneity at micro-scales. Over the study period, Plasmodium vivax was the most commonly detected malaria parasite species, followed by P. malariae, and much less frequently P. falciparum. Consecutive blood samples from 859 out of the 981 studied Yanomami showed that malaria parasites were detected in only 8% of the previously malaria-positive individuals, with most of them young children (median age 3 yrs). Overall, our results show that molecular tools are more sensitive for the identification of malaria infection among the Yanomami, which is characterized by heterogeneous transmission, a predominance of low-density infections, circulation of multiple malaria parasite species, and a higher susceptibility in young children. Our findings are important for the design and implementation of the new strategic interventions that will be required for the elimination of malaria from isolated indigenous populations in Latin America."
https://openalex.org/W3011660106,"Plant molecular farming (PMF) is a convenient and cost-effective way to produce high-value recombinant proteins that can be used in the production of a range of health products, from pharmaceutical therapeutics to cosmetic products. New plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) provide a means to enhance PMF systems more quickly and with greater precision than ever before. However, the feasibility, regulatory standing and social acceptability of both PMF and NPBTs are in question. This paper explores the perceptions of key stakeholders on two European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 programmes–Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana–towards the barriers and facilitators of PMF and NPBTs in Europe. One-on-one qualitative interviews were undertaken with N = 20 individuals involved in one or both of the two projects at 16 institutions in seven countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain and the UK). The findings indicate that the current EU regulatory environment and the perception of the public towards biotechnology are seen as the main barriers to scaling-up PMF and NPBTs. Competition from existing systems and the lack of plant-specific regulations likewise present challenges for PMF developing beyond its current niche. However, respondents felt that the communication of the benefits and purpose of NPBT PMF could provide a platform for improving the social acceptance of genetic modification. The importance of the media in this process was highlighted. This article also uses the multi-level perspective to explore the ways in which NPBTs are being legitimated by interested parties and the systemic factors that have shaped and are continuing to shape the development of PMF in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W3011000293,"Background About one-third of the cervical cancer cases in Sweden occur in women over the age of 60. The primary aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of HPV, and HPV related dysplasia, in elderly women who had an HPV negative test at the age of 60 years or older. Methods From October 2004 to June 2019, 1784 women aged 60–90 years were sampled for an HPV test when attending an outpatient gynecology clinic. Of these women, 827 HPV-negative women had two or more HPV tests at intervals of three months to eleven years (mean 3.2 years). The women with positive results had a repeat HPV test and cytology after 2.5 months on average. Those with a positive repeat HPV test were examined by colposcopy and biopsy. Findings The overall prevalence of HPV was 5.4%, (95%CI 4.4–6.6, 96/1784). The incidence of HPV in the 827 women, who were HPV negative in their first test, was 2.4% (95%CI 1.5–3.8, n = 20). At the repeat test 1.2% remained positive (95%CI 0.6–2.3, n = 10). HPV-related dysplasia diagnosed by histology was found in 1.2% (95%CI 0.6–2.3, n = 10) of the 827 women. CIN2+ was found in 0.5% (95%CI 0.2–1.3, n = 4). In the repeat HPV test 52.6% 10/19) were HPV positive. The time between an HPV negative test and an HPV positive test and CIN2+ was on average 45.5 months (range 10–85 months). The positive predictive value (PPV) for CIN2+ was 20.0% in the first positive HPV test and 40.0% in the repeat HPV test. The women with CIN2+ had normal cytology. No cancer or glandular dysplasia was detected. Interpretation In this study older HPV-negative women were at risk of becoming HPV positive. Among the women who were HPV positive in a repeat test, there was a high risk of dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W3011066454,"Background In the clinical dental consultation, multi-party configurations predominate with the presence of parents/ primary caregivers in pediatric dentistry adding another layer of complexity. In managing child oral healthcare, parents/ primary caregivers are critical, especially in dental caries prevention. This study aimed (1) to identify the structure of oral health literacy (OHL) talk in interpreter-mediated pediatric dentistry and (2) to analyze interpreter contributions to the communication strategies: patient-centered direct interpreting (PC-DI), patient-centered mediated interpreting (PC-MI), clinician-centered direct interpreting (CC-DI), and clinician-centered mediated interpreting (CC-MI). Methods Visual text analysis (VTA) of video recorded pediatric clinical consultations in Hong Kong utilized Discursis™ software to illustrate temporal and topical structures and their distribution across turns-at-talk. Conversation analysis (CA) was applied to analyze turn-taking of the identified OHL talk qualitatively. The mixed-method approach of combining VTA and CA was applied to analyze the patterns and features of the recorded OHL talk. Results The conceptual recurrences of the 77 transcribed video recordings were plotted visually. CC- and PC-OHL talk were identified by the recurrence patterns of monochromatic and multi-colored triangular clusters formed by off-diagonal boxes, respectively. CA of interpreter-mediated turns supported earlier findings regarding patterns of MI in multilingual adult dental consultations; however, the role of the interpreter in parent/ primary caregiver education and patient management was more distinctive in the pediatric dentistry. Conclusions The mixed-method approach assisted in unpacking the complexities of the multi-party interactions, supported identification of effective communication strategies, and illustrated the roles of the dental professionals in initiating CC- and PC-OHL talk in pediatric dentistry. The intervention showed the implication of the professional education of evidence-based practices for clinicians in balancing agenda management and the communicative dimension of OHL with the help of VTA and CA in multilingual consultations."
https://openalex.org/W3011774145,"Adolescent girls in West Africa are migrating in search of educational and livelihood opportunities. In Mali, early marriage (before the legal age of 16) is a common practice. This paper builds on prior research on female migration that focused on the direct influences of migration on marriage and explores the wider social impact of rising female migration in sending communities by examining direct and indirect effects and intended and unintended consequences. This study examines perceptions about migration among girls and their parents including how it influences marital timing, marriage preparations, marriage practices, and marital relations. Qualitative data were collected from 140 adolescent girls and 115 parents of adolescent girls in rural areas in focus group discussions (FGDs) (n = 31) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) (n = 41) to inform how girls’ migration patterns might influence program recruitment strategies and content for an intervention aimed at addressing early marriage in Mali. Our findings concur with earlier studies that migration has direct effects on marriage because it allows girls to both avoid early marriage and prepare for marriage through the assembly of goods and wares to bring to their conjugal homes. Despite some of the perceived risks of migration on marriage, the indirect effects of migration include allowing girls to see different types of marriage practices and marital relationships between husbands and wives and potentially allowing migrant girls to exert more influence over the marital process compared to non-migrants. However, migration can expose girls to new ideas and alternatives that may be incongruent with cultural expectations for them once they return to their communities. This study suggests that migration is seen as an inevitable part of life for many adolescent girls in Mali. Girls who migrate may return to their villages with not only items or income that provide direct benefits to a marriage, but also viewpoints on the expectations for women and girls in their communities that indirectly influence marital relationships. Although this can be challenging for individual returned girls in terms of reintegration, these new expectations may, over time, lead to social changes that influence migrants and non-migrants. Program strategies and approaches must consider the possibility of migration as an important aspect of every adolescent girl’s opportunity structure. The qualitative data suggests that certain skills are critical for adolescent girls. Programs should emphasize the acquisition of relevant skills such as communication, risk assessment, negotiation and money management in ways that are relevant for migrants and non-migrants."
https://openalex.org/W3010733180,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting one in eight women in their lifetime. Taxane-based chemotherapy is routinely used in the treatment of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a predictive biomarker to improve the benefit/risk ratio for that cytotoxic chemotherapy. We explicitly strived for a biomarker that enables secure translation into clinical practice. We used genome-wide gene expression data of the Hatzis et al. discovery cohort of 310 patients for biomarker development and three independent cohorts with a total of 567 breast cancer patients for validation. We were able to develop a biomarker signature that consists of just the three gene products ELF5, SCUBE2 and NFIB, measured on RNA level. Compared to Hatzis et al., we achieved a significant improvement in predicting responders and non-responders in the Hatzis et al. validation cohort with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.73 [95% CI, 69%—77%]. Moreover, we could confirm the performance of our biomarker on two further independent validation cohorts. The overall performance on all three validation cohorts expressed as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.75 [95% CI, 70%—80%]. At the clinically relevant classifier’s operation point to optimize the exclusion of non-responders, the biomarker correctly predicts three out of four patients not responding to neoadjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy, independent of the breast cancer subtype. At the same time, the response rate in the group of predicted responders increased to 42% compared to 23% response rate in all patients of the validation cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3010981899,"The heterotrophic microalgae Crypthecodinium cohnii was usually cultivated in complex medium containing glucose, yeast extract and sea salt. For the preparation of DHA with highest purity, a new defined medium without the yeast extract was developed. Different inoculated densities, C/N ratios, temperatures, culture volumes and glucose additions were investigated to optimize the algal growth rate and DHA production. The growth period in C. cohnii was shortened from 12-14 days to 7-8 days, the OD600 was enhanced from 2.0 to 3.0, the glucose consumption was accelerated and used up on day 3-4, and the DHA content in culture were increased from 10 to 45 nmoles/300 μl batch. It was found that C. cohnii had optimal growth and DHA accumulation in 25 °C, 0.2 inoculated density, 5-10 C/N ratio, 5:1 air/culture volume ratio. This is the first time DHA production using C.cohnii has been optimized in synthetic medium. This allows preparation of uniformly radiolabeled 13C- and 14C-DHA."
https://openalex.org/W3012502982,"Owing to increasing medical expenses, researchers have attempted to detect clinical signs and preventive measures of diseases using electronic health record (EHR). In particular, time-series EHRs collected by periodic medical check-up enable us to clarify the relevance among check-up results and individual environmental factors such as lifestyle. However, usually such time-series data have many missing observations and some results are strongly correlated to each other. These problems make the analysis difficult and there exists strong demand to detect clinical findings beyond them. We focus on blood test values in medical check-up results and apply a time-series analysis methodology using a state space model. It can infer the internal medical states emerged in blood test values and handle missing observations. The estimated models enable us to predict one's blood test values under specified condition and predict the effect of intervention, such as changes of body composition and lifestyle. We use time-series data of EHRs periodically collected in the Hirosaki cohort study in Japan and elucidate the effect of 17 environmental factors to 38 blood test values in elderly people. Using the estimated model, we then simulate and compare time-transitions of participant's blood test values under several lifestyle scenarios. It visualizes the impact of lifestyle changes for the prevention of diseases. Finally, we exemplify that prediction errors under participant's actual lifestyle can be partially explained by genetic variations, and some of their effects have not been investigated by traditional association studies."
https://openalex.org/W3011485119,"Dermatoglyphic patterns on the fingers often differ in syndromes and other conditions with a developmental component, compared to the general population. Previous literature on the relationship between orofacial clefts-the most common craniofacial birth defect in humans-and dermatoglyphics is inconsistent, with some studies reporting altered pattern frequencies and/or increased asymmetry and others failing to find differences. To investigate dermatoglyphics in orofacial clefting, we obtained dermatoglyphic patterns in a large multiethnic cohort of orofacial cleft cases (N = 367), their unaffected family members (N = 836), and controls (N = 299). We categorized fingerprint pattern types from males and females who participated at five sites of the Pittsburgh Orofacial Cleft study (Hungary, United States of America (Pennsylvania, Texas), Spain, and Argentina). We also calculated a pattern dissimilarity score for each individual as a measure of left-right asymmetry. We tested for group differences in the number of arches, ulnar and radial loops, and whorls on each individual's hands, and in the pattern dissimilarity scores using ANOVA. After taking sex and site differences into account, we did not find any significant pattern count differences between cleft and non-cleft individuals. Notably, we did observe increased pattern dissimilarity in individuals with clefts, compared to both their unaffected relatives and controls. Increased dermatoglyphic pattern dissimilarity in individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts may reflect a generalized developmental instability."
https://openalex.org/W3011413611,"Community detection in complex networks is an important issue in network science. Several statistical measures have been proposed and widely applied to detecting the communities in various complex networks. However, due to the lack of flexibility resolution, some of them have to encounter the resolution limit and thus are not compatible with multi-scale structures of complex networks. In this paper, we investigated a statistical measure of interest for community detection, Significance [Sci. Rep. 3 (2013) 2930], and analyzed its critical behaviors based on the theoretical derivation of critical number of communities and the phase diagram in community-partition transition. It was revealed that Significance exhibits far higher resolution than the traditional Modularity when the intra- and inter-link densities of communities are obviously different. Following the critical analysis, we developed a multi-resolution version of Significance for identifying communities in the multi-scale networks. Experimental tests in several typical networks have been performed and confirmed that the generalized Significance can be competent for the multi-scale communities detection. Moreover, it can effectively relax the first- and second-type resolution limits. Finally, we displayed an important potential application of the multi-scale Significance in computational biology: disease-gene identification, showing that extracting information from the perspective of multi-scale module mining is helpful for disease gene prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3012214170,"Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have the potential to work as biological therapeutics. OKT3, Herceptin, Keytruda and others have positively impacted healthcare. Antibodies evolved naturally to provide high specificity and high affinity once mature. These characteristics can make them useful as therapeutics. However, we may be missing characteristics that are not obvious. We present a means of measuring antibodies in an unbiased manner that may highlight therapeutic activity. We propose using a microarray of random peptides to assess antibody properties. We tested twenty-four different commercial antibodies to gain some perspective about how much information can be derived from binding antibodies to random peptide libraries. Some monoclonals preferred to bind shorter peptides, some longer, some preferred motifs closer to the C-term, some nearer the N-term. We tested some antibodies with clinical activity but whose function was blinded to us at the time. We were provided with twenty-one different monoclonal antibodies, thirteen mouse and eight human IgM. These antibodies produced a variety of binding patterns on the random peptide arrays. When unblinded, the antibodies with polyspecific binding were the ones with the greatest therapeutic activity. The protein target to these therapeutic monoclonals is still unknown but using common sequence motifs from the peptides we predicted several human and mouse proteins. The same five highest proteins appeared in both mouse and human lists."
https://openalex.org/W3011012443,"Whilst susceptibility variants for many complex diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have been well characterised, the mechanism by which risk is mediated is still unclear for many loci. This is especially true for the majority of variants that do not affect protein-coding regions. lncRNA represent a group of molecules that have been shown to be enriched amongst variants associated with RA and other complex diseases, compared to random variants. In order to establish to what degree direct disruption of lncRNA may represent a potential mechanism for mediating RA susceptibility, we chose to further explore this overlap. By testing the ability of annotated features to improve a model of disease susceptibility, we were able to demonstrate a local enrichment of enhancers from immune-relevant cell types amongst RA susceptibility variants (log2 enrichment 3.40). This was not possible for lncRNA annotations in general, however a small, but significant enrichment was observed for immune-enriched lncRNA (log2 enrichment 0.867002). This enrichment was no longer apparent when the model was conditioned on immune-relevant enhancers (log2 enrichment -0.372734), suggesting that direct disruption of lncRNA sequence, independent of enhancer disruption, does not represent a major mechanism by which susceptibility to complex diseases is mediated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, in keeping with general lncRNA characteristics, immune-enriched lncRNA are expressed at low levels that may not be amenable to functional characterisation."

We explored rural women's perceptions and beliefs regarding barriers to vasectomy use in the low resource setting of Pwani, Tanzania. The qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to obtain data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 married/cohabiting women with two or more children. Thematic analysis guided the data analysis, with qualitative data reporting informed by COREQ guidelines. Most participants were Muslim and had between two and six children. Most had completed primary-level education and were engaged in small-scale farming. We extracted three main themes with associated sub-themes:1) lack of education, which included men's education levels and inadequate knowledge and misinformation 2) religious beliefs, social pressure and stigma, which included community stigma and the belief that vasectomy was not good for men with multiple wives; and 3) promoting men's involvement in family planning which included educating men and the women's perceived role in promoting vasectomy. Participating women perceived vasectomy uptake to be affected by a lack of low knowledge (among men, women, and the community), misinformation, and various sociocultural barriers. Efforts to promote vasectomy and male involvement in reproductive health services should be directed to addressing deeply-rooted sociocultural barriers. Women may have an essential role in encouraging their partners' vasectomy uptake. In addition, engaging couples in family planning education is critical to enhance knowledge. Ideally, such community based education should be conducted in partnership with communities and healthcare providers."

The aggregation, sitting on the French island called Ile aux Cochons, lies between Madagascar and Antarctica. Various colonies of the species, which numbers 3.2 million birds, are mostly rebounding from centuries of human hunting. But with more than half of the world9s 18 penguin species declining in numbers, the collapse inspired scientists to investigate. In November 2019, a team conducted a 5-day expedition to the island, collecting tissue samples and tagging 10 birds with satellite transmitters. So far, the data suggest the warming waters that circle Antarctica may be the culprit. There, a thermal boundary where the penguins9 prey lie has shifted away from their colony, making it harder to forage. The expedition also illustrates the logistical, political, and physical challenges of conducting biology on the bottom of the planet."
https://openalex.org/W3011565658,"The earliest recorded sighting of Antarctica was made 200 years ago in 1820, when the first Russian Antarctic expedition, led by Captain Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, encountered what is now called the Fimbul Ice Shelf. In commemoration of that historic event, we present this special issue on Antarctica. The defining aspect of Antarctica is its massive ice sheet. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is Earth's largest reservoir of fresh water, with the capacity to raise sea level by more than 60 meters if it were to completely melt into the ocean. Additionally, Antarctica is one of the great archives of past climate: The EPICA Dome C ice core, for example, provides a continuous record of the past 800,000 years and represents one of the crowning achievements of modern climate science.

This special issue describes the formation of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the geological processes controlling its existence; the ice sheet's evolution, as affected by its interaction with the surrounding ocean; and how the continent's ice is expected to change in our warming future. We also examine a more biological facet of the region—the mysterious recent die-off of penguins on a remote Antarctic island. Together, the contents of this special issue provide a window into the physical aspects and fauna of this remarkable part of the world."

https://openalex.org/W3011262116,"In spite of its acoustic diversity, the speech signal presents statistical regularities that can be exploited by biological or artificial systems for efficient coding. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) revealed that on small time scales (∼ 10 ms), the overall structure of speech is well captured by a time-frequency representation whose frequency selectivity follows the same power law in the high frequency range 1–8 kHz as cochlear frequency selectivity in mammals. Variations in the power-law exponent, i.e. different time-frequency trade-offs, have been shown to provide additional adaptation to phonetic categories. Here, we adopt a parametric approach to investigate the variations of the exponent at a finer level of speech. The estimation procedure is based on a measure that reflects the sparsity of decompositions in a set of Gabor dictionaries whose atoms are Gaussian-modulated sinusoids. We examine the variations of the exponent associated with the best decomposition, first at the level of phonemes, then at an intra-phonemic level. We show that this analysis offers a rich interpretation of the fine-grained statistical structure of speech, and that the exponent values can be related to key acoustic properties. Two main results are: i) for plosives, the exponent is lowered by the release bursts, concealing higher values during the opening phases; ii) for vowels, the exponent is bound to formant bandwidths and decreases with the degree of acoustic radiation at the lips. This work further suggests that an efficient coding strategy is to reduce frequency selectivity with sound intensity level, congruent with the nonlinear behavior of cochlear filtering."
