With the exception of one unconfirmed report, reproductive stages of these fungi have not been described1. Numerous attempts to isolate the fungus from infected tissue have been unsuccessful, and mycelial transplants unattached to a piece of infected plant tissue have never survived2. Butler3 pointed out the close relationship of the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to the Endogonaceæ, and concurred with Peyronel's view that they are probably members of this family."

https://openalex.org/W2009128069,"IN Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium, members of the Acrasieæ, there is an aggregation stage in which previously independent amœboid cells stream towards certain cell clumps, which thus act as collecting centres, and there form communal fruiting bodies1. Communication between the centres and the reacting cells is through the external medium. Bonner2 produced indirect evidence that a chemical diffused outwards from the centres, setting up a concentration gradient by which the separate cells oriented themselves; pointing out that isolation in vitro would be the final proof of the chemical's existence, he named it ‘acrasin’."

https://openalex.org/W112069602,"The recent development by Craig (l-3) of an all-glass machine for liquidliquid counter-current fractionation makes possible the application of his method to the separation of porphyrins which cannot readily be separated by the sensitive Willstatter “HCl number” method. In this paper we have studied the application of the Craig method to the separation of a mixture of three known porphyrins, using the Willstiitter system of aqueous HCl and ether. The principle of separating porphyrins by liquid-liquid partition was first used in 1906 by Willstatter and Mieg (4). In their method, the porphyrin mixture was dissolved in ether and the ether solution was extracted successively with equal volumes of increasingly higher concentrations of aqueous HCl. They defined a partition value called the HCl number as that per cent of HCl (in gm. per 100 cc.) in the aqueous phase which would extract two-thirds of the porphyrin from the ether phase when the volume of the aqueous phase saturated with ether was equal to the volume of the ether phase saturated with water. In 1937 Zeile and Rau (5) attempted to extend the method of Willstatter and Mieg to the separation of a mixture of two porphyrins that differed only slightly in their HCl numbers, namely deuteroporphyrin (HCl number = 0.36) and mesoporphyrin (HCl number = 0.60) (Fig. 1). They calculated that, starting with a 1: 1 mixture of these porphyrins, it should be possible to obtain one-third of the mesoporphyrin admixed with only 1.3 per cent of deuteroporphyrin after 60 successive extractions. The Craig method, as we shall see below, permits a complete separation of these two porphyrins, uncontaminated with each other, and at the same time has made possible the recognition of unsuspected porphyrin impurities in the original crystalline materials."

In a further investigation the pH of the oviducts of seventy sheep, recovered at slaughter from the abattoir, was determined by using Lovibond's comparator. This material covered all stages of the œstrous cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2086259029,"WHILE investigating the chromatographic separation of sugars upon filter paper impregnated with sodium borate buffer (0.05 N borax, pH 9.18) it was found that the carbohydrates showed up prominently on spraying with 80 per cent aqueous ethanol containing either 1 mgm./ml. of phenolphthalein or phenol red just made alkaline with sodium hydroxide. Phenolphthalein gave rise to white spots on a purple background and was rather more effective than phenol red, which gave yellow spots on a purple background."
https://openalex.org/W2030550517,"THE means by which the pars distalis of the adenohypophysis (‘the anterior lobe of the pituitary’ or ‘anterior lobe’) adjusts its secretions to the requirements of the body continue to be the subject of much inquiry and speculation. Apart from the reciprocal interaction of the anterior lobe with such endocrine organs as are under its control (for example, the adrenal cortex and gonads), it is generally accepted that the gland is able to respond to changes which are mediated through the nervous system. For example, it is known that the reproductive organs of the ferret, which in Great Britain breeds only between March and August, can be activated during the winter months if the animal is exposed to additional light. This response is dependent on the presence of (a) the retina, (b) the pituitary, and (c) the gonads, and the presumption is that nerve impulses, first transmitted along the optic pathways, in some way stimulate the anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotrophic hormone. Unfortunately, attempts to track the actual pathways by which the impulses are relayed from the optic pathways to the gland have in large part failed1. Moreover, while it is definitely established that the whole neurohypophysis is innervated by hypothalamic nuclei, there is no agreement that nerve fibres reach the pars distalis of the adenohypophysis from this region of the brain2. Such sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres as enter it on the walls of the blood-vessels are usually assumed to be mainly vasomotor in function3."

https://openalex.org/W1983919077,"IT has been shown that the shielding of the liver in situ protects 73 per cent of a group of rats against a dose of X-rays which is 100 per cent lethal after fifteen days for the control animals1. E. S. G. Barron2 showed that glutathione had a protective action in mice when injected before the lethal irradiation. Bacq and his co-workers3 have shown that β-mercaptoethylamine protects mice against a lethal dose of X-rays when this compound is injected into the animals immediately before the total body irradiation. We have been able to confirm these results in rats4. On the other hand, the β-mercaptoethylamine is completely inactive when given even immediately after the exposure to a lethal dose."

With the view of throwing further light on this problem, the insecticidal treatment of soil was considered to be a convenient experimental technique, as special attention could be paid to the effects of the insecticides on the dominant soil arthropods, namely, Collembola and Acari."

https://openalex.org/W1995220489,"The antifibromatogenic potency of deoxycorticosterone—prevention of œstrogen-induced abdominal fibroids—diminishes through the substitution O=C11 (Kendall's compound A) and especially through OH– –C17 (Reichstein's compound S)1. The anti-fibromatogenic potency of cortisone,which differs from deoxycorticosterone by both these substitutions, is also strikingly diminished; there were fibroids even with as much as 1,000 µgm. of cortisone acetate per day. But, on the other hand, there apparently was some antifibromatogenic activity of compound F, or 17-hydroxy-corticosterone (OH– –C17 and OH—C11); we had thus to raise the question of a ‘protective’ action of OH—C11 against OH– –C17. However, in view of the variations of the fibrous tumoral effect met with in similar experiments, and especially in view of the small number of experiments performed with compound F, the conclusion as to the supposed ‘protective’ action of OH—C11 against OH– –C17 remained doubtful1. In the meantime, we have been able to settle this question in what seems to be a definite manner, thanks to the kindness of Messrs. Merck and Co., who put at our disposal the necessary quantities of compound F acetate."
