https://openalex.org/W1963580691,"Ray-finned fishes constitute the dominant radiation of vertebrates with over 32,000 species. Although molecular phylogenetics has begun to disentangle major evolutionary relationships within this vast section of the Tree of Life, there is no widely available approach for efficiently collecting phylogenomic data within fishes, leaving much of the enormous potential of massively parallel sequencing technologies for resolving major radiations in ray-finned fishes unrealized. Here, we provide a genomic perspective on longstanding questions regarding the diversification of major groups of ray-finned fishes through targeted enrichment of ultraconserved nuclear DNA elements (UCEs) and their flanking sequence. Our workflow efficiently and economically generates data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those produced by traditional approaches and is well-suited to working with museum specimens. Analysis of the UCE data set recovers a well-supported phylogeny at both shallow and deep time-scales that supports a monophyletic relationship between Amia and Lepisosteus (Holostei) and reveals elopomorphs and then osteoglossomorphs to be the earliest diverging teleost lineages. Our approach additionally reveals that sequence capture of UCE regions and their flanking sequence offers enormous potential for resolving phylogenetic relationships within ray-finned fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2026371916,"This paper examines the multiple atlas random diffeomorphic orbit model in Computational Anatomy (CA) for parameter estimation and segmentation of subcortical and ventricular neuroanatomy in magnetic resonance imagery. We assume that there exist multiple magnetic resonance image (MRI) atlases, each atlas containing a collection of locally-defined charts in the brain generated via manual delineation of the structures of interest. We focus on maximum a posteriori estimation of high dimensional segmentations of MR within the class of generative models representing the observed MRI as a conditionally Gaussian random field, conditioned on the atlas charts and the diffeomorphic change of coordinates of each chart that generates it. The charts and their diffeomorphic correspondences are unknown and viewed as latent or hidden variables. We demonstrate that the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm arises naturally, yielding the likelihood-fusion equation which the a posteriori estimator of the segmentation labels maximizes. The likelihoods being fused are modeled as conditionally Gaussian random fields with mean fields a function of each atlas chart under its diffeomorphic change of coordinates onto the target. The conditional-mean in the EM algorithm specifies the convex weights with which the chart-specific likelihoods are fused. The multiple atlases with the associated convex weights imply that the posterior distribution is a multi-modal representation of the measured MRI. Segmentation results for subcortical and ventricular structures of subjects, within populations of demented subjects, are demonstrated, including the use of multiple atlases across multiple diseased groups."
https://openalex.org/W2028561445,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths and the search for prognostic biomarkers that might improve treatment decisions is warranted. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules involved in regulating gene expression and have been proposed as possible biomarkers in CRC. In order to characterize the miRNA transcriptome, a large cohort including 88 CRC tumors with long-term follow-up was deep sequenced. 523 mature miRNAs were expressed in our cohort, and they exhibited largely uniform expression patterns across tumor samples. Few associations were found between clinical parameters and miRNA expression, among them, low expression of miR-592 and high expression of miR-10b-5p and miR-615-3p were associated with tumors located in the right colon relative to the left colon and rectum. High expression of miR-615-3p was also associated with poorly differentiated tumors. No prognostic biomarker candidates for overall and metastasis-free survival were identified by applying the LASSO method in a Cox proportional hazards model or univariate Cox. Examination of the five most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the cohort (miR-10a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-192-5p) revealed that their collective expression represented 54% of the detected miRNA sequences. Pathway analysis of the target genes regulated by the five most highly expressed miRNAs uncovered a significant number of genes involved in the CRC pathway, including APC, TGFβ and PI3K, thus suggesting that these miRNAs are relevant in CRC."

Previous studies have shown that ablation of the adipocyte-secreted protein adiponectin leads to endothelial dysfunction, whereas its overexpression promotes wound healing. However, the receptor(s) mediating the protective effects of adiponectin on the vasculature is not known. Here we examined the role of membrane protein T-cadherin, which localizes adiponectin to the vascular endothelium, in the revascularization response to chronic ischemia. T-cadherin-deficient mice were analyzed in a model of hind limb ischemia where blood flow is surgically disrupted in one limb and recovery is monitored over 28 days by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. In this model, T-cadherin-deficient mice phenocopy adiponectin-deficient mice such that both strains display an impaired blood flow recovery compared with wild-type controls. Delivery of exogenous adiponectin rescued the impaired revascularization phenotype in adiponectin-deficient mice but not in T-cadherin-deficient mice. In cultured endothelial cells, T-cadherin deficiency by siRNA knockdown prevented the ability of adiponectin to promote cellular migration and proliferation. These data highlight a previously unrecognized role for T-cadherin in limb revascularization and show that it is essential for mediating the vascular actions of adiponectin.Background: Adiponectin has vascular protective actions and is bound by T-cadherin.Results: T-cadherin-deficient mice lack skeletal muscle tissue-resident adiponectin and display impaired revascularization that is not improved by treatment with exogenous adiponectin.Conclusion: Expression of T-cadherin is critical for revascularization actions of adiponectin in vitro and in vivo.Significance: The T-cadherin/adiponectin interaction is important for vascular homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W1967130085,"Immune cell infiltration of expanding adipose tissue during obesity and its role in insulin resistance has been described and involves chemokines. However, studies so far have focused on a single chemokine or its receptor (especially CCL2 and CCL5) whereas redundant functions of chemokines have been described. The objective of this work was to explore the expression of chemokines in inflamed adipose tissue in obesity. Human and mouse adipocytes were analyzed for expression of chemokines in response to inflammatory signal (TNF-α) using microarrays and gene set enrichment analysis. Gene expression was verified by qRT-PCR. Chemokine protein was determined in culture medium with ELISA. Chemokine expression was investigated in human subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies and mechanism of chemokine expression was investigated using chemical inhibitors and cellular and animal transgenic models. Chemokine encoding genes were the most responsive genes in TNF-α treated human and mouse adipocytes. mRNA and protein of 34 chemokine genes were induced in a dose-dependent manner in the culture system. Furthermore, expression of those chemokines was elevated in human obese adipose tissue. Finally, chemokine expression was reduced by NF-κB inactivation and elevated by NF-κB activation. Our data indicate that besides CCL2 and CCL5, numerous other chemokines such as CCL19 are expressed by adipocytes under obesity-associated chronic inflammation. Their expression is regulated predominantly by NF-κB. Those chemokines could be involved in the initiation of infiltration of leukocytes into obese adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2025054010,"Cervical cancer is caused by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), in more than half of the worldwide cases by HPV16. Viral DNA integration into the host genome is a frequent mutation in cervical carcinogenesis. Because integration occurs into different genomic locations, it creates unique viral-cellular DNA junctions in every single case. This singularity complicates the precise identification of HPV integration sites enormously. We report here the development of a novel multiplex strategy for sequence determination of HPV16 DNA integration sites. It includes DNA fragmentation and adapter tagging, PCR enrichment of the HPV16 early region, Illumina next-generation sequencing, data processing, and validation of candidate integration sites by junction-PCR. This strategy was performed with 51 cervical cancer samples (47 primary tumors and 4 cell lines). Altogether 75 HPV16 integration sites (3'-junctions) were identified and assigned to the individual samples. By comparing the DNA junctions with the presence of viral oncogene fusion transcripts, 44 tumors could be classified into four groups: Tumors with one transcriptionally active HPV16 integrate (n = 12), tumors with transcribed and silent DNA junctions (n = 8), tumors carrying episomal HPV16 DNA (n = 10), and tumors with one to six DNA junctions, but without fusion transcripts (n = 14). The 3'-breakpoints of integrated HPV16 DNA show a statistically significant (p<0.05) preferential distribution within the early region segment upstream of the major splice acceptor underscoring the importance of deregulated viral oncogene expression for carcinogenesis. Half of the mapped HPV16 integration sites target cellular genes pointing to a direct influence of HPV integration on host genes (insertional mutagenesis). In summary, the multiplex strategy for HPV16 integration site determination worked very efficiently. It will open new avenues for comprehensive mapping of HPV integration sites and for the possible use of HPV integration sites as individualized biomarkers after cancer treatment of patients for the early diagnosis of residual and recurrent disease."
https://openalex.org/W2021842094,"The oil from flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) has high amounts of α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3(cis)(Δ9,12,15)) and is one of the richest sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3-PUFAs). To produce ∼57% ALA in triacylglycerol (TAG), it is likely that flax contains enzymes that can efficiently transfer ALA to TAG. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a systematic characterization of TAG-synthesizing enzymes from flax. We identified several genes encoding acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (PDATs) from the flax genome database. Due to recent genome duplication, duplicated gene pairs have been identified for all genes except DGAT2-2. Analysis of gene expression indicated that two DGAT1, two DGAT2, and four PDAT genes were preferentially expressed in flax embryos. Yeast functional analysis showed that DGAT1, DGAT2, and two PDAT enzymes restored TAG synthesis when produced recombinantly in yeast H1246 strain. The activity of particular PDAT enzymes (LuPDAT1 and LuPDAT2) was stimulated by the presence of ALA. Further seed-specific expression of flax genes in Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that DGAT1, PDAT1, and PDAT2 had significant effects on seed oil phenotype. Overall, this study indicated the existence of unique PDAT enzymes from flax that are able to preferentially catalyze the synthesis of TAG containing ALA acyl moieties. The identified LuPDATs may have practical applications for increasing the accumulation of ALA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids in oilseeds for food and industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2116808295,"The pathophysiology of episodic memory dysfunction after infarction is not completely understood. It has been suggested that infarctions located anywhere in the brain can induce widespread effects causing disruption of functional networks of the cortical regions. The default mode network, which includes the medial temporal lobe, is a functional network that is associated with episodic memory processing. We investigated whether the default mode network activity is reduced in stroke patients compared to healthy control subjects in the resting state condition. We assessed the whole brain network properties during resting state functional MRI in 21 control subjects and 20 'first-ever' stroke patients. Patients were scanned 9-12 weeks after stroke onset. Stroke lesions were located in various parts of the brain. Independent component analyses were conducted to identify the default mode network and to compare the group differences of the default mode network. Furthermore, region-of-interest based analysis was performed to explore the functional connectivity between the regions of the default mode network. Stroke patients performed significantly worse than control subjects on the delayed recall score on California verbal learning test. We found decreased functional connectivity in the left medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortical areas within the default mode network and reduced functional connectivity between these regions in stroke patients compared with controls. There were no significant volumetric differences between the groups. These results demonstrate that connectivity within the default mode network is reduced in 'first-ever' stroke patients compared to control subjects. This phenomenon might explain the occurrence of post-stroke cognitive dysfunction in stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2039653697,"Prostate cancer is the most common solid malignancy in men, with 32,000 deaths annually. Piperine, a major alkaloid constituent of black pepper, has previously been reported to have anti-cancer activity in variety of cancer cell lines. The effect of piperine against prostate cancer is not currently known. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anti-tumor mechanisms of piperine on androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate cancer cells. Here, we show that piperine inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP, PC-3, 22RV1 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, Annexin-V staining demonstrated that piperine treatment induced apoptosis in hormone dependent prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). Using global caspase activation assay, we show that piperine-induced apoptosis resulted in caspase activation in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Further studies revealed that piperine treatment resulted in the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP-1 proteins in LNCaP, PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Piperine treatment also disrupted androgen receptor (AR) expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Our evaluations further show that there is a significant reduction of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels following piperine treatment in LNCaP cells. NF-kB and STAT-3 transcription factors have previously been shown to play a role in angiogenesis and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, treatment of LNCaP, PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells with piperine resulted in reduced expression of phosphorylated STAT-3 and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) transcription factors. These results correlated with the results of Boyden chamber assay, wherein piperine treatment reduced the cell migration of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Finally, we show that piperine treatment significantly reduced the androgen dependent and androgen independent tumor growth in nude mice model xenotransplanted with prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these results support further investigation of piperine as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1974809860,"The throat is an ecological assemblage involved human cells and microbiota, and the colonizing bacteria are important factors in balancing this environment. However, this bacterial community profile has thus been poorly investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial biology of the larynx and to analyze the throat biodiversity in laryngeal carcinoma patients compared to a control population in a case-control study. Barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was used. We collected tissue samples from 29 patients with laryngeal carcinoma and 31 control patients with vocal cord polyps. The findings of high-quality sequence datasets revealed 218 genera from 13 phyla in the laryngeal mucosa. The predominant communities of phyla in the larynx were Firmicutes (54%), Fusobacteria (17%), Bacteroidetes (15%), Proteobacteria (11%), and Actinobacteria (3%). The leading genera were Streptococcus (36%), Fusobacterium (15%), Prevotella (12%), Neisseria (6%), and Gemella (4%). The throat bacterial compositions were highly different between laryngeal carcinoma subjects and control population (p = 0.006). The abundance of the 26 genera was significantly different between the laryngeal cancer and control groups by metastats analysis (p<0.05). Fifteen genera may be associated with laryngeal carcinoma by partial least squares discriminant analysis (p<0.001). In summary, this study revealed the microbiota profiles in laryngeal mucosa from tissue specimens. The compositions of bacteria community in throat were different between laryngeal cancer patients and controls, and probably were related with this carcinoma. The disruption of this bio-ecological niche might be a risk factor for laryngeal carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2086657677,"Taste buds are composed of a variety of taste receptor cell types that develop from tongue epithelium and are regularly replenished under normal homeostatic conditions as well as after injury. The characteristics of cells that give rise to regenerating taste buds are poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested that Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) identifies taste bud stem cells that contribute to homeostatic regeneration in adult circumvallate and foliate taste papillae, which are located in the posterior region of the tongue. Taste papillae in the adult anterior region of the tongue do not express Lgr5. Here, we confirm and extend these studies by demonstrating that Lgr5 cells give rise to both anterior and posterior taste buds during development, and are capable of regenerating posterior taste buds after injury induced by glossopharyngeal nerve transection."
https://openalex.org/W2005630897,"The galectin CvGal1 from the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), which possesses four tandemly arrayed carbohydrate recognition domains, was previously shown to display stronger binding to galactosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine relative to d-galactose. CvGal1 expressed by phagocytic cells is “hijacked” by the parasite Perkinsus marinus to enter the host, where it proliferates and causes systemic infection and death. In this study, a detailed glycan array analysis revealed that CvGal1 preferentially recognizes type 2 blood group A oligosaccharides. Homology modeling of the protein and its oligosaccharide ligands supported this preference over type 1 blood group A and B oligosaccharides. The CvGal ligand models were further validated by binding, inhibition, and competitive binding studies of CvGal1 and ABH-specific monoclonal antibodies with intact and deglycosylated glycoproteins, hemocyte extracts, and intact hemocytes and by surface plasmon resonance analysis. A parallel glycomic study carried out on oyster hemocytes (Kurz, S., Jin, C., Hykollari, A., Gregorich, D., Giomarelli, B., Vasta, G. R., Wilson, I. B. H., and Paschinger, K. (2013) J. Biol.

Invertebrates lack the typical adaptive immune responses of vertebrates, but they display effective innate immunity for defense against microbial infection (1.Boehm T. Evolution of vertebrate immunity.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R722-R732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among the multiple factors involved in recognition of the potential infectious challenges, a diversified repertoire of soluble and cell-associated lectins mediate binding interactions with potential pathogens that usually result in their agglutination, immobilization, and phagocytosis or encapsulation by hemolymph cells (hemocytes) (2.Vasta G.R.

Biol. 2004; 14: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The engulfed microbe is killed by oxidative stress resulting from the respiratory burst by the hemocytes upon particle uptake and is degraded in the phagosomal compartment (3.Schmitt P. Rosa R.D.

The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is a keystone species in the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal areas of North America (4.Kennedy V.S. Newell R.I. Eble A.F. 2nd Ed. The Eastern Oyster: Crassostrea virginica. University of Maryland Sea Grant Publications, 1996Google Scholar). As active filter feeders, oysters are critical components of the estuarine ecosystems that contribute to maintain water quality and environmental health overall (5.Dame R. Bushek D. Allen D. Lewitus A. Edwards D. Koepfler E. Gregory L. Ecosystem response to bivalve density reduction: management implications.Aquat. Ecol. 2002; 36: 51-65Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Like most invertebrates, eastern oysters have a diverse lectin repertoire present in plasma and phagocytic hemocytes (6.Vasta G.R. Sullivan J.T. Cheng T.C. Marchalonis J.J. Warr G.W.

Newell R.I. Eble A.F. 2nd Ed. The Eastern Oyster: Crassostrea virginica. University of Maryland Sea Grant Publications, 1996Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus successfully infects and causes “Dermo” disease in the eastern oyster (8.Andrews J.D.

Emerging marine diseases–climate links and anthropogenic factors.Science. 1999; 285: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). Since the 1950s, it has produced extensive damage to oyster bars along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast, with catastrophic consequences for local fisheries and the health of coastal waters (10.Perkins F.O. The Structure of Perkinsus marinus, with comments on taxonomy and phylogeny of Perkinsus spp.J. Shellfish Res. 1996; 15: 67-87Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that oyster populations from the Pacific coast of North America are also affected (11.Cáceres-Martínez J. Ortega M.G. Vásquez-Yeomans R. García Tde J. Stokes N.A. Carnegie R.B. Natural and cultured populations of the mangrove oyster Saccostrea palmula from Sinaloa, Mexico, infected by Perkinsus marinus.J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2012; 110: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transmission of Dermo disease is not fully understood but is thought to occur mainly through the release into the water column of P. marinus trophozoites from infected oysters (12.Bushek D. Ford S.E. Chintala M.M. Comparison of in vitro-cultured and wild-type Perkinsus marinus. III. Fecal elimination and its role in transmission.Dis. Aquat. Org. 2002; 51: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Trophozoites are filtered by neighboring oysters, and once in contact with the mantle, gills, and the gut lumen, they are phagocytosed by hemocytes, which migrate into the internal milieu (12.Bushek D. Ford S.E. Chintala M.M. Comparison of in vitro-cultured and wild-type Perkinsus marinus. III. Fecal elimination and its role in transmission.Dis. Aquat.

Aquat. Org. 2002; 51: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The phagocytosed trophozoites survive intracellular killing and proliferate. Therefore, the hemocytes provide not only the means of parasite uptake and entry but also an environment favorable for parasite proliferation and dissemination, leading to systemic infection and death of the oyster (14.Chu F.-L. Laboratory investigations of susceptibility, infectivity, and transmission of Perkinsus marinus in oysters.J. Shellfish Res. 1996; 15: 57-66Google Scholar).

Galectins are lectins characterized by their binding affinity for β-galactosides, a unique binding site sequence motif, and wide taxonomic distribution and structural conservation in vertebrates, invertebrates, protista, and fungi (16.Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Animal Lectins: A Functional View. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2008Google Scholar). They not only bind endogenous (“self”) glycans and mediate developmental processes and cancer metastasis (17.Leffler H. Carlsson S. Hedlund M. Qian Y. Poirier F. Introduction to galectins.Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), but they also function as key regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses (18.Rabinovich G.A. Croci D.O. Regulatory circuits mediated by lectin-glycan interactions in autoimmunity and cancer.Immunity. 2012; 36: 322-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). More recently, however, evidence has accumulated to reveal that galectins also bind exogenous (“non-self”) glycans on the surface of potentially pathogenic microbes, parasites, and fungi, suggesting that galectins can function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in innate immunity (19.Vasta G.R. Roles of galectins in infection.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). According to the currently accepted model for non-self recognition, PRRs recognize pathogens via highly conserved microbial surface molecules of wide distribution (pathogen-associated molecular patterns), such as LPS or peptidoglycans, which are absent in the host (20.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Decoding the patterns of self and nonself by the innate immune system.Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Galectins, however, apparently bind similar self and non-self molecular patterns (galactoside-containing glycans) on host and microbial cells. This apparent paradox underscores the significant gaps in our knowledge about the structural and biophysical aspects of the interactions of galectins with endogenous and microbial carbohydrate moieties (20.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Decoding the patterns of self and nonself by the innate immune system.Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). In addition to binding self glycans on the hemocyte surface, CvGal1 also recognizes a variety of potential microbial pathogens and unicellular algae, but it binds preferentially and in a carbohydrate-specific manner to P. marinus trophozoites (15.Tasumi S. Vasta G.R. A galectin of unique domain organization from hemocytes of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Is a receptor for the protistan parasite Perkinsus marinus.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3086-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Attachment and spreading of oyster hemocytes to foreign surfaces induce localization of CvGal1 to the cell periphery, its secretion and binding to the plasma membrane, and the release of remaining free CvGal1 to the extracellular compartment. Exposure of oyster hemocytes to P. marinus trophozoites or to glycoproteins that behave as strong CvGal1 ligands leads to hemocyte activation and enhances this process further. Partial inhibition of P. marinus phagocytosis by pretreatment of oyster hemocytes with anti-CvGal1 antibodies strongly suggests that CvGal1-mediated recognition of P. marinus at the hemocyte cell surface is critical for entry of the parasite into the host cells. Our results suggested that the unusual four-CRD organization of CvGal1 facilitates cross-linking of the recognized microbes and unicellular algae to the hemocyte cell surface, thereby promoting phagocytosis, killing, and digestion of the potential infectious challenge and selected components of ingested phytoplankton. However, P. marinus trophozoites display a glycocalyx that is selectively recognized by CvGal1 over the abovementioned particles and subverts the host's innate immune/feeding recognition mechanism to gain entry into those cells that will enable its proliferation and dissemination (15.Tasumi S. Vasta G.R. A galectin of unique domain organization from hemocytes of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Is a receptor for the protistan parasite Perkinsus marinus.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3086-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, the paradox of self versus non-self recognition by galectins is even more intriguing for CvGal1 because it is likely to involve host-parasite reciprocal recognition (21.Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Nita-Lazar M. Banerjee A. Pasek M. Shridhar S. Guha P. Fernández-Robledo J.A. Galectins as self/non-self recognition receptors in innate and adaptive immunity: an unresolved paradox.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 199Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of the apparent stronger binding of CvGal1 to GalNAc rather than Gal (15.Tasumi S. Vasta G.R. A galectin of unique domain organization from hemocytes of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Is a receptor for the protistan parasite Perkinsus marinus.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3086-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was unclear, and it became of great interest to examine in detail the carbohydrate specificity of CvGal1, identify its binding partners on the oyster hemocyte membrane, and determine whether the same ligands are also present on the parasite surface. In this study, we used multiple approaches to reveal that CvGal1 recognizes blood group A oligosaccharides, also shown in a parallel glycomic study (61.Kurz S. Jin C. Hykollari A. Gregorich D. Giomarelli B. Vasta G.R. Wilson I.B.H. Paschinger K. Hemocytes and plasma of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) display a diverse repertoire of sulfated and blood group A-modified N-glycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; : 24410-24428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to be present on the oyster hemocyte glycans. Finally, by proteomic analysis, we identified β-integrin and dominin among the hemocyte glycoproteins that are recognized by CvGal1. Although our data indicate that the glycocalyx of P. marinus trophozoites contains no blood group A moieties, GalNAc residues are present in surface glycans that are equally good ligands for CvGal1. Thus, we hypothesize that glycan-based mimicry developed by convergent host/parasite evolution enables the parasite to infect oyster hemocytes.

To withdraw hemolymph, oysters were notched using a grinding wheel at the anterior side of the shell, close to the adductor muscle, allowed to acclimate for 3 days in the water tank, and bled from the adductor muscle using an 18-gauge needle, and the hemolymph was collected on wet ice (15.Tasumi S.

Hemocytes from pooled hemolymph samples from 6 to 12 oysters were collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), washed three times in ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 10 mm HEPES, 430 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3), suspended in HBS containing glutaraldehyde (10 mm), incubated on wet ice for 10 min, washed three times in HBS, and stored at 4 °C until use. As required, fixed hemocytes were incubated with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (103 units/ml as final concentration in G7 buffer) or buffer only at 37 °C for 72 h. For the preparation of hemocyte extracts, fresh hemolymph samples from 6 to 12 oysters were pooled, and the circulating hemocytes were collected by centrifugation as above. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) and sonicated three times for 10 s on ice. The extract was centrifuged to remove insoluble materials; the clear supernatant was collected; the protein concentration was quantified, and the extracts were stored at −20 °C until use. For flow cytometry analyses, the hemocyte suspensions (1 × 107 cells/ml) were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in HBS for 30 min on ice, washed three times with HBS, and processed as described below. Clonal cultures of P. marinus established in our laboratory (P. marinus strain PRA 240) (22.Fernández-Robledo J.A. Lin Z. Vasta G.R. Transfection of the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus.Mol.

In vitro culture of the eastern oyster parasite Perkinsus marinus: Optimization of the methodology.J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1995; 66: 156-168Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cultures in log phase of growth were harvested, washed three times in HBS, suspended at 4 × 107 cells/ml in HBS, and treated with glutaraldehyde (10 mm) for 30 min on wet ice.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 3086-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)-competent cells (Novagen, Billerica, MA), and the expression of rCvGal1 was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 23 °C for 16 h in 3 liters of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The soluble proteins extracted with BugBuster (Novagen), containing 1 mm PMSF and 0.07% β-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), contained most of the recombinant CvGal1 (∼80%). This fraction was loaded onto a column packed with 5 ml of lactose-Sepharose (Sigma). After washing the column thoroughly (washing buffer: 1:10 PBS, 0.07% 2-ME (PBS (1:10)/2-ME), the rCvGal1 was eluted with 0.1 m lactose in PBS (1:10)/2-ME. From a 3-liter E. coli culture, ∼20 mg of rCvGal1 were purified. Purified rCvGal1 (17 mg) was absorbed on 1 ml of DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with PBS (1:10)/2-ME and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with slow agitation. The resin was poured into a column, and after extensive washing with PBS (1:10), the column was overlaid with 3 ml of 0.1 m iodoacetamide, 0.1 m lactose and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. After washing the column with 50 mm lactose in PBS (1:10), the bound protein (crCvGal1) was eluted with PBS (1:10), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m lactose. Porcine stomach mucin (PSM; 30 μg/ml, final concentration) or hemocyte extract (100 μg/ml) were incubated with PNGase F (25 × 103 units/ml as final concentration in G7 reaction buffer, pH 7.5), O-glycosidase (2 × 106 units/ml in G7, pH 7.5), α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (103 units/ml in G7, pH 7.5), α-l-fucosidase (1 unit/ml in G6, pH 5.5), β1,3-galactosidase (500 units/ml in G6, pH 5.5), or buffer only (G6 or G7 as control) at 37 °C for 48 h. To prepare desialylated glycoproteins, fetuin, PSM, ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM), or bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) (10 μg/ml in Tris buffer, pH 5.5) were incubated with neuraminidase (10 milliunits/ml as final concentration) at 37 °C overnight. The neuraminidase-treated glycoproteins were boiled for 10 min to deactivate the enzyme before use. The untreated (fetuin, PSM, OSM, and BSM) and desialylated (asialofetuin, asialo-PSM, asialo-OSM, and asialo-BSM) glycoproteins as well as glycosidase-treated hemocyte extracts were diluted in PBS for coating onto 96-well plates for binding and binding-inhibition assays as described below. Fixed intact hemocytes were incubated with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (103 units/ml) or buffer only at 37 °C for 72 h, incubated with rCvGal1 or anti-blood group A or B monoclonal antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described below. Protein concentrations were estimated with the protein assay kit I (Bio-Rad) in 96-well flat-bottom plates as described by the manufacturer in the microassay format, using crystalline BSA as a standard. After 5 min of combining protein and dye, the reactions were read at 595 nm on SpectraMax340 Plate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) controlled by SoftmaxPro software, version 1. Glycan array analysis was carried out at the Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics at Emory University, on version 5.0 of the array printed with 611 glycans in replicates of six. The rCvGal1 (1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against PBS containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (PBS/2-ME) and diluted with PBS/2-ME to 2, 10, 50, or 150 μg/ml before adding onto an array for analysis. The bound rCvGal1 was detected with rabbit anti-CvGal1-purified IgG, followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen). The oyster galectin CvGal1 was modeled by using the toad Bufo arenarum galectin-1 structure (BaGal1, PDB code 1GAN) (24.Bianchet M.A. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Soluble β-galactosyl-binding lectin (galectin) from toad ovary: crystallographic studies of two protein-sugar complexes.Proteins. 2000; 40: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as a template. Sequence homologies of Cvgal1 with the template (BaGal1) are shown in Table 1. An initial automatic alignment with the program MOE (CGC Inc.) was further improved conserving the maximum number of the galectin archetypical interactions and locating deletions and insertions in permissive regions of the template structure. Three-dimensional models of CvGal1 were built with the homology modeling routine of MOE and manually rebuilt with the program Coot (25.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23308) Google Scholar). The structures were regularized and minimized using Charmm27-based force field included in MOE. Loops showing significant variations from the template were modeled using the LowMD conformational search in MOE, maintaining the other residues fixed or alternatively tethered. The carbohydrates were built in MOE and minimized using an MMFX94x force field (MOE version 2012.10). Conformations of the carbohydrates were selected in agreement to their minimum conformational potential energy in vacuum.TABLE 1Pairwise percentage identity in the modeling alignment of Fig. 2GalectinBaGal1 chain ACvGal1Chain AChain BChain CChain DBaGal1Chain A100.018.622.818.822.8CvGal1Chain A20.1100.033.132.637.5Chain B23.131.0100.031.230.9Chain C19.431.031.6100.035.3Chain D23.135.230.934.8100.0 Open table in a new tab Solid phase lectin binding assays were carried out as described elsewhere (15.Tasumi S.

In yeast, excess levels of certain nutrients induce endocytosis of the cognate permeases to prevent toxic accumulation of metabolites. The α-arrestins, a family of trafficking adaptors, stimulate ubiquitin-dependent and clathrin-mediated endocytosis by interacting with both a client permease and the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5. However, the molecular mechanisms that control α-arrestin function are not well understood.

Dephosphorylation of Aly1 by calcineurin at a subset of phospho-sites is required for Aly1-mediated trafficking of the aspartic acid and glutamic acid transporter Dip5 to the vacuole, but it does not alter Rsp5 binding, ubiquitinylation, or stability of Aly1. In addition, dephosphorylation of Aly1 by calcineurin does not regulate the ability of Aly1 to promote the intracellular sorting of the general amino acid permease Gap1.

https://openalex.org/W1994625742,"The ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC E2) mediates selective ubiquitination, acting with E1 and E3 enzymes to designate specific proteins for subsequent degradation. In the present study, we characterized the function of the mung bean VrUBC1 gene (Vigna radiata UBC 1). RNA gel-blot analysis showed that VrUBC1 mRNA expression was induced by either dehydration, high salinity or by the exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not by low temperature or wounding. Biochemical studies of VrUBC1 recombinant protein and complementation of yeast ubc4/5 by VrUBC1 revealed that VrUBC1 encodes a functional UBC E2. To understand the function of this gene in development and plant responses to osmotic stresses, we overexpressed VrUBC1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The VrUBC1-overexpressing plants displayed highly sensitive responses to ABA and osmotic stress during germination, enhanced ABA- or salt-induced stomatal closing, and increased drought stress tolerance. The expression levels of a number of key ABA signaling genes were increased in VrUBC1-overexpressing plants compared to the wild-type plants. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation demonstrated that VrUBC1 interacts with AtVBP1 (A. thaliana VrUBC1 Binding Partner 1), a C3HC4-type RING E3 ligase. Overall, these results demonstrate that VrUBC1 plays a positive role in osmotic stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of ABA-related genes and possibly through interaction with a novel RING E3 ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2046131836,"Numerous studies have examined the empirical evidence concerning the influence of demographic and socio-economic factors influencing child immunization, but no documentation is available which shows the actual impact of antenatal care (ANC) visits on subsequent child immunization. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the net impact of ANC visits on subsequent utilization of child immunization after removing the presence of selection bias. Nationwide data from India’s latest National Family Health Survey conducted during 2005–06 is used for the present study. The analysis has been carried out in the two separate models, in the first model 1–2 ANC visit and in the second model three or more ANC visits has been compared with no visit. We have used propensity score matching method with a counterfactual model that assesses the actual ANC visits effect on treated (ANC visits) and untreated groups (no ANC visit), and have employed Mantel-Haenszel bounds to examine whether result would be free from hidden bias or not. Using matched sample analysis result shows that child immunization among the groups of women who have completed 1–2 ANC visits and those who had more than two visits was about 13 percent and 19 percent respectively, higher than the group of women who have not made any ANC visit. Findings of nearest neighbor matching with replacement method, which completely eliminated the bias, indicate that selection bias present in data set leads to overestimates the positive effects of ANC visits on child immunization. Result based on Mantel-Haenszel bounds method suggest that if around 19 percent bias would be involved in the result then also we could observe the true positive effect of 1–2 ANC visits on child immunization. This also indicates that antenatal clinics are the conventional platforms for educating pregnant women on the benefits of child immunization."
https://openalex.org/W2150453049,"Galectin-4 (Gal-4) is a member of the galectin family of glycan binding proteins that shows a significantly higher expression in cystic tumors of the human pancreas and in pancreatic adenocarcinomas compared to normal pancreas. However, the putative function of Gal-4 in tumor progression of pancreatic cancer is still incompletely understood. In this study the role of Gal-4 in cancer progression was investigated, using a set of defined pancreatic cancer cell lines, Pa-Tu-8988S (PaTu-S) and Pa-Tu-8988T (PaTu-T), as a model. These two cell lines are derived from the same liver metastasis of a human primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but differ in their growth characteristics and metastatic capacity. We demonstrated that Gal-4 expression is high in PaTu-S, which shows poor migratory properties, whereas much lower Gal-4 levels are observed in the highly metastatic cell line PaTu-T. In PaTu-S, Gal-4 is found in the cytoplasm, but it is also secreted and accumulates at the membrane at sites of contact with neighboring cells. Moreover, we show that Gal-4 inhibits metastasis formation by delaying migration of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro using a scratch assay, and in vivo using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an experimental model. Our data suggest that Gal-4 may act at the cell-surface of PaTu-S as an adhesion molecule to prevent release of the tumor cells, but has in addition a cytosolic function by inhibiting migration via a yet unknown mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2010560524,"The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) has become a useful model system for glycan-dependent host-parasite interactions due to the hijacking of the oyster galectin CvGal1 for host entry by the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus, the causative agent of Dermo disease. In this study, we examined the N-glycans of both the hemocytes, which via CvGal1 are the target of the parasite, and the plasma of the oyster. In combination with HPLC fractionation, exoglycosidase digestion, and fragmentation of the glycans, mass spectrometry revealed that the major N-glycans of plasma are simple hybrid structures, sometimes methylated and core α1,6-fucosylated, with terminal β1,3-linked galactose; a remarkable high degree of sulfation of such glycans was observed. Hemocytes express a larger range of glycans, including core-difucosylated paucimannosidic forms, whereas bi- and triantennary glycans were found in both sources, including structures carrying sulfated and methylated variants of the histo-blood group A epitope. The primary features of the oyster whole hemocyte N-glycome were also found in dominin, the major plasma glycoprotein, which had also been identified as a CvGal1 glycoprotein ligand associated with hemocytes. The occurrence of terminal blood group moieties on oyster dominin and on hemocyte surfaces can account in part for their affinity for the endogenous CvGal1."
https://openalex.org/W2019331927,"Effective long-term wildlife conservation planning for a species must be guided by information about population vital rates at multiple scales. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations declined substantially during the twentieth century, largely as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. In addition to the importance of conserving large tracts of suitable habitat, successful conservation of this species will require detailed information about factors affecting vital rates at both the population and range-wide scales. Research has shown that sage-grouse population growth rates are particularly sensitive to hen and chick survival rates. While considerable information on hen survival exists, there is limited information about chick survival at the population level, and currently there are no published reports of factors affecting chick survival across large spatial and temporal scales. We analyzed greater sage-grouse chick survival rates from 2 geographically distinct populations across 9 years. The effects of 3 groups of related landscape-scale covariates (climate, drought, and phenology of vegetation greenness) were evaluated. Models with phenological change in greenness (NDVI) performed poorly, possibly due to highly variable production of forbs and grasses being masked by sagebrush canopy. The top drought model resulted in substantial improvement in model fit relative to the base model and indicated that chick survival was negatively associated with winter drought. Our overall top model included effects of chick age, hen age, minimum temperature in May, and precipitation in July. Our results provide important insights into the possible effects of climate variability on sage-grouse chick survival."
https://openalex.org/W2018215572,"The fungal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter Cdr1 protein (Cdr1p), responsible for clinically significant drug resistance, is composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). We have probed the nature of the drug binding pocket by performing systematic mutagenesis of the primary sequences of the 12 transmembrane segments (TMSs) found in the TMDs. All mutated proteins were expressed equally well and localized properly at the plasma membrane in the heterologous host Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but some variants differed significantly in efflux activity, substrate specificity, and coupled ATPase activity. Replacement of the majority of the amino acid residues with alanine or glycine yielded neutral mutations, but about 42% of the variants lost resistance to drug efflux substrates completely or selectively. A predicted three-dimensional homology model shows that all the TMSs, apart from TMS4 and TMS10, interact directly with the drug-binding cavity in both the open and closed Cdr1p conformations. However, TMS4 and TMS10 mutations can also induce total or selective drug susceptibility. Functional data and homology modeling assisted identification of critical amino acids within a drug-binding cavity that, upon mutation, abolished resistance to all drugs tested singly or in combinations. The open and closed Cdr1p models enabled the identification of amino acid residues that bordered a drug-binding cavity dominated by hydrophobic residues. The disposition of TMD residues with differential effects on drug binding and transport are consistent with a large polyspecific drug binding pocket in this yeast multidrug transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2042505627,"Although inositol pyrophosphates have diverse roles in phosphate signaling and other important cellular processes, little is known about their functions in the biosynthesis of inositol and phospholipids. Here, we show that KCS1, which encodes an inositol pyrophosphate kinase, is a regulator of inositol metabolism. Deletion of KCS1, which blocks synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates on the 5-hydroxyl of the inositol ring, causes inositol auxotrophy and decreased intracellular inositol and phosphatidylinositol. These defects are caused by a profound decrease in transcription of INO1, which encodes myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase. Expression of genes that function in glycolysis, transcription, and protein processing is not affected in kcs1Δ. Deletion of OPI1, the INO1 transcription repressor, does not fully rescue INO1 expression in kcs1Δ. Both the inositol pyrophosphate kinase and the basic leucine zipper domains of KCS1 are required for INO1 expression. Kcs1 is regulated in response to inositol, as Kcs1 protein levels are increased in response to inositol depletion. The Kcs1-catalyzed production of inositol pyrophosphates from inositol pentakisphosphate but not inositol hexakisphosphate is indispensable for optimal INO1 transcription.

Virus infection can induce interferon through Toll like Receptors (TLR)3, TLR7 and TLR8. The role of these TLRs in interferon induction in asthma is unclear. This objective of this study was to measure the type I and III interferon response to TLR in bronchial epithelial cells and peripheral blood cells from atopic asthmatics and non-atopic non-asthmatics. Bronchial epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic asthmatic and non-atopic non-asthmatic subjects were stimulated with agonists to TLR3, TLR4 & TLRs7-9 and type I and III interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-8, responses assessed. mRNA expression was analysed by qPCR. Interferon proteins were analysed by ELISA. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were induced by each TLR ligand in both cell types. Ligands to TLR3 and TLR7/8, but not other TLRs, induced interferon-β and interferon-λ in bronchial epithelial cells. The ligand to TLR7/8, but not those to other TLRs, induced only type I interferons in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. No difference was observed in TLR induced interferon or pro-inflammatory cytokine production between asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects from either cell type. TLR3 and TLR7/8,, stimulation induced interferon in bronchial epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Interferon induction to TLR agonists was not observed to be different in asthmatics and non-asthmatics."
https://openalex.org/W2031787550,"The noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls a variety of cell behaviors such as polarized protrusive cell activity, directional cell movement, and oriented cell division and is crucial for the normal development of many tissues. Mutations in the PCP genes cause malformation in multiple organs. Recently, the PCP pathway was shown to control endocytosis of PCP and non-PCP proteins necessary for cell shape remodeling and formation of specific junctional protein complexes. During formation of the renal glomerulus, the glomerular capillary becomes enveloped by highly specialized epithelial cells, podocytes, that display unique architecture and are connected via specialized cell-cell junctions (slit diaphragms) that restrict passage of protein into the urine; podocyte differentiation requires active remodeling of cytoskeleton and junctional protein complexes. We report here that in cultured human podocytes, activation of the PCP pathway significantly stimulates endocytosis of the core slit diaphragm protein, nephrin, via a clathrin/β-arrestin-dependent endocytic route. In contrast, depletion of the PCP protein Vangl2 leads to an increase of nephrin at the cell surface; loss of Vangl2 functions in Looptail mice results in disturbed glomerular maturation. We propose that the PCP pathway contributes to podocyte development by regulating nephrin turnover during junctional remodeling as the cells differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W2073719082,"Bile acids (BAs) are recently recognized key signaling molecules that control integrative metabolism and energy expenditure. BAs activate multiple signaling pathways, including those of nuclear receptors, primarily farnesoid X receptor (FXR), membrane BA receptors, and FXR-induced FGF19 to regulate the fed-state metabolism. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) has been implicated as a key mediator of these BA signaling pathways by recruitment of chromatin modifying proteins, but the key question of how SHP transduces BA signaling into repressive histone modifications at liver metabolic genes remains unknown. Here we show that protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) is activated by BA or FGF19 and phosphorylates SHP at Thr-55 and that Thr-55 phosphorylation is critical for the epigenomic coordinator functions of SHP. PKCζ is coimmunopreciptitated with SHP and both are recruited to SHP target genes after bile acid or FGF19 treatment. Activated phosphorylated PKCζ and phosphorylated SHP are predominantly located in the nucleus after FGF19 treatment. Phosphorylation at Thr-55 is required for subsequent methylation at Arg-57, a naturally occurring mutation site in metabolic syndrome patients. Thr-55 phosphorylation increases interaction of SHP with chromatin modifiers and their occupancy at selective BA-responsive genes. This molecular cascade leads to repressive modifications of histones at metabolic target genes, and consequently, decreased BA pools and hepatic triglyceride levels. Remarkably, mutation of Thr-55 attenuates these SHP-mediated epigenomic and metabolic effects. This study identifies PKCζ as a novel key upstream regulator of BA-regulated SHP function, revealing the role of Thr-55 phosphorylation in epigenomic regulation of liver metabolism."

There is a lack of evidence-based guidelines on the diagnosis, management and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-2 or HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infections. Because of these issues, we designed a West African collaborative cohort for HIV-2 infection within the framework of the International epidemiological Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA).We collected data on all HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV-2 dually seropositive patients (both ARV-naive and starting ART) and followed-up in clinical centres in the IeDEA-WA network including a total of 13 clinics in five countries: Benin, Burkina-Faso Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal, in the West Africa region.Data was merged for 1,754 patients (56% female), including 1,021 HIV-2 infected patients (551 on ART) and 733 dually seropositive for both HIV-1 and HIV 2 (463 on ART). At ART initiation, the median age of HIV-2 patients was 45.3 years, IQR: (38.3-51.7) and 42.4 years, IQR (37.0-47.3) for dually seropositive patients (p = 0.048). Overall, 16.7% of HIV-2 patients on ART had an advanced clinical stage (WHO IV or CDC-C). The median CD4 count at the ART initiation is 166 cells/mm(3), IQR (83-247) among HIV-2 infected patients and 146 cells/mm(3), IQR (55-249) among dually seropositive patients. Overall, in ART-treated patients, the CD4 count increased 126 cells/mm(3) after 24 months on ART for HIV-2 patients and 169 cells/mm(3) for dually seropositive patients. Of 551 HIV-2 patients on ART, 5.8% died and 10.2% were lost to follow-up during the median time on ART of 2.4 years, IQR (0.7-4.3).This large multi-country study of HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infection in West Africa suggests that routine clinical care is less than optimal and that management and treatment of HIV-2 could be further informed by ongoing studies and randomized clinical trials in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2021017993,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid, which regulates several cancer-related processes including migration and angiogenesis. We have previously shown S1P to induce migration of follicular ML-1 thyroid cancer cells. Hypoxia-induced factor-1 (HIF-1) is an oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, which adapts cells to hypoxic conditions through increased survival, motility and angiogenesis. Due to these properties and its increased expression in response to intratumoral hypoxia, HIF-1 is considered a significant regulator of tumor biology. We found S1P to increase expression of the regulatory HIF-1α subunit in normoxic ML-1 cells. S1P also increased HIF-1 activity and expression of HIF-1 target genes. Importantly, inhibition or knockdown of HIF-1α attenuated the S1P-induced migration of ML-1 cells. S1P-induced HIF-1α expression was mediated by S1P receptor 3 (S1P3), Gi proteins and their downstream effectors MEK, PI3K, mTOR and PKCβI. Half-life measurements with cycloheximide indicated that S1P treatment stabilized the HIF-1α protein. On the other hand, S1P activated translational regulators eIF-4E and p70S6K, which are known to control HIF-1α synthesis. In conclusion, we have identified S1P as a non-hypoxic regulator of HIF-1 activity in thyroid cancer cells, studied the signaling involved in S1P-induced HIF-1α expression and shown S1P-induced migration to be mediated by HIF-1."

However, EGFR expression determined by immunohistochemistry does not predict clinical outcomes of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with cetuximab. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation between EGFR levels detected by cetuximab and drug sensitivities of CRC cell lines (Caco-2, WiDR, SW480, and HCT116) and the A431 epidermoid carcinoma cell line. We used flow cytometry (FCM) to detect EGFR-binding of biotinylated cetuximab on the cell surface. Subcloned cell lines showing the highest and lowest EGFR expression levels were chosen for further study. Cytotoxic assays were used to determine differential responses to cetuximab. Xenograft models treated with cetuximab intraperitoneally to assess sensitivity to cetuximab. Strong responses to cetuximab were specifically exhibited by subcloned cells with high EGFR expression levels. Furthermore, cetuximab inhibited the growth of tumors in xenograft models with high or low EGFR expression levels by 35% and 10%–20%, respectively. We conclude that detection of EGFR expression by cetuximab promises to provide a novel, sensitive, and specific method for predicting the sensitivity of CRC to cetuximab."
https://openalex.org/W1995216412,"Disturbances of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling have been implicated in the evolution of depression, which likely arises, in part, as a result of diminished synaptic plasticity. Predictably, given stressor involvement in depression, BDNF is affected by recent stressors as well as stressors such as neglect experienced in early life. The effects of early life maltreatment in altering BDNF signalling may be particularly apparent among those individuals with specific BDNF polymorphisms. We examined whether polymorphisms of the Val66Met genotype might be influential in moderating how early-life events play out with respect to later coping styles, cognitive flexibility and depressive features. Among male and female undergraduate students (N = 124), childhood neglect was highly related to subsequent depressive symptoms. This outcome was moderated by the BDNF polymorphism in the sense that depressive symptoms appeared higher in Met carriers who reported low levels of neglect than in those with the Val/Val allele. However, under conditions of high neglect depressive symptoms only increased in the Val/Val individuals. In effect, the Met polymorphism was associated with depressive features, but did not interact with early life neglect in predicting later depressive features. It was further observed that among the Val/Val individuals, the relationship between neglect and depression was mediated by emotion-focused styles and diminished perceived control, whereas this mediation was not apparent in Met carriers. In contrast to the more typical view regarding this polymorphism, the data are consistent with the perspective that in the presence of synaptic plasticity presumably associated with the Val/Val genotype, neglect allows for the emergence of specific appraisal and coping styles, which are tied to depression. In the case of the reduced degree of neuroplasticity expected in the Met carriers, early life adverse experiences are not tied to coping styles, and hence less likely to be translated into depressive states."
https://openalex.org/W2068132661,"Background Migration has long been understood as an underlying factor for HIV transmission, and sexual partner concurrency has been increasingly studied as an important component of HIV transmission dynamics. However, less work has examined the role of short-term mobility in sexual partner concurrency using a network approach. Short-term mobility may be a risk for HIV for the migrant’s partner as well either through the partner’s risk behaviors while the migrant is away, such as the partner having additional partners, or via exposure to the return migrant. Methods Using data from the 2010–11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey, weighted generalized linear regression models were used to investigate the associations between short-term mobility and partnership concurrency at the individual and partnership levels. Results At the individual level, we find strong evidence of an association between short-term mobility and concurrency. Men who traveled were more likely to have concurrent partnerships compared to men who did not travel and the relationship was non-linear: each trip was associated with a 2% higher probability of concurrency, with a diminishing risk at 60 trips (p<0.001). At the partnership level, short-term mobility by the male only or both partners was associated with male concurrency. Couples in which the female only traveled exhibited less male concurrency. Conclusions Short-term mobility has the ability to impact population-level transmission dynamics by facilitating partnership concurrency and thus onward HIV transmission. Short-term migrants may be an important population to target for HIV testing, treatment, or social and behavioral interventions to prevent the spread of HIV."

When expressed in mammalian cells, NANOMS report on loss of membrane anchorage due to chemical or genetic inhibition of myristoylation e.g. by blocking NMT and methionine-aminopeptidase (Met-AP). We used Yes-NANOMS to assess inhibitors of NMT and a cherry-picked compound library of putative Met-AP inhibitors. Thus we successfully confirmed the activity of DDD85646 and fumagillin in our cellular assay. The developed assay is unique in its ability to identify modulators of signaling protein nanoclustering, and is amenable to high throughput screening for chemical or genetic inhibitors of functional membrane anchorage of myristoylated proteins in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1979714269,"Major degraders of petroleum hydrocarbons in tropical seas have been indicated only by laboratory culturing and never through observing the bacterial community structure in actual environments. To demonstrate the major degraders of petroleum hydrocarbons spilt in actual tropical seas, indigenous bacterial community in seawater at Sentosa (close to a port) and East Coast Park (far from a port) in Singapore was analyzed. Bacterial species was more diverse at Sentosa than at the Park, and the composition was different: γ-Proteobacteria (57.3%) dominated at Sentosa, while they did not at the Park. Specialized hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (SHCB), which use limited carbon sources with a preference for petroleum hydrocarbons, were found as abundant species at Sentosa, indicating petroleum contamination. On the other hand, SHCB were not the abundant species at the Park. The abundant species of SHCB at Sentosa were Oleibacter marinus and Alcanivorax species (strain 2A75 type), which have previously been indicated by laboratory culturing as important petroleum-aliphatic-hydrocarbon degraders in tropical seas. Together with the fact that SHCB have been identified as major degraders of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine environments, these results demonstrate that the O. marinus and Alcanivorax species (strain 2A75 type) would be major degraders of petroleum aliphatic hydrocarbons spilt in actual tropical seas."
https://openalex.org/W2075102137,"Habitat-modifying organisms that impact other organisms and local functioning are important in determining ecosystem resilience. However, it is often unclear how the outcome of interactions performed by key species varies depending on the spatial and temporal disturbance context which makes the prediction of disturbance-driven regime shifts difficult. We investigated the strength and generality of effects of the filter feeding cockle Cerastoderma edule on its ambient intertidal benthic physical and biological environment. By comparing the magnitude of the effect of experimental cockle removal between a non-cohesive and a sheltered cohesive sediment in two different periods of the year, we show that the outcome of cockle interference effects relates to differences in physical disturbance, and to temporal changes in suspended sediment load and ontogenetic changes in organism traits. Interference effects were only present in the cohesive sediments, though the effects varied seasonally. Cockle presence decreased only the density of surface-dwelling species suggesting that interference effects were particularly mediated by bioturbation of the surface sediments. Furthermore, density reductions in the presence of cockles were most pronounced during the season when larvae and juveniles were present, suggesting that these life history stages are most vulnerable to interference competition. We further illustrate that cockles may enhance benthic microalgal biomass, most likely through the reduction of surface-dwelling grazing species, especially in periods with high sediment load and supposedly also high bioturbation rates. Our results emphasize that the physical disturbance of the sediment may obliterate biotic interactions, and that temporal changes in environmental stressors, such as suspended sediments, may affect the outcome of key species interference effects at the local scale. Consequently, natural processes and anthropogenic activities that change bed shear stress and sediment dynamics in coastal soft-sediment systems will affect cockle-mediated influences on ecosystem properties and therefore the resilience of these systems to environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2028510937,"Deficiency in DNA ligase I, encoded by CDC9 in budding yeast, leads to the accumulation of unligated Okazaki fragments and triggers PCNA ubiquitination at a non-canonical lysine residue. This signal is crucial to activate the S phase checkpoint, which promotes cell cycle delay. We report here that a pol30-K107 mutation alleviated cell cycle delay in cdc9 mutants, consistent with the idea that the modification of PCNA at K107 affects the rate of DNA synthesis at replication forks. To determine whether PCNA ubiquitination occurred in response to nicks or was triggered by the lack of PCNA-DNA ligase interaction, we complemented cdc9 cells with either wild-type DNA ligase I or a mutant form, which fails to interact with PCNA. Both enzymes reversed PCNA ubiquitination, arguing that the modification is likely an integral part of a novel nick-sensory mechanism and not due to non-specific secondary mutations that could have occurred spontaneously in cdc9 mutants. To further understand how cells cope with the accumulation of nicks during DNA replication, we utilized cdc9-1 in a genome-wide synthetic lethality screen, which identified RAD59 as a strong negative interactor. In comparison to cdc9 single mutants, cdc9 rad59Δ double mutants did not alter PCNA ubiquitination but enhanced phosphorylation of the mediator of the replication checkpoint, Mrc1. Since Mrc1 resides at the replication fork and is phosphorylated in response to fork stalling, these results indicate that Rad59 alleviates nick-induced replication fork slowdown. Thus, we propose that Rad59 promotes fork progression when Okazaki fragment processing is compromised and counteracts PCNA-K107 mediated cell cycle arrest."

Overexpression of ANKRD2 inhibits C2C12 myoblast differentiation. However, the mechanism by which ANKRD2 inhibits myoblast differentiation is unknown. We demonstrate that the primary myoblasts of mdm (muscular dystrophy with myositis) mice (pMB(mdm)) overexpress ANKRD2 and ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3) proteins and are unable to differentiate into myotubes upon myogenic induction. Although suppression of either ANKRD2 or ID3 induces myoblast differentiation in mdm mice, overexpression of ANKRD2 and inhibition of ID3 or vice versa is insufficient to inhibit myoblast differentiation in WT mice. We identified that ANKRD2 and ID3 cooperatively inhibit myoblast differentiation by physical interaction. Interestingly, although MyoD activates the Ankrd2 promoter in the skeletal muscles of wild-type mice, SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1) activates the same promoter in the skeletal muscles of mdm mice, suggesting the differential regulation of Ankrd2. Overall, we uncovered a novel pathway in which SREBP-1/ANKRD2/ID3 activation inhibits myoblast differentiation, and we propose that this pathway acts as a critical determinant of the skeletal muscle developmental program."

However, the molecular mechanisms governing the maintenance of the polarized functions of Th cells remain unclear. GATA3, a master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation, initiates the expressions of Th2 cytokine genes and other Th2-specific genes. GATA3 also plays important roles in maintaining Th2 cell function and in continuous chromatin remodeling of Th2 cytokine gene loci. However, it is unclear whether continuous expression of GATA3 is required to maintain the expression of various other Th2-specific genes. In this report, genome-wide DNA gene expression profiling revealed that GATA3 expression is critical for the expression of a certain set of Th2-specific genes. We demonstrated that GATA3 dependency is reduced for some Th2-specific genes in fully developed Th2 cells compared to that observed in effector Th2 cells, whereas it is unchanged for other genes. Moreover, effects of a loss of GATA3 expression in Th2 cells on the expression of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes were examined in detail. A critical role of GATA3 in the regulation of Th2-specific gene expression is confirmed in in vivo generated antigen-specific memory Th2 cells. Therefore, GATA3 is required for the continuous expression of the majority of Th2-specific genes involved in maintaining the Th2 cell identity."

Individual variables (e.g., age, gender) affect behaviour and physiology of animals. Together, these parameters can create both great inter-individual variations in health indicators and interpretation difficulties. We investigated the relevance of body condition and somatic indices (liver, kidneys) as indicators of health status in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus, n = 560) captured along a metal pollution gradient in four landscape types (30 sampling squares 500-m sided). The indices were calculated using a recently proposed standard major axis regression instead of an ordinary least square regression. After considering age and gender for the body condition index, no landscape type influence was detected in the indices. However, important index variability was observed between sampling squares; this effect was included as a random effect in linear models. After integrating all individual and environmental variables that may affect the indices, cadmium (Cd) concentrations in both the liver and kidneys were negatively related to body condition and liver indices only for individuals from highly contaminated sites. Lead in the liver was negatively related to the liver index, and Cd in kidneys was positively linked to the kidney index, potentially suggesting metal-induced stress. However, interpretation of these indices as a wildlife ecotoxicology tool should be performed with caution due to the sensitivity of potentially confounding variables (e.g., individual factors and environmental parameters)."
https://openalex.org/W2037737867,"Recent neuroimaging studies show that brain abnormalities in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are more frequent than earlier described. Yet, more research considering multiple aspects of NMO is necessary to better understand these abnormalities. A clinical feature of relapsing NMO (RNMO) is that the incremental disability is attack-related. Therefore, association between the attack-related process and neuroimaging might be expected. On the other hand, the immunopathological analysis of NMO lesions has suggested that CNS microvasculature could be an early disease target, which could alter brain perfusion. Brain tissue volume changes accompanying perfusion alteration could also be expected throughout the attack-related process. The aim of this study was to investigate in RNMO patients, by voxel-based correlation analysis, the assumed associations between regional brain white (WMV) and grey matter volumes (GMV) and/or perfusion on one side, and the number of optic neuritis (ON) attacks, myelitis attacks and/or total attacks on the other side. For this purpose, high resolution T1-weighted MRI and perfusion SPECT imaging were obtained in 15 RNMO patients. The results showed negative regional correlations of WMV, GMV and perfusion with the number of ON attacks, involving important components of the visual system, which could be relevant for the comprehension of incremental visual disability in RNMO. We also found positive regional correlation of perfusion with the number of ON attacks, mostly overlapping the brain area where the WMV showed negative correlation. This provides evidence that brain microvasculature is an early disease target and suggests that perfusion alteration could be important in the development of brain structural abnormalities in RNMO."

An algorithm based on sparse component analysis (SCA) and the circle transform (CT) was developed for image segmentation and quantification of distinct tissue types. The accuracy of our approach was quantified through simulations of tumor and muscle images. Specifically, tumor, muscle, and tumor+muscle tissue images were simulated because these tissue types were most commonly observed in sarcoma margins. Simulations were based on tissue characteristics observed in pathology slides. The potential clinical utility of our approach was evaluated by imaging excised margins and the tumor bed in a cohort of mice after surgical resection of sarcoma.Simulation experiments revealed that SCA+CT achieved the lowest errors for larger nuclear sizes and for higher contrast ratios (nuclei intensity/background intensity). For imaging of tumor margins, SCA+CT effectively isolated nuclei from tumor, muscle, adipose, and tumor+muscle tissue types. Differences in density were correctly identified with SCA+CT in a cohort of ex vivo and in vivo images, thus illustrating the diagnostic potential of our approach.The combination of a subcellular-resolution microendoscope, acriflavine staining, and SCA+CT can be used to accurately isolate nuclei and quantify their density in anatomical images of heterogeneous tissue."

Neutralizing antibodies from individuals who have recovered from an infection confer therapeutic protection to others infected with the same pathogen. However, survivors may not always be available for providing plasma or for the cloning of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Methodology/Principal Findings The genome and the immunoglobulin genes in rhesus macaques and humans are highly homologous; therefore, we investigated whether neutralizing mAbs that are highly homologous to those of humans (human-like) could be generated. Using the H5N1 influenza virus as a model, we first immunized rhesus macaques with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin (HA). Following screening an antibody phage display library derived from the B cells of immunized monkeys, we cloned selected macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions into the human IgG constant region, which generated human-macaque chimeric mAbs exhibiting over 97% homology to human antibodies. Selected mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against three clades (0, 1, 2) of the H5N1 influenza viruses. The in vivo protection experiments demonstrated that the mAbs effectively protected the mice even when administered up to 3 days after infection with H5N1 influenza virus. In particular, mAb 4E6 demonstrated sub-picomolar binding affinity to HA and superior in vivo protection efficacy without the loss of body weight and obvious lung damage. The analysis of the 4E6 escape mutants demonstrated that the 4E6 antibody bound to a conserved epitope region containing two amino acids on the globular head of HA. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrated the generation of neutralizing mAbs for potential application in humans in urgent preparedness against outbreaks of new influenza infections or other virulent infectious diseases."

These species coincide geographically, co-occur locally, and consume similar food resources. Despite their idiosyncratic responses to landscape and patch variables, patch occupancy models suggest that competition may influence their respective distributions and abundances, and accordingly their influence on the rest of the forest community. Experimental studies, however, are wanting. We present the result of a large-scale experiment in which we removed white-footed mice or gray squirrels from small, isolated forest fragments in Dutchess County, New York, and added these mammals to other fragments in order to alter the abundance of these two species. We then used mark–recapture analyses to quantify the population-level and individual-level effects on resident mice, squirrels, and chipmunks. Overall, we found little evidence of competition. There were essentially no within-season numerical responses to changes in the abundance of putative competitors. Moreover, while individual-level responses (apparent survival and capture probability) did vary with competitor densities in some models, these effects were often better explained by site-specific parameters and were restricted to few of the 19 sites we studied. With only weak or nonexistent competition among these three common rodent species, we expect their patterns of habitat occupancy and population dynamics to be largely independent of one another."

A short porcine LEPR isoform (LEPRa), that encodes a protein lacking the intracellular residues responsible of signal transduction, has been identified for the first time. The LEPRb isoform was only quantifiable in hypothalamus while LEPRa appeared widely expressed across tissues, but at higher levels in liver, suggesting that both isoforms would develop different roles. The unique LEP transcript showed expression in backfat and muscle. The effects of gene variants on transcript expression revealed interesting results. The LEPRc.1987C>T polymorphism showed opposite effects on LEPRb and LEPRa hypothalamic expression. In addition, one out of the 16 polymorphisms identified in the LEPR promoter region revealed high differential expression in hepatic LEPRa. These results suggest a LEPR isoform-specific regulation at tissue level. Conversely, non-differential expression of LEP conditional on the analyzed polymorphisms could be detected, indicating that its regulation is likely affected by other mechanisms rather than gene sequence variants. The present study has allowed a transcriptional characterization of LEP and LEPR isoforms on a range of tissues. Their expression patterns seem to indicate that both molecules develop peripheral roles apart from their known hypothalamic signal transduction function."

The biosynthesis of these complex polysaccharides involves complicated reactions that turn the simple glycosaminoglycan backbone into highly heterogeneous structures. One of the modification reactions is the epimerization of D-glucuronic acid to its C5-epimer L-iduronic acid, which is essential for the function of heparan sulfate. Although L-iduronic acid residues have been shown to exist in polysaccharides of some prokaryotes, there has been no experimental evidence for the existence of a prokaryotic D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase. This work for the first time reports on the identification of a bacterial enzyme with D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase activity. A gene of the marine bacterium Bermanella marisrubri sp. RED65 encodes a protein (RED65_08024) of 448 amino acids that has an overall 37% homology to the human D-glucuronic acid C5-epimerase. Alignment of this peptide with the human and mouse sequences revealed a 60% similarity at the carboxyl terminus. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed epimerization activity toward substrates generated from heparin and the E. coli K5 capsular polysaccharide, thereby providing the first evidence for bacterial D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase activity. These findings may eventually be used for modification of mammalian glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2027640025,"FtsZ from most bacteria assembles rapidly in vitro, reaching a steady-state plateau in 5-10 s after addition of GTP. A recent study used a novel dynamic light-scattering technique to assay the assembly of FtsZ from Caulobacter crescentus (CcFtsZ) and reported that assembly required 10 min, ∼100 times slower than for related bacteria. Previous studies had indicated normal, rapid assembly of CcFtsZ. We have reinvestigated the assembly kinetics using a mutant L72W, where assembly of subunits into protofilaments results in a significant increase in tryptophan fluorescence. We found that assembly reached a plateau in 5-10 s and showed no change in the following 10 min. This was confirmed by 90° light scattering and negative-stain electron microscopy. The very slow kinetics in the dynamic light-scattering study may be related to a refractory state induced when the FtsZ protein is stored without nucleotide, a phenomenon that we had observed in a previous study of EcFtsZ. We conclude that CcFtsZ is not an outlier, but shows rapid assembly kinetics similar to FtsZ from related bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1978909709,"Homologous recombination is important for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks and for replication fork restart. Recombinases of the RecA/Rad51 family perform the central catalytic role in this process. UvsX recombinase is the RecA/Rad51 ortholog of bacteriophage T4. UvsX and other recombinases form presynaptic filaments on ssDNA that are activated to search for homology in dsDNA and to perform DNA strand exchange. To effectively initiate recombination, UvsX must find and bind to ssDNA within an excess of dsDNA. Here we examine the binding of UvsX to ssDNA and dsDNA in the presence and absence of nucleotide cofactor, ATP. We also examine how the binding of one DNA substrate is affected by simultaneous binding of the other to determine how UvsX might selectively assemble on ssDNA. We show that the two DNA binding sites of UvsX are regulated by the nucleotide cofactor ATP and are coordinated with each other such that in the presence of ssDNA, dsDNA binding is significantly reduced and correlated with its homology to the ssDNA bound to the enzyme. UvsX has high affinity for dsDNA in the absence of ssDNA, which may allow for sequestration of the enzyme in an inactive form prior to ssDNA generation."
https://openalex.org/W2002752078,"Current efforts to understand antibiotic resistance on the whole genome scale tend to focus on known genes even as high throughput sequencing strategies uncover novel mechanisms. To identify genomic variations associated with antibiotic resistance, we employed a modified genome-wide association study; we sequenced genomic DNA from pools of E. coli clinical isolates with similar antibiotic resistance phenotypes using SOLiD technology to uncover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) unanimously conserved in each pool. The multidrug-resistant pools were genotypically similar to SMS-3-5, a previously sequenced multidrug-resistant isolate from a polluted environment. The similarity was evenly spread across the entire genome and not limited to plasmid or pathogenicity island loci. Among the pools of clinical isolates, genomic variation was concentrated adjacent to previously reported inversion and duplication differences between the SMS-3-5 isolate and the drug-susceptible laboratory strain, DH10B. SNPs that result in non-synonymous changes in gyrA (encoding the well-known S83L allele associated with fluoroquinolone resistance), mutM, ligB, and recG were unanimously conserved in every fluoroquinolone-resistant pool. Alleles of the latter three genes are tightly linked among most sequenced E. coli genomes, and had not been implicated in antibiotic resistance previously. The changes in these genes map to amino acid positions in alpha helices that are involved in DNA binding. Plasmid-encoded complementation of null strains with either allelic variant of mutM or ligB resulted in variable responses to ultraviolet light or hydrogen peroxide treatment as markers of induced DNA damage, indicating their importance in DNA metabolism and revealing a potential mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance. Our approach uncovered evidence that additional DNA binding enzymes may contribute to fluoroquinolone resistance and further implicate environmental bacteria as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2107624127,"The genome of periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans exhibits substantial variations in gene content among unrelated strains primarily due to the presence or absence of genomic islands. This study examined the genomic stability of A. actinomycetemcomitans during its persistent infection in the same host. Four pairs of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, each pair isolated from an individual over time (0–10 years), were examined for their gains/losses of genes by whole genome sequencing, comparative genomic hybridization by microarray and PCR analysis. Possible effects due to genomic changes were further assessed by comparative transcriptome analysis using microarrays. The results showed that each pair of strains was clonally identical based on phylogenetic analysis of 150 core genes. A novel 24.1-Kb plasmid found in strain S23A was apparently lost in the sibling strain I23C. A 353-bp inversion affecting two essential genes of the serotype-specific gene cluster was found in the serotype antigen-nonexpressing strain I23C, while the same gene cluster was intact in the serotype-expressing sibling strain S23A. A 2,293-bp deletion affecting a gene encoding oxaloacetate decarboxylase and its neighbor region was found in strain SCC2302 but not in the sibling strain AAS4a. However, no evidence of gains or losses of genomic islands was found in the paired strains. Transcriptome profiles showed little or no difference in the paired strains. In conclusion, the genome of A. actinomycetemcomitans appears to be relatively stable during short-term infection. Several types of genomic changes were observed in the paired strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans recovered from the same subjects, including a mutation in serotype-specific gene cluster that may allow the bacteria to evade host immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1994599447,"Several deleterious intra-acinar phenomena are simultaneously triggered on initiating acute pancreatitis. These culminate in acinar injury or inflammatory mediator generation in vitro and parenchymal damage in vivo. Supraphysiologic caerulein is one such initiator which simultaneously activates numerous signaling pathways including non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as of the Src family. It also causes a sustained increase in cytosolic calcium- a player thought to be crucial in regulating deleterious phenomena. We have shown Src to be involved in caerulein induced actin remodeling, and caerulein induced changes in the Golgi and post-Golgi trafficking to be involved in trypsinogen activation, which initiates acinar cell injury. However, it remains unclear whether an increase in cytosolic calcium is necessary to initiate acinar injury or if injury can be initiated at basal cytosolic calcium levels by an alternate pathway. To study the interplay between tyrosine kinase signaling and calcium, we treated mouse pancreatic acinar cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. We studied the effect of the clinically used Src inhibitor Dasatinib (BMS-354825) on pervanadate or caerulein induced changes in Src activation, trypsinogen activation, cell injury, upstream cytosolic calcium, actin and Golgi morphology. Pervanadate, like supraphysiologic caerulein, induced Src activation, redistribution of the F-actin from its normal location in the sub-apical area to the basolateral areas, and caused antegrade fragmentation of the Golgi. These changes, like those induced by supraphysiologic caerulein, were associated with trypsinogen activation and acinar injury, all of which were prevented by Dasatinib. Interestingly, however, pervanadate did not cause an increase in cytosolic calcium, and the caerulein induced increase in cytosolic calcium was not affected by Dasatinib. These findings suggest that intra-acinar deleterious phenomena may be initiated independent of an increase in cytosolic calcium. Other players resulting in acinar injury along with the Src family of tyrosine kinases remain to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2004898475,"DNA methylation is an important regulatory mechanism for gene expression that involved in the biological processes of development and differentiation in plants. To investigate the association of DNA methylation with heterosis in Brassica, a set of intraspecific hybrids in Brassica rapa and B. napus and interspecific hybrids between B. rapa and B. napus, together with parental lines, were used to monitor alterations in cytosine methylation at 5′-CCGG sites in seedlings and buds by methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism analysis. The methylation status of approximately a quarter of the methylation sites changed between seedlings and buds. These alterations were related closely to the genomic structure and heterozygous status among accessions. The methylation status in the majority of DNA methylation sites detected in hybrids was the same as that in at least one of the parental lines in both seedlings and buds. However, the association between patterns of cytosine methylation and heterosis varied among different traits and between tissues in hybrids of Brassica, although a few methylation loci were associated with heterosis. Our data suggest that changes in DNA methylation at 5′-CCGG sites are not associated simply with heterosis in the interspecific and intraspecific hybridizations derived from B. rapa and B. napus."
https://openalex.org/W1983535576,"Human protein complexes play crucial roles in various biological processes as the functional module. However, the expression features of human protein complexes at the transcriptome cascade are poorly understood. Here, we used the RNA-Seq data from 16 disparate tissues and four types of human cancers to explore the characteristics and dynamics of human protein complexes. We observed that many individual components of human protein complexes can be generated by multiple distinct transcripts. Similar with yeast, the human protein complex constituents are inclined to co-express in diverse tissues. The dominant isoform of the genes involved in protein complexes tend to encode the complex constituents in each tissue. Our results indicate that the protein complex dynamics not only correlate with the presence or absence of complexes, but may also be related to the major isoform switching for complex subunits. Between any two cancers of breast, colon, lung and prostate, we found that only a few of the differentially expressed transcripts associated with complexes were identical, but 5–10 times more protein complexes involved in differentially expressed transcripts were common. Collectively, our study reveals novel properties and dynamics of human protein complexes at the transcriptome cascade in diverse normal tissues and different cancers."

Photo credit: Amoret Tanner Collection/The Art Archive at Art Resource, New York, NY. Modern wheat was domesticated ~14,000 years ago. The free-threshing phenotype, which made domestication possible, is a result of a mutation in a transcription factor called Q2 (1). This mutation was introduced into hexaploid Triticum aestivum, the basis of all contemporary bread, by conventional breeding. Why not, then, label all bread as GMOs? All potatoes? All tomatoes— such as the “Turner Hybrid Tomato”? All foods that have been genetically modified by conventional breeding? The target of the labeling frenzy is foodstuff that was created by the precise insertion of one or more genes using recombinant DNA technology, a methodology that in contrast to conventional breeding, results in a plant or animal containing a known number of new genes with known products. Why focus on the method by which the organism was created rather than the properties of the organism itself? A National Research Council study addressed this question more than 20 years ago in the context of concern about field-testing plants containing recombinant DNA.3 That study recommended strongly that the properties of the plant, rather than the method used to create it, were the key to constructing a useful policy (2). California seems to become a focus of attention by groups whose political interests exceed their scientific understanding. Some years ago, these enthusiasts destroyed quite good experiments in which strawberry plants containing a gene expressing an antifreeze protein were being tested to determine if that protein might provide some protection against frost damage. They tore up the experimental plots, bringing that work to an end. That level of “concern” for the environment became manifest in the discussions about a California initiative to require labeling of foods that contain genetically engineered ingredients. The political component of this initiative becomes evident as soon as one realizes that any and all food contains genetically engineered ingredients. The derogatory “GMO” term stems from ignorance—a failure to recognize that transgenic plants, for example, have been created by procedures that are more precise and controlled than conventional breeding. The political nature of this concern can be illustrated by the history of animal feed use in Europe, particularly in France. Thanks to extremely noisy advocates, it became impossible for French producers of beef and pork to import soybean meal from the United States. (Soybeans in the United States are largely engineered to be resistant to herbicides that kill weeds.) Instead, the French animals were fed animal parts from England. Then came the scare of Scrapie-related disease that could be communicated, in principle, by infected animal parts from England. Lo, one door swung shut, and another opened. Overnight, U.S. meal from genetically engineered soybeans was permitted to be imported and used to feed animals. Guess what? No French animals have suffered to date, and that is a grand experiment going on for years. And the imported soybean meal is not labeled GMO. The current labeling dustup, metastasizing from California, has reached into the peaceful confines of the respected Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, whose major business is the certification of dieticians as well as providing useful advice on diet and nutrition to hospitals and other clients. Before weighing in on the label controversy by supporting or objecting to the California-labeling initiative, the academy wisely appointed a committee to review the scientific facts and engaged a distinguished professor from the University of California at Davis to write a report, which is expected to be widely quoted and influential. However, one member of the review committee, objected because of the presence on the committee of two persons who had a “conflict of interest.” One had received an award from Monsanto, and the other is a vice president of the International Food Information Council, which is financed, in part, by agri-businesses (3). There is no need to label foods thought to contain GMOs, whatever the labelers mean by GMO. Better to tell the prospective purchaser how much salt that food contains. Salt presents a clear and present danger; GMOs do not."
