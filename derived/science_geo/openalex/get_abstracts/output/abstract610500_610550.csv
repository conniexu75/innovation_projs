https://openalex.org/W2803084733,"This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene 'click chemistry' aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via in situ immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9-10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices."
https://openalex.org/W2801057471,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of aerobic high-intensity training with reduced volume and training cessation on body composition and physical fitness after the end of season and the time required to recapture physical fitness with intensified retraining following two weeks of detraining in elite soccer players.Twenty male semi-professional soccer players participated in this study. The soccer players were assigned to either a group that completed high-intensity aerobic training (HAT, n = 10) or to a detraining and retraining group (DHAT, n = 10) for a 5-week period immediately after the end of the season. The first 2 weeks of the period, members of the HAT group performed high-intensity aerobic exercise (80-90% of HRmax, 12 min × 3, three times per week), whereas members of the DHAT group abstained from any physical activity. During the subsequent 3 weeks, members of both the HAT and DHAT groups completed high-intensity aerobic exercise. Exercise performance testing and body composition analysis were performed before; after 2 weeks of detraining; and at 1, 2 and 3 weeks of retraining.Intensified high-intensity training for 5 weeks maintained the performance in the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 2 test (Yo-Yo IR2) and repeated sprints at any time point (P > 0.05). However 2 weeks of detraining resulted in significant decreases in the performance on the Yo-Yo IR2 (P < 0.01) and repeated sprints test (P < 0.05). Performance on the Yo-Yo IR2 enhanced after 2 weeks of retraining and was maintained up to 3 weeks after retraining, with no significant differences between conditions (P > 0.05). In addition, repeated sprint performance markedly decreased after the detraining period (P < 0.05) and was continuously lower compared to the baseline at 2 weeks after retraining (P < 0.05). Furthermore, this value reached baseline level at the end of the experimental period (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between conditions in body composition, performance of agility, or sprint ability throughout the 5-week experimental period (P > 0.05).The present data suggest that short-term detraining after the competitive season can markedly decrease performances in the Yo-Yo IR2 test and repeated sprints. To return to a previous level of ability on the Yo-Yo IR2 and/or sprint test with retraining through high-intensity aerobic training after a period of detraining, a similar or longer period of retraining is required. However, the high-intensity training with reduced amount of training after competitive season can prevent reductions in physical fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2800612869,"Flavin-dependent halogenases catalyse halogenation of aromatic compounds. In most cases, this reaction proceeds with high regioselectivity and requires only the presence of FADH2, oxygen, and halide salts. Since marine habitats contain high concentrations of halides, organisms populating the oceans might be valuable sources of yet undiscovered halogenases. A new Hidden-Markov-Model (HMM) based on the PFAM tryptophan halogenase model was used for the analysis of marine metagenomes. Eleven metagenomes were screened leading to the identification of 254 complete or partial putative flavin-dependent halogenase genes. One predicted halogenase gene (brvH) was selected, codon optimised for E. coli, and overexpressed. Substrate screening revealed that this enzyme represents an active flavin-dependent halogenase able to convert indole to 3-bromoindole. Remarkably, bromination prevails also in a large excess of chloride. The BrvH crystal structure is very similar to that of tryptophan halogenases but reveals a substrate binding site that is open to the solvent instead of being covered by a loop."
https://openalex.org/W2802921980,"Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2801639927,"Purpose Peritumoral edema impedes the full delineation of fiber tracts due to partial volume effects in image voxels that contain a mixture of cerebral parenchyma and extracellular water. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of incorporating a free water (FW) model of edema for white matter tractography in the presence of edema. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated 26 consecutive brain tumor patients with diffusion MRI and T2-weighted images acquired presurgically. Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) was performed using the two-tensor unscented Kalman filter tractography (UKFt) method, the UKFt method with a reduced fiber tracking stopping fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold (UKFt+rFA), and the UKFt method with the addition of a FW compartment (UKFt+FW). An automated white matter fiber tract identification approach was applied to delineate the AF. Quantitative measurements included tract volume, edema volume, and mean FW fraction. Visual comparisons were performed by three experts to evaluate the quality of the detected AF tracts. Results The AF volume in edematous brain hemispheres was significantly larger using the UKFt+FW method (p<0.0001) compared to UKFt, but not significantly larger (p = 0.0996) in hemispheres without edema. The AF size increase depended on the volume of edema: a significant correlation was found between AF volume affected by (intersecting) edema and AF volume change with the FW model (Pearson r = 0.806, p<0.0001). The mean FW fraction was significantly larger in tracts intersecting edema (p = 0.0271). Compared to the UKFt+rFA method, there was a significant increase of the volume of the AF tract that intersected the edema using the UKFt+FW method, while the whole AF volumes were similar. Expert judgment results, based on the five patients with the smallest AF volumes, indicated that the expert readers generally preferred the AF tract obtained by using the FW model, according to their anatomical knowledge and considering the potential influence of the final results on the surgical route. Conclusion Our results indicate that incorporating biophysical models of edema can increase the sensitivity of tractography in regions of peritumoral edema, allowing better tract visualization in patients with high grade gliomas and metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2800341854,"Vision loss from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has a profound effect on vision-related quality of life (VRQoL). The pupose of this study is to identify clinical factors associated with VRQoL using the Rasch- calibrated NEI VFQ-25 scales in bilateral advanced AMD patients.We retrospectively reviewed 47 patients (mean age 83.2 years) with bilateral advanced AMD. Clinical assessment included age, gender, type of AMD, high contrast visual acuity (VA), history of medical conditions, contrast sensitivity (CS), central visual field loss, report of Charles Bonnet Syndrome, current treatment for AMD and Rasch-calibrated NEI VFQ-25 visual function and socioemotional function scales. The NEI VFQ visual function scale includes items of general vision, peripheral vision, distance vision and near vision-related activity while the socioemotional function scale includes items of vision related-social functioning, role difficulties, dependency, and mental health. Multiple regression analysis (structural regression model) was performed using fixed item parameters obtained from the one-parameter item response theory model.Multivariate analysis showed that high contrast VA and CS were two factors influencing VRQoL visual function scale (β = -0.25, 95% CI-0.37 to -0.12, p<0.001 and β = 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.46, p<0.001) and socioemontional functioning scale (β = -0.2, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.03, p = 0.023, and β = 0.3, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.43, p = 0.001). Central visual field loss was not assoicated with either VRQoL visual or socioemontional functioning scale (β = -0.08, 95% CI-0.28 to 0.12,p = 0.44 and β = -0.09, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.16, p = 0.50, respectively).In patients with vision impairment secondary to bilateral advanced AMD, high contrast VA and CS are two important factors affecting VRQoL."
https://openalex.org/W2799629069,"The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized."
https://openalex.org/W2800170307,"Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W2799476107,"Electrical stimulation (ES) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are widely used in bone regeneration because of their osteogenic activity. However, the combined effects of ES and supplemental IGF-1 on the whole bone formation process remain unclear. In this study, fluorescence staining and an MTT assay were first utilized to observe the influence of ES and IGF-1 on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and adhesion in vitro. Subsequently, osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by the alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and the expression of osteogenic marker genes. In addition, cell mineralization was determined by alizarin red staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We demonstrated that the MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation was significantly higher for treatments combining IGF-1 and ES than for treatments with IGF-1 alone. The combination of IGF-1 and ES increased the MC3T3-E1 cell ALP activity, the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and the calcium deposition with a clear dose-dependent effect. Our data show the synergistic effect of IGF-1 and ES in promoting the proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells, which suggests that it would be more effective to combine the proper dose of IGF-1 with ES to promote local bone damage repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2801490044,"Nutritional suitability of milk is not only related to gross composition, but is also strongly affected by the microheterogeniety of the protein fraction. Hence, to go further into the evaluation of the potential suitability of non-bovine milks in human/infant nutrition it is necessary to have a detailed characterization of their protein components. Combining proven proteomic approaches (SDS-PAGE, LC-MS/MS and LC-ESI-MS) and cDNA sequencing, we provide here in depth characterization of the milk protein fraction of dromedary and Bactrian camels, and their hybrids, from different regions of Kazakhstan. A total 391 functional groups of proteins were identified from 8 camel milk samples. A detailed characterization of 50 protein molecules, relating to genetic variants and isoforms arising from post-translational modifications and alternative splicing events, belonging to nine protein families (κ-, αs1-, αs2-, β-; and γ-CN, WAP, α-LAC, PGRP, CSA/LPO) was achieved by LC-ESI-MS. The presence of two unknown proteins UP1 (22,939 Da) and UP2 (23,046 Da) was also reported as well as the existence of a β-CN short isoform (946 Da lighter than the full-length β-CN), arising very likely in both genetic variants (A and B) from proteolysis by plasmin. In addition, we report, for the first time to our knowledge, the occurrence of a αs2-CN phosphorylation isoform with 12P groups within two recognition motifs, suggesting thereby the existence of two kinase systems involved in the phosphorylation of caseins in the mammary gland. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic variants, which hitherto seemed to be species- specific (e.g. β-CN A for Bactrian and β-CN B for dromedary), are in fact present both in Camel dromedarius and C. bactrianus."
https://openalex.org/W2802393199,"As part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in Aedes aegypti (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in Ae. aegypti, but, rather, in (a) a female Aedes albopictus pool, and (b) a female Culex quinquefasciatus pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved Ae. albopictus vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from Ae. albopictus is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than Ae. aegypti, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2802254242,"Metabolomics studies of disease conditions related to chronic alcohol consumption provide compelling evidence of several perturbed metabolic pathways underlying the pathophysiology of alcoholism. The objective of the present study was to utilize proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy metabolomics to study the holistic metabolic consequences of acute alcohol consumption in humans. The experimental design was a cross-over intervention study which included a number of substances to be consumed—alcohol, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) supplement, and a benzoic acid-containing flavoured water vehicle. The experimental subjects—24 healthy, moderate-drinking young men—each provided six hourly-collected urine samples for analysis. Complete data sets were obtained from 20 of the subjects and used for data generation, analysis and interpretation. The results from the NMR approach produced complex spectral data, which could be resolved sufficiently through the application of a combination of univariate and multivariate methods of statistical analysis. The metabolite profiles resulting from acute alcohol consumption indicated that alcohol-induced NAD+ depletion, and the production of an excessive amount of reducing equivalents, greatly perturbed the hepatocyte redox homeostasis, resulting in essentially three major metabolic disturbances—up-regulated lactic acid metabolism, down-regulated purine catabolism and osmoregulation. Of these, the urinary excretion of the osmolyte sorbitol proved to be novel, and suggests hepatocyte swelling due to ethanol influx following acute alcohol consumption. Time-dependent metabolomics investigations, using designed interventions, provide a way of interpreting the variation induced by the different factors of a designed experiment, thereby also giving methodological significance to this study. The outcomes of this approach have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the serious impact of the pathophysiological perturbations which arise from the consumption of a single, large dose of alcohol—a simulation of a widespread, and mostly naive, social practice."
https://openalex.org/W2800156302,"This study was performed to analyse the genetic and morphological diversity of the sabellid annelid genus Branchiomma, with special emphasis on a taxon so far identified as Branchiomma bairdi. This species, originally described from Bermuda, has frequently been reported as an invader in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific, but recent observations have raised some taxonomic questions. Samples of this taxon were collected from five sites in the Mediterranean Sea, two sites in the original distribution area of B. bairdi in the Gulf of Mexico and four localities in the east Pacific and Atlantic Oceans where B. bairdi has been reported as invasive. The molecular results revealed a conspicuous genetic divergence (18.5% K2P) between the sampled Mediterranean populations and all the other ones that led to a re-evaluation of their morphological characters. The latter showed that the Mediterranean and extra-Mediterranean populations also differ in some discrete morphological and reproductive features. Consequently, the Mediterranean samples were re-designated as B. boholense, another non-indigenous species originally described from Philippines. Branchiomma bairdi and B. boholense differ in body size, development and shape of micro and macrostylodes, size of radiolar eyes and body pigmentation. Genetic diversity was high in B. boholense from the Mediterranean as well as in B. bairdi from the Gulf of Mexico, but low in B. bairdi populations outside their native range. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of connections between the Mediterranean localities as well as between native and introduced B. bairdi populations that focus the attention on the Panama Canal as important passage for the introduction of the species from the Gulf of Mexico to the north-east Pacific Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2802845184,"There is growing evidence that the intermittent nature of mind wandering episodes and mood have a pronounced influence on trial-to-trial variability in performance. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics and significance of such lapses in attention remains inadequately understood. Here, we hypothesize that the dynamics of fluctuations in sustained attention between external and internal sources of information obey so-called critical-state dynamics, characterized by trial-to-trial dependencies with long-range temporal correlations. To test this, we performed behavioral investigations measuring reaction times in a visual sustained attention task and cued introspection in probe-caught reports of mind wandering. We show that trial-to-trial variability in reaction times exhibit long-range temporal correlations in agreement with the criticality hypothesis. Interestingly, we observed the fastest responses in subjects with the weakest long-range temporal correlations and show the vital effect of mind wandering and bad mood on this response variability. The implications of these results stress the importance of future research to increase focus on behavioral variability."
https://openalex.org/W2800523430,"As the density of human and domestic animal populations increases, the threat of localized epidemics and global pandemics grows. Although effective vaccines have been developed for a number of threatening pathogens, manufacturing and disseminating vaccines in the face of a rapidly spreading epidemic or pandemic remains a formidable challenge. One potentially powerful solution to this problem is the use of transmissible vaccines. Transmissible vaccines are capable of spreading from one individual to another and are currently being developed for a range of infectious diseases. Here we develop and analyze mathematical models that allow us to quantify the benefits of vaccine transmission in the face of an imminent or ongoing epidemic. Our results demonstrate that even a small amount of vaccine transmission can greatly increase the rate at which a naïve host population can be protected against an anticipated epidemic and substantially reduce the size of unanticipated epidemics if vaccination is initiated shortly after pathogen detection. In addition, our results identify key biological properties and implementation practices that maximize the impact of vaccine transmission on infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2802044528,"Objectives Few studies have assessed the long-term medical costs and incidence of obesity and overweight in Asia. We evaluated the impact of body mass index (BMI) on medical expenditures and disease incidence and prevalence over more than 10 years in South Korea. Methods Using 2002–2013 data from the Korean National Claims Database, we analysed two population sets (initial BMI in 2002–2003; consistent BMI in 2002–2003 and 2012–2013). Obesity was defined by Asian BMI criteria. Incremental medical expenditures or Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ratios for obese compared to normal weight individuals were calculated. Medical expenditure over 11 years was estimated by BMI using a generalised linear model. Individual obesity-related disease incidence was determined and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated. Results Data for 496,469 and 214,477 individuals were included in the entire and consistent BMI level populations, respectively. Average CCI score change in normal weight and the obesity III (BMI 35–59.99 kg/m2) group over 11 years were 0.94 and 1.56, respectively in the entire population, and incremental ratio in the obesity III group was 66.0% compared to the normal weight group. In consistent BMI level population, incremental ratio (92.1%) for obesity III was higher than entire population. Medical costs in the obesity III groups versus the normal weight group in the entire and consistent BMI level populations increased by 38.4% and 77.1%, respectively. Over 11 years, individuals with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 in the entire and consistent BMI level populations had post-adjustment medical expenditures of 1.13–1.20 and 1.21–1.40 times the normal weight group, respectively. Incidence rate and adjusted hazard ratio of obesity-related disease increased in the obesity groups compared to the normal weight group. Conclusions Our findings emphasize the importance of the effective and sustainable obesity management strategies, considering the dramatic increase in obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2802950087,"Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle."

Here we demonstrate that heterobifunctional cross-linkers, while theoretically different from homobifunctional cross-linkers, need not be considered separately in practice. We develop and then evaluate the impact of applying a correct FDR formula for use of heterobifunctional cross-linkers and conclude that there are minimal practical advantages. Hence a single formula can be applied to data generated from the many different non-cleavable cross-linkers."
https://openalex.org/W2802588917,"Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) provides emergency pulmonary and cardiac assistance for patients in respiratory or cardiac failure. Most studies evaluate the success of ECLS based on patients' survival rate. However, the trajectory of health status and quality of life (QOL) should also be important considerations. The study's aim was to explore changes in health status and QOL in adult patients weaned from ECLS who survived to hospital discharge over a one-year period.A prospective longitudinal study was conducted from April 2012 to September 2014. A convenience sample of patients who had undergone ECLS was followed for one-year after hospital discharge. Heath status was measured with a physical activity scale, the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and a social support scale; we assessed quality of life with the physical and mental component summary scales of the Short-Form 36 Health Survey. Changes in depression, social support, physical activity and QOL were analysed with generalized estimating equations at 3-month intervals; participants' QOL at 12 months after discharge was compared with the general population.A total of 231 patients received ECLS during the study period. Sixty-five patients survived to hospital discharge (28% survival rate); 32 participants completed the study. Data showed scores for physical activity increased significantly over time (p < .001), while depression and social support significantly decreased (p < .05 and p < .001, respectively). Participants with veno-venous ECLS had higher scores for depression than participants with veno-arterial ECLS (p < .05). PCS scores significantly increased at 9, and 12 months after discharge (p < .05 and p < .001, respectively). There was no significant change in MCS scores.This was a preliminary study of patients with ECLS following hospital discharge over a one-year period. One year following hospital discharge survivors of ECLS continued to experience physical complications and some continued to have depressive symptoms; the level of social support was significantly lower after hospital discharge. Healthcare professionals should understand the trajectory of health status and QOL after discharge, which can help developing evidence-based interventions and improve QOL for survivors of ECLS."
https://openalex.org/W2799352675,"Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce."
https://openalex.org/W2799554631,"Background Long delays to diagnosis is a major cause of late presentation of breast diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Aims We designed and implemented a single-visit breast care algorithm that overcomes health system-related barriers to timely diagnosis of breast diseases. Methods A multidisciplinary team of Zambian healthcare experts trained a team of mid- and high-level Zambian healthcare practitioners how to evaluate women for breast diseases, and train trainers to do likewise. Working collaboratively, the two teams then designed a clinical platform that provides multiple breast care services within a single visit. The service platform was implemented using a breast outreach camp format, during which breast self-awareness, psychosocial counseling, clinical breast examination, breast ultrasound, ultrasound-guided biopsy, imprint cytology of biopsy specimens and surgical treatment or referral, were offered within a single visit. Results Eleven hundred and twenty-nine (1129) women attended the camps for breast care. Mean age was 35.9 years. The majority were multiparous (79.4%), breast-fed (76.0%), and reported hormone use (50.4%). Abnormalities were detected on clinical breast examination in 122 (10.8%) women, 114 of whom required ultrasound. Of the 114 who underwent ultrasound, 48 had identifiable lesions and were evaluated with ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (39) or fine-needle aspiration (9). The concordance between imprint cytology and histopathology was 100%, when breast specimens were classified as either benign or malignant. However, when specimens were classified by histopathologic subtype, the concordance between imprint cytology and histology was 85.7% for benign and 100% for malignant lesions. Six (6) women were diagnosed with invasive cancer. Eighteen (18) women with symptomatic breast lesions had next-day surgery.

To assess prevalence of triple burden of disease of currently married women and to contrast out of pocket maternal care expenditure of these diseases in India.This study uses nationally representative unit level data from the 71st round (2014) of the National Sample Survey Organisation. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis are employed to assess triple burden of diseases by background of currently married women. Mean out of pocket (OOP) expenditure for healthcare care by demographic and household characteristics of women are also compared by type of diseases. Two parts model is adopted for assessment of determents of out of pocket healthcare expenditure of women.Overall medical and non-medical expenses of non-communicable disease are much higher than those of other disease and disability, reproductive health related and communicable diseases. OOP expenditure for treatment of non-communicable diseases, reproductive health and related diseases and other disease and disability are significantly higher than the inpatient treatment of communicable diseases and the differences are statistically significant.Out of pocket expenditure for treatment of non-communicable diseases is the highest, followed by that of other diseases & disability, then reproductive health related diseases and the least is for communicable diseases. OOP expenditures for maternal healthcare in private health facilities are much higher than in public health facilities regardless of types of disease. Women from households having insurance of any member spent less than that of women from households not having health insurance. There is an urgent need to expand the outreach of the public health system in India to rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2801176561,"Background When subjects without a known malignancy present with suspicious skeletal lesions, differential diagnosis and primary cancer identification is important. Here, we investigated the role of FDG PET/CT in this clinical situation. Methods We enrolled 103 patients with no known malignancies who were referred for FDG PET/CT because of bone lesions that were suspicious for cancer metastasis. Each extra-skeletal FDG lesion was categorized as consistent with primary cancer or with metastasis based on the distribution and pattern of all abnormal lesions in the individual. Results Final diagnosis revealed that bone lesions represented cancer metastasis in 75 patients (72.8%). In the remaining 28 patients (27.2%), they were from other causes including multiple myeloma or lymphoma, malignant primary bone tumor, and benign bone disease. PET/CT indicated a primary cancer in 70 patients (68.0%). This was the correct primary site in 46 cases and the incorrect site in 13 cases (including 6 cases with cancer of unknown primary, CUP). In the remaining 11 cases, the bone lesions were due to other causes. PET/CT did not indicate a primary cancer in 33 patients (32.0%). Of these cases, 17 did not have a primary cancer, 8 had CUP, and 8 had primary cancers that were missed. Thus, PET/CT had a sensitivity of 61.3% and specificity of 60.7% for primary cancer identification in the entire population. Excluding patients with CUP, PET/CT sensitivity was 75.4%. PET/CT also provided information useful for recognizing multiple myeloma and benign bone disease as the cause of the skeletal lesions. Conclusions In patients without known malignancies with suspected skeletal cancer metastasis, FDG PET/CT can help identify the primary cancer and provide useful information for differential diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2799482005,"Female sex workers (FSWs) continue to carry a heavy burden of sexually transmitted infections (STI). For prevention purposes, there is a need to identify most-at-risk subgroups among them. The objective of this longitudinal cohort study conducted at Dispensaire IST, Cotonou, Benin, was to assess Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) / Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) incidence and determinants; and HIV incidence among FSWs in presence of STI/HIV risk reduction activities. Overall, 319 adult FSWs were followed quarterly from September 2008 to March 2012. NG/CT were detected from endocervical swabs by Amplified DNA Assays employing Strand displacement amplification technology. HIV testing was done on capillary blood using two consecutive rapid diagnostic tests. Anderson-Gill proportional hazard models (HR) were used to determine factors independently associated with NG/CT incidence. The majority of FSWs were HIV-negative (188, 58.9%). There were 6 HIV seroconversions among these 188 HIV-negative women. HIV incidence (95% Confidence interval, CI) was 1.41 (0.28-2.54) seroconversions per 100 person-years at risk (PYAR): 6 events / 425.1 PYAR. Sixty-two out of 319 women experienced 83 new episodes of NG/CT for an overall incidence rate (95% CI) of 10.8 (8.17-13.88) events / 100 PYAR. From month-24 onwards, HIV-positive women (treated: HR (95%CI): 4.2 (1.60-10.77); untreated: HR (95%CI): 4.2 (1.59-11.49) were more likely to acquire NG/CT compared to HIV-negative FSWs. Longer duration in sex work (>2 years: HR; 95%CI: 0.4 (0.22-0.72)) was protective against NG/CT. Refusal by clients (55.8%) was the main reason for non-condom use. Enrolling women from one clinic (Dispensaire IST) may have impaired generalizability of the findings. New NG/CT/HIV infections were observed among FSWs notwithstanding ongoing prevention interventions. To eliminate HIV transmission among FSWs, STI/HIV control programs need to promote women's empowerment and address vulnerability to infection of HIV-positive FSWs."
https://openalex.org/W2800340710,"The diversity of planktonic eukaryotic microbes was studied at a coastal station of the eastern English Channel (EEC) from March 2011 to July 2015 (77 samples) using high throughput sequencing (454-pyrosequencing and Illumina) of the V2-V3 hypervariable region of the 18S SSU rDNA gene. Similar estimations of OTU relative abundance and taxonomic distribution for the dominant higher taxonomic groups (contributing >1% of the total number of OTUs) were observed with the two methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value = 0.22). Eight super-groups were identified throughout all samples: Alveolata, Stramenopiles, Opisthokonta, Hacrobia, Archeaplastida, Apusozoa, Rhizaria, and Amoebozoa (ordered by decreasing OTU richness). To gain further insight into microbial activity in the EEC, ribosomal RNA was extracted for samples from 2013-2015 (30 samples). Analysis of 18S rDNA and rRNA sequences led to the detection of 696 and 700 OTUs, respectively. Cluster analysis based on OTUs' abundance indicated three major seasonal groups that were associated to spring, winter/autumn, and summer conditions. The clusters inferred from rRNA data showed a clearer seasonal representation of the community succession than the one based on rDNA. The rRNA/rDNA ratio was used as a proxy for relative cell activity. When all OTUs were considered, the average rRNA:rDNA ratio showed a linear trend around the 1:1 line, suggesting a linear relation between OTU abundance (rDNA) and activity (rRNA). However, this ratio was highly variable over time when considering individual OTUs. Interestingly, the OTU affiliated with P. globosa displayed rRNA:rDNA ratio that allowed to delimit high vs low abundance and high vs low activity periods. It unveiled quite well the Phaeocystis bloom dynamic regarding cell proliferation and activity, and could even be used as early indicator of an upcoming bloom."
https://openalex.org/W2801942763,"Pesticides represent a potential public health hazard of note in farming communities. Accumulating evidence indicates that some pesticides used in agriculture act as hormone disrupters, with the potential to result in chronic health effects. Despite such a growing evidence base, pesticides remain the preferred method of pest control in agriculture worldwide. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, usage is on the increase. This qualitative study assessed changes in the usage of pesticides by Zimbabwean smallholder cotton farmers in the past 30 years. Farmers reported an increase in the usage of pesticides, specifically insecticides, since the early 1980s. An increase in pest populations was also reported. The findings suggested a bi-directional causal relationship between the increase in pest population and the increase in pesticide use. Factors which emerged to have collectively impacted on the changes include climate variability, limited agency on the part of farmers, power dynamics involving the government and private cotton companies and farmers' perceptions and practices. An Integrated Pest Management Policy for Zimbabwe is recommended to facilitate integration of chemical controls with a broad range of other pest control tactics. Continuous farmer education and awareness raising is further recommended, since farmers' perceptions can influence their practices."
https://openalex.org/W2802388239,"This study investigated Vegfa expression in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of Vegfa mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine Vegfa gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for Vegfa within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human. All identified transcripts encode angiogenic VEGFAxxx isoforms, with no evidence for alternative splicing within exon 8. These findings led us to investigate in detail how “Vegfaxxxb-like” PCR products could be generated by RT-PCR and misidentified as endogenous transcripts, in sheep and human HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our findings do not support the existence of anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms in the ovine PT/MBH and shed new light on the interpretation of prior studies, which claimed to identify Vegfaxxxb isoforms by RT-PCR."
https://openalex.org/W2802957211,"Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of Testudinid herpesvirus genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2799625686,"Four small oval populations and five large intensive populations of Rhododendron aureum growing at the alpine in Changbai Mountain (China) were studied in two types of habitat (in the tundra and in Betula ermanii forest). Identification and delimitation of genets were inferred from excavation in small populations and from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers by the standardized sampling design in large populations. Clonal architecture and clonal diversity were then estimated. For the four small populations, they were monoclonal, the spacer length (18.6 ± 5.6 in tundra, 29.7 ± 9.7 in Betula ermanii forest, P < 0.05) was shorter and branching intensity (136.7 ± 32.9 in tundra, 43.4 ± 12.3 in Betula ermanii forest, P < 0.05) was higher in the tundra than that in Betula ermanii forest. For the five large populations, they were composed of multiple genets with high level of clonal diversity (Simpson’s index D = 0.84, clonal richness R = 0.25, Fager's evenness E = 0.85); the spatial distribution of genets showed that the clonal growth strategy of R. aureum exhibits both guerilla and phalanx. Our results indicate that the clonal plasticity of R. aureum could enhance exploitation of resource heterogeneity and in turn greatly contribute to maintenance or improvement of fitness and the high clonal diversity of R. aureum increase the evolutionary rates to adapt the harsh alpine environment in Changbai Mountain."
https://openalex.org/W2802354280,"Safe and effective antitoxins to treat and prevent botulism are needed for biodefense. We have developed recombinant antibody-based therapeutics for botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotypes A, B, and E. The mechanism of action of this antitoxin requires that three mAbs bind one toxin molecule to achieve clearance. Here we present a co-formulation of an antitoxin to the three most important serotypes. Combining these antibodies obviates the need to identify the serotype causing intoxication prior to drug administration, which would facilitate administration. The lyophilized powder formulation contains nine mAbs, three mAbs for each of the three serotypes (A, B, E). The formulation was stored as a liquid and lyophilized powder for up to one year, and characterized by binding affinity and multiple physicochemical methods. No significant increase in soluble higher order aggregates, cleavage products, or change in charge isoforms was measured after storage as a lyophilized powder at 50°C for one year. Furthermore, toxin-domain binding ELISA data indicated that each of the individual antibodies in the lyophilized drug product showed essentially full binding capability to their respective toxin domains after being stored at 50°C for one year. Physicochemical characterization of the formulation demonstrated the nine individual mAbs were remarkably stable. This work demonstrates feasibility of lyophilized, oligoclonal antibody therapies for biodefense with ambient temperature stability, that would facilitate stockpiling, distribution, and administration."
https://openalex.org/W2801606182,"Health Care Workers (HCWs) are among the highest risk groups for contracting tuberculosis (TB), which is ranked the third most common occupational health disease in South Africa. Little is known about the true extent of the burden of TB among South African HCWs and current surveillance approaches are inadequate. The study aimed to determine the feasibility of using postal and web-based surveys accessed through registries of registered professionals to estimate the prevalence of TB among HCWs in South Africa.We conducted a cross sectional survey on a sample of professional nurses and doctors (general practitioners) registered on the Medpages database platform; a subscription based registry for practising health care professionals. The survey included professionals who were actively involved in the clinical management of patients, either in public or private health care facilities. The paper based survey, including pre-paid return envelopes, was distributed via the post office and web-based surveys were distributed via e-mail through a hyperlink. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and the Chi-square test to determine associations between categorical variables. Active TB was defined as any history of TB.Out of a total of 3,400 health care professionals contacted, 596 (18%) responses were received: 401 (67%) web-based and 195 (33%) postal. A significantly higher percentage of complete forms were from postal compared to web-based (97% [189/195] versus 87% [348/401], p<0.001). Younger (<60 years) professionals were more likely to use the web-based compared to postal (87% [236/270] versus 71% [134/189], p<0.001). Overall, the prevalence of active TB infection was 8.7%, (95%CI: 6.3%-11.7%) and there was no difference observed between doctors and nurses (10.8% [18/167] versus 7.5% [22/292], p = 0.236).This novel approach demonstrated the feasibility of using an existing registry of professionals to conduct surveys to estimate the prevalence of TB. Our findings showed a high TB prevalence; however the estimate might have been biased by the low response rate. Further research to optimise our approach could lead to a viable option in improving surveillance among health care professionals."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of white wine consumption on granulocyte and monocyte CD15s, CD11b, and CD44 expression 24h after the surgically inflicted MI. Granulocytes and monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry, using whole blood of male Sprague–Dawley rats that consumed white wine for 4 weeks. This group was compared with water only drinking controls, sham animals (subject to surgery without myocardial infarction) and baseline group (intact animals that received no intervention prior to being sacrificed). Sham animals did not differ from baseline animals in CD11b+CD44+ percentage and CD44+ median fluorescence intensity. Wine drinking was associated with striking increase in CD44 expression on monocyte subpopulations. Its expression was three and fourfold increased on monocytes and large monocytes, respectively, relative to the water only drinking controls. Because of known role of CD44 on suppression of post-infarction inflammation, its upregulation on granulocytes and monocytes may significantly contribute to the microenvironment favourable for the cardiac regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2799610056,"Purpose To investigate the relationship between choroidal structure and visual acuity after intravitreal aflibercept therapy for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-centre and observational study including 18 eyes of 18 patients with PCV (73.8 ± 10.2 years of age) who were treated with three monthly intravitreal aflibercept injections followed by additional treatments in a treat-and-extend protocol. The cross-sectional images of the macula were obtained with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography at baseline, at 3 months, and at 12 months. The choroidal layer was divided into luminal or stromal segments by applying binarization processing to calculate these areas. The relationships between age, spherical equivalent, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), baseline value, or changes in the luminal or the stromal areas, and the BCVA change at 12 months were analysed using multiple regression analyses and model selection procedures. Results Both stromal and luminal areas were decreased at 3 and 12 months compared to baseline areas (5% and 9% at 3 months, 6% and 12% at 12 months, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Greater improvement of visual acuity (VA) at 12 months was significantly associated with younger age, greater spherical equivalent, worse baseline BCVA, greater baseline luminal area, and smaller baseline stromal area. Conclusions Choroidal structure might be useful as a new biomarker for potential Visual outcomes after intravitreal aflibercept therapy for PCV."
https://openalex.org/W2800346449,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight."
https://openalex.org/W2801160359,"A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p<0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation."
https://openalex.org/W2802037447,"Angiogenesis is essential for cancer metastasis, thus the discovery and characterization of molecules that inhibit this process is important. Thalidomide is a teratogenic drug which is known to inhibit angiogenesis and effectively inhibit cancer metastasis, yet the specific cellular targets for its effect are not well known. We discovered that CUL5 (previously identified as VACM-1), a scaffold protein in E3 ligase complexes, is involved in thalidomide-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell growth. Our results show that in human endothelial cells (HUVEC), thalidomide-dependent decrease in cell growth was associated with decreased nuclear localization of CUL5. In HUVEC transfected with anti-VACM-1 siRNA, thalidomide failed to decrease cell growth. Previously it was established that the antiproliferative effect of CUL5 is inhibited in rat endothelial cells (RAMEC) transfected with mutated CUL5 which is constitutively modified by NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein. In this study, the antiproliferative response to thalidomide was compromised in RAMEC expressing mutated CUL5. These results suggest that CUL5 protein is involved in the thalidomide-dependent regulation of cellular proliferation in vitro. Consequently, CUL5 may be an important part of the mechanism for thalidomide-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation, as well as a novel biomarker for predicting a response to thalidomide for the treatment of disorders such as multiple myeloma and HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2802084862,"Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers' preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger's choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost."
https://openalex.org/W2802507159,"Background Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) can cause Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in immunosuppressed individuals. However, little is known about the association between chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), circulating HHV8 DNA levels, and clinical KS in HIV-1-infected individuals with various malignancies. Therefore, we examined the associations between various malignancies, systemic cancer chemotherapy, T cell phenotypes, and circulating HHV8 DNA in 29 HIV-1-infected participants with concomitant KS or other cancer diagnoses. Methods We quantified HHV8 plasma viral loads and cell-associated HHV8 DNA and determined the relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and lymphocyte counts, and markers of early and late lymphocyte activation, proliferation and exhaustion. Results There were no significant differences in plasma HHV8 DNA levels between baseline and post-chemotherapy time points or with the presence or absence of clinical KS. However, in two participants circulating HHV8 DNA increased following treatment for KS or HSCT for lymphoma,. We observed an approximately 2-log10 reduction in plasma HHV8 DNA in an individual with KS and multicentric Castleman disease following rituximab monotherapy. Although individuals with clinical KS had lower mean CD4+ T cell counts and percentages as expected, there were no significant associations with these factors and plasma HHV8 levels. We identified increased proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing CD69 (P = 0.01 & P = 0.04 respectively), and increased CD57 expression on CD4+ T cells (P = 0.003) in participants with detectable HHV8. Conclusion These results suggest there is a complex relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and tissue-based disease in HIV-1 and HHV8 co-infected individuals with various malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2800531387,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied. Methods We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps. Result Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (β = .079, p = < .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (β = .068, p = < .0001), after adjusting all covariates. Conclusion Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2802659848,"There are a few common species and many rare species in a biological community or a multi-species collection in given space and time. This hollow distribution curve is called species abundance distribution (SAD). Few studies have examined the patterns and dynamics of SADs during the succession of forest communities by model selection. This study explored whether the communities in different successional stages followed different SAD models and whether there existed a best SAD model to reveal their intrinsic quantitative features of structure and dynamics in succession. The abundance (the number of individuals) of each vascular plant was surveyed by quadrat sampling method from the tree, shrub and herb layers in two typical communities (i.e., the evergreen needle- and broad-leaved mixed forest and the monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest) in southern subtropical Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, South China. The sites of two forest communities in different successional stages are both 1 ha in area. We collected seven widely representative SAD models with obviously different function forms and transformed them into the same octave (log2) scale. These models are simultaneously confronted with eight datasets from four layers of two communities, and their goodness-of-fits to the data were evaluated by the chi-squared test, the adjusted coefficient of determination and the information criteria. The results indicated that: (1) the logCauchy model followed all the datasets and was the best among seven models; (2) the fitness of each model to the data was not directly related to the successional stage of forest community; (3) according to the SAD curves predicted by the best model (i.e., the logCauchy), the proportion of rare species decreased but that of common ones increased in the upper layers with succession, while the reverse was true in the lower layers; and (4) the difference of the SADs increased between the upper and the lower layers with succession. We concluded that the logCauchy model had the widest applicability in describing the SADs, and could best mirror the SAD patterns and dynamics of communities and their different layers in the succession of forests. The logCauchy-modeled SADs can quantitatively guide the construction of ecological forests and the restoration of degraded vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2799537656,"In this manuscript, we report the design and development of a fast, reliable instrument to run gel-based cassette polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Here termed the GelCycler Mark II, our instrument is a miniaturized molecular testing system that is fast, low cost and sensitive. Cassette PCR utilizes capillary reaction units that carry all reagents needed for PCR, including primers and Taq polymerase, except the sample, which is loaded at the time of testing. Cassette PCR carries out real time quantitative PCR followed by melt curve analysis (MCA) to verify amplicon identity at the expected melt temperature (Tm). The cassette PCR technology is well developed, particularly for detecting pathogens, and has been rigorously validated for detecting pathogenic Escherichia coli in meat samples. However, the work has been hindered by the lack of a robust and stable instrument to carry out the PCR, which requires fast and accurate temperature regulation, improved light delivery and fluorescent recording, and faster PCR reactions that maintain a high sensitivity of detection. Here, we report design and testing of a new instrument to address these shortcomings and to enable standardized testing by cassette PCR and commercial manufacture of a robust and accurate instrument that can be mass produced to deliver consistent performance. As a corollary to our new instrument development, we also report the use of an improved design approach using a machined aluminum cassette to meet the new instrument standards, prevent any light bleed across different trenches in each cassette, and allow testing of a larger number of samples for more targets in a single run. The GelCycler Mark II can detect and report E. coli contamination in 41 minutes. Sample positives are defined in as having a melt curve comparable to the internal positive control, with peak height exceeding that of the internal negative control. In a fractional analysis, as little as 1 bacterium per capillary reaction unit is directly detectable, with no enrichment step, in 35 cycles of PCR/MCA, in a total time of 53 minutes, making this instrument and technology among the very best for speed and sensitivity in screening food for pathogenic contamination."

In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2802396160,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of synovial joints, characterized by the presence of the highly disease-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in approximately 70% of patients. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has previously been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of RA. However, given the high incidence of EBV in the general population and the difficulty of detecting initial infection, providing a direct link between EBV infection and RA development has remained elusive. We hypothesized that primary EBV infection may be a trigger for the development of the ACPA response in vivo. Using a unique cohort of 26 kidney transplant patients with a primary EBV infection, the presence of ACPA before and following infection was determined. No increase in IgG anti-CCP2 titers was detected following EBV infection. IgG anti-CCP2 antibodies were present in two patients and borderline positive in another. These three patients were HLA-DR4 negative. To test whether EBV infection may trigger a non-class switched anti-CCP2 response, IgM anti-CCP2 antibodies were analyzed. No general trend in the IgM anti-CCP2 response was observed following EBV infection. Since two out of the three IgG anti-CCP2 (borderline) positive patients were diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, 23 additional IgA nephropathy patients were tested for IgG anti-CCP2, regardless of their EBV status. All of these patients were IgG anti-CCP2 negative, indicating that IgG anti-CCP2 is not commonly present in IgA nephropathy patients. Collectively, these data do not support the hypothesis that EBV does trigger the highly RA specific ACPA response."
https://openalex.org/W2802543421,"Verbal learning and memory are impaired not only in patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) but also-to a lower extent-in those with an at-risk mental state for psychosis (ARMS). However, little is known about the specific nature of these impairments. Hence, we aimed to study learning and memory processes in ARMS and FEP patients by making use of structural equation modelling.Verbal learning was assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) in 98 FEP patients, 126 ARMS patients and 68 healthy controls (HC) as part of the Basel early detection of psychosis (FePsy) study. The four-factorial CFA model of Donders was used to estimate test performance on latent variables of the CVLT and growth curve analysis was used to model the learning curve. The latter allows disentangling initial recall, which is strongly determined by attentional processes, from the learning rate.The CFA model revealed that ARMS and FEP patients were impaired in Attention Span, Learning Efficiency and Delayed Memory and that FEP patients were additionally impaired in Inaccurate Memory. Additionally, ARMS-NT, but not ARMS-T, performed significantly worse than HC on Learning Efficiency. The growth curve model indicated that FEP patients were impaired in both initial recall and learning rate and that ARMS patients were only impaired in the learning rate.Since impairments were more pronounced in the learning rate than the initial recall, our results suggest that the lower scores in the CVLT reported in previous studies are more strongly driven by impairments in the rate of learning than by attentional processes."
https://openalex.org/W2800726813,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) has been shown to form biofilms, comprised of extracellular DNA (eDNA), in the middle ear and bronchus during clinical infections. Studies in our laboratory have shown that NTHi possesses a homolog of Staphylococcus aureus thermonuclease (staphylococcal thermonuclease), NTHi nuclease (NTHi Nuc, HI_1296). This enzyme had similar size, heat stability, and divalent cation requirements to those of the staphylococcal homolog as determined by light scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis suggested an overall shape and substrate-binding site comparable to those of staphylococcal nuclease. However, NTHi Nuc was approximately 25-fold more active in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) activity assay than staphylococcal thermonuclease. Homology modeling implicates shorter NTHi Nuc loops near the active site for this enhanced activity."
https://openalex.org/W2801084184,"In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011-2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011-2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18-8.40; p<0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14-2.44; p<0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45-5.62; p<0.05).A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients."
