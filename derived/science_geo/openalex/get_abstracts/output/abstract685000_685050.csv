https://openalex.org/W3215382413,"Previous literature has shown that migrant workers manifested higher common mental issues (especially depressive symptom) compared to local workers due to stressors such as financial constraint and lack of access to healthcare. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize the current body of evidence for the prevalence of depression and anxiety among migrant workers as well as exploring the risk factors and the availability of social support for migrant workers. Seven electronic databases, grey literature and Google Scholar were searched for studies from 2015 to 2021 related to mental health, social support and migrant workers. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). Study heterogeneity was evaluated using I 2 statistics. Random effects meta-analysis results were presented given heterogeneity among studies. The search returned 27 articles and only seven studies were included in meta-analysis, involving 44 365 migrant workers in 17 different countries. The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety among migrant workers was 38.99% (95% CI = 0.27, 0.51) and 27.31% (95% CI = 0.06, 0.58), respectively. Factors such as age, biological (health issue, family history of psychiatric disorder), individual (poor coping skills), occupational (workplace psychosocial stressors, poor working condition, salary and benefits issue, abuse), environmental (limited access towards healthcare, duration of residence, living condition) and social factor (limited social support) were associated with a mental health outcome in migrant workers. The availability of social support for migrant workers was mainly concentrated in emotional type of support. A high prevalence of depression and anxiety was found among migrant workers across the globe. This finding warrants a collective effort by different parties in providing assistance for migrant workers to promote their mental well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3036079357,"Do reminders to promote social distancing achieve the desired effects on behavior? Much of the existing literature analyses impacts on people's intentions to comply. We run a randomised controlled trial in Denmark to test different versions of a reminder to stay home at the beginning of the crisis. Using a two-stage design, we follow up with recipients and analyse their subsequent self-reported behaviour. We find that the reminder increases ex-ante intentions to comply when it emphasises the consequences of non-compliance for the subjects themselves and their families, while it has no effect when the emphasis is on other people or the country as a whole. We also find, however, that impacts on intentions do not translate into equivalent impacts on actions. Only people in poor health react to the reminder by staying home significantly more. Our results shed light on important gaps between people's intentions and their actions in responding to the recommendations of health authorities."
https://openalex.org/W3217315984,"Cytokines are major mediators of COVID-19 pathogenesis and several of them are already being regarded as predictive markers for the clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 cases. A major pitfall of many COVID-19 cytokine studies is the lack of a benchmark sampling timing. Since cytokines and their relative change during an infectious disease course is quite dynamic, we evaluated the predictive value of serially measured cytokines for COVID-19 cases.In this single-center, prospective study, a broad spectrum of cytokines were determined by multiplex ELISA assay in samples collected at admission and at the third day of hospitalization. Appropriateness of cytokine levels in predicting mortality were assessed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for both sampling times in paralel to conventional biomarkers.At both sampling points, higher levels of IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, IL-27 IP-10, MCP-1, and GCSF were found to be more predictive for mortality (p<0.05). Some of these cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-7 and GCSF, had higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting mortality. AUC values of IL-6, IL-10, IL-7 and GCSF were 0.85 (0.65 to 0.92), 0.88 (0.73 to 0.96), 0.80 (0.63 to 0.91) and 0.86 (0.70 to 0.95), respectively at hospital admission. Compared to hospital admission, on the 3rd day of hospitalization serum levels of IL-6 and, IL-10 decreased significantly in the survivor group, unlike the non-survivor group (IL-6, p = 0.015, and IL-10, p = 0.016).Our study results suggest that single-sample-based cytokine analyzes can be misleading and that cytokine levels measured serially at different sampling times provide a more precise and accurate estimate for the outcome of COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3215561302,"Several reports highlighted the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) disease. Also, the hyper-inflammatory response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrom-Covid-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was believed to play an essential role in disease severity and adverse clinical course. For that reason, the classical inflammatory markers were proposed as a possible indicator for COVID-19 severity. However, an extensive analysis of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers in large patients' cohorts is still limited and critically needed. In this study we investigated the predictive value of the classical inflammatory biomarkers in a patient cohort consists of 541 COVID-19 patients admitted to Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE. A detailed analysis of the association between the essential inflammatory markers and clinical characteristics as well as clinical outcome of the patients were made. In addition, the correlation between those markers and a wide range of laboratory biomarkers and incidence of acute organs injury were investigated. Our results showed a significant elevation of many inflammatory markers including white cell count (WBC) count, neutrophils count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, ferritin, procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in patients with more severe illness. Also, our results highlighted that higher levels of those markers can predict worse patient outcome including the need of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, multiple organs dysfunction as well as death. In addition, Our results showed that the presence of lymphopenia and lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at the time of admission were associated with severe to critical COVID-19 illness (P<0.0001), presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (P<0.0001) and the need for ventilation and ICU admission., Moreover, our results showed a strong association between lower ALC count and multiple organs dysfunction and patient's death (P<0.0001). In conclusion, our results highlighted the possible use of classical inflammatory biomarkers at time of admission as a potential predictive marker for more severe clinical course in COVID-19 patients that might need more aggressive therapeutic approach including the need of ventilators and ICU admission. The presence of such predictive markers might improve patient's stratification and help in the direction of the available resources to patients in need, which in turn help in improving our response to the disease pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3217512302,"Microbial invasion of the intraamniotic cavity and intraamniotic inflammation are factors associated with spontaneous preterm birth. Understanding the route and kinetics of infection, sites of colonization, and mechanisms of host inflammatory response is critical to reducing preterm birth risk.This study developed an animal model of ascending infection and preterm birth with live bacteria (E. coli) in pregnant CD-1 mice with the goal of better understanding the process of microbial invasion of the intraamniotic cavity and intraamniotic inflammation.Multiple experiments were conducted in this study. To determine the dose of E. coli required to induce preterm birth, CD-1 mice were injected vaginally with four different doses of E. coli (103, 106, 1010, or 1011 colony forming units [CFU]) in 40 μL of nutrient broth or broth alone (control) on an embryonic day (E)15. Preterm birth (defined as delivery before E18.5) was monitored using live video. E. coli ascent kinetics were measured by staining the E. coli with lipophilic tracer DiD for visualization through intact tissue with an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) after inoculation. The E. coli were also directly visualized in reproductive tissues by staining the bacteria with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) prior to administration and via immunohistochemistry (IHC) by staining tissues with anti-E. coli antibody. Each pup's amniotic fluid was cultured separately to determine the extent of microbial invasion of the intraamniotic cavity at different time points. Intraamniotic inflammation resulting from E. coli invasion was assessed with IHC for inflammatory markers (TLR-4, P-NF-κB) and neutrophil marker (Ly-6G) for chorioamnionitis at 6- and 24-h post-inoculation.Vaginally administered E. coli resulted in preterm birth in a dose-dependent manner with higher doses causing earlier births. In ex vivo imaging and IHC detected uterine horns proximal to the cervix had increased E. coli compared to the distal uterine horns. E. coli were detected in the uterus, fetal membranes (FM), and placenta in a time-dependent manner with 6 hr having increased intensity of E. coli positive signals in pups near the cervix and in all pups at 24 hr. Similarly, E. coli grew from the cultures of amniotic fluid collected nearest to the cervix, but not from the more distal samples at 6 hr post-inoculation. At 24 hr, all amniotic fluid cultures regardless of distance from the cervix, were positive for E. coli. TLR-4 and P-NF-κB signals were more intense in the tissues where E. coli was present (placenta, FM and uterus), displaying a similar trend toward increased signal in proximal gestational sacs compared to distal at 6 hr. Ly-6G+ cells, used to confirm chorioamnionitis, were increased at 24 hr compared to 6 hr post-inoculation and control.We report the development of mouse model of ascending infection and the associated inflammation of preterm birth. Clinically, these models can help to understand mechanisms of infection associated preterm birth, determine targets for intervention, or identify potential biomarkers that can predict a high-risk pregnancy status early in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3217671882,"Dental caries is a prevalent disease in both developed and developing countries and is a public health problem among adolescents. This study aimed to assess the determinants of dental caries among adolescent patients in the west Wollega Zone, Western Ethiopia.A hospital-based unmatched case-control study design was conducted in West Wollega Zone, West Ethiopia. A total of 133 cases and 266 controls participated in this study. Data were collected using pre-tested questionnaires from three hospitals. Epi-info version 7 was used for data entry and was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Frequency, proportion, mean and standard deviation were computed to summarize the data. Statistics are presented using tables and bar graphs. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinants of dental caries at P < 0.05. The adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to show the strength of association between the predictors and dental caries.A total of 399 adolescents were enrolled in this study, yielding a response rate of 100%. The study found that, daily consumption of sugared coffee (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI:1.62, 5.23), khat chewing (AOR = 2.90, 95%CI: 1.46, 3.15), daily consumption of bread (AOR = 2.65, 95%CI: 1.44, 4.89), daily consumption of sweet foods (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI:1.19, 3.48), living in urban areas (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI:1.09, 3.15), and daily tooth brushing using toothpaste or stick (AOR = 0.48;95%CI, 0.28, 0.81) were significantly associated with dental caries among adolescents.In this study, drinking sugared coffee, daily consumption of bread, khat chewing, sugary food consumption, living in urban areas, and daily tooth brushing using toothpaste were significantly associated with dental caries. Therefore, improving dietary and drinking habits and strengthening regular tooth brushing are important for reducing dental caries among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3215788720,"Medical Education studies suggest that medical students experience mental distress in a proportion higher than in the rest of the population In the present study, we aimed to conduct a nationwide analysis of the prevalence of mental health problems among medical students. The study was carried out in 2020 in all 43 medical schools in Spain, and analyzes the prevalence of depression, anxiety, empathy and burnout among medical students (n = 5216). To measure these variables we used the Beck Depression Inventory Test for assessing depression, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Survey for Students was used for burnout, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to assess anxiety state and trait and the Jefferson Empathy Scale 12 to obtain empathy scores. In relation to depression, the data indicate an overall prevalence of 41%, with 23.4% of participants having moderate to severe levels, and 10% experiencing suicidal ideation. Burnout prevalence was 37%, significantly higher among 6 th year than among 1 st year students. Anxiety levels were consistent with those reported previously among medical students (25%), and were higher than in the general population for both trait and state anxiety. The prevalence of trait anxiety was higher among women. Empathy scores were at the top end of the scale, with the highest-scoring group (&gt;130) containing a greater percentage of women. Similarly to those published previously for other countries, these results provide a clear picture of the mental disorders affecting Spanish medical students. Medicine is an extremely demanding degree and it is important that universities and medical schools view this study as an opportunity to ensure conditions that help minimize mental health problems among their students. Some of the factors underlying these problems can be prevented by, among other things, creating an environment in which mental health is openly discussed and guidance is provided. Other factors need to be treated medically, and medical schools and universities should therefore provide support to students in need through the medical services available within their institutions."
https://openalex.org/W3214764788,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most distressing gastrointestinal emergencies affecting neonates. Amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC) improve intestinal injury and survival in experimental NEC but are difficult to administer. In this study, we evaluated whether conditioned medium (CM) derived from human AFSC have protective effects.Three groups of C57BL/6 mice were studied: (i) breast-fed mice as control; (ii) experimental NEC mice receiving PBS; and (iii) experimental NEC mice receiving CM. NEC was induced between post-natal days P5 through P9 via: (A) gavage feeding of hyperosmolar formula four-time a day; (B) 10 minutes hypoxia prior to feeds; and (C) lipopolysaccharide administration on P6 and P7. Intra-peritoneal injections of either PBS or CM were given on P6 and P7. All mice were sacrificed on P9 and terminal ileum were harvested for analyses.CM treatment increased survival and reduced intestinal damage, decreased mucosal inflammation (IL-6; TNF-α), neutrophil infiltration (MPO), and apoptosis (CC3), and also restored angiogenesis (VEGF) in the ileum. Additionally, CM treated mice had increased levels of epithelial proliferation (Ki67) and stem cell activity (Olfm4; Lgr5) compared to NEC+PBS mice, showing restored intestinal regeneration and recovery during NEC induction. CM proteomic analysis of CM content identified peptides that regulated immune and stem cell activity.CM derived from human AFSC administered in experimental NEC exhibited various benefits including reduced intestinal injury and inflammation, increased enterocyte proliferation, and restored intestinal stem cell activity. This study provides the scientific basis for the use of CM derived from AFSC in neonates with NEC."
https://openalex.org/W3214802117,"In decision-making problems, the researchers' application of parametric tests is the first choice due to their wide applicability, reliability, and validity. The common parametric tests require the validation of the normality assumption even for large sample sizes in some cases. Jarque-Bera test is among one of the methods available in the literature used to serve the purpose. One of the Jarque-Bera test restrictions is the computational limitations available only for the data in exact form. The operational procedure of the test is helpless for the interval-valued data. The interval-valued data generally occurs in situations under fuzzy logic or indeterminate state of the outcome variable and is often called neutrosophic form. The present research modifies the existing statistic of the Jarque-Bera test for the interval-valued data. The modified design and operational procedure of the newly proposed Jarque-Bera test will be useful to assess the normality of a data set under the neutrosophic environment. The proposed neutrosophic Jarque-Bera test is applied and compared with its existing form with the help of a numerical example of real gold mines data generated under the fuzzy environment. The study's findings suggested that the proposed test is effective, informative, and suitable to be applied in indeterminacy compared to the existing Jarque-Bera test."
https://openalex.org/W3215398413,"Recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and associated COVID-19 pandemic have posed a great challenge for the scientific community. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences, trying to unravel potential molecular similarities between this newly emerged pathogen with non-coronavirus ssRNA viruses. Comparing the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with non-coronavirus positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses revealed multiple sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and non-coronaviruses, including similarities between RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases and helicases (two highly-conserved proteins). We also observed similarities between SARS-CoV-2 surface (i.e. spike) protein with paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This similarity was restricted to a segment of spike protein S2 subunit which is involved in cell fusion. We next analyzed spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 ""variants of concern"" (VOCs) and ""variants of interests"" (VOIs) and found that some of these variants show considerably higher spike-fusion similarity with paramyxoviruses. The 'spike-fusion' similarity was also observed for some pathogenic coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2. Epitope analysis using experimentally verified data deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that several B cell epitopes as well as T cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion similarity region. These data indicate that there might be a degree of convergent evolution between SARS-CoV-2 and paramyxovirus surface proteins which could be of pathogenic and immunological importance."
https://openalex.org/W3215699191,"The purpose of this study was to identify individual and residency program factors associated with increased suicide risk, as measured by suicidal ideation. We utilized a prospective, longitudinal cohort study design to assess the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation in 6,691 (2012-2014 cohorts, training data set) and 4,904 (2015 cohort, test data set) first-year training physicians (interns) at hospital systems across the United States. We assessed suicidal ideation two months before internship and then quarterly through intern year. The prevalence of reported suicidal ideation in the study population increased from 3.0% at baseline to a mean of 6.9% during internship. 16.4% of interns reported suicidal ideation at least once during their internship. In the training dataset, a series of baseline demographic (male gender) and psychological factors (high neuroticism, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation) were associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation during internship. Further, prior quarter psychiatric symptoms (depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation) and concurrent work-related factors (increase in self-reported work hours and medical errors) were associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation. A model derived from the training dataset had a predicted area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 in the test dataset. The suicidal ideation risk predictors analyzed in this study can help programs and interns identify those at risk for suicidal ideation before the onset of training. Further, increases in self-reported work hours and environments associated with increased medical errors are potentially modifiable factors for residency programs to target to reduce suicide risk."
https://openalex.org/W3216162054,"This study analysed the associations of sex steroids with fat-free mass (FFM) and handgrip strength in 641 Chinese boys. Serum total testosterone (TT) and oestradiol were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Free testosterone (FT) and oestradiol were calculated. FFM and handgrip strength were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and a hand dynamometer, respectively. Generalised additive models and multiple linear regression were used to explore the relationships. A subgroup analysis was conducted in early-mid pubertal and late-post pubertal groups. Age, height, weight, physical activity, intake of dietary protein and/or stage of puberty were adjusted. TT and FT were positively related to FFM and handgrip strength, with a curvilinear relationship being detected for handgrip strength (p<0.050). This curvilinear relationship was only observed in the late-post pubertal group, suggesting a potential threshold effect (FT>11.99ng/dL, β = 1.275, p = 0.039). In the early-mid pubertal group, TT and/or FT were linearly or near-linearly related to FFM or handgrip strength (β = 0.003-0.271, p<0.050). The association between FT and FFM was stronger than that in the late-post pubertal group. This study found that serum T had different associations with muscle parameters in Chinese early-mid pubertal and late-post pubertal boys. In the late-post pubertal boys, serum T was curvilinearly related to muscle strength with a threshold effect and its link with muscle mass was weaker."
https://openalex.org/W3217652063,"Low back pain is a common public health problem throughout the world with a global prevalence from 28% to 86%. Nurses working in intensive care units are handling people who are critically ill and helpless, which requires more assistance for transferring and handling activities. This possesses a risk for low back pain but little is known about it in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the magnitude of low back pain and associated factors among nurses who work at intensive care units in Amhara region public hospitals, North Ethiopia.A multi-centered institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Amhara region public hospitals from March 1-30, 2020. A simple random sampling technique after proportional allocation was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using a standard modified Nordic musculoskeletal assessment tool. After data were checked for completeness and consistency, it was entered into Epidata version 3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Science software version 26 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with low back pain. Finally, those variables with a p-value of <0.05 in multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant.Study was conducted among 412 intensive care unit nurses giving a response rate of 97.6%. The magnitude of low back pain was 313 (76%) [95% CI: (71.6%-79.9%)]. Being female [AOR = 2.674 (1.404, 5.076)], unavailability of assistive device for patient handling [AOR = 2.139 (1.035, 4.410)], lack of training on intensive care [AOR = 2.017 (1.092, 3.943)], lack of regular exercise [AOR = 2.164 (1.164, 4.108)] and job stress [AOR = 3.66 (1.955, 6.498)] were factors significantly associated with low back pain.In this study the magnitude of low back pain was high. Being female, unavailability of an assistive device for patient handling, lack of training on intensive care, lack of regular exercise and job stress were factors associated with low back pain. Policymakers and concerned bodies should emphasize the accessibility of assistive devices for patient care, provision of training on intensive care, and adaptive working environment for intensive care unit nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3215208712,"Globally, the economic losses due to hard ticks infestation and the control of the associated diseases have been calculated at USD $13.9-18.7 billion per year. The economic impact is related to its direct damage to the skins, blood loss, anemia, severe immunological reactions and indirect losses that related to the effects of hemoparasites, cost of treatment for clinical cases and expenses incurred in the control of ticks. The current study evaluated the acaricidal activities of fennel Foeniculum vulgare essential oil and its main components; trans-anethole and fenchone; against R. annulatus. GC-MS analysis revealed that this oil contained 16 components representing 99.9% of the total identified compounds with E-anethole being the predominant component(64.29%), followed by fenchone (9.94%). The fennel oil and trans-anethole showed significant acaricidal activities. The LC50 of the fennel oil was attained at concentrations of 12.96% for adult ticks and 1.75% for tick larvae meanwhile the LC50 of trans-anethole was reached at concentrations of 2.36% for adult tick and 0.56% for tick larvae. On the contrary, fenchone showed no any significant adulticidal activities and its LC50 attained at a concentration of 9.11% for tick larvae. Regarding repellence activities, trans-anethole achieved 100% repellency at the concentration of 10% while fennel showed 86% repellency at the same concentration. Fenchone showed no repellency effect. Treatment of larvae with fennel, trans-anethole, and fenchone LC50 concentrations significantly inhibited the acetylcholinesterase activity. Meanwhile, glutathione s-transferase activity was significantly decreased in fennel treated larvae but no significant effect was found in the larvae of trans-anethole and fenchone groups. These results indicate that the acaricide effect of fennel oil may attributed to its high content of trans-anethole. This was supported by potent adulticidal, larvicidal, and repellency effects of trans-anethole against Rhipeciphalus annulatus tick and therefore it could be included in the list of acaricide of plant origin."
https://openalex.org/W3215675787,"Infectious pneumonia induced by multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii strains is among the most common and deadly forms of healthcare acquired infections. Over the years, different strategies have been put in place to increase host susceptibility to MDR A. baumannii, since only a self-limiting pneumonia with no or limited local bacterial replication was frequently obtained in mouse models. Direct instillation into the trachea or intranasal inoculation of the bacterial suspension are the techniques used to induce the infection in most of the preclinical models of pneumonia developed to date. More recently, the oropharyngeal aspiration procedure has been widely described in the literature for a variety of purposes including pathogens administration. Aim of this study was to compare the oropharyngeal aspiration technique to the intranasal inoculation and intratracheal instillation in the ability of inducing a consistent lung infection with two MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates in immunocompromised mice. Moreover, pneumonia obtained by bacteria administration with two out of three techniques, intratracheal and oropharyngeal, was characterised in terms of histopathology of pulmonary lesions, biomarkers of inflammation level and leukocytes cells infiltration extent after mice treatment with either vehicle or the antibiotic tigecycline. The data generated clearly showed that both strains were not able to colonize the lungs when inoculated by intranasal route. By contrast, the bacterial load in lungs of mice intratracheally or oropharyngeally infected significantly increased during 26 hours of monitoring, thus highlighting the ability of these strains to generate the infection when directly instilled into the lower respiratory airways. Furthermore, the intragroup variability of mice was significantly reduced with respect to those intranasally administered. Tigecycline was efficacious in lung bacterial load and cytokines release reduction. Findings were supported by semi-quantitative histopathological evaluation of the pulmonary lesions and by inflammatory biomarkers analysis. To conclude, both intratracheal instillation and oropharyngeal aspiration techniques showed to be suitable methods for inducing a robust and consistent pneumonia infection in mice when difficult MDR A. baumannii clinical isolates were used. Noteworthy, oropharyngeal aspiration not requiring specific technical skills and dedicated equipment, was proven to be a safer, easier and faster technique in comparison to the intratracheal instillation."

https://openalex.org/W3217417692,"Women left behind by migration represent a unique and growing population yet remain understudied as key players in the context of migration and development. Using a unique longitudinal survey of life in Bangladesh, the Matlab Health and Socioeconomic Surveys, we examined the role of spousal migration in healthcare utilization for women. The objective of this study was to assess realized access to care (do women actually get healthcare when it is needed) and consider specific macrostructural, predisposing, and resource barriers to care that are related to migration.In a sample of 3,187 currently married women, we estimated multivariate logistic and multinomial regression models controlling for a wide range of baseline sociodemographic factors measured as far back as 1982. Our analyses also controlled for selection effects and explored two mechanisms through which spousal migration can affect healthcare utilization for women, remittances and frequent contact with spouses. We found that women with migrant spouses were approximately half as likely to lack needed healthcare compared to women whose spouses remained in Bangladesh (predicted probability of not getting needed healthcare 11.7% vs. 21.8%, p<0.001). The improvements in access (logistic regression coefficient for lacking care for left-behind women -0.761 p<0.01) primarily occurred through a reduction in financial barriers to care for women whose spouses were abroad.Wives of international migrants showed significantly better access to healthcare even when accounting for selection into a migrant family. While the overall story is one of positive migration effects on healthcare access due to reductions in financial barriers to care, results also showed an increase in family-related barriers such as not being permitted to get care by a family member or travel alone to a facility, indicating that some of the benefits of migration for women left behind may be diluted by gendered family structures."

We assessed level of provider knowledge for HIV testing and counseling (HTC), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). We also explored the association between HTC, PMTCT, and VMMC provider knowledge and provider and facility characteristics.We used data collected in 2012 and 2013. Vignettes were administered to physicians, nurses, and counselors in facilities in Kenya (66), Rwanda (67), South Africa (57), and Zambia (58). The analytic sample consisted of providers of HTC (755), PMTCT (709), and VMMC (332). HTC, PMTCT, and VMMC provider knowledge scores were constructed using item response theory (IRT). We used GLM regressions to examine associations between provider knowledge and provider and facility characteristics focusing on average patient load, provider years in position, provider working in another facility, senior staff in facility, program age, proportion of intervention exclusive staff, person-days of training in facility, and management score. We estimated three models: Model 1 estimated standard errors without clustering, Model 2 estimated robust standard errors, and Model 3 estimated standard errors clustering by facility.The mean knowledge score was 36 for all three interventions. In Model 1, we found that provider knowledge scores were higher among providers in facilities with senior staff and among providers in facilities with higher proportions of intervention exclusive staff. We also found negative relationships between the outcome and provider years in position, average program age, provider working in another facility, person-days of training, and management score. In Model 3, only the coefficients for provider years in position, average program age, and management score remained statistically significant at conventional levels.HTC, PMTCT, and VMMC provider knowledge was low in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zambia. Our study suggests that unobservable organizational factors may facilitate communication, learning, and knowledge. On the one hand, our study shows that the presence of senior staff and staff dedication may enable knowledge acquisition. On the other hand, our study provides a note of caution on the potential knowledge depreciation correlated with the time staff spend in a position and program age."
https://openalex.org/W3215930408,"The purpose of this study was to develop a driving behavior scale for professional drivers of heavy semi-trailer trucks in China, and study the causes of such driving behavior and its impact on traffic safety operation. Data was processed by IBM SPSS 25. In addition to principal component analysis, Promax rotation, Bartlett's test, Cronbach's alpha, correlation analysis and binary logistic regression were examined. A DBQ with 4 dimensions and 20 items, and a PDBQ with 1 dimension and 6 items were developed for professional drivers of heavy semi-trailer trucks in China. The KMO coefficients of PDBQ and DBQ were 0.822 and 0.852, respectively, and the significant level of Bartlett's popularity test was p < 0.0001. The accident prediction model showed that the variables related to traffic accidents were negligence/lapses and driving time of heavy semi-trailer truck drivers. 1-5 a.m. was found to be the most dangerous period for drivers of medium and heavy semi-trailer trucks, during which accidents were most likely to happen. As negligence/lapses increased by one unit, the probability of traffic accidents increased by 2.293 times."
https://openalex.org/W3216172455,"Most micro-business managers in Nigeria do not see the adoption of digital marketing technology (DMT) as vital for business. Many consider it as a precondition to support managerial or operational activities, not as a tactical and/or strategic tool. Although most studies focused on large organisations, the outcome of such research may not be appropriate to micro-businesses. This is informed by the negligence of micro-businesses' idiosyncrasies and their thought of digitalization as a precondition for managerial activities without considering the value small businesses attached to these devices in terms of aiding the use as strategic tools. This renders micro-businesses' digitalization an under-reflected phenomenon. Yet, studies spend less on examining the factors that specifically stimulate the value micro-businesses attach to these applications, leading to constant adoption and usage. Hence, there is a need for a thorough exploration of the factors that shape the value of digital marketing applications in micro-businesses in Nigeria. The study is qualitative in nature and interviews (unstructured and semi-structured) were carried out with 26 micro-businesses which was drawn purposefully from the online database and underpinned by Technology, Organisation and Environment (TOE) framework. The study revealed eleven (11) critical success factors stimulating value micro-businesses attribute to digital marketing technology (DMT) adoption. These factors include long-term functional capacity, integration capacity, expansion capacity which are related to technology context. Collective capability, collaborative experience are linked to the organisation context while adaptive training, service delivery, customer fulfilment are linked to environmental context. The study also unveiled expectancy context which is linked to budget, growth and profitability and aid in the extension of the TOE framework. This study will be of importance to academics and practitioners because it provides further awareness into DMT adoption framework, factors critical to the DMT adoption and may assist in reducing the number of resources spent in search of information aimed at helping DMT adoption by micro-businesses."

This quantitative research hypothesizes that PSM leads towards higher level of organizational performance among public sector officials and also explores the intervening effects of Altruism (ALT), Perceived Social Impact (PSI) and Political Support (PS) in this context. Based on self-administered questionnaire, data was collected from 405 public officials using random sampling strategy. Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling was used to test the hypothesized model. Following the validation of the measurement model, structural model was developed to test the various paths predicted in the hypotheses. Analysis revealed that PSM, PS and ALT have a positive relationship with OP whereas PSM relationship with PS could not be established."
https://openalex.org/W3216692891,"Multimorbidity is associated with physical-mental health comorbidity (PMHC). However, the scope of overlap between physical and mental conditions, associated factors, as well as types of mental illness involved are not well described in Eastern Europe. This study aims to assess the PMHC burden in the Estonian population.In this population-based cross-sectional study we obtained health claims data for 55 chronic conditions from the Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF) database, which captures data for all publicly insured individuals (n = 1 240 927 or 94.1% of the total population as of 31 December 2017). We assessed the period-prevalence (3 years) of chronic physical and mental health disorders, as well as associations between them, by age and sex.Half of the individuals (49.1% (95% CI 49.0-49.3)) had one or more chronic conditions. Mental health disorders (MHD) were present in 8.1% (8.1-8.2) of individuals, being higher among older age groups, women, and individuals with a higher number of physical conditions. PMHC was present in 6.2% (6.1-6.2) of the study population, and 13.1% (13.0-13.2) of the subjects with any chronic physical disorder also presented with at least one MHD. Dominating MHDs among PMHC patients were anxiety and depression. The prevalence of MHD was positively correlated with the number of physical disorders. We observed variation in the type of MHD as the number of physical comorbidities increased. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and mental and behavioral disorders due to the misuse of alcohol and other psychoactive substances increased as physical comorbidities increased, but the prevalence of schizophrenia and dementia decreased with each additional physical disease. After adjusting for age and sex, this negative association changed the sign to a positive association in the case of dementia and mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance misuse.The burden of physical-mental comorbidity in the Estonian population is relatively high. Further research is required to identify clusters of overlapping physical and mental disorders as well as the interactions between these conditions. Public health interventions may include structural changes to health care delivery, such as an increased emphasis on integrated care models that reduce barriers to mental health care."
https://openalex.org/W3214849247,"Automated image processing approaches are indispensable for many biomedical experiments and help to cope with the increasing amount of microscopy image data in a fast and reproducible way. Especially state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches most often require large amounts of annotated training data to produce accurate and generalist outputs, but they are often compromised by the general lack of those annotated data sets. In this work, we propose how conditional generative adversarial networks can be utilized to generate realistic image data for 3D fluorescence microscopy from annotation masks of 3D cellular structures. In combination with mask simulation approaches, we demonstrate the generation of fully-annotated 3D microscopy data sets that we make publicly available for training or benchmarking. An additional positional conditioning of the cellular structures enables the reconstruction of position-dependent intensity characteristics and allows to generate image data of different quality levels. A patch-wise working principle and a subsequent full-size reassemble strategy is used to generate image data of arbitrary size and different organisms. We present this as a proof-of-concept for the automated generation of fully-annotated training data sets requiring only a minimum of manual interaction to alleviate the need of manual annotations."
https://openalex.org/W3216555954,"The term ""mentalized affectivity"" describes the ability to reflect on, process, modulate and express emotions through the prism of autobiographical memory. It represents a bridge concept that integrates previous contributions on emotion regulation and mentalization, offering a quite unique perspective on affective and reflective functioning. The overall aim of this study was to validate the Brief-Mentalized Affectivity Scale (B-MAS), a 12-items self-report instrument, on the Italian population. We tested both the factorial validity of the instrument and its reliability and convergent validity with other similar constructs. We also obtained normative data for the Italian population, broken down by gender. Participants (n = 389) were recruited through snowball sampling. Data was collected through an online survey. Besides the Brief-Mentalized Affectivity Scale, the survey included an ad hoc schedule with questions investigating socio-demographic characteristics, and self-report measures of empathy and reflective functioning. Statistical analysis has shown a three-component (Identifying, Processing, and Expressing emotions) hierarchical structure underlying mentalized affectivity, mirroring the model already proposed in the original validation of the instrument. Moreover, the B-MAS showed good psychometric properties for what regards both reliability and convergent validity. The results of our study highlight the good operationalization and robust empirical foundation of the construct, revealing that the B-MAS is a promising instrument to assess mentalized affectivity. Its brevity makes it particularly valuable both in clinical and research contexts, and the normative data provided in this study will allow an easy comparison with the scores obtained by other samples (clinical and non-clinical)."

Also, for Parkinson's patients there are upcoming alternatives to regular care.The aim of the present study was to interview Parkinson's patients under the impression of the first lockdown in Germany about their health care situation, but especially about the use of and attitudes towards videotherapy and -consultation.Northern German members of the German Parkinson Association were mailed a 16-item questionnaire including demographic questions on a one-time basis. The voluntary participants answered regarding their health care situation during the first German SARS CoV-2 lockdown, as well as attitudes towards videotherapy/-consultations.The 332 (of 974 questionnaires) responding evaluated their care situation predominantly (58.7%) unchanged during lockdown. There was hardly any previous experience in the areas of videotherapy and -consultations (15.4% and 3%, respectively), but at the same time mostly imaginability of implementation (54.2% and 56%, respectively) and the belief that they could motivate themselves to do so (51.8%). A total of 69% welcomed technical support for the implementation of videotherapy.In principle, there seems to be both, a need and an interest in telematics in healthcare such as videotherapy and video consultations, even if further barriers such as technical implementation need to be addressed. An expansion of telemedical services and infrastructure seems desirable not only in the pandemic situation, but also in the long term against the backdrop of demographic change, especially in an area like Schleswig-Holstein. Further studies are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3216320666,"The positive influence of undergraduate research and mentoring on student success in STEM fields has been well-established. However, the role that the gender of a research mentor may play in the undergraduate research experience warrants further investigation. This is an especially critical issue to address, since the lack of female role models in STEM fields is acknowledged as an impediment to the success and progress of women pursuing STEM-careers. To evaluate how the gender of undergraduate research mentors influences the research experience of students, we collected and analyzed surveys from undergraduates and alumni who had completed undergraduate research at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. We found that even though students did not select mentors based on gender, there were differences in how students perceived their mentors, depending on the gender of their mentors. Interestingly, students with female mentors were more likely than students with male mentors to report that their research experience had prepared them for a career in science. Further, our gender-pairing analyses revealed that students who expressed that the gender of their mentor had contributed to their relationship with their mentor were more likely to have a female mentor. Our data indicate that female mentors favorably influence the undergraduate research experience of both male and female students. Finally, our study reinforces the conclusions of previous studies demonstrating that undergraduate research and mentoring are beneficial for students. Overall, our findings support that, for students to fully benefit from their undergraduate research experience, undergraduate research opportunities for students should include an equitable representation of female mentors."
https://openalex.org/W3216614778,"Low count PET (positron emission tomography) imaging is often desirable in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research, but its images are generally very noisy, due to the very weak signals in the sinograms used in image reconstruction. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel kernel graph filtering method for dynamic PET sinogram denoising. This method is derived from treating the dynamic sinograms as the signals on a graph, and learning the graph adaptively from the kernel principal components of the sinograms to construct a lowpass kernel graph spectrum filter. The kernel graph filter thus obtained is then used to filter the original sinogram time frames to obtain the denoised sinograms for PET image reconstruction. Extensive tests and comparisons on the simulated and real life in-vivo dynamic PET datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in sinogram denoising and image enhancement of dynamic PET at all count levels, especially at low count, with a great potential in real life applications of dynamic PET imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3215317961,"Meditation is a consciousness state associated with specific physiological and neural correlates. Numerous investigations of these correlates reported controversial results which prevented a consistent depiction of the underlying neurophysiological processes. Here we investigated the dynamics of multiple neurophysiological indicators during a staged meditation session. We measured the physiological changes at rest and during the guided Taoist meditation in experienced meditators and naive subjects. We recorded EEG, respiration, galvanic skin response, and photoplethysmography. All subjects followed the same instructions split into 16 stages. In the experienced meditators group we identified two subgroups with different physiological markers dynamics. One subgroup showed several signs of general relaxation evident from the changes in heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and EEG rhythmic activity. The other subgroup exhibited mind concentration patterns primarily noticeable in the EEG recordings while no autonomic responses occurred. The duration and type of previous meditation experience or any baseline indicators we measured did not explain the segregation of the meditators into these two groups. These results suggest that two distinct meditation strategies could be used by experienced meditators, which partly explains the inconsistent results reported in the earlier studies evaluating meditation effects. Our findings are also relevant to the development of the high-end biofeedback systems."
https://openalex.org/W3215384146,"Using the 9th round of European Social Survey (ESS), we explored the relationship between Europeans' basic values and their attitudes towards immigrants. Employing a latent class analysis (LCA), we classified the respondents based on three items capturing the extent to which participants would support allowing three groups of immigrants to enter and live in their countries: immigrants of same ethnic groups, immigrants of different ethnic groups, and immigrants from poorer countries outside Europe. Four classes of Europeans with mutually exclusive response patterns with respect to their inclusive attitudes towards immigrants were found. The classes were named Inclusive (highly inclusive), Some (selective), Few (highly selective), and Exclusive (highly exclusive). Next, using a network technique, a partial correlation network of 10 basic human values was estimated for each class of participants. The four networks were compared to each other based on three network properties namely: global connectivity, community detection, and assortativity coefficient. The global connectivity (the overall level of interconnections) between the 10 basic values was found to be mostly invariant across the four networks. However, results of the community detection analysis revealed a more complex value structure among the most inclusive class of Europeans. Further, according to the assortativity analysis, as expected, for the most inclusive Europeans, values with similar motivational backgrounds were found to be interconnected most strongly to one another. We further discussed the theoretical and practical implications of our findings."

To analyze the age-specific contributions to the changing gender differences before and after the crossover at the national and sub-national levels. We have used sample-survey-based age-specific mortality data available for the periods 1970-2018 to construct abridged life tables. The contribution of different age groups to the gender gap is estimated by using Arriaga's method of decomposition. During 1981-85 female life expectancy at birth caught up with male life expectancy at birth for India and by 2005 all major states completed the crossover. The male-female crossover in life expectancy at the national level in the early 80s is remarkable in the face of continued female disadvantage from birth till adolescence, even for some richer states. We provide evidence that gender difference in longevity in favour of females is largely a function of adult age groups and younger age groups contribute negatively to the gender gap in life expectancy at birth in most states. Juxtaposing the results from contribution in an absolute number of years and their relative contribution change before and after the crossover, it is established that although the adult and old age groups contribute the highest in the absolute number of years before and after the crossover, the contribution of the reproductive age groups and childhood years in the recent time is most relevant in relative terms."
https://openalex.org/W3215526503,"Hulless barley ( Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum ), also called naked barley, is a unique variety of cultivated barley. The genome-wide specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method is a rapid deep sequencing technology that is used for the selection and identification of genetic loci or markers. In this study, we collected 300 hulless barley accessions and used the SLAF-seq method to identify candidate genes involved in plant height (PH) and tiller number (TN). We obtained a total of 1407 M paired-end reads, and 228,227 SLAF tags were developed. After filtering using an integrity threshold of &gt;0.8 and a minor allele frequency of &gt;0.05, 14,504,892 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) loci were screened out. The remaining SNPs were used for the construction of a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree, and the three subcluster members showed no obvious differentiation among regional varieties. We used a genome wide association study approach to identify 1006 and 113 SNPs associated with TN and PH, respectively. Based on best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP), 41 and 29 SNPs associated with TN and PH, respectively. Thus, several of genes, including Hd3a and CKX5 , may be useful candidates for the future genetic breeding of hulless barley. Taken together, our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling barley architecture, which is important for breeding and yield."

Evidence supporting a significant association between influenza vaccination and severe illness is limited.We retrospectively analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of out- and inpatients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection attended during the 2018-19 epidemic season. Influenza vaccination coverage by indication was analyzed. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of vaccination between severe and non-severe influenza-positive patients. Severe cases were defined as presenting pneumonia, admission to critical care units and/or death.The overall vaccination coverage among influenza-positive patients was 30.4%. In subjects with ≥ 1 indication for vaccination, the vaccination coverage was 42.4%. By indication, coverage rates were: 52.5% in patients aged ≥ 59 years, 42.2% in obese patients, 29.2% in immunosuppressed subjects and 6.5% in pregnant women. In patients with underlying chronic diseases, a higher coverage was found in patients with cognitive impairment (77%), muscular dystrophy (63.6%) and renal disease (60.4%). The multivariate logistic regression model showed severe influenza-related illness was associated with a lack of influenza vaccination before seeking care during the 2018-2019 season [0.59 (95%CI 0.36-0.97); p = 0.038], older age [1.01 (95%CI 1.00-1.02); p = 0.009] and current or former smoking status [1.63 (95%CI 0.84-3.18) and 2.03 (95%CI 1.16-3.57); p = 0.031], adjusted by underlying disease.Adjusting by age, smoking status and underlying disease, a moderate association between the influenza vaccine and severe laboratory-confirmed influenza-related illness was found in an epidemic season in which there was matching between the vaccine and circulating strains. Protection against complications, especially in older subjects and in those with underlying disease is postulated as one of the strengths of annual influenza vaccination. However, influenza vaccination is a pending issue in these groups, especially in pregnant women and obese people. To avoid suboptimal vaccination coverages, health professionals should recommend the seasonal influenza vaccination according to the annual instructions of the health authorities."
https://openalex.org/W3217110623,"Ticks and tick-borne diseases represent a growing public health threat in North America and Europe. The number of ticks, their geographical distribution, and the incidence of tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease, are all on the rise. Accurate, real-time tick-image identification through a smartphone app or similar platform could help mitigate this threat by informing users of the risks associated with encountered ticks and by providing researchers and public health agencies with additional data on tick activity and geographic range. Here we outline the requirements for such a system, present a model that meets those requirements, and discuss remaining challenges and frontiers in automated tick identification. We compiled a user-generated dataset of more than 12,000 images of the three most common tick species found on humans in the U.S.: Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor variabilis, and Ixodes scapularis. We used image augmentation to further increase the size of our dataset to more than 90,000 images. Here we report the development and validation of a convolutional neural network which we call ""TickIDNet,"" that scores an 87.8% identification accuracy across all three species, outperforming the accuracy of identifications done by a member of the general public or healthcare professionals. However, the model fails to match the performance of experts with formal entomological training. We find that image quality, particularly the size of the tick in the image (measured in pixels), plays a significant role in the network's ability to correctly identify an image: images where the tick is small are less likely to be correctly identified because of the small object detection problem in deep learning. TickIDNet's performance can be increased by using confidence thresholds to introduce an ""unsure"" class and building image submission pipelines that encourage better quality photos. Our findings suggest that deep learning represents a promising frontier for tick identification that should be further explored and deployed as part of the toolkit for addressing the public health consequences of tick-borne diseases."

The two-factor latent structure of the DII composed of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity was supported, although three items had to be removed due to low standardized loadings, and strong cross-gender measurement invariance was established. Our analyses of the DII also provided evidence of criterion-related validity, known-groups validity, and internal consistency/reliability. Our findings support the use of the DII among Portuguese young adults."
https://openalex.org/W3215772116,"Identifying agricultural disaster risk regions before the occurrence of climate-related disasters is critical for early mitigation planning. This paper aims to identify these regions based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the bilateral and multilateral trade network data of the World Integrated Trade Solution(WITS) and the agent-based economic model Acclimate. By applying a uniform forcing across agricultural sectors of some breadbasket regions (US, EU and China), when single and simultaneous extreme weather events occur, such as the 2018 European heatwave, production and consumption value losses and gains are calculated at regional and global levels. Comparing the FAO data sets, WITS, and Acclimate's production value losses, the results show a strong dependence of agricultural production losses on a region's output and connectivity level in the global supply and trade network. While India, Brazil, Russia, Canada, Australia, and Iran are highly vulnerable, the imposition of export restrictions to compensate for demand shortfalls makes Sub-Saharan Africa the most vulnerable region, as it is heavily dependent on agricultural imports. In addition, simultaneous extreme weather events can exacerbate the loss of value of agricultural production relative to single extreme weather events. Agricultural practices to increase production such as smart farming, increased investment in plantation agriculture, and diversification of trading partners can help mitigate future food security risks in Sub-Saharan Africa and other agricultural import-dependent regions."
https://openalex.org/W3215876172,"Little is known about how specific individual viral lineages replicating systemically during acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus or Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/SIV) infection persist into chronic infection. In this study, we use molecularly barcoded SIV (SIVmac239M) to track distinct viral lineages for 12 weeks after intravenous (IV) or intrarectal (IR) challenge in macaques. Two Mafa-A1*063+ cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis , CM) were challenged IV, and two Mamu-A1*001+ rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta , RM) were challenged IR with 200,000 Infectious Units (IU) of SIVmac239M. We sequenced the molecular barcode of SIVmac239M from all animals over the 12 weeks of the study to characterize the diversity and persistence of virus lineages. During the first three weeks post-infection, we found ~70–560 times more unique viral lineages circulating in the animals challenged IV compared to those challenged IR, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the challenge route is the primary driver restricting the transmission of individual viral lineages. We also characterized the sequences of T cell epitopes targeted during acute SIV infection, and found that the emergence of escape variants in acutely targeted epitopes can occur on multiple virus templates simultaneously, but that elimination of some of these templates is likely a consequence of additional host factors. These data imply that virus lineages present during acute infection can still be eliminated from the systemic virus population even after initial selection."
https://openalex.org/W3215890014,"Microbial community assembly is shaped by deterministic and stochastic processes, but the relationship between these processes and the environment is not understood. Here we describe a rule for the determinism and stochasticity of microbial community assembly affected by the environment using in silico, in situ, and ex situ experiments. The in silico experiment with a simple mathematical model showed that the existence of essential symbiotic microorganisms caused stochastic microbial community assembly, unless the community was exposed to a non-adapted nutritional concentration. Then, a deterministic assembly occurred due to the low number of microorganisms adapted to the environment. In the in situ experiment in the middle of a river, the microbial community composition was relatively deterministic after the drastic environmental change caused by the treated wastewater contamination, as analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Furthermore, by culturing microbial communities collected from the upstream natural area and downstream urban area of the river in test tubes with varying carbon source concentrations, the upstream community assembly became deterministic with high carbon concentrations while the downstream community assembly became deterministic with low carbon concentrations. These results suggest that large environmental changes, which are different from the original environment, result in a deterministic microbial community assembly."

In this qualitative study, we conducted interviews with 15 key stakeholders from Ministries of Health along with PEPFAR-supported and other in-country non-governmental organizations actively engaged in national programming for adult HIV care and prevention of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services in Côte d'Ivoire, Lesotho and Malawi. We aimed to understand perspectives regarding transitions into and out of PMTCT services for continued ART. Thematic analysis revealed that, although transitions of care are necessary and a potential point of loss from ART care in all three countries, there is a lack of clear guidance on transition approach and no formal way of monitoring transition between services. Several opportunities were identified to monitor and strengthen transitions of care for continued ART along the PMTCT cascade."

PVD was defined as the presence of at least two of the following vascular bed (VB) diseases: concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD).Patients with PVD (288 patients, 13.3%) had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications, such as AKI (16.3% vs. 7.0%, p<0.01) and disabling stroke (3.5% vs. 1.2%, p<0.01) than patients without PVD. These complications caused higher rates of procedural mortality (4.5% vs. 2.0%, p<0.01). PVD increased the risk of the 2-year rate of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.50; p<0.05); however, non-cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke was not associated with PVD. Worsening heart failure (4.6% vs. 1.1%, p<0.01) was the main cause of cardiovascular death among patients with PVD. In a sub-analysis, compared with patients with AS alone, those with 2 VB diseases (CAD+PAD; adjusted HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.06-3.53; p<0.05) and 3 VB diseases (CAD+CVD+PAD; adjusted HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.21-5.62; p<0.05) had a higher risk of 2-year cardiovascular death.The increased prevalence of concomitant atherosclerotic VB diseases before TF-TAVI may increase the rates of in-hospital complications and 2-year cardiovascular death. Given the higher rate of mortality in patients with PVD undergoing TF-TAVI, future studies focusing on medical therapy are needed to reduce long-term cardiovascular events in this high-risk subset."

Barriers to disclosure may include fears and misconceptions about whether, and under what circumstances, healthcare providers report DV to law enforcement and immigration authorities. We sought to assess undocumented Latino immigrants (UDLI), Latino legal residents/citizens (LLRC) and non-Latino legal residents/citizens (NLRC) beliefs about disclosure of DV victimization to healthcare providers and healthcare provider reporting of DV to law enforcement and immigration authorities. From 10/2018-2/2020, we conducted this survey study at two urban emergency departments (EDs) in California. Participants, enrolled by convenience sampling, responded to survey questions adapted from a previously published survey instrument that was developed to assess undocumented immigrant fears of accessing ED care. Our primary outcomes were the proportions of UDLI, LLRC and NLRC who knew of someone who had experienced DV in the past year, whether these DV victims were afraid to access ED care, reasons DV victims were afraid to access ED care, and rates of misconceptions (defined according to current California law) about the consequences of disclosing DV to healthcare providers. Of 667 patients approached, 531 (80%) agreed to participate: 32% UDLI, 33% LLRC, and 35% NLRC. Of the 27.5% of respondents who knew someone who experienced DV in the past year, 46% stated that the DV victim was afraid to seek ED care; there was no significant difference in this rate between groups. The most common fears reported as barriers to disclosure were fear the doctor would report DV to police (31%) and fear that the person perpetrating DV would find out about the disclosure (30.3%). Contrary to our hypothesis, UDLI had lower rates of misconceptions about healthcare provider and law enforcement responses to DV disclosure than LLRC and NLRC. Fear of disclosing DV and misconceptions about the consequences of disclosure of DV to healthcare providers were common, indicating a need for provider, patient, and community education and changes that lower barriers to help-seeking."
https://openalex.org/W3215918896,"In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic of the ZIKA virus (ZIKV) in Latin America to be a public health emergency. In Colombia, 11,944 pregnant women registered a ZIKV infection during the epidemic. So far, little is known about the experiences of women infected with ZIKV during their pregnancy, especially those relating to the provision of health services during the period of the epidemic.To explore the experiences of pregnant women diagnosed with ZIKV infection about the provision of health services in two Colombian cities, considering the perspective of sexual and reproductive rights.Qualitative study under the grounded theory approach, which uses semi-structured interviews as tools to explore the biographical experience of mothers during their gestation process and ZIKV infection, dividing the interview into two broad categories: before and during pregnancy.Twenty-two women were interviewed, 10 in Cali and 12 in Villavicencio. The average age at the time of pregnancy was 27.6 years. Most women were not planning at the time of pregnancy and the pregnancy was unwanted. Most campaigns focused on mosquito eradication rather than on sexual and reproductive health campaigns. The quality of health care was not sufficient, adequate, or appropriate. Also, the breakdown of the health system to deal with the pandemic was also noted. Some women were treated with disrespect by health professionals. Voluntary termination of pregnancy was inadequately advised, and women lost autonomy regarding decisions about their health.In the health care of ZIKV epidemics, it is necessary to include the gender perspective, more specifically, sexual and reproductive rights. In addition, these epidemics must be addressed through a comprehensive, appropriate, and not fragmented health system, in which sexual and reproductive rights must be mainstreamed in all health promotion and prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W3216683217,"Globally, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common malignancy and its prognosis remains poor because of the lack of reliable early diagnostic biomarkers. The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and prognosis of NSCLC. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is valuable for predicting the response to immunotherapy and determining the prognosis of NSCLC patients. To understand the TIME-related ceRNA network, the RNA profiling datasets from the Genotype-Tissue Expression and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were analyzed to identify the mRNAs, microRNAs, and lncRNAs associated with the differentially expressed genes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed that the brown module of mRNAs and the turquoise module of lncRNAs were the most important. Interactions among microRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs were prognosticated using miRcode, miRDB, TargetScan, miRTarBase, and starBase databases. A prognostic model consisting of 13 mRNAs was established using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses and validated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The 22 immune infiltrating cell types were analyzed using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and results showed that the high-risk score of this model was related to poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive TIME. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network that included 69 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) was constructed based on the five mRNAs obtained from the prognostic model. ROC survival analysis further showed that the seven DElncRNAs had a substantial prognostic value for the overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients; the area under the curve was 0.65. In addition, the high-risk group showed drug resistance to several chemotherapeutic and targeted drugs including cisplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and gefitinib. The differential expression of five mRNAs and seven lncRNAs in the ceRNA network was supported by the results of the HPA database and RT-qPCR analyses. This comprehensive analysis of a ceRNA network identified a set of biomarkers for prognosis and TIME prediction in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3216695078,"We set out to assess the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and micronutrient deficiency as indicated by serum retinol levels on the immune responses to Oral Cholera Vaccine (Shanchol™) in a cohort of participants in Lukanga Swamps, Zambia. Cholera remains endemic in Zambia with vaccines being the only effective preventive measures. However, the effect of these vaccines on populations living with HIV has not been widely documented.HIV testing and confirmation was done using the Alere Determine™ HIV-1/2 and Uni-Gold™ kits while vibriocidal antibody assay was applied for vaccine immunogenicity. Serum retinol analysis was assessed by Shimadzu Prominence HCT-2010 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The primary outcome was log transformed geometric mean titre.From 47 participants screened for HIV, 51% (24) tested positive. There was a statistically significant reduction in Ogawa geometric mean ratio (GMR) by 67% (GMR = 0.33; 95% CI: -0.15, 0.76; p-value = 0.009) attributable to HIV positivity with a non-significant reduction in Inaba GMR by about 50% due to HIV positivity. When doubling of retinol levels modelled, GMR reduction against Ogawa were non-significant but that against Inaba resulted in a significant reduction in geometric mean titer (GMT) (GMT-0.33, C.I 0.16-0.66, p-value 0.002). At 1000copies/ml viral load cut off and 350 cells/μl CD4 counts, Ogawa GMT was two times higher 11.16 (95%CI: 8.20-15.19) versus 6.06 (95%CI: 4.04-9.10) in low viremia participants, and three times higher in above threshold CD4 count participants; 24.81 (95%CI: 18.94-32.50) versus 7.07 (95%CI: 5.22-9.58).Our results show that while Shanchol™ is immunogenic in both HIV+/- individuals, HIV + participants responded poorly. Viral load and CD4 count affected vaccine immunogenicity. More research is required for detailed understanding of this in order to appropriately inform policy and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3216796101,"The study aimed to evaluate and compare anterior segment parameters between keratoconic eyes and eyes with high myopic astigmatism using Pentacam Scheimpflug tomography. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study that included sixty keratoconic eyes (thirty-two persons) and seventy-three eyes (forty-six persons) with high myopic astigmatism with mean ages 24.72 ± 11.65years and 26.60 ± 10.69years, respectively. Twenty-three parameters from the topographic map and fifteen parameters from the Belin-Ambrosió enhanced ectasia display map of the printouts of a Scheimpflug principle-based Pentacam tomographer were evaluated for their diagnostic accuracy using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. All parameters except cornea volume, anterior chamber volume, and anterior chamber angle indicated a significant difference between high myopic astigmatism and keratoconic eyes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of eighteen Pentacam parameters was excellent (0.9-1.0) in discriminating keratoconus from high myopic astigmatism, out of which four {anterior minimum sagittal curvature (ant. Rmin), posterior minimum sagittal curvature (post. Rmin), maximum Ambrosió relational thickness (ART max) and total deviation value (D)} indicated excellent (>90%) sensitivity and specificity in addition to the excellent AUROC values. Topographic and Belin-Ambrosió enhanced ectasia display (BAD) maps of a Scheimpflug principle-based Pentacam tomographer are useful in enhancing the diagnosis of keratoconus and may also provide valuable information in effectively screening for keratoconus cases among refractive surgery candidates with high myopic astigmatism."
https://openalex.org/W3217010504,"Timber linings are applied as primary supports in the tunnel fault and fracture zones of mines. These linings are essential to prevent broken rock from falling during the occurrence of exogenous fires. In this study, experiments and numerical simulations were carried out using a fire dynamics simulator to investigate the flame-spread rate, flame characteristics, smoke movement, and spread process of timber-lining fires under different wind speeds of 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 m/s. It was found that cross-section flame spreading follows the three-stage sidewall-ceiling-sidewall pattern. Moreover, the average flame-spread rate increases along the vertical flame-spreading direction and decreases when the flame reaches the timber-lining corners. Moreover, the flame lengths underneath the timber-lining ceiling in the x-direction are longer than those in the y-direction. As the wind speed increases, the normalized flame lengths R(f) in the two directions decrease, and the maximum temperature underneath the ceiling decreases. In addition, the maximum temperature in the three tunnel sections of interest is first recorded in the tunnel cross-section in the initial fire stage. Higher wind speeds correspond to farther distances of the maximum-temperature points of the three timber-lining sections from the fire source."
https://openalex.org/W3217098636,"To compare the utilization rate and usage patterns of pseudophakic and phakic donor corneas recovered by the Singapore Eye Bank.Records of local donor corneas recovered by the Singapore Eye Bank from 2012 to 2017 were examined. Corneas that were deemed suitable for clinical use were stratified into phakic and pseudophakic groups. We examined the basic demographic pattern of both groups and the initial type of surgery/ies that the corneas were suitable for based on tissue parameters such as time from harvesting, stromal clarity, the clear central corneal area, the presence of Descemet's membrane tears or defects, and endothelial cell density and quality. We also identified the types of corneal grafts that the corneas were eventually used for; Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK), Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (ALK), Endothelial Keratoplasty (EK). Finally, the overall utilization rates for each group were determined.A total of 986 corneas deemed suitable for transplant were analyzed, 908 (92%) were phakic and 78 were pseudophakic (8%). The average age of pseudophakic donor corneas was (65 ± 8 yrs. old) and there was a slight male preponderance for both groups (55%). Age adjusted analysis of pseudophakic corneas showed the endothelial cell density (ECD) (mean: 2327 ± 47.1 cells/mm2) and clear area (mean: 7.0 ± 0.7 mm) were lesser than phakic corneas. The percentage of pseudophakic corneas that were of EK standard (ECD >2500 cells/mm2) were lower compared to phakic corneas (37% and 77% respectively, p < 0.001). There was significant correlation between previous cataract surgery and the endothelial cell count of the donor corneas (p < 0.001), and regression analysis also showed a strong association of ECD with cataract surgery in reference to non-cataract surgery (-478.8 (95% CI-576.9 to -380.7). The overall utilization rate for pseudophakic corneas was 58% compared to that of phakic corneas at 83%. The most common reason for pseudophakic corneas not to be utilized was due to the presence of Descemet's membrane (DM) tears or defects under the main or side port incision created during phacoemulsification (30%). Phakic corneas were used primarily for optical grafts 84% (mainly EK) while pseudophakic corneas were used mostly for therapeutic/tectonic grafts 47% (mainly ALK or patch grafts).Compared to phakic donor corneas, pseudophakic corneas generally have lower overall tissue quality leading to lower uptake by surgeons and lower utilization rates. Eye banks must continuously refine their donor acceptance criteria and engage surgeons to optimize utilization of each recovered tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3217425620,"Efficient order execution plays a crucial role in the activity of every company. In production planning it is important to find a balance between the fluctuations of orders and stability of production flow regarding the company. One of the methods of achieving this goal is heijunka (production leveling). This paper presents a study of choosing the best variant of the production planning and control system for the production of standard parts. Three variants are investigated regarding delays in order delivery. The analysis of variants was conducted using a simulation method. The method of choosing the best variant for the production system being investigated is also proposed. The results show that the best variant is a mix of production leveling and production ""for stock""."

Eligible medical records of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 illnesses were reviewed at four participating hospitals in population centers across Puerto Rico and data were abstracted that described the clinical course, interventions, and outcomes. We found hospitalized patients had a median of 3 underlying conditions with obesity and diabetes as the most frequently reported conditions. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred among 28% of patients and 18% of patients died during the hospitalization. Patients 65 or older or with immune deficiencies had a higher risk for death. Common symptoms included cough, dyspnea, and fatigue; less than half of patients in the study reported fever which was less frequent than reported elsewhere in the literature. It is important for interventions within Hispanic communities to protect high-risk groups."
