https://openalex.org/W2017033059,"Heterogeneous, patterned surfaces comprising well-defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions and having micrometer-scale periodicities were prepared by patterning the adsorption of omega-functionalized alkanethiolates in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold. Condensation of water on such surfaces resulted in drops that followed the patterns in the SAMs. These patterned condensation figures (CFs) acted as optical diffraction gratings for reflected (or transmitted) light from a helium-neon laser (wavelength of 632.8 nanometers). Under an atmosphere of constant relative humidity, the development of the condensation figure was monitored quantitatively, as the temperature of the surface was lowered, by following the change in intensity of a first-order diffraction spot. This experimental technique may be useful in the development of new types of optical sensors that respond to their environment by changing the reflectivity of patterned regions and for studying phenomena such as drop nucleation, contact angle hysteresis, and spontaneous dewetting and break-up of thin liquid films."

It is critical to ensure that CF(3) groups do not cause significant ozone depletion. The rate coefficients for the key reactions that determine the efficiency of the CF(3) radical as a catalyst for ozone loss in the stratosphere have been measured and used in a model to calculate the possible depletion of ozone. From these results, it is concluded that the ozone depletion potentials related to the presence of the CF(3) group in hydrofluorocarbons are negligibly small."

In such dispersions, which were initially homogeneous, the voids grew with time when the dispersions were kept standing and formed more quickly in the internal material than in material close to the glass-dispersion interface. Void formation is thus not an artifact arising from the presence of the interface. A similar structural inhomogeneity, in apparently homogeneous systems, is discussed for simple ionic solutions, ionic polymer solutions, and Langmuir-Blodgett films."
https://openalex.org/W4246565490,"An array of problems in astronomy, cosmology, and particle physics is dependent on our understanding of the evolution and structure of stars. Stellar structure and evolution, in turn, depend on how the nuclear energy generated in the stellar center is transported to the surface. Energy transport by photons is a primary transfer mechanism. Recent improvements in the calculation of the radiative properties of stellar matter have helped resolve several long-standing discrepancies between observations and the predictions of theoretical models."
https://openalex.org/W1987403777,"Solar carbon monoxide spectra indicate the existence of a cool (less than 4000 kelvin) component to the solar chromosphere coexisting with the hot, bright gas at 6000 to 7000 kelvin. However, both the existence and the location of the cool component have been controversial. New high-resolution spectra show that carbon monoxide goes into emission just beyond the limb, allowing it to be probed without photospheric contamination. The cool component has temperatures as low as 3000 to 3500 kelvin and appears to cover 50 to 85 percent of the quiet solar surface. There is a steep temperature rise to normal chromospheric temperatures at a height of 900 to 1100 kilometers. Large horizontal velocities are seen, suggesting that the cool component is maintained by the supersonic adiabatic expansion of upwelling gas in overshooting granules."
https://openalex.org/W2039868620,"Laser radiation (XeCl laser, 308-nanometer wavelength) focused into a cell containing Mo(CO)(6) vapor produced ultrafine particles in the extended waist of the laser beam. Negative ion mass spectrometry revealed molybdenum carbide cluster ions with a stoichiometry MonC4n (n = 1 to 4). The MonC4n(-) (n = 2 to 4) ions are completely unreactive with NH(3), H(2)O, and O(2), suggesting structures in which the molybdenum atoms are unavailable for coordination to additional ligands. Collision-induced dissociation studies of these anions show the loss of MoC(4) units as the main fragmentation pathway. This observation, together with the lack of addition reactions, provides a basis for structures in which a planar cluster of two, three, or four molybdenum atoms is surrounded by, and bonded to, carbon dimers."
