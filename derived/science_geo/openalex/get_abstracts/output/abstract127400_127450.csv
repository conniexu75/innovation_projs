https://openalex.org/W1483162601,"Induction of the adaptive immune response depends on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines by antigen-presenting cells. The mechanisms that control the initial induction of these signals upon infection are poorly understood. It has been proposed that their expression is controlled by the non-clonal, or innate, component of immunity that preceded in evolution the development of an adaptive immune system in vertebrates1. We report here the cloning and characterization of a human homologue of the Drosophila toll protein (Toll) which has been shown to induce the innate immune response in adult Drosophila2,3,4. Like Drosophila Toll, human Toll is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor. Both Drosophila Toll and the IL-1 receptor are known to signal through the NF-κB pathway5,6,7. We show that a constitutively active mutant of human Toll transfected into human cell lines can induce the activation of NF-κB and the expression of NF-κB-controlled genes for the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1, which is required for the activation of naive T cells."

Here we present a study of the photophysical behaviour of single molecules of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) derived from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. Wild-type GFP and its mutant have attracted interest as fluorescent biological labels because the fluorophore may be formed in vivo15,16. GFP mutants immobilized in aereated aqueous polymer gels and excited by 488-nm light undergo repeated cycles of fluorescent emission (‘blinking’) on a timescale of several seconds—behaviour that would be unobservable in bulk studies. Eventually the individual GFP molecules reach a long-lasting dark state, from which they can be switched back to the original emissive state by irradiation at 405 nm. This suggests the possibility of using these GFPs as fluorescent markers for time-dependent cell processes, and as molecular photonic switches or optical storage elements, addressable on the single-molecule level."

https://openalex.org/W1618955965,"Kinesin is a two-headed, ATP-dependent motor protein1,2 that moves along microtubules indiscrete steps3 of 8 nm. In vitro, single molecules produceprocessive movement4,5, motors typically take ∼100steps before releasing from a microtubule5,6,7 . A central question relates tomechanochemical coupling in this enzyme: how many molecules ofATP are consumed per step? For the actomyosin system,experimental approaches to this issue have generated considerablecontroversy8,9. Here we take advantage of theprocessivity of kinesin to determine the coupling ratio withoutrecourse to direct measurements of ATPase activity, which aresubject to large experimental uncertainties8,10,11,12. Beads carrying singlemolecules of kinesin moving on microtubules were tracked with highspatial and temporal resolution by interferometry3,13. Statistical analysis of theintervals between steps at limiting ATP, and studies offluctuations in motor speed as a function of ATPconcentration14,15, allow the coupling ratio to bedetermined. At near-zero load, kinesin moleculeshydrolyse a single ATP molecule per 8-nm advance. Thisfinding excludes various one-to-many andmany-to-one coupling schemes, analogous to thoseadvanced for myosin, and places severe constraints on models for movement."

https://openalex.org/W1628323995,"Infants aged 4-6 months discriminate the fine phonetic differences that distinguish syllables in both their native and unfamiliar languages, but by 10-12 months their perceptual sensitivities are reorganized so that they discriminate only the phonetic variations that are used to distinguish meaning in their native language. It would seem, then, that infants apply their well honed phonetic sensitivities as they advance and begin to associate words with objects, but the question of how speech perception sensitivities are used in early word learning has not yet been answered. Here we use a recently developed technique to show that when they are required to pair words with objects, infants of 14 months fail to use the fine phonetic detail they detect in syllable discrimination tasks. In contrast, infants of 8 months--who are not yet readily learning words--successfully discriminate phonetic detail in the same task in which infants aged 14 months fail. Taken together, these results suggest a second reorganization in infants's use of phonetic detail as they move from listening to syllables to learning words."
https://openalex.org/W2171313781,"A method has been developed for culturing cardiac myocytes in a collagen matrix to produce a coherently contracting 3-dimensional model heart tissue that allows direct measurement of isometric contractile force. Embryonic chick cardiomyocytes were mixed with collagen solution and allowed to gel between two Velcro-coated glass tubes. During culture, the cardiomyocytes formed spontaneously beating cardiac myocyte-populated matrices (CMPMs) anchored at opposite ends to the Velcro-covered tubes through which they could be attached to a force measuring system. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed a highly organized tissue-like structure of alpha-actin and alpha-tropomyosin-positive cardiac myocytes exhibiting typical cross-striation, sarcomeric myofilaments, intercalated discs, desmosomes, and tight junctions. Force measurements of paced or unpaced CMPMs were performed in organ baths after 6-11 days of cultivation and were stable for up to 24 h. Force increased with frequency between 0.8 and 2.0 Hz (positive ""staircase""), increasing rest length (Starling mechanism), and increasing extracellular calcium. The utility of this system as a test bed for genetic manipulation was demonstrated by infecting the CMPMs with a recombinant beta-galactosidase-carrying adenovirus. Transduction efficiency increased from about 5% (MOI 0.1) to about 50% (MOI 100). CMPMs display more physiological characteristics of intact heart tissue than monolayer cultures. This approach, simpler and faster than generation of transgenic animals, should allow functional consequences of genetic or pharmacological manipulation of cardiomyocytes in vitro to be studied under highly controlled conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2031472414,"Hyperphosphorylated tau is the major component of paired helical filaments in neurofibrillary lesions associated with Alzheimer's disease. Hyperphosphorylation reduces the affinity of tau for microtubules and is thought to be a critical event in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recently, glycogen-synthase kinase-3 has been shown to phosphorylate tau in vitro and in non-neuronal cells transfected with tau. The activity of glycogen-synthase kinase-3 can be down-regulated in response to insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 through the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. We therefore hypothesize that insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 may affect tau phosphorylation through the inhibition of glycogen-synthase kinase-3 in neurons. Using cultured human neuronal NT2N cells, we demonstrate that glycogen-synthase kinase-3 phosphorylates tau and reduces its affinity for microtubules and that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation reduces tau phosphorylation and promotes tau binding to microtubules. We further demonstrate that these effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 are mediated through the inhibition of glycogen-synthase kinase-3 via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway.

Hyperphosphorylated tau is also found in neurofibrillary lesions in a range of other central nervous system disorders (7Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Rosenberg R.N. Prusiner S.B. Dimauro S. Barchi R.L. The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological Disease. 2nd Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1997: 613-627Google Scholar). In AD patients, the extent and topographical distribution of the neurofibrillary lesions correlate reliably with the degree of dementia (8Braak H. Braak E.

Neurology. 1992; 42: 631-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation impairs the microtubule binding function of tau. PHF-tau does not bind to microtubules unless it is dephosphorylated (10Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y.

It has been hypothesized that the reduced binding ability of PHF-tau to microtubules, coupled with reduced levels of normal tau, destabilizes microtubules in AD. This results in the disruption of vital cellular processes, such as rapid axonal transport, and leads to the degeneration of affected neurons. Several serine/threonine protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate tau in vitro. They include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (12Drewes G. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Doring F. Mandelkow E.M.

However, it is not clear which of these kinases phosphorylate tau in neuronal cells and are authentic regulators of tau phosphorylationin vivo. One of these kinases, GSK-3, has a possible physiological role in regulating tau phosphorylation, because recent studies have demonstrated that it induces cellular tau phosphorylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells and COS cells transfected with tau (21Sperber B.R. Leight S. Goedert M. Lee V.M.-Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 197: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,22Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Latimer D. Davis D.R. Anderton B.H. Gallo J.M. Hanger D.

Two isoforms of GSK-3, GSK-3α (51 kDa) and GSK-3β (46 kDa), are encoded by two different genes. They share 85% homology at the amino acid level (23Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The activities of both isoforms can be down-regulated in response to insulin and growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (23Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Sutherland C. Cohen P.

Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). This down-regulation involves phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue (serine 21 for GSK-3α and serine 9 for GSK-3β) (24Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 26Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is putatively mediated by several protein kinases, e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAPK1 or p90 rsk), which lies on the MAPK cascade (24Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the 70-kDa S6 kinase (p70 S6K) (25Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) (26Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar), which lie downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) pathway. GSK-3 is abundant in the brain (27Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Insulin, IGF-1, and their receptors are also found throughout the developing and mature vertebrate brain (28Marks J.L. King M.G. Baskin D.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 293: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Sara V.R. Hall K. Von Holtz H. Humbel R. Sjogren B. Wetterberg L. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 34: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 30Haselbacher G.K. Schwab M.E. Pasi A. Humbel R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). But it is currently unclear whether GSK-3 activity is regulated by insulin and IGF-1 in neurons. Recent studies have shown that insulin and IGF-1 promote survival by signaling through the PI(3)K-PKB pathway in cultured cerebellar neurons (31Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). This led to our speculation that through the activation of PKB, insulin or IGF-1 may induce inhibition of GSK-3 and affect tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. To test this hypothesis, we conducted our study in human NT2N neurons, which are derived from a human teratocarcinoma cell line (NTera2/D1 or NT2) after treatment with retinoic acid (32Lee V.M.-Y. Andrews P.W. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 514-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These NT2N cells resemble late embryonic central nervous system neurons and express the fetal isoform of tau (33Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 35Merrick S.E. Demoise D.C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5589-5594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using this system, we demonstrate that insulin and IGF-1 reduce tau phosphorylation and promote tau binding to microtubules. This effect is mediated through the inhibition of GSK-3 via the PI(3)K-PKB signaling pathway. Recombinant GSK-3β and PD98059 were purchased from New England Biolabs; IGF-1 was from Promega; LY294002 was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories; protein kinase A inhibitor was from Upstate Biotechnology; [γ-32P]ATP and125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG were from NEN Life Science Products; and the Semliki Forest Virus gene expression system was from Life Technologies, Inc. Taxol was obtained from Dr. V. Narayanan of the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. NT2 cells were grown and maintained as described (33Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NT2 cells were treated with retinoic acid for 5 weeks before the neuron-like NT2N cells were separated from the parent NT2 cells and replated on 6-well plates previously coated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml) and matrigel. These NT2N neurons were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (DMEM-HG), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and mitotic inhibitors (1 μmcytosine arabinoside, 10 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, and 10 μm uridine). 2–4-week-old NT2N cells were used for experiments. Three GSK-3β/SFV viral constructs carrying C-terminal c-Myc tags (EQKLISEEDL) were made. GSK-3β WT is the wild type GSK-3β; GSK-3β S9A is a constitutively active form of GSK-3β, in which the serine 9 residue was mutated to alanine; and GSK-3β KM is an inactive mutant engineered by mutating lysines 85 and 86 to methionine and isoleucine. Another SFV construct expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) was used as a control. To overexpress these constructs, NT2N cells were incubated for an hour with viral stocks diluted in DMEM-HG (MOI = 10) and then replenished with regular medium and incubated overnight. For experiments that examined the effects of insulin on infected cells, cells were incubated for 6 h after infection, serum-starved (in DMEM-HG with 0.1% fetal bovine serum) for another hour, and then treated with insulin (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. To study the effects of insulin and IGF-1, NT2N cells were serum-starved in DMEM-HG with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for an hour and then treated with 100 ng/ml of insulin or 10 ng/ml of IGF-1 for 5 min. Alternatively, NT2N cells were pretreated with PD98059 (50 μm, 60 min), LY294002 (100 μm, 15 min), wortmannin (100 nm, 15 min), 8-Br-cAMP (2 mm, 15 min), or rapamycin (100 nm, 15 min) before insulin or IGF-1 treatment. Pervanadate was prepared by incubating one part of 500 mm H2O2with five parts of 10 mm Na3VO4 at room temperature for 10 min (36Pumiglia K.M. Lau L.F. Huang C.K. Burroughs S. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This stock was added to NT2N cells at 1:100 dilution for 2 h. NT2N cells were lysed in ice-cold high salt RAB buffer (0.1 m MES, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.75 m NaCl, pH 6.8) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (37Bramblett G.T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 212-222PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation for 20 min at 50,000 ×g at 4 °C, the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). An equal amount of total protein was resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblotting analysis with anti-tau antibodies. The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine methods. Alternatively, for the quantitation of the relative levels of tau protein, 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibody, and the blots were exposed to PhosphorImager plates as described (37Bramblett G.T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 212-222PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total protein was loaded for the detection of tau on immunoblots using the monoclonal antibodies T14/46, 25 μg for the antibodies T1 and PHF1 and 50 μg for the antibodies AT8, AT270, and PHF6. NT2N cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of insulin or infected with GSK-3β S9A/SFV overnight before they were lysed in 37 °C RAB buffer (essentially high salt RAB without NaCl) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μm taxol, 2 mm GTP, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (38Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (3095) Google Scholar, 39Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were Dounce homogenized 20 times and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g at 25 °C. The protein concentrations of the soluble fractions were adjusted to be the same. The insoluble cytoskeleton fractions (pellet) were resuspended in ice-cold RAB buffer of the same volumes as the corresponding soluble fractions. Equal volumes of both fractions (approximately 5 μg of total protein from each fraction) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody. To enrich tau, the samples were boiled for 5 min, incubated on ice for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal volumes (containing approximately 10 μg of total protein) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblot analysis with T14/46. 125I-Labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was used to detect the immunoreactivities, and quantitation was performed with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The ratios of microtubule-bound tau (in cytoskeletal fraction)versus soluble tau (in the soluble fraction) were calculated according to T14/46 immunoreactivities. Infected NT2N cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 μm microcystin) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. Overexpressed GSK-3β containing a c-Myc tag was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc antiserum. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with GSK-3 kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 5 μm ATP). GSK-3 kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of GSK-3 kinase buffer supplemented with 4 μg of recombinant tau and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by adding 5 × sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The entire reaction was then resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to PhosphorImager plate. GSK-3 kinase activity was represented by the 32P incorporation into tau and normalized by the amount of GSK-3 present in each reaction determined by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti-GSK-3 antibody. To determine endogenous GSK-3 activity, the monoclonal anti-GSK-3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. For PKB immunoprecipitation kinase assay, NT2N cells were harvested in the same lysis buffer, and PKB was immunoprecipitated with a sheep polyclonal anti-PKB antibody.

G. Greenberg; and AT8 and AT270 were from Innogenetics. The rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc was raised against synthetic peptide EQKLISEEDL. The mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories; the sheep polyclonal anti-PKB was from Upstate Biotechnology; and the mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin was from Amersham Corp. To determine whether insulin or IGF-1 stimulation alters tau phosphorylation, NT2N cells were treated with or without insulin or IGF-1 for 5 min and lysed for immunoblot analysis of tau phosphorylation with a panel of anti-tau antibodies. T14/46, a mixture of two phosphorylation-independent antibodies, detects total tau protein, whereas T1 detects dephosphorylated tau at residues 189–207 (numbering according to the largest isoform of central nervous system tau). With insulin and IGF-1 treatment, T1 immunoreactivity increased, indicating a reduction of tau phosphorylation. This was confirmed by the decrease in AT8 immunoreactivity, which is specific for phosphorylated serine 202 and threonine 205 (Fig. 1, A and B). The reduction of tau phosphorylation was induced by 100 ng/ml of insulin and 10 ng/ml of IGF-1. At these concentrations, insulin and IGF-1 bind with high affinity to their cognate receptors, because the affinity for cross-reaction is 100–1000 times lower (60De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. ( Basel ). 1994; 42: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that both insulin and IGF-1 receptors mediate this effect. We then examined whether insulin or IGF-1 stimulation affects tau binding to microtubules. Soluble and cytoskeletal fractions of cell lysates were prepared from control and insulin-treated NT2N cells. The tau protein and α-tubulin in each fraction were detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). The ratio of microtubule-bound tau (P) versus soluble tau (S) was determined and plotted in Fig. 1 D. This ratio was significantly higher in cells treated with insulin than in control cells (Fig. 1 D), indicating an enhanced tau binding to microtubules. To determine whether GSK-3 phosphorylates tau in neuronal cells, we overexpressed wild type (WT) and two mutant forms (S9A and KM) of GSK-3β in NT2N cells using the SFV gene expression system. The S9A mutation abolishes phosphorylation-dependent regulation at serine 9 and results in a constitutively active enzyme. KM has a double mutation and is enzymatically inactive. All three overexpressed GSK-3β carried a c-Myc-tag at their C termini and were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-c-Myc antiserum. GSK-3 kinase assay was performed with recombinant tau as substrate. Fig. 2 Ademonstrates that GSK-3β S9A and WT phosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas GSK-3β KM was inactive despite of a similar expression level. An irrelevant SFV construct expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) was used as control. To determine whether tau phosphorylation is altered by overexpression of GSK-3β in vivo, we detected tau in infected NT2N cells by immunoblotting with a panel of site-specific and phosphorylation-sensitive anti-tau antibodies. Fig. 2 Bdemonstrates that in cells infected with the active GSK-3β/SFVs (S9A and WT), T1 (dephosphorylated tau) levels decreased, whereas PHF1 (phosphoserine 396/404), AT270 (phosphothreonine 181), and PHF6 (phosphothreonine 231) levels increased, indicating elevations of phosphorylation at these sites. The phosphorylation levels also increased at sites recognized by AT8 (phosphoserine 202/phosphothreonine 205) and PHF13 (phosphoserine 396) (data not shown). However, the immunoreactivity to 12E8 (phosphoserine 262) was not affected by GSK-3 (Fig. 2 B). Cells infected with LacZ/SFV were used as control in which tau phosphorylation levels did not differ from noninfected cells (data not shown). The expression of GSK-3β KM also did not alter tau phosphorylation (data not shown). We also examined the effects of GSK-3β on tau binding to microtubules. As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), significantly less tau was bound to microtubules in cells infected with GSK-3β S9A/SFV, because the ratio of cytoskeletal tauversus soluble tau was decreased. These data suggest that in neuronal cells, GSK-3 phosphorylates tau at multiple sites and reduces the affinity of tau for microtubules. It has been shown previously that in non-neuronal cells, insulin and IGF-1 down-regulate GSK-3 activity by inducing the phosphorylation of a serine residue (serine 9 in GSK-3β and serine 21 in GSK-3α, 23–26). To determine whether insulin mediates its effects on tau phosphorylation through the inhibition of GSK-3 in neurons, we first examined whether or not in NT2N cells insulin inhibits GSK-3β activity through the phosphorylation of serine 9. To do this, the cells were infected with either GSK-3β S9A/SFV or GSK-3β WT/SFV and subsequently treated with insulin. Overexpressed GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated, and the kinase activities were determined quantitatively using the in vitro kinase assay and normalized to the amount of GSK-3 in each reaction. As shown in Fig.3 A, wild type GSK-3β activity (WT) was inhibited by insulin, whereas GSK-3β S9A activity (S9A) remained unchanged. The endogenous GSK-3 activity was also assayed in noninfected NT2N cells by immunoprecipitating both GSK-3α and GSK-3β with a monoclonal anti-GSK-3 antibody. The normalized relative endogenous GSK-3 activity was also decreased by insulin treatment (Fig. 3 A, Endogenous). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of serine 9 is involved in the insulin-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β in neurons. To further demonstrate that insulin regulates tau phosphorylation by the inhibition of GSK-3, we infected NT2N neurons with GSK-3β S9A/SFV or GSK-3β WT/SFV and subsequently treated the cells with insulin. The total tau levels were not altered by infection or by insulin treatment (T14/46, Fig. 3 B). Similar to what was shown in Fig. 2, in cells not treated with insulin, overexpression of GSK-3β S9A and GSK-3β WT resulted in a decrease in T1 and an increase in PHF1. However, insulin treatment only reduced tau phosphorylation in cells expressing GSK-3β WT but not in cells expressing GSK-3β S9A, because an increase in T1 and a decrease in PHF1 can be detected only in cells infected with GSK-3β WT/SFV (Fig. 3 B). These experiments demonstrate that tau phosphorylation cannot be regulated by insulin unless GSK-3 activity can be inhibited through serine 9. This strongly suggests that insulin regulates tau phosphorylation through the inhibition of GSK-3. Three different protein kinases have been proposed to phosphorylate and inhibit GSK-3. They are MAPKAPK1, which lies downstream of the MAP-kinase cascade, and p70 S6K and PKB, which lie on the PI(3)K pathway. All three have been shown to phosphorylate GSK-3β at serine 9 and GSK-3α at serine 21 (24Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Sutherland C.

Moreover, a transfected cell line expressing human gp130 without IL-6Rα exhibited a robust response to vIL-6 but not to huIL-6.

Other studies demonstrate an anti-apoptotic function induced by IL-6 in some B cell neoplasms and mediated through apoptotic antagonists such as Bcl-xL (25Schwarze M.M. Hawley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2262-2265PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lichtenstein A. Tu Y. Fady C. Vescio R. Berenson J. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 162: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). IL-6 also plays a pivotal role in hepatic tissue, where it causes the expression of multiple acute phase response (APR) proteins (27Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The receptor for IL-6 contains two heterologous subunits, IL-6Rα and gp130. Both receptors belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily containing described canonical motifs (28Bazan J.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). To initiate signaling by the IL-6 receptor complex, the ligand must first make a low affinity contact with the IL-6Rα subunit which then recruits the signal transducing gp130 subunit. Importantly, receptor function depends on the dimerization of gp130 subunits (29Murakimi M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). IL-6 thus belongs to a small family of cytokines that function via the homodimerization of gp130 or the heterodimerization of gp130 with LIFRβ, another signal transducing subunit. A prominent signaling event induced by this dimerization of signal transducing subunits is activation of the JAK-STAT system, a recently described pathway employed by numerous cytokine receptor systems (30Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar) and known to be activated specifically by the IL-6 family of cytokines (31Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M.

Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced receptor assembly causes the activation of associated Janus protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) resulting in phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors that interact physically with specific receptor phosphotyrosines. Finally, phosphorylation of the STAT factors directs their dimerization and relocalization to the nucleus where they influence the transcription of target genes (30Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 33Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous work in the IL-6 system provided evidence that the gp130 subunit can associate variously with the JAK kinases, JAK1, -2, and Tyk2, and that JAK activation leads to STAT1 and STAT3 DNA binding and gene transactivation in a cell context-dependent manner (34Stahl N.

In these studies we endeavored to determine whether the JAK-STAT signaling program was induced by the KSHV cytokine homolog vIL-6, whether this response mimicked that of huIL-6, and whether the cell surface receptor engaged by the viral cytokine is related to the classical IL-6 receptor complex. HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Calabasis, CA), 1% 100 × non-essential amino acids and 1% 100 × sodium pyruvate. BCBL-1 cells (a gift of Dr. Don Ganem) were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.05 m2-mercaptoethanol. vIL-6 and the reverse vIL-6 (6-LIv) control were prepared as described previously. Open reading frame K2 was cloned into the pMET7 expression vector in forward and reverse orientations and transfected into COS7 cells. COS-derived supernatants were then concentrated 10-fold with a Centriplus 10 filter. HepG2 cells were treated for 10–15 min with 0.5–1.0 ml COS media containing vIL-6 or reverse vIL-6, 100 ng/ml human IL-6 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or 1 nm human LIF (R & D Systems) prior to preparation of nuclear extracts. Soluble IL-6Rα fragments (sIL-6Rα, R & D Systems) were used where indicated at 50 ng/ml. BCBL-1 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma), and then cell culture supernatant was harvested. HepG2 cells were then incubated with 1 ml of supernatant for 10–15 min before nuclear extraction. BAF-130 cells, representing Ba/F3 cells expressing transfected human gp130 but not IL-6Rα (41Hibi M.

Narazaki (Osaka University Medical School). They were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% WEHI 3B-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3, and geneticin 0.3 mg/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10–40 × 106 HepG2 cells or 40–50 × 106 BAF-130 cells were incubated with COS7 supernatants and then washed in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (42Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouillex F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The STAT-response element from the FcγRI gene promoter was used for EMSA assays. The probe was prepared by end-labeling oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Corp.) and polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). Binding reactions were performed using 105 cpm, 3 μg of poly[d(I-C)], binding buffer, and 10 μg of nuclear extract (52Dent C. Latchman D. Latchman D. in Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 1-26Google Scholar). Probe specificity competition was done with 50 ng of FcγRI and IRF-1 oligonucleotides. Sequences of oligonucleotides are as follows: FcγRI, GTATTTCCCAGAAAAAGGAC; IRF-1, GCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGG. Preincubations of nuclear extracts with antibodies were performed for 45 min on ice in the absence of poly[d(I-C)] and binding buffer as described previously (42Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouillex F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The STAT1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and STAT2 and -3 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), JAK1, 4G10, and anti-SHC were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and MOPC21 (monoclonal IgG1) and MOPC195 (IgG2b control) were from Cappel (Durham, NC). Receptor neutralization studies were performed using monoclonal antibodies reactive with human IL-6Rα, gp130, and a polyclonal antibody against IL-6Rα (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or with MOPC21 (monoclonal IgG1) and anti-SHC (polyclonal IgG) antibodies as controls. 10–40 × 106 HepG2 cells were incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of antibody and then subjected to cytokine stimulation for 15 min, and nuclear extracts were subsequently prepared as described above. Cell lysates were prepared from 30–40 × 106 cells using a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 mg/ml), aprotinin (10 mg/ml), pepstatin A (1 mg/ml) as described previously (63Goldsmith M.A. Xu W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14698-14704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pre-cleared once overnight and twice for 30 min with 5 μg of rabbit preimmune serum (Cappel, Durham, NC) and 100 μl of protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim). JAKs were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against JAK1, -2, and -3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and Tyk2 (a gift of Dr. Oscar Colaminici) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Immunoblots were performed with 4G10 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). To assess protein loading, blots were stripped (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.7) for 30 min at 55 °C and reblotted with appropriate JAK antibodies. HepG2 cells were plated at 1.8 × 106 cells/well density in 6-well plates 16 h before transfection. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg per well of reporter plasmid DNA containing 4 IRF-1 promoter STAT-response elements upstream of a minimal TK promoter and firefly luciferase gene (a gift of Ligand Corp.) (44Lamb P. Kessler L.V. Suto C. Levy D.E. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 83: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection cells were incubated in media containing 100 ng/ml IL-6, 1 ml of vIL-6, or 1 ml of control reverse vIL-6 (6-LIv) media for 6 h. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Lysates were exposed to luciferase substrates (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and counted for luminescence units on a Monolight 2000 (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories). Lysates were assayed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) to control for protein quantity. Concentrated COS7 cell supernatants expressing recombinant vIL-6 or the reverse 6-LIv as a negative control were used to stimulate HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma line that expresses IL-6 receptors (45Sonne O. Davidsen O. Moller B.D. Munck Petersen C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 20: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Serial immunoprecipitations of JAKs were carried out in HepG2 cells after cytokine stimulation, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to measure the tyrosine phosphorylation of these kinases as a marker of their activation (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation of JAK1 occurred in response to both vIL-6 and huIL-6 but not the 6-LIv control supernatant. Stripping and re-blotting with anti-JAK1 antibodies demonstrated equivalent levels of JAK1 protein expression in each sample. However, the phosphorylation status of other JAK kinases revealed no reproducible activation of either JAK2 or Tyk2 in samples treated with either huIL-6 or vIL-6 (data not shown). Subsequently, the induction of STAT factors by the expressed viral cytokine was assessed. Treatment of HepG2 cells with the recombinant supernatants resulted in the appearance of three discrete nucleoprotein complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) employing the STAT-binding probe FcγRI (Fig. 1 B). This tripartite DNA-binding activity mirrors that found upon stimulation with huIL-6. To demonstrate that these DNA-binding activities were binding the oligonucleotide probe specifically, cold competition was performed with a related gamma activation sequence element probe, from the IRF-1 promoter (Fig. 2 A). Preincubation of extracts with excesses of either FcγRI or IRF-1 oligonucleotide sequences caused complete elimination of the 3 bands. Furthermore, incubation of these extracts with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies caused a diminution of DNA-binding activity, providing evidence that this activity requires tyrosine phosphorylation sites, characteristic of STAT factors (Fig.2 B). Finally, antibody supershift experiments with antibodies raised against STAT proteins were performed to elucidate precisely the components involved in these complexes. An antibody against the N terminus of STAT1 caused a band supershift concomitant with the loss of the lower two bands in the tripartite band pattern (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, the anti-STAT3 antibody completely abolished the upper two bands but did not yield a supershifted complex. This indicates that the lower and upper bands consist of STAT1 and STAT3 homodimers, respectively, whereas the intermediate band contained STAT1/STAT3 heterodimers. A similar profile of STAT activation has been described in response to huIL-6 (36Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) and other gp130-interacting cytokines (46Levy J.B. Schindler C. Raz R. Levy D.E. Baron R. Horowitz M.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 47Faris M. Ensoli B. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G. Nguyen A. Wang S. Nel A.E. AIDS. 1996; 10: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To examine vIL-6 induced gene expression, a reporter plasmid containing the firefly luciferase gene downstream of the STAT-responsive IRF-1 element linked to a minimal promoter was transiently expressed in HepG2 cells. A 30-fold increase in luciferase activity in response to huIL-6 relative to the unstimulated condition was observed in these cells (Fig. 3). Others have reported similar levels of transcriptional transactivation in response to IL-6 (33Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Likewise, exposure of reporter-expressing cells to vIL-6 caused a comparable increase in transcriptional activity. The lower level of transcriptional activity triggered by vIL-6 relative to that of huIL-6 may be due either to lower specific activity of vIL-6 compared with huIL-6 or to differences in relative concentration. These data demonstrate that STAT factors activated following stimulation with the viral cytokine are capable of transactivating gene expression and therefore may play a role in modulating gene expression in cells expressing the appropriate cell surface receptors. The IL-6Rα subunit contains an extracellular domain that binds the ligand at low affinity but is not alone sufficient to spark an intracellular signal. Signal initiation depends on the ligation of IL-6/IL-6Rα with gp130 subunits. In light of the similarities found between huIL-6 and vIL-6 in terms of JAK/STAT activation, we asked whether these two molecules also mimic each other in their interactions with receptor subunits. To this end, HepG2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of a monoclonal antibody against IL-6Rα and then stimulated with huIL-6. A loss of signaling capacity was observed at high antibody concentrations using STAT DNA binding activity in EMSA as an indicator (Fig.4 A). Unexpectedly, when the same procedure was carried out using vIL-6 instead of huIL-6, no loss of STAT activation was detected. Furthermore, when cells preincubated with antibody were exposed to a 1:3 dilution of vIL-6 supernatant, no loss of STAT-activated DNA binding activity was observed. Similar studies employing a polyclonal antibody to neutralize IL-6Rα also demonstrated no inhibition of vIL-6 activity, while substantially diminishing that of huIL-6 (data not shown). A similar antibody competition approach was then employed to elucidate the role of the gp130 subunit in signaling by the KSHV cytokine. In contrast to the anti-IL6-Rα antibody, an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody at high concentrations inhibited both the huIL-6 and vIL-6 signals (Fig.4 B). These findings suggest that the viral cytokine, unlike huIL-6 itself, utilizes gp130 without necessarily interacting with IL-6Rα; IL-6Rα apparently does not facilitate the association of vIL-6 with gp130 as it does with IL-6. Therefore, by these criteria, it appears unlikely that the viral cytokine must rely on recruitment of IL-6Rα to elicit its intracellular signal. As an alternate test of the hypothesis that vIL-6 differs from huIL-6 by selectively engaging gp130, signaling studies were performed using a transfected IL-3-dependent murine cell line expressing exclusively human gp130 but not IL-6Rα. These BAF-130 cells have been shown previously to respond to huIL-6 only upon the addition of soluble fragments of the IL-6Rα chain (sIL-6Rα) to the culture (41Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Likewise, we observed that the induction in these cells of STAT DNA binding by huIL-6 was undetectable by EMSA with the STAT-binding probe in the absence of sIL-6Rα but was readily evident as a three-component nucleoprotein complex when sIL-6Rα was added (Fig.5). Strikingly, supernatants containing vIL-6 (but not the 6LI-v negative control) induced the indistinguishable tripartite nucleoprotein species in BAF-130 cells regardless of the presence or absence of sIL-6Ra (Fig. 5). These findings confirm that vIL-6 engages the IL-6R in a markedly different manner from that of huIL-6 and that this interaction is functionally independent of the IL-6Rα subunit. BC-1 and BCP-1, cell lines that are coinfected with KSHV and Epstein-Barr virus or KSHV alone, respectively, have been demonstrated to produce transcripts encoding vIL-6 in response to TPA (15Moore P.S. Boshoff C. Weiss R.A. Chang Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). BCBL-1 is a body cavity-based lymphoma (BCBL) cell line that is KSHV-positive and Epstein-Barr virus-negative, similar to BCP-1. To assess further the potential biologic activity of vIL-6 within the viral life cycle, we subjected BCBL-1 cells to TPA treatment (20 ng/ml for 48 h) and harvested the culture medium; this treatment of BCBL-1 cells has been shown to induce both the expression of KSHV genes (including that encoding vIL-6) and the lytic replication of KSHV, which is otherwise latent and transcriptionally suppressed in these cells (7Renne R.

We determined the entire cDNA sequence which encodes a highly basic polypeptide of 134 amino acids total with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The predicted mature protein of 111 amino acids has the four canonical cysteine residues and shows 21–33% identity to other human CC chemokines, but has a unique carboxyl-terminal extension of about 30 amino acids which contains two extra cysteine residues. The mRNA was expressed strongly in tissues such as the lymph nodes, Appendix, and spleen. The recombinant protein, which was produced by the baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity, was a highly efficient chemoattractant for certain human T cell lines and a highly potent one for freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured normal T cells expanded by phytohemagglutinin and interleukin 2. Unlike most other CC chemokines, however, this novel chemokine was not chemotactic for monocytes or neutrophils, suggesting that it is specific for lymphocytes. From these results, we designated this novel CC chemokine as SLC fromsecondary lymphoid-tissuechemokine. SLC fused with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SLC-SEAP) was used to characterize the SLC receptor. Binding of SLC-SEAP to freshly isolated lymphocytes was blocked by SLC (IC50, 0.12 nm) but not by any other CC chemokine so far tested, suggesting that resting lymphocytes express a class of receptors highly specific for SLC. By using somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, and selected yeast and bacterial artificial chromosome clones, we mapped the SLC gene (SCYA21) at chromosome 9p13 and between chromosomal markers, D9S1978(WI-8765) and AFM326vd1, where the gene for another novel CC chemokine termed ELC from EBI1-ligandchemokine (SCYA19) also exists.

The chemokines are grouped into two major subfamilies from the arrangement of the amino-terminal two of the four canonical cysteine residues. One amino acid separates the two cysteines in the CXC chemokines, whereas the two cysteines are adjacent in the CC chemokines. The CXC chemokine genes are clustered at chromosome 4q12-q21, whereas the CC chemokine genes at chromosome 17q11.2. Most CXC chemokines are primarily chemotactic for neutrophils, whereas most CC chemokines are chemotactic for monocytes. Furthermore, most CXC and CC chemokines share receptors with some other members of the respective subfamilies (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv.

Thus, these chemokines may constitute a new category of CC chemokines, each playing a specific role in the immune system. Furthermore, besides CXC and CC chemokines, new molecules related to the chemokine superfamily have been identified. Lymphotactin/SCM-1 is a cytokine which carries only the second and the fourth of the four canonical cysteine residues and seems to act specifically on lymphocytes (21Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W. Schall T.J. Zlotnik A. Science. 1994; 266: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 22Yoshida T.

Fractalkine is a transmembrane molecule that carries a chemokine-like domain with a distinct CX 3C motif on top of an extended mucin-like stalk. A soluble form of fractalkine was shown to be efficiently chemotactic for monocytes and T cells (23Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J.

The data base of expressed sequence tags (EST) consists of partial single pass cDNA sequences from various tissues (24Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Med. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Analysis of the EST data base is becoming a powerful approach to look for new members of gene families. Recently, we have identified a number of novel human CC chemokines by initially probing the EST data base with nucleotide and amino acid sequences of known CC chemokines (16Hieshima K. Imai T.

Here we report another novel human CC chemokine termed SLC fromsecondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine which was also initially identified in the EST data base. SLC is expressed strongly in lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, Appendix, and spleen and is specifically chemotactic for lymphocytes. Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes possess a class of receptors binding SLC with high affinity and specificity. The SLC gene (SCYA21) is mapped to chromosome 9p13 where the gene for another novel CC chemokine ELC (SCYA19) also exists (18Yoshida R. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Baba M. Kitaura M. Nishimura M.

Human T cell lines, Hut78 and Hut102, and a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). 293/EBNA-1 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Sf9 insect cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS. High FiveTM cells were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained at 27 °C in EX-CELL 400 medium (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from EDTA-treated venous blood obtained from healthy adult donors by using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Granulocytes were isolated from the pellet of Ficoll-Paque gradient by dextran sedimentation and hypotonic lysis of residual erythrocytes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (>97% lymphocytes) were negatively selected by MiniMACS (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch, Germany) after staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14. In some experiments, T cells were expanded from PBMC by stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 days and cultivation for another week with a supplement of 400 units/ml IL-2 (Shionogi, Osaka, Japan) (>99% CD3+ T cells). In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 500 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PT) (Sigma) at 37 °C for 90 min before assays. Production and purification of recombinant TARC, LARC, and eotaxin were described previously (15Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol.

Wiese B.A. Wojzynski M.K. Davison D.B. Worley K.C. Genomic Res. 1996; 6: 454-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) available on the World Wide Web. The program used was Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68264) Google Scholar). By using primers based on an EST sequence (GenBankTM accession number W84422), cDNA clones were obtained by the method of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (29Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In brief, PCR was performed with 0.5 ng of human fetal lung cDNA commercially available for RACE-PCR (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, 10 pmol each of primers (5′-RACE primer, 5′-CCTTCTTGCATCTTGGGTTCAGGCTTC; 3′-RACE primer, 5′-GAAGCCTGAACCAAGATGCAAGAAGG; AP1 primer (CLONTECH) which is complementary to part of the cDNA adaptor ligated at both ends of the cDNA), 2.5 units of TAKARA LA Taq (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 1 × buffer supplied with the polymerase, and 0.55 μg of TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 2 min, and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min. The amplification products were cloned into pCR-II vector (Invitrogen) by T-A ligation and sequenced on both strands by using gene-specific primers and commercially available primers. The 0.5-kbBamHI-XbaI fragment of the SLC cDNA containing the entire coding region was labeled with 32P using Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at a specific activity of 3.1 × 109 cpm/μg. The probe hybridized with a single band in human genomic DNA digested with EcoRI,HindIII, or BamHI at high stringency conditions. Northern blot filters containing human poly(A)+ RNA from various tissues (2 μg/lane) were purchased fromCLONTECH. Filters were hybridized with the32P-labeled probe at 42 °C for 16 h in a solution consisting of 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, washed twice at 42 °C for 30 min in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, and exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT) at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 8, 24, 48, and 96 h. Recombinant SLC was produced by using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the BamHI-XbaI fragment of the SLC cDNA containing the entire coding region was subcloned intoBamHI-XbaI sites of pFastBac 1 baculovirus transfer vector in the downstream of the polyhedrin promoter. The resulting recombinant plasmid termed pFastBac-NCC8.1 was transfected into Escherichia coli DH10Bac containing shuttle vector “bacmid” with a mini-attTn7 target site and the helper plasmid. The mini-Tn7 element on the pFastBac 1 plasmid transposes to the mini-attTn7 target site on the bacmid in the presence of transposition proteins provided by the helper plasmid. Insertion of the mini-Tn7 into the mini-attTn7 target site disrupts the coding sequence for the LacZ α peptide, making colonies containing recombinant bacmids white in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. The resulting recombinant bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the recombinant viruses were obtained. High FiveTM cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the recombinant viruses at multiplicity of infection of 10–20. The culture supernatants collected 2 days after infection were mixed with 0.1 volume of 500 mm MES, pH 6.5, and applied to 1-ml cation-exchange Hitrap-S column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The column on the FPLC system (Pharmacia) was eluted with 45 ml of a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in 50 mm MES at a rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing recombinant SLC were pooled and injected into a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (4.6 × 250 mm Cosmocil 5C4-AR-300, Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted with 60 ml of a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing recombinant SLC were pooled and lyophilized. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA kit (Pierce). Endotoxin levels, which were determined by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), were always <4 pg/μg of recombinant SLC. The amino-terminal sequence analysis was done on a protein sequencer (Shimazu, Tokyo, Japan). Migration of cells was assessed in a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described previously (15Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In brief, Hut78, Hut102, THP-1, PBMC, PBL, and cultured normal T cells expanded by PHA and IL-2 were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, at 2 × 106/ml (Hut78, Hut102, THP-1, PBMC) or at 4 × 106/ml (PBL, cultured T cells). Granulocytes were suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 1 × 106/ml. The lower wells were filled with 30 μl of assay buffer without or with chemokines, while the upper wells were filled with 50 μl of cell suspension. The lower and upper wells were separated by a polycarbonate filter (Neuroprobe) with 5-μm pore size. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters were used for assays with neutrophils, PBL, cultured T cells, and T-cell lines, whereas polyvinylpyrrolidone-treated filters were used for assays with monocytes (PBMC) and THP-1. In assays using PBL and cultured T cells, the surface of filters facing the lower wells was precoated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin for 2 h at room temperature and extensively washed with distilled water. Similarly, in assays using T cell lines, the surface of filters facing the lower wells was precoated with 5 μg/ml collagen type IV for 2 h at room temperature and extensively washed with distilled water. Assays were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h with neutrophils, 2 h with PBMC (monocytes) and THP-1, or 4 h with PBL, cultured normal T cells, and established T cell lines (Hut78 and Hut102). Filters were washed, fixed, and stained with Diff-Quick (Harleco, Gibbstown, NJ). The number of migrated cells in five randomly selected high power (× 400) fields was counted. All assays were done in triplicate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) at 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 1% FCS and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, in the dark. Cells were washed three times and resuspended at 1.25 × 106/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% FCS, 50 mmCaCl2, and 50 mm MgCl2. Two ml of cell suspension was placed in a cuvette and set into a luminescence spectrometer (LS50B, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) with constant stirring. Emission fluorescent intensity at the wavelength of 520 nm was measured upon excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm with a time resolution of 2.5 or 5 points/s. Data were presented by the ratio ofF 340 divided by F 380(R 340/380). After each measurement,R 340/380 at the presence and absence of excess calcium was determined by the sequential addition of 10 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and 120 μl of 0.5 m EGTA. This was carried out essentially as described previously (16Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol.

In brief, to produce a soluble fusion protein of SLC with the secreted form of placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) with the carboxyl-terminal histidine tag, the SLC cDNA was amplified by PCR using the 5′-SalI-SLC primer (5′-GCCGTCGACACAGACATGGCTCAGTCACTGGCT-3′) and 3′-SLC-XbaI primer (5′-GCCTCTAGATGGCCCTTTAGGGGTCTGTGACCG-3′), digested withSalI and XbaI, subcloned intoSalI-XbaI sites of the pDREF-SEAP(His)6 vector (16Hieshima K.

After 96 h, the supernatants were centrifuged, filtered (0.45 μm), and stored at 4 °C with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.02% sodium azide. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity was measured by using Great EscApe Detection Kit (CLONTECH) and expressed with relative light units/s. In binding assays, PBL (2 × 105) were incubated with SLC-SEAP (4 × 106 relative light units/s) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of SLC or 200 nm of various chemokines at 16 °C for 1 h in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.02% sodium azide. After washing five times, cells were lysed in 50 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Lysates were heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate cellular phosphatases. After centrifugation, SEAP activity in 25 μl of the lysate was determined by the chemiluminescent assay as described above. All assays were done in duplicate. DNA samples were prepared from a panel of human × rodent somatic cell hybrids containing human monochromosomes (National Institute of General Medical Science Mapping Panel No. 2, version 2, Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ), from 93 radiation hybrids of the GeneBridge 4 Mapping Panel (30Gyapay G.

Genome Digest. 1995; 4: 14-15Google Scholar) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). To determine theSLC gene locus, these DNA samples were analyzed by PCR using SLC primers (+5′-GCCTTGCCACACTCTTTCTC and −5′-CAAGGAAGAGGTGGGGTGTA). The PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel. The SLC product was 218 bp in length. 2The radiation hybrid mapping data were analyzed by accessing the server athttp://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/contig/rhmapper.pl andhttp://www-shgc.stanford.edu/, respectively. Four yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones of a contig containing a chromosome marker AFM326vd1 were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), and their DNAs were prepared as described previously (25Naruse K. Ueno M. Satoh T. Nomiyama H. Tei H. Takeda M. Ledbetter D.H. Van Coillie E. Opdenakker G. Gunge N. Sakaki Y. Iio M. Miura R. Genomics. 1996; 34: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using these DNAs, PCR was carried out with the SLC primers and ELC primers (18Yoshida R. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Baba M. Kitaura M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol.

Furthermore, previously selected bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (Research Genetics) containing the DNA fragments of human chromosome 9p13 3M. Ridanpää, unpublished data. were examined by PCR using the SLC and ELC primers. Primer sequences for AFM326vd1 and the nearby markers were taken from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research/MIT YAC data base. To find new members of the human CC chemokine family, we searched the EST data base (24Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Med. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) with amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences of various CC chemokines as probes. We have found a number of EST sequences derived from a single species of cDNA encoding a novel CC chemokine (GenBankTMaccession numbers W17274, W67885, W84375, W84422, T25128, W67812, AA027314, AA027315, AA149456, and AA151607) (Fig. 1). To determine the full-length cDNA, we carried out the 5′- and 3′-RACE using primers designed from W84422 and human fetal cDNA commercially available for RACE-PCR (CLONTECH) as templates. The 5′-RACE further extended 53 nucleotides beyond the 5′ end of the overlapping ESTs. Sequence comparison of the RACE fragments with the ESTs showed no misincorporation of nucleotides during the RACE-PCR. The full-length cDNA is 852 bp with an open reading frame of 402 bp starting with the first methionine and encoding a polypeptide of 134 amino ac"

https://openalex.org/W2001040684,"The perception of sound is based on signal processing by a bank of frequency-selective auditory filters, the so-called critical bands. Here we investigate how the internal frequency organization of the main auditory midbrain station, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC), might contribute to the generation of the critical-band behaviour of its neurons. We find a unique spatial arrangement of the frequency distribution in the ICC that correlates with psychophysical critical-band characteristics. Systematic frequency discontinuities along the main tonotopic axis, in combination with a smooth frequency gradient orthogonal to the main tonotopic organization of cat ICC, reflect a layering of the frequency organization paralleling its anatomical laminae. This layered frequency organization is characterized by constant frequency ratios of corresponding locations on neighbouring laminae and may provide a spatial framework for the generation of critical bands and for signal processing within and across frequency bands for the analysis of sound."

After incubation with HeLa cells, B-Glyc-KDEL was progressively glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and remained stably associated with this compartment. B-fragment with a nonfunctional KDEL sequence (B-Glyc-KDELGL) was glycosylated with about the same kinetics as B-Glyc-KDEL but localized at steady state to the Golgi apparatus. Morphological studies showed that B-Glyc-KDEL was delivered from the plasma membrane, via endosomes and the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, to the ER. Moreover, the addition of a sulfation site allowed us to show that B-Glyc-KDEL on transit to the ER entered the Golgi apparatus through the trans-Golgi network. Transport of B-Glyc-KDEL to the ER was slowed down by nocodazole, indicating that microtubules are important for the retrograde pathway.

Both biochemical and morphological evidence indicates that these proteins can leave the ER, reach the Golgi apparatus in which they acquire Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications, and be subsequently retrieved to the ER (1Dean N.

Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ER resident membrane proteins can also leave the ER and are retrieved from the Golgi apparatus. This process involves basic residues located at the carboxyl- or amino-terminal ends of the proteins (7Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A.

Golgi resident proteins may also undergo retrograde movement. For instance, the medial Golgi protein MG160 is sialylated, suggesting that it cycles between late Golgi/TGN compartments in which sialylation occurs and medial Golgi (9Johnston P.A. Stieber A. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar).

Other evidence for the existence of a retrograde pathway comes from work on some bacterial toxins that seem to enter the cytosol of higher eukaryotic cells after reaching ER compartments (13Pelham H.R.B. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 183-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Particularly well studied examples are Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriaeand Shiga-like toxins (or verotoxins) from Escherichia coli. These toxins are composed of two polypeptidic chains, one of which (A-fragment) carries a deadenylase activity that inhibits protein biosynthesis by acting on the 28 S rRNA, whereas the other subunit (B-fragment) allows the binding of the toxin to target cells (14O'Brien A.D. Tesh V.L. Donohue-Rolfe A. Jackson M.P. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Lindberg A.A. Keusch G.T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 180: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis has shown that Shiga toxin can be detected in the ER of T47D cells, of butyric acid-treated A431 cells, and of Daudi cells (15Garred O. Dubinina E. Holm P.K.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Shiga toxin does not carry a KDEL motif at its carboxyl terminus, and the mechanism of its retrograde transport is currently unknown. In contrast, retrieval signals are found on cholera toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A (19Chaudhary V.K. Jinno Y. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Majoul I.V. Bastiaens P.I. Soling H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For ricine it has been shown that the addition of a KDEL peptide to the toxin increases its toxicity (21Wales R. Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate further the retrograde transport pathway. For this purpose, we constructed a recombinant B-fragment that was carboxyl-terminally modified by the addition of anN-glycosylation site and the KDEL peptide (B-Glyc-KDEL). We found that a significant part of this chimeric protein was glycosylated after incubation with HeLa cells, indicating that it can be transported to the ER. The presence of the KDEL motif was not critical for retrograde transport per se, but for retention of B-Glyc-KDEL in the ER. A biochemical and morphological analysis allowed us to show that B-Glyc-KDEL passed in a microtubule-dependent fashion from endosomes via the TGN/Golgi apparatus to the ER. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.01% penicillin/streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, and 5 mm pyruvate in a 5% CO2 incubator. Mouse hybridoma cells expressing the monoclonal anti-VT1 antibody 13C4 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1794) and kept in culture according to ATCC instructions. Monoclonal antibody 13C4 was purified from culture medium on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The monoclonal anti-Lamp-2 antibody H4B4 was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego); the monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody H68.4 and the polyclonal antibodies anti-signal sequence receptor and anti-galactosyltransferase were kindly provided by I. Trowbridge (The Salk Institute, San Diego), T. A. Rapoport (Harvard University, Boston), and E. Berger (Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich, Switzerland), respectively. To construct a plasmid expressing B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL, a two-step polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was adopted essentially as described previously (22Johannes L. Lledo P.M. Roa M. Vincent J.D. Henry J.P. Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction primers ShigaC-4 (for B-Glyc-KDEL; 5′-ACTAGCTCTGAAAAGGATGAACTTTGAGAATTCTGACTCAGAATAGCTC-3′) or ShigaC-5 (for B-Glyc-KDELGL; 5′-ACTAGCTCTGAAAAGGATGAACTTGGTCTTTGAGAATTCTGACTCAGAATAGCTC-3′) and ShigaC-3 (5′-CTTTTCAGAGCTAGTAGAATTAGGATGATAGCGGCCGCTACGAAAAATAACTTCGC-3′) were used with plasmid pSU108 (a generous gift from K. N. Timmis, Gesellschaft für biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany; (23Su G.F. Brahmbhatt H.N. Wehland J. Rohde M. Timmis K.N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3345-3359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) specific primers ShigaAtpE (5′-CACTACTACGTTTTAAC-3′) and Shiga-fd (5′-CGGCGCAACTATCGG-3′) to produce fragments that were cloned into the SphI andSalI restriction sites of pSU108. Sequences derived by polymerase chain reaction were verified by dideoxy sequencing (Pharmacia). A pSU108-based plasmid expressing B-Glyc-Sulf-KDEL was constructed essentially as described previously (24Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. Ruther U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15938-15942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sulfation sites encoding 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides Sulfat5 (5′-GAGGAACCTGAGTATGGAGAA-3′) and Sulfat6 (5′-CCTTTCTCCATACTCAGGTTC-3′) were hybridized and ligated at 16 °C for 8 h. Adaptor fragments containing the N-glycosylation site and the KDEL sequence, composed of oligonucleotides Sulfat1 (5′-phosphorylated; 5′-GGCCGCCATCCTAATTCTACTTCT-3′) and Sulfat2 (5′-CTCAGAAGTAGAATTAGGATGGC-3′), or of Sulfat3 (5′-GAGTCTGAAAAAGATGAACTTTGATGAG-3′) and Sulfat4 (5′-phosphorylated; 5′-AATTCTCATCAAAGTTCATCTTTTTCAGA-3′) were ligated overnight at 16 °C. The resulting fragment was cloned into the NotI and EcoRI restriction sites of pSU108 containing the cDNA coding for B-Glyc-KDEL (see above). Oligonuclotide-derived sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing (Pharmacia). Purification of recombinant B-fragments was essentially done as described (23Su G.F. Brahmbhatt H.N. Wehland J. Rohde M. Timmis K.N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3345-3359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After preparation of periplasmic extracts, these were loaded on a QFF column (Pharmacia) and eluted by a linear NaCl gradient in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5. Depending on the construction, recombinant B-fragments eluted between 120 and 400 mm. B-fragment-containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, reloaded on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia), and eluted as before. The resulting proteins, estimated to be 95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were stored at −80 °C until use. For iodination, 25 μg (for B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL) or 100 μg (for B-fragment) of purified protein in elution buffer was treated with 200 μCi (B-fragment) or 500 μCi (B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL) iodine (16.9 mCi/μg, Amersham Corp.) on a single IODO-BEAD (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were labeled to specific activities of about 500 cpm/ng (B-fragment) or 5,000 cpm/ng (B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL). Incorporated label was removed on PD10 gel filtration columns (Pharmacia). For metabolic sulfate labeling 4 × 105 HeLa cells were kept at 37 °C for 1 h in minimal essential medium without sulfate. After binding of B-Glyc-Sulf-KDEL to cells (see below), cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in sulfate-free Hanks' balanced saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate (1,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). After labeling, cells were either placed on ice for direct immunoprecipitation or rinsed three times with chase medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) before being incubated for 8 h in chase medium, followed by immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, mixture of protease inhibitors containing leupeptine, chymostatin, pepstatin, antipain, and aprotinin in PBS). B-Glyc-Sulf-KDEL was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 13C4 and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, boiled in sample buffer, and analyzed as described below. 1 × 105 cells were placed on ice and washed once with ice-cold PBS. The indicated concentrations of recombinant B-fragments (for Scatchard analysis, concentrations from 0.05 to 2 μm; for most other experiments, 50 nm) were added in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 90 min (for Scatchard analysis, incubation in presence of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) or 45 min on ice, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. For Scatchard analysis, cells were lysed in 0.1 m KOH. Cell-associated radioactivity and radioactivity in the culture medium and wash solutions were counted, and binding data were obtained as published (25Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17806) Google Scholar). Iodinated B-Glyc-KDEL or B-Glyc-KDELGL was bound to 1 × 105 HeLa cells as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Samples were run on 10–20% polyacrylamide-SDS gradient gels, analyzed by autoradiography, and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant software. In each experiment, the percentage of glycosylated protein was determined. The treatment with endoglycosidase H and peptideN-glycosidase F was done as described previously (26Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salaméro J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In some experiments, internalization of modified B-fragments was performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (added 1 h before the B-fragments) or 1 mm DMM (Boehringer Mannheim). 60 μg of recombinant B-fragments in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, were added to 250 mmNaHCO3 and a 10-fold molar excess of DTAF (Sigma) and incubated by end-over-end rotation for 30 min at room temperature. 0.2 mm NH4Cl was added, and coupled protein was purified on PD10 columns. 0.7 × 105 HeLa cells, grown on 12-mm round glass coverslips, were incubated with 1 μg/ml DTAF-labeled recombinant B-fragments as described above. After the indicated internalization periods, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with saponin, stained with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies, and mounted, as described previously (26Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salaméro J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis were performed using a TCS4D confocal microscope based on a DM microscope interfaced with an argon/krypton laser. Simultaneous double fluorescence acquisitions were performed using the 488 nm and the 568 nm laser lines to excite fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red dyes using a 63 × oil immersion Neofluar objective (NA = 1.4). The fluorescence was selected with appropriate double fluorescence dichroic mirror and band pass filters and measured with blue-green-sensitive and red side-sensitive one photomultipliers. B-Glyc-KDEL binding was performed on HeLa cells grown on 50-cm2 round tissue culture plates (1 × 107 cells), as described above. Cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C as indicated, fixed in the culture dishes by adding to the medium an equivalent volume of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 1 h, and then further fixed with a fresh 2% paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1 sodium phosphate buffer for 1 more hour. Cells were collected by careful scraping and processed for cryosectioning according to Kleijmeer et al. (27Kleijmeer M.J. Raposo G. Geuze H.J. Methods: Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1996; 10: 191-207Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cryosections were retrieved with a 1/1 solution of 2.3 m sucrose and 2% methyl cellulose according to Liou et al. (28Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling with the monoclonal antibody 13C4 (diluted 1/250) was performed with a rabbit anti-mouse linker antibody (Dako) and protein-A gold conjugate (purchased from Dr. J. W. Slot, Utrecht University). Double labeling experiments were performed as described previously (29Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) using the rabbit polyclonal anti-galactosyltransferase antibody (O14 affinity-purified serum, diluted 1/100) as first primary antibody and 13C4 as the second one, diluted 1/250. Bacterial Shiga toxin is composed of two polypeptidic chains, termed A-fragment and B-fragment (14O'Brien A.D. Tesh V.L. Donohue-Rolfe A. Jackson M.P. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Lindberg A.A. Keusch G.T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 180: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the whole toxin as well as isolated B-fragment are transported from the plasma membrane to the ER of toxin sensitive cells (15Garred O. Dubinina E. Holm P.K. Olsnes S. van Deurs B. Kozlov J.V. Sandvig K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Khine A.A. Lingwood C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Sandvig K. Garred O. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 18Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred O. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To quantify this transport by monitoring the appearance of Shiga toxin B-fragment in the ER, anN-glycosylation site was added to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 1 A). The carboxyl terminus of B-fragment was chosen since it sticks out of the globular conformation of the protein (30Fraser M.E. Chernaia M.M. Kozlov Y.V. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Stein P.E. Boodhoo A. Tyrrell G.J. Brunton J.L. Read R.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation starts in the ER by the addition of a core oligosaccharyl group from membrane-bound dolichol to an Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr acceptor sequence on newly synthesized proteins (32Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Further modifications ofN-linked oligosaccharides occur only if this basic sugar backbone is present. B-fragment does not carry a KDEL motif (33Kozlov Yu V. Kabishev A.A. Lukyanov E.V. Bayev A.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Seidah N.G.

O'Brien A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to favor its retention in the ER, the KDEL peptide was appended to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig. 1 A). We also constructed a recombinant B-fragment carrying the KDELGL peptide (Fig. 1 A), which was previously found to be inactive with respect to KDEL-receptor interaction (6Miesenbock G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We will refer in this study to the recombinant B-fragments as B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL (“B” for B-fragment, “Glyc” for N-glycosylation site, and “KDEL” or “KDELGL” for KDEL or KDELGL peptides). It has been shown previously that Shiga toxin binds to the glycolipid Gb3, which is expressed by toxin-sensitive cells (36Lingwood C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) such as HeLa cells. To test whether the carboxyl-terminal modifications made on the B-fragment influenced its interaction with cells, we first compared binding to and internalization into HeLa cells of B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL with that of the wild type B-fragment. Recombinant B-fragments were purified from E. coli and iodinatedin vitro (see “Materials and Methods”). Unlabeled wild type B-fragment and B-Glyc-KDEL competed equally well with radiolabeled B-Glyc-KDEL for binding to HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Half-maximal competition was observed at 300 nm cold competitor protein. Scatchard analysis showed that the binding constants of wild type B-fragment, of B-Gly-KDEL, and of B-Gly-KDELGL were comparable (Table I). We calculated that 1–2 × 106 binding sites were present per HeLa cell (Table I), in good agreement with the literature (37Eiklid K. Olsnes S. J. Recept. Res. 1980; 1: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All three proteins were also found to be equally well internalized into HeLa cells (not shown). Altogether, the results indicated that the modifications of the carboxyl terminus of B-fragment did not significantly change its binding and uptake properties.Table IScatchard analysis of binding of iodinated wild type B-fragment and B-Glyc-KDEL to HeLa cellsConstructionK DBinding sites (×106/cell)nmB-fragment250 (±17; n= 2)1.5 (±0.1; n = 2)B-Glyc-KDEL100 (±5;n = 3)1.2 (±0.3; n = 3)B-Glyc-KDELGL238 (±12; n = 3)1.9 (±0.1;n = 3) Open table in a new tab Iodinated B-Glyc-KDEL or B-Glyc-KDELGL were first bound for 45 min to HeLa cells on ice. After binding, the cells were incubated for various lengths of time at 37 °C (Fig. 3 A). At the end of each incubation period, cells were lysed, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At time 0 (45 min of binding on ice), single fragments migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 9.5 kDa and corresponding to the expected size of B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL were observed (Fig. 3 A). B-Glyc-KDEL migrated slightly faster than B-Glyc-KDELGL (Fig.3 A), consistent with the fact that B-Glyc-KDELGL is two amino acids longer than B-Glyc-KDEL. Internalization of B-Glyc-KDEL led to the appearance of further bands (Fig. 3 A,left). After 1, 2, or 4 h, one species (Fig.3 A, triangle) and after 15 h, two species (Fig. 3 A, triangle and asterisk) with a lower electrophoretic mobility than the original B-Glyc-KDEL were observed. As shown in Fig. 3 B, their appearance was strongly inhibited by treatment of cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor ofN-glycosylation. In addition, these bands were lost after treatment of samples with endoglycosidase H or peptideN-glycosidase F, two N-glycosylation-specific glycosidases (Fig. 3 B). These observations suggest that the upper bands represent N-glycosylated B-Glyc-KDEL. The fact that they remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive indicated that B-Glyc-KDEL reached the ER and then stayed associated with it. The appearance of the second species of N-glycosylated B-Glyc-KDEL (Fig. 3 A, asterisk) was inhibited by DMM (Fig. 3 C), an inhibitor of mannosidase I, indicating that this species resulted from the trimming of the primary glycosylation product of B-Glyc-KDEL (Fig. 3 A,triangle) by cis-Golgi-specific mannosidase activity. B-Glyc-KDEL thus cycles between ER and cis-Golgi compartments, as described for other resident ER proteins (1Dean N. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Pelham H.R. Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1757-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The same results on glycosylation of B-Glyc-KDEL were obtained in A431 cells and Vero cells (not shown). The incubation of HeLa cells with B-Glyc-KDELGL gave a different pattern. Multiple bands with a lower electrophoretic mobility than unmodified B-Glyc-KDELGL were observed, giving the appearance of a smear (Fig. 3 A, open bracket). Some of them were found to be endoglycosidase H-resistant (not shown). In addition, the appearance of the upper bands was inhibited by DMM (Fig.3 C). These observations suggest that B-Glyc-KDELGL was also transported to the ER in HeLa cells where it was glycosylated. In contrast to B-Glyc-KDEL, B-Glyc-KDELGL seemed to be able to move in the anterograde direction up to cis/medial Golgi and acquire complex carbohydrates (endoglycosidase H resistance). The unequal behavior of B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL was also observed in morphological studies (see below). In addition to slower migrating glycosylation products, faster migrating bands were observed after incubation of B-Glyc-KDEL or B-Glyc-KDELGL with cells (Fig. 3 A, circles). These proteins were insensitive to tunicamycin, endoglycosidase H, and peptide N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 3 B) and could represent degradation products. In this respect, it is interesting to note that even after 15 h of incubation in cells, less than 3% of internalized B-Glyc-KDEL and B-Glyc-KDELGL became trichloroacetic acid-soluble (not shown). This indicates that if the lower bands are degradation products, these remain stably associated with cells. To quantify the arrival of modified B-fragments in the ER, autoradiographs were scanned using a PhosphorImager (Fig.3 D). To allow an accurate quantification of the glycosylated bands, especially for B-Glyc-KDELGL, internalization of modified B-fragments was performed in the presence of DMM. Glycosylation of B-Glyc-KDEL increased linearly with incubation time and reached 22% of the total cell-associated protein after a 15-h incubation (Fig.3 D). Similar results were obtained for cells incubated without DMM (not shown). Interestingly, glycosylation of B-Glyc-KDELGL was only slightly less efficient than that of B-Glyc-KDEL (Fig.3 D). In addition, the kinetics of glycosylation was not markedly modified. This indicates that the functional KDEL motif is important for the retention of the protein within the ER but not for its retrograde transport. To characterize the intracellular pathway followed by B-Glyc-KDEL or B-Glyc-KDELGL from the plasma membrane to the ER, recombinant proteins were covalently linked to the fluorophore DTAF. After 15 min at 37 °C, the bulk of B-Glyc-KDEL was found associated with the plasma membrane and endosomes, as shown by its colocalization with the transferrin receptor (Fig. 4,A and B). After 45 min, the protein became detectable in the Golgi apparatus where it colocalized with Rab6, a GTPase associated with Golgi and TGN membranes (38Goud B. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 39Antony C. Cibert C. Geraud G. Santa Maria A. Maro B. Mayau V. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 785-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4,C and D). After 4 h at 37 °C, B-Glyc-KDEL displayed a typical ER staining and colocalized with the signal sequence receptor protein (Fig. 4, E andF). In contrast to B-Glyc-KDEL, B-Glyc-KDELGL was mainly localized in the Golgi region after incubation of cells for 1 h, 4 h (not shown), or 15 h at 37 °C (Fig. 4, G andH). The same result was obtained for DTAF-labeled wild type B-fragment (not shown), which is in good agreement with previously published experiments on B-fragment transport to the Golgi apparatus (40Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, a fraction of B-Glyc-KDELGL was present in the ER, as documented by colocalization with signal sequence receptor protein (Fig. 4, G and H). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that B-Glyc-KDELGL is transported to the ER and that the protein can then move in the anterograde direction up to the Golgi apparatus (see above; Fig. 3 A). In agreement with the literature, we noticed that the intensity of B-Glyc-KDEL labeling showed some heterogeneity from cell to cell in the same population (17Sandvig K. Garred O. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 18Sandvig K. Ryd M. Garred O. Schweda E. Holm P.K. van"
https://openalex.org/W2011936496,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are involved in many cellular processes. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a new MAP kinase, p38-2. p38-2 belongs to the p38 subfamily of MAP kinases and shares with it the TGY phosphorylation motif. The complete p38-2 cDNA was isolated by polymerase chain reaction. It encodes a 364-amino acid protein with 73% identity to p38. Two shorter isoforms missing the phosphorylation motif were identified. Analysis of various tissues demonstrated that p38-2 is differently expressed from p38. Highest expression levels were found in heart and skeletal muscle. Like p38, p38-2 is activated by stress-inducing signals and proinflammatory cytokines. The preferred upstream kinase is MEK6. Although p38-2 and p38 phosphorylate the same substrates, the site specificity of phosphorylation can differ as shown by two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis of Sap-1a. Additionally, kinetic studies showed that p38-2 appears to be about 180 times more active than p38 on certain substrates such as ATF2. Both kinases are inhibited by a class of pyridinyl imidazoles. p38-2 phosphorylation of ATF2 and Sap-1a but not Elk1 results in increased transcriptional activity of these factors. A sequential kinetic mechanism of p38-2 is suggested by steady state kinetic analysis. In conclusion, p38-2 may be an important component of the stress response required for the homeostasis of a cell. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are involved in many cellular processes.

Additionally, kinetic studies showed that p38-2 appears to be about 180 times more active than p38 on certain substrates such as ATF2. Both kinases are inhibited by a class of pyridinyl imidazoles. p38-2 phosphorylation of ATF2 and Sap-1a but not Elk1 results in increased transcriptional activity of these factors. A sequential kinetic mechanism of p38-2 is suggested by steady state kinetic analysis. In conclusion, p38-2 may be an important component of the stress response required for the homeostasis of a cell.

The members of the MAPK family are proline-directed Ser/Thr kinases which themselves are activated upon phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr by dual specificity protein kinases, the MAPK kinases (MAPKKs). Specific protein kinase cascades (MAPKKK→ MAPKK→MAPK) constituted within the cytoplasm are stimulated by a variety of signals including growth factors, cytokines, ultraviolet light (UV), and other stress-inducing agents. Since these signals can affect cell proliferation, oncogenesis, development as well as differentiation, and the cell cycle, MAPKs may have a pivotal impact on these cellular processes. The p38MAPK (cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug binding protein; CSBP1/2) was identified by homology to the yeast HOG1 MAPK and is activated by osmotic shock (10Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L.

In an attempt to find novel members of the p38MAPK cascade, we cloned and characterized a new human MAPK, which we named p38-2. Analysis of various tissues demonstrated that p38-2 is differently expressed from p38. Like p38, p38-2 is activated by stress-inducing signals and cytokines. We show that MEK6 phosphorylates p38-2, suggesting its role as a specific MAPKK. Although p38-2 and p38 phosphorylate the same substrates, the site specificity of phosphorylation can differ, and p38-2 appears to be about 180 times more active on certain substrates such as ATF2. The expressed sequence tags (EST) subdivision of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank data base was searched with the tblastn program and the human p38 (CSBP) amino acid sequence as query. The 154-bp EST sequence R72598from a human breast cDNA library displayed the highest similarity score. A forward PCR primer (5′-GCGCCAGGCGGACGAGGAGATGACC-3′) directed against the 3′ end of this sequence was designed with the help of the program Oligo version 4.0 (National Biosciences, Inc.). This gene-specific forward primer and the adaptor-specific primer from the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) were used to PCR-amplify the 3′ portion of p38-2 from a skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH). PCR amplification was performed with a combination of Taq and Pwopolymerases (Expand Long Template PCR System, Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH). All PCR amplifications were carried out in 0.2 ml of Perkin-Elmer thin wall MicroAmp tubes and a Perkin-Elmer model 2400 or 9600 thermocycler. The resulting 800-bp PCR fragment was ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced (dye terminator cycle sequencing) with an ABI 373 Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We also sequenced the original R72598 clone. This clone had a 900-bp insert encoding the 5′ end of p38-2. We recombined the cDNA insert of R72598 and the 3′ end of one of the p38-2 clones by restriction digest using a uniqueKpnI site. The resulting 1.5-kb cDNA was ligated into 3xHA-BKS and its sequence determined. The BLAST program was used to search the NCBI GenBank data base for related cDNAs. The Bestfit program from the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI, was used for calculating the amino acid identities between p38 and p38-2. The MacVector program (Oxford Molecular Group) was used for aligning the sequences of p38 and p38-2. 3xHA-p38-2-SRα3 was constructed by replacing serine in position 2 of p38-2 with alanine, adding sequence encoding three copies of a 10-amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope to the N terminus of p38-2 and ligating the resulting cDNA into SRα3. GST-p38-2 was constructed by ligating a 1.1-kb DNA fragment encoding amino acid 1 through the stop codon of p38-2 with a serine to alanine substitution in position 2 into pGEX-KG (34Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). 3xHA-MEK6(DD)-SRα3 was constructed by PCR mutagenesis of the wild type MEK6 expression vector (29Stein B.

Northern blots were performed using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 16 different adult human tissues, fractionated by denaturing formaldehyde 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a charge-modified nylon membrane (CLONTECH). The blots were hybridized to a p38 probe (850-bp CSBP2 cDNA fragment), p38-2 probe (900-bp p38-2 cDNA fragment), or p38-2 intron probe (oligonucleotide against first intron) using ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both cDNA probes were prepared by random prime labeling (Prime It II, Stratagene) of the cDNA with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products). For control purposes the blots were also hybridized to a radiolabeled β-actin probe. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 500 mg/liter l-glutamine, and antibiotics. HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.); COS cells were transfected using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.); and 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (51Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later cells were treated with stimulators of MAPK for 45 min unless otherwise indicated and then solubilized in kinase lysis buffer as described (35Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of lysates was determined by Bradford assay (52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). HA-tagged proteins were isolated from transfected cells with an anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). 293 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with the SRE2-tk80-luc luciferase reporter gene construct and either the empty expression vector pEV3S or the respective expression vector for Elk1 or Sap-1a as well as the indicated protein kinase vectors. Luciferase activity was determined 36 h after transfection and normalized to transfection efficiency with the help of a cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector (38Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the 5×GAL4-luc reporter gene construct and either the empty expression vector pAG147 or GAL4-ATF219–96 as well as the indicated kinase vectors. Expression of bacterial GST-fusion proteins and purification by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was performed as described previously (46Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed as described previously (29Stein B. Brady H. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11427-11433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylated GST-fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film, and a gel slice containing the phosphorylated GST-fusion protein was cut out. The protein was extracted from the gel slice as described (53van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 422-448Crossref Google Scholar). After digestion with chymotrypsin, the resulting phosphopeptides were resolved on cellulose thin layer plates by electrophoresis in the first dimension in pH 1.9 buffer (88% w/v formic acid/glacial acetic acid/water, 50:156:1794) and by ascending chromatography in 1-butanol/pyridine/glacial acetic acid/water (15:10:3:12) in the second dimension (53van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 422-448Crossref Google Scholar). The p38-2 reaction velocities were determined by quantifying the amount of 32P incorporation into GST-ATF2. GST-p38-2 activity was monitored as a function of both GST-ATF2 concentration (0.31, 0.62, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μm) and ATP concentration (0.05, 0.5, 2.5, and 5.0 μm). Enzymatic reactions (0.1 ml) were carried out in wells of a 96-well assay plate (Corning) for 1 h at room temperature and terminated with the addition of trichloroacetic acid (150 μl/well of 12.5% w/v). The subsequent 20-min incubation with trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C precipitated the proteins from solution. The trichloroacetic acid-mediated precipitate was then collected on 96-well glass fiber plates (Packard) and washed 10 × with approximately 0.3 ml per well of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, using a Packard Filtermate 196. Scintillation fluid (0.05 ml, MicroScint, Packard) was added to each well, and the plate was analyzed for 32P using a Packard TopCount scintillation counter. Reactions contained 20 μl of recombinant p38-2 (0.25 μg/ml in a dilution buffer that contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.004% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate), 25 μl of ATP solution (in distilled, deionized water), 18 μl of recombinant GST-ATF2 (in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100), and 37 μl of a kinase buffer that delivered 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) per reaction (in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol). A typical control reaction in the absence of GST-ATF2 that contained 722,808 cpm would result in a background of 584 cpm. The 32P-labeled GST-ATF2 typically ranged from 15,712 to 84,410 cpm which was significantly greater than the background and ensured accurate velocity values. Double reciprocal analysis was used to assess the kinetic mechanism. The data were fit to the equation for a sequential mechanism by nonlinear least squares method of Cleland (54Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar) to obtain kinetic constants. The assay for p38-2 activity was a discontinuous assay with data taken after 1 h of room temperature reaction. The reaction time course of p38-2 was found to be linear up to and including 1 h of kinase reaction for the conditions used in the kinetic experiments. There is a linear relationship between enzyme activity and enzyme concentration for p38-2 concentrations from 6.1 to 49 nm. Less than 10% ATP was turned over in the course of the assay. The apparent kinetic constants for recombinant p38 and p38-2 were determined by the assay method described in the previous section. Data were taken in the linear portion of the reaction time course. Less than 10% ATP was turned over by p38 in the course of the assay. The final concentrations of GST-p38 and GST-p38-2 were 25 and 0.075 mg/ml, respectively. The GST-ATF2 concentration was varied (0.156, 0.313, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.50 μm). A common solution of GST-ATF2 was used for both p38 and p38-2 reactions. The ATP concentration in the kinase buffer was held constant at 15 μm. Reactions were initiated with the addition of a common kinase buffer that delivered 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (15 μm). After 1 h at room temperature, reactions (0.1 ml) were terminated and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 150 μl of 12.5% trichloroacetic acid (20 min incubation at 4 °C). Kinetic constants were derived from a nonlinear least squares fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation in the manner outlined by Cleland (54Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). We performed BLAST homology searches of the EST subdivision of NCBI GenBank data bank to identify EST sequences that encode peptides related to human p38MAPK(CSBP). A 154-bp EST fragment with the accession number R72598 that encoded a peptide related to p38 was identified. The corresponding cDNA clone was obtained from Research Genetics (clone ID 156272) and its sequence determined. The 900-bp cDNA fragment contained the putative 5′ end of a novel gene. Although the cDNA fragment had an in-frame stop codon, the region before and after this stop codon encoded peptides with significant homology to p38. A forward PCR primer was designed to amplify the missing 3′ portion of the potential new gene from an adapter-ligated skeletal muscle cDNA library. A population of PCR fragments was obtained and subcloned into pGEM-T. Sequencing revealed several identical PCR clones with open reading frames followed by a stretch of about a 300-bp untranslated region and a poly(A)-tail. We combined the cDNA insert of R72598with one of the PCR clones to obtain a cDNA of maximum length. A GenBank BLAST search revealed no identical sequences to this cDNA, and we named the respective gene p38-2, based on its similarity to p38. Closer inspection of the sequence surrounding the internal stop codon and alignment of the encoded peptide with p38 revealed an 86-bp intron 2The intron 1 sequence is GTGAGCGGCGGGCGGGCGAGGCAGCGGGAGCGCGTTCGCGGTGGGGCGGTGGGGCCCTGTCCTGACCCCCTGACCCCGCCCCAG. with typical splice junction consensus sequences. This suggests that the poly(A)+selected mRNA preparation used for creation of the cDNA library contained unspliced mRNA. Therefore, we reamplified the intron area from a different skeletal muscle cDNA library. About 50% of the PCR clones had no intron, and about 25% had the previously described intron at amino acid position 102/103, and 25% had a different intron 3The intron 2 sequence is GTAGGTGCGACCGCAGGGTGAGGGTCGGGTCCAGCAGGGCTCCGTCCCAGCCTCCTGTGCTCACGCTCCGCGTGACCTGCAG. at amino acid position 149/150. From these data we conclude that p38-2 potentially exists in several isoforms. The 1.3-kb cDNA without introns encodes a protein of 364 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 41.3 kDa, and the cDNAs with intron 1 or intron 2 encode shorter proteins of 102 and 155 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Both shorter isoforms are missing the phosphorylation motif. p38-2 has 73% amino acid identity and 86% similarity with its closest homologue, p38. p38-2 is a member of the p38 subgroup of MAPK.

Here we show using BIAcore™, a solution binding assay, and GTP hydrolysis and exchange assays, with yeast proteins, that karyopherin β and RanGTP are recycled efficiently in a reaction that involves karyopherin α, RanBP1, RanGAP, and the C terminus of the nucleoporin Nup1. We find that karyopherin α first releases RanGTP from karyopherin β in a reaction that does not require GTP hydrolysis. The released RanGTP is then sequestered by RanBP1, and the newly formed karyopherin αβ binds to the C terminus of Nup1. Finally, RanGTP is converted to RanGDP via nucleotide hydrolysis when RanGAP is present. Conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP can also occur via nucleotide exchange in the presence of RanGEF, an excess of GDP, and if RanBP1 is absent.

However, dissociation of RanGTP-karyopherin β is crucial to recycle both factors for another round of function.We show here that the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex is disassembled in the presence of karyopherin α, the C terminus of Nup1 (C-Nup1), RanGAP, and RanBP1. A detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism revealed that karyopherin β is first released from RanGTP by karyopherin α, followed by conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP in the presence of RanGAP and RanBP1. Interaction of RanBP1 with RanGTP not only stimulates GTP hydrolysis in the presence of RanGAP but also prevents reformation of the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex in the presence of C-Nup1 and karyopherin α. C-Nup1 sequesters the released karyopherin β by forming a C-Nup1-karyopherin αβ complex. Formation of this ternary complex makes rebinding of karyopherin β to RanGTP less favorable. Nup36 and a fragment containing the FXFG repeat region of Nup1 function in the disassembly reaction as well, although with lower activity than C-Nup1.RESULTSWe previously showed that RanGTP forms a complex with karyopherin β (1Floer M.

Estimates from the inhibition of RanGAP by karyopherin β indicate an affinity below 1 nm for the RanGTP-karyopherin β interaction 2M. Floer and G. Blobel, unpublished data.

Here we investigated the disassembly of the yeast RanGTP-karyopherin β complex and its regulation by transport factors and nucleoporins. As RanGAP is synthetically lethal with the C terminus of the nucleoporin Nup1 (45Bogerd A.M. Hoffman J.A. Amberg D.C. Fink G.R. Davis L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and with karyopherin β (46Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the C terminus of Nup1 and RanGAP are involved in the disassembly of the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex.Karyopherin β binds to the C terminus of Nup1 (C-Nup1) (AA 963–1076) (Fig. 1, lane 1) and is released in the presence of RanGTP (lanes 2 and 3) but not RanGDP (lanes 4 and 5). This indicates that complex formation of RanGTP with karyopherin β abolishes the interaction of karyopherin β with C-Nup1. Neither RanGDP nor RanGTP bound to C-Nup1 (not shown). Preincubation of karyopherin β with RanGTP for 15 min at 4 °C also abolished binding of karyopherin β to C-Nup1 (Fig.2 A, compare lane 1 to lane 2). We used this observation as an assay to detect disassembly of the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex in the presence of different transport factors. Addition of RanGAP to karyopherin β and RanGTP that had been preincubated did not stimulate disassembly of the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex as judged by the inability of karyopherin β to bind to C-Nup1 (lane 3). However, addition of karyopherin α led to binding of some karyopherin β to C-Nup1 (lane 4). Karyopherin α bound directly to C-Nup1 in the absence of karyopherin β (not shown). The binding of karyopherin α to C-Nup1 will be discussed elsewhere. 3M. Rexach, and G. Blobel, submitted for publication.Most importantly, when karyopherin α and RanGAP were added together, karyopherin β binding to C-Nup1 was restored (lane 5). These results indicate that the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex is disrupted in the presence of karyopherin α, C-Nup1, and RanGAP and that RanGTP is converted to RanGDP through GTP hydrolysis stimulated by RanGAP.Figure 2The RanGTP-karyopherin β (Kap95) complex is disassembled in the presence of karyopherin α (Kap60), RanGAP, and the C terminus of Nup1 (C-Nup1). A, immobilized GST-C-Nup1 (2 μg per 10 μl of packed beads) was incubated with 0.6 μg of Kap95 (lane 1) or 0.6 μg of Kap95 that had been preincubated with 1 μg of RanGTP for 15 min at 4 °C (lanes 2–5). RanGTP was prepared as described (2Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Reactions also contained 1 μg of RanGAP (lanes 3 and 5) and 0.6 μg of Kap60 (lanes 4 and 5). Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 21 °C and then for 15 min at 4 °C. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. B, GTP hydrolysis assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 15 nmRan-[γ-32P]GTP was preincubated with 25 nmKap95 for 10 min at 21 °C. Then 10 nm RanGAP, 1 μm Kap60, and increasing amounts of C-Nup1 were added. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 21 °C. The extent of GTP hydrolysis was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP occurred, we measured GTP hydrolysis. RanGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran was completely inhibited in the presence of karyopherin β (not shown) (1Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, addition of 1 μm karyopherin α and 10 nmRanGAP to a mixture of 15 nm RanGTP and 25 nmkaryopherin β that had been preincubated resulted in 25% GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 2 B). If 200 nm C-Nup1 was added to this reaction, 70% of the Ran-bound GTP was hydrolyzed, and if 1 μm C-Nup1 was added, 80% of the Ran-bound GTP was hydrolyzed. These results demonstrate that in the presence of karyopherin α RanGAP stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Ran that was bound to karyopherin β and that this reaction is stimulated by C-Nup1.As the C-Nup1-stimulated conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP was only 80%, we investigated whether RanBP1 could complete the reaction, as RanBP1 binds to RanGTP (40Coutavas E.

Addition of RanBP1 and RanGAP to a mixture of RanGTP and karyopherin β that had been preincubated did not promote GTP hydrolysis (not shown). However, when RanBP1 and RanGAP were added together with karyopherin α and C-Nup1, GTP hydrolysis was greatly stimulated (Fig. 3). In a control reaction that contained 15 nm RanGTP and 25 nm karyopherin β that had been preincubated, 10 nm RanGAP, 100 nm karyopherin α, and 100 nm C-Nup1, 22% of the Ran-bound GTP was hydrolyzed (Fig. 3, closed symbols). When 50 nm RanBP1 was added, 80% of the Ran-bound GTP was hydrolyzed, and when 100 nm RanBP1 was added, 95% of the Ran-bound GTP was hydrolyzed. Noticeably, the concentration of RanGAP required was lower in the presence of RanBP1 (open symbols); this is consistent with previous findings on RanBP1 function in the absence of karyopherin β (41Schlenstedt G.

These results demonstrate that RanGTP-karyopherin β complex is fully disassembled in a reaction that requires karyopherin α and is stimulated by RanGAP, RanBP1, and the C terminus of Nup1.Figure 9Nup36 stimulates GTP hydrolysis in the presence of RanGAP.

The extent of GTP hydrolysis was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if RanGAP is essential for the disassembly reaction, we tested whether the nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, RanGEF, could replace RanGAP. RanGEF stimulates exchange of GDP and GTP on Ran with equal efficiency (48Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Due to the higher concentration of GTP in the cell (49Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), it is generally assumed that RanGEF exchanges Ran-bound GDP for GTP in vivo (48Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, RanGEF can exchange Ran-bound GTP for GDP in vitro if an excess of GDP is provided (48Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although recombinant RanGEF stimulated nucleotide exchange on Ran (not shown), it was incapable of stimulating exchange when RanGTP was bound to karyopherin β (Fig.4 A) (39Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). However, exchange of Ran-bound GTP occurred when 10 nm RanGEF, 200 μm GDP, 200 μm GTP, and increasing amounts of karyopherin α and C-Nup1 were added to 15 nm RanGTP and 25 nmkaryopherin β that had been preincubated (Fig. 4 A). GTP exchange reached 80% in the presence of 1 μm karyopherin α and 1 μm C-Nup1. Addition of C-Nup1 in the absence of karyopherin α did not result in GTP exchange, whereas addition of 1 μm karyopherin α in the absence of C-Nup1 promoted exchange of 25% of the Ran-bound GTP (not shown). We also tested the effect of RanBP1 on this reaction. 50 nm RanBP1 inhibited exchange of Ran-bound GTP when added to a reaction that contained 10 nm RanGEF, 200 μm GDP, 200 μmGTP, 1 μm karyopherin α, 1 μm C-Nup1, and 15 nm RanGTP and 25 nm karyopherin β that had been preincubated (Fig. 4 B). This result is consistent with previous reports on the inhibitory effect of RanBP1 on the exchange of Ran-bound GTP when karyopherin β is absent (43Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 551-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 47Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H.

The extent of GTP exchange was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze further the effect of RanGEF and RanBP1 on the disassembly of RanGTP-karyopherin β complex, we carried out solution binding assays similar to those described in Fig. 2 A. As expected, RanGEF could replace RanGAP (Fig. 5 A) when an excess of GDP (lane 4), but not GTP (lane 5), was present in addition to karyopherin α and C-Nup1. Karyopherin α was required, as RanGEF and GDP alone did not promote karyopherin β binding to C-Nup1 (lane 6). This result suggests that RanGTP is accessible to RanGAP, or RanGEF, after the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex is disassembled by the combined action of karyopherin α and C-Nup1. Surprisingly, RanGEF bound to the C terminus of Nup1 (lanes 4–7); we are currently investigating the significance of this interaction. We then tested whether inhibition of RanGEF function by RanBP1 had an effect on RanGTP-karyopherin β disassembly. Unexpectedly, disassembly occurred even in the presence of RanBP1 (compare lane 7 to lane 4). This surprising result suggests that RanBP1 can directly stimulate disassembly of the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex in the presence of karyopherin α and C-Nup1. Indeed RanBP1 stimulated disassembly in the presence of karyopherin α and C-Nup1 (Fig. 5 B, lane 4) but not in the absence of karyopherin α (lane 5). Thus karyopherin α is required to disrupt the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex in the presence of RanBP1 and C-Nup1. Neither RanBP1 nor RanGTP bound to the karyopherin αβ-C-Nup1 complex (not shown). These results suggest that RanBP1 stimulates disassembly of the RanGTP-karyopherin β complex by preventing reformation of the complex after it has been disassembled in the presence of karyopherin α and C-Nup1. RanBP1 may accomplish this task by sequestering RanGTP that had been released from karyopherin β, since RanBP1 binds RanGTP (not shown) (40Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G.

Moreover, decreased expression of the GlcNAcβ(1,6)Man branch has been correlated with decreased metastatic potential (23Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S.

The transformation of baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts by thesrc oncogene causes an increase in N-linked oligosaccharide (GlcNAcβ(1,6)Man) branching, and the mechanism by which this increase occurs has been under investigation in our laboratories. To elucidate this mechanism, we examined GlcNAc-T V enzyme activity and mRNA levels in BHK cells and their Rous sarcoma virus-transformed counterparts (RSV-BHK) in the presence of the Src kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A. The results from these experiments led us to examine the 5′ region of the human gene encoding GlcNAc-T V and its increased expression caused by Src activity. Our results indicate that the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V gene can be transcriptionally activated by Src tyrosine kinase activity, and this control is dependent on both the Raf-1 kinase and an Ets family transcriptional activator. Cells were grown to confluency and harvested in 50 mm MES 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and lysed by addition of Trition X-100 to 1%. Lysates were assayed according to the method of Palcic et al. (22Palcic M.M.

Briefly, 106 cpm of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (25 cpm/pmol) and 10 nmol of synthetic trisaccharide acceptor for GlcNAc-T V (octyl 6-O-[2-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucosyl-pyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranosyl]-β-d-glucopyraoside) were dried under vacuum in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Extracts of various protein concentrations were prepared, and 10 μl were added to the assay tube. Assays were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and quenched by the addition of 500 μl of water. Radiolabeled product was isolated on a C18 Sep-Pak (Waters) column, eluted in 2 ml of methanol, and counted in a scintillation counter. Assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate, at two or three protein concentrations, and specific activity was calculated by linear least squares regression analysis of the data. 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted to nylon. A 1-kb fragment of a partial rat GlcNAc-T V cDNA clone was random prime-labeled (26Vogelstein B. Gillespie D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), and the blot was probed according to the method of Church and Gilbert (27Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Data were collected and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Cells were harvested by the addition of 1 ml of preheated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer to a 10-cm plate and shearing through a 20 gauge needle. Protein concentrations were determined on trichloroacetic acid precipitates using the BCA reagents (Pierce). 20 μg of protein were electrophoresed on a 4–20% gradient acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Bart Sefton) followed by a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Bands were detected using the ECL reagents (Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by scanning densitometry. Marathon Race Ready cDNA from human whole brain (CLONTECH) was used as a template in a 5′ RACE PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 3′ PCR primer (303, CCTGGACCTCAGCAAAAGGTACATCAAGGC) designed near the 5′ end of the published human cDNA sequence was used along with the 5′ anchor primer in a primary round of RACE PCR. Products were separated on a 1% Tris-acetic acid-EDTA-agarose gel and blotted to nitrocellulose. A nested PCR product was generated using the primers 501 (GAATGGAAGTGAGGGAAGGC) and 305 (GGAAGTTGTCCTCTCAGAAGCTGGGCTTT) and a genomic clone template. This product was random prime-labeled (26Vogelstein B. Gillespie D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) and used to probe the membrane to which the RACE PCR product was transferred (see Fig. 6). To improve yields of authentic products, a secondary round of RACE PCR was then performed. A nested GlcNAc-T V 3′ primer (305) and nested 5′ anchor primer were used in the secondary round of RACE PCR using as templates the products from the primary RACE PCR. The products from this round of RACE PCR were directly subcloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and clones were sequenced. The human GlcNAc-T V promoter sequences were isolated from a human genomic library cloned in the λ-FIX II vector (Stratagene, Inc.). A 687-bp EcoRI fragment containing the 5′-untranslated region of the rat cDNA (28Shoreibah M. Perng G.-S. Adler B. Weinstein J. Basu R. Cupples R. Wen D. Browne J.K. Buckhaults P. Fregien N.

Screening 5 × 106 phage plaques yielded two overlapping genomic clones that span a region of approximately 30 kb. Sequencing of RACE PCR clones and human genomic clones was performed using the Applied Biosystems, Inc. reagents by the UGA Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility. For pGL2-TV1, a 6-kbXhoI-SacI fragment of the genomic clone was band-purified (Sephaglass, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and subcloned intoXhoI-SacI sites of the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). For pGL2-TV2 through pGL2-TV4, PCR products were generated using the genomic clone as a template and subcloned into the TA vector. TA clones of the correct orientation were cut withXhoI-SacI, and inserts were cloned intoXhoI-SacI sites of pGL2-Basic. SV40-β-galactosidase (2 μg) and reporter constructs (2 μg) ± effector plasmids (2 μg) were transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (29Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) into 50% confluent cultures of HepG2 cells grown in 6-well culture plates. 40 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to vector-dependent β-galactosidase activity. The plasmids encoding the Raf-1 kinase and its dominant negative form (30Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R.

The v-src expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Tony Hunter. Earlier experiments utilizing BHK and RSV-BHK cells metabolically radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose indicated at least a 2-fold increase in the total amount of (2,6)-substituted mannose in the RSV-BHK cells, normalized to total mannose-labeled glycopeptides. Although the specific activity of GlcNAc-T V was increased over 6-fold in the RSV-transformed cells, no significant differences in the kinetic properties of GlcNAc-T V in the transformed cells could be detected. These results suggested that the increases in GlcNAcβ(1,6)Man levels after transformation were most likely not due to post-translational effects on the enzyme (22Palcic M.M. Ripka J. Kaur K.J. Shoreibah M. Hindsgaul O. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6759-6769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of GlcNAc-T V and its mRNA levels were measured, therefore, to determine if the increase in GlcNAc-T V activity in the transformed cells could result from differences in mRNA levels. GlcNAc-T V activity was assayed under optimal conditions in BHK and RSV-BHK cells using a synthetic trisaccharide acceptor. The transformed BHK cells demonstrated a GlcNAc-T V enzyme specific activity 6-fold higher than the untransformed BHK cells. By contrast, no difference was seen in the specific activity of another N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that functions in the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides, GlcNAc-T I (Fig. 1), indicating the specificity of Rous sarcoma virus transformation on GlcNAc-T V activity. To investigate the possibility that the difference in GlcNAc-T V specific activity is associated with a difference in steady-state mRNA levels, Northern blots were performed using a fragment of a cDNA encoding GlcNAc-T V. Compared with BHK cells, RSV-transformed cells were found to have a 6-fold increase in the expression levels of both 8.7 and 9.3 kb GlcNAc-T V transcripts, but no change in either GAPDH or GlcNAc-T I transcripts (Fig.2). Although not apparent in Fig. 2, PhosphorImager quantitation demonstrated an equivalent increase in both GlcNAc-T V mRNA transcripts. These results demonstrated that the elevation of enzyme activity in the RSV-transformed cells was a result of either transcriptional activation or increased mRNA stability and argue against postranslational modifications of the enzyme causing a significant increase in its catalytic activity.Figure 2BHK and RSV-BHK cell GlcNAc-T V mRNA levels.

The blot was stripped and hybridized with a rat GAPDH radiolabeled cDNA to demonstrate loading equivalence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain convincing evidence that the differences in GlcNAc-T V expression result from src tyrosine kinase activity, we made use of a src-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, a metabolite produced by Streptomyces sp. MH237-CF8. This inhibitor was first identified for its ability to reverse the transformed morphology of Rous sarcoma virus-infected rat kidney cells (32Uehara Y. Hori M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1985; 76: 672-675PubMed Google Scholar), and this reversion of morphology was associated with a reduction in total cellular phosphotyrosine levels (33Uehara Y. Murakami Y. Sugimoto Y. Mizuno S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 780-785PubMed Google Scholar). Herbimycin A was unable, however, to reverse the transformed morphologies induced by theras, raf, or myc oncogenes, demonstrating its specificity for the src family of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (34Uehara Y. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Kawai S. Virology. 1988; 164: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Herbimycin A is also able to reversesrc-stimulated expression of the glucose transporter gene (35Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Hori M. Uehara Y. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1587-1590PubMed Google Scholar) and to cause a reversible Go contact arrest insrc-transformed normal rat kidney cells (36Suzukake-Tsuchiya K. Moriya Y. Hori M. Uehara Y. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 42: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We utilized herbimycin A, therefore, to test the hypothesis that the expression of GlcNAc-T V is positively regulated by the src tyrosine kinase. First, to monitor the effects of src kinase and demonstrate its inhibition by herbimycin A, we measured total cellular phosphotyrosine levels by performing Western blots with an α-phosphotyrosine antibody on extracts made from cells treated for 24 h with various concentrations of the drug. These results demonstrate that, as expected, herbimycin A caused a dose-dependent decrease in cellular phosphotyrosine levels (Fig. 3). At a concentration of 1 μg/ml, herbimycin A caused a reversal of the RSV-transformed morphology and a complete inhibition of cell division (data not shown). Consistent with the drug's effect of inhibiting the src kinase (33Uehara Y. Murakami Y. Sugimoto Y. Mizuno S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 780-785PubMed Google Scholar) and blocking cell division in Go (36Suzukake-Tsuchiya K. Moriya Y. Hori M. Uehara Y. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 42: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), herbimycin A caused a dose-dependent decrease in GlcNAc-T V enzyme specific activity in RSV-transformed BHK cells (Fig. 4). Interestingly, although the drug blocked cell division and caused a modest decrease in phosphotyrosine levels in the untransformed BHK cells (data not shown), it had little effect on the expression level of GlcNAc-T V enzyme activity in confluent cultures of untransformed cells (Fig. 4). This result suggests that regulation of GlcNAc-T V expression is complex, with both src-dependent andsrc-independent factors. Herbimycin A had no effect on the specific activity of GlcNAc-T I (data not shown), arguing against nonspecific toxic effects on the transformed cells and confirming that GlcNAc-T I is not regulated by src. To determine if the inhibition of expression of GlcNAc-T V enzyme activity by herbimycin A was a result of inhibiting the expression of the mRNA encoding the enzyme, Northern blots were performed on RNA samples prepared from RSV-transformed cells treated with various concentrations of the drug. Similar to its effects on GlcNAc-T V enzyme specific activity, herbimycin A caused a decrease in GlcNAc-T V message levels in the RSV-BHK cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). Taken together, these results indicate that expression of the GlcNAc-T V mRNA in the src-transformed cells is under the control of the src tyrosine kinase.Figure 4BHK and RSV-BHK GlcNAc-T V specific activities after treatment with herbimycin A.

The level of GlcNAc-T V mRNA in untreated cells was set at 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the mechanism by which src induces the expression of GlcNAc-T V, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of the gene and analyzed this region for promoter activity. The GlcNAc-T V message is approximately 9 kb in most rodent and human tissues, with brain having high expression levels. To locate a promoter for GlcNAc-T V, 5′ RACE PCR techniques were used to isolate and sequence the 5′ end of the message from human brain. RACE PCR products were first generated from the genomic clone using the 303 primer (designed against the 5′ end of the human GlcNAc-T V cDNA sequence) and then analyzed by Southern blotting. GlcNAc-T V-specific sequences were detected using a nested 501–305 PCR product as the hybridization probe. Multiple bands were detected, the longest of which was 2.9 kb (Fig. 6). PCR products were ligated into the TA cloning vector, and clones corresponding to the 600- and 1200-bp products were obtained and found to overlap and differ only in the length of their 5′ ends. To isolate a product that encompassed all of the 5′-untranslated region of the GlcNAc-T V message, a second round of RACE PCR was then performed using two nested primers designed near the 5′ end of the 0.6 kb clone, and the resulting products were subcloned and sequenced. Clones corresponding to the 1.8- and 2.9-kb bands were isolated from this second round of RACE PCR and sequenced. As before, these clones were found to differ only in the length of their 5′ ends. A third round of RACE PCR using a 3′ primer designed to the sequence near the 5′ end of the 2.9-kb clone produced a single product of the expected size (70 bp). The assembled sequence of the RACE clones was co-linear with the sequence of the genomic clone in this region, indicating that no splicing events occurred in the 5′-UTR of the message from human brain. These results demonstrate, therefore, that the location of the 5′-most transcriptional start site utilized in brain is located approximately 2.9 kb upstream of the ATG, corresponding to the band of this size shown in Fig. 6. To examine the 5′ region flanking the 5′-most transcriptional start site, a 6-kb SacI-XhoI genomic fragment containing 848 bp of the brain 5′-UTR and 5.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence (depicted in Fig. 7), designated pGL2-TV1, was cloned into the luciferase expression vector pGL2-basic. The activity of this region as a promoter and its responsiveness to srcwere then examined in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. pGL2-TV1 was found to act as a weak promoter, shown in Fig. 8, consistent with the low levels of GlcNAc-T V transcript observed in HepG2 cells and most tissues. Moreover, this DNA fragment conferred transcriptional responsiveness to src when co-transfected with a src-containing expression plasmid (Fig. 8). The similarity between the increases in GlcNAc-T V expression in the RSV-transformed cells and src stimulation of transcription from the GlcNAc-T V promoter in HepG2 cells suggests that transcriptional control is likely the most important regulatory influence of src on GlcNAc-T V activity.Figure 8The TV1 fragment promoter activity is responsive to src and is dependent on raf.The TV1 fragment depicted in Fig. 7, representing a 6240-bpSacI-XhoI fragment of the 5′-flanking region, was cloned into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector and used to transfect Hep G-2 cells in the presence and the absence of a co-transfected src-expression plasmid. A dominant negativeraf-1 expression plasmid, Raf C4B, was also utilized in some transfections, as well as an expression plasmid containing an inactive point mutant of the same, Raf C4B pm17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transformation and some transcriptional activation by srcoccurs via the MAPK pathway in a Raf-1-dependent manner. For example, a dominant-negative Raf-1 mutant suppresses srctransformation of BALB/c mouse fibroblasts (37Qureshi S.A. Joseph C.K. Hendrickson M. Song J. Gupta R. Bruder J. Rapp U. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and is able to blocksrc-stimulated transcriptional activation of the EGR gene (38Qureshi S.A. Rim M.

Furthermore, this mutant is able to block serum or Ras stimulation of the transcription of an AP-1/Ets-driven gene (30Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). If transcriptional activation of GlcNAc-T V by src occurs at least in part via the MAPK pathway, we reasoned that the activation should be inhibited by the dominant-negative Raf-1 mutant. Consistent with this hypothesis, the transcriptional stimulation of the GlcNAc-T V promoter by src was significantly inhibited when co-transfected with a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant Raf, RafC4B-DN (Fig. 8). Because proliferation often occurs in a Raf-dependent manner, this result is consistent with correlations noted between GlcNAc-T V expression and cellular proliferation in nontransformed cells (39Perng G.S. Shoreibah M. Margitich I. Pierce M. Fregien N. Glycobiology. 1995; 4: 867-871Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Hahn T.J. Goochee C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23982-23987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may predict in certain cell types a general association between GlcNAc-T V enzyme activity and cell proliferation. To map more closely the region of the GlcNAc-T V promoter responsible for transcriptional activation by src, a series of 5′ deletions containing 70 bp of the brain 5′-UTR and different amounts of the 5′-flanking region were constructed by PCR amplification from the genomic clone, the boundaries of which are depicted in Fig. 7. Promoter fragments were cloned into the pGL2-basic vector and tested for basal promoter activity and src responsiveness. Based on the results from several sets of experiments, both pGL2-TV2, which contained about 1.2 kb, and pGL2-TV3, which contained 739 bp, were both found to be weakly active as promoters and transcriptionally responsive to src (Fig. 9). The pGL2-TV4 construct containing 339 bp, however, was found to be inactive as a basic promoter and completely unresponsive to src. These results suggest a requirement for the two overlapping PEA-3 sites located near the transcriptional start site, contained in pGL2-TV3, in thesrc-mediated transcriptional activation of the GlcNAc-T V gene (Figs. 7 and 10).Figure 10Nucleotide sequence of the GlcNAc-T V genomic fragment TV3. This sequence corresponds to the shortest fragment tested that conferred src responsiveness to a GlcNAc-T V promoter-driven luciferase gene. The fragment was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and included 70 bp 3′ of the transcriptional start site.

To examine the contribution of homocysteine (H[cys]) in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, we sought to determine whether the H[cys] effect on vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) proliferation is mediated by a specific receptor/transporter or is due to an interaction with growth factors or cytokines. We show that H[cys] induced c-fos and c-myb and increased DNA synthesis and cell proliferation 12-fold in neural crest-derived VSMC (N-VSMC). The H[cys] effect on N-VSMC proliferation is inhibited by Mk-801, a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate-gated calcium ion channel receptor, and CGS 19755, a competitive antagonist of NMDA-type glutamate receptor. H[cys] stimulates the synthesis of mass amounts of sn-1,2 diacylglycerol, and activates protein kinase C translocation from the nucleus and cytoplasm to cell membranes. Furthermore, protein kinase C inhibitors block the growth effect mediated by H[cys]. These findings indicate that H[cys]-mediated responses are coupled to diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C activation. Our results suggest that homocysteine activates a receptor/transporter-like factor in neural crest derived smooth muscle."

Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in its activated mature 17-kDa form may mediate aspects of vascular inflammation.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that CD40L modulates the expression and/or activity of ICE and thus of IL-1β in cells of the vascular vessel wall, particularly smooth muscle and endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that recombinant human CD40L (rCD40L) inducesde novo synthesis of the IL-1β precursor and coordinates expression of a 20-kDa immunoreactive ICE protein with the expression of biological ICE-activity in human vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Moreover, supernatants of the rCD40L-stimulated cultures, but not supernatants from cells exposed to a variety of other mediators, contained biological IL-1β activity. Human vascular SMC were isolated from saphenous veins by explant outgrowth (45Ross R. Kariya B. Bohr D.F. Somlyo A.P. Sparks H.Y. Handbook of Physiology, The Cardiovascular System. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1980: 66-91Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1%l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and 10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Human vascular EC were isolated from saphenous veins by collagenase treatment (1 mg/ml; Worthington Biochemicals, Freehold, NJ) and cultured in dishes coated with fibronectin (1.5 μg/cm2; Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Lake Placid, NY) as described elsewhere (46Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Cotran R.S. Folkman J. J. Cell. Biol. 1974; 60: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in medium 199 (M199; BioWhittaker), supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5% FCS, 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml ECGF (endothelial cell growth factor; Pel-Freez Biological, Rogers, AR). Both cell types were subcultured following trypsinization (0.5% trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals), 0.2% EDTA (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ)) in 75-cm2 culture flasks (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and used throughout passages 2 to 4. Culture media and FCS contained less than 40 pg of endotoxin/ml as determined by chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte assay-analysis (QLC-1000; BioWhittaker). Human vascular SMC and EC were characterized by immunostaining with an anti-smooth muscle cell α-actin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and anti-vWF antibody (von Willebrand factor; Dako), respectively. In some experiments, the cells were cultured for 24 h prior to the experiment in medium lacking FCS. Vascular EC were cultured in M199 supplemented with 0.1% human serum albumin (Immuno-US-Incorporated, Rochester, MN), and vascular SMC were cultured in IT (insulin/transferrin) medium as described (47Libby P. O'Brien K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Monocytes were isolated from freshly prepared human peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from leukopacs of healthy donors (kindly provided by Dr. Steve K. Clinton, Dana Farber Institute, Boston, MA) by density gradient centrifugation as described previously (30Mach F. Schönbeck U. Sukhova G.K. Bourcier T. Bonnefoy J.-Y. Pober J.S. Libby P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) harvested by scraping were resuspended in processing buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol; Sigma) and used directly for processing assays or stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Purity of monocytes was ≥95%, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (anti-human CD68 monoclonal antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). For detection of IL-1β activity, the mouse thymocyte cell line D10.G4.1 (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Lichtman, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) and human dermal fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as described previously (48Loppnow H.

Human vascular SMC or EC cultured in 75-cm2 flasks were washed twice and incubated for 24 h prior to the experiment in the absence of serum. The medium was replaced by medium lacking methionine and cysteine but supplemented with rCD40L (49Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Graber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J.-F.

All experiments were performed in the presence of the endotoxin inhibitor polymyxin B (1 μg/ml; Sigma). After 24 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by scraping in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 0.025% sodium azide). Cell-extracts were centrifuged (30 min, 4 °C, 10,000 × g) and supernatants were precleared with non-immune rabbit-serum (18 h, 4 °C; Vector, Burlingame, CA). After centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 10,000 × g), proteins of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated (2 h, 4 °C) with the IL-1β-specific polyclonal rabbit antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). After adding protein A-agarose (1.5 h, 4 °C; Life Technologies, Inc.), precipitates were centrifuged (2 min, 4 °C, 300 × g), and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.2 m Tris (pH 6.8), 5% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, final concentrations). After heating for 10 min at 95 °C, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and exposed to autoradiography film (NEN Life Science Products). Cell extracts, equalized in total protein, were separated by standard SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (3.0 mA/cm2, 30 min; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Blots were blocked (2 h), and dilution of first and second antibody was made in 5% defatted dry milk, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After 1 h of incubation with the respective primary antibody (1:1,000 polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-1β (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 1:200 polyclonal goat anti-IL-1β-converting enzyme (M19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)) blots were washed four times (15 min in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and the secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was added for another hour. Finally, after 4 times washing (20 min, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20), immunoblots were developed using the Western blot chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products) or the chromogenic system adding diaminobenzidine (50 μg/ml; Sigma) in substrate buffer (17 mm citric acid, 65 mmNaH2PO4, 0.1% H2O2, 0.01% (w/v) Thimerosal) to the blots. Independently produced antibodies directed against IL-1β (rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-1β (Santa Cruz) and the mouse monoclonal antibody Fib3 (50Herzbeck H. Blum B. Rönspeck W. Frenzel B. Brandt E.

Cultured human vascular SMC and EC as well as monocytes were harvested by scraping in processing buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol; final concentrations; Sigma). After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, 30 μl of cell extract (containing equal amounts of total protein) were incubated for the designated times at 37 °C with 50 ng of recombinant human IL-1β precursor (pIL-1β; Cistron, Pine Brook, NJ). All assays were performed in a final volume of 50 μl. The processing was stopped by adding 10 μl SDS-PAGE (5 ×) sample buffer and heating the samples (10 min, 95 °C). Finally, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Specificity of the processing was analyzed by pre-incubation (10 min, 37 °C) of cell extracts with 100 μm ICE-inhibitor (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-H (aldehyde); Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) (8Thornberry N.A.

Human vascular SMC or EC were incubated for 24 h with the respective stimuli (None, rCD40L, or IL-1β) in the absence or presence of the anti-CD40L antibody (5 μg/ml). The culture supernatants were added in the absence or presence of the neutralizing IL-1β antibody (1 μg/ml; Endogen, Cambridge, MA) to (i) the murine thymocyte cell line D10.G4.1 or (ii) subconfluent fibroblast cultures (5000 cells/cm2), and the IL-1 assay was performed as described previously (48Loppnow H.

Briefly, after 72 h of stimulation, cells were pulsed for the final 24 h with tritiated thymidine ([3H]thymidine, 5 μCi//well, NEN Life Science Products) in 96-well plates and harvested, and [3H]thymidine incorporation (disintegrations per minute per culture ± S.D.) was determined. The mean of triplicate cultures was determined. Alternatively, fibroblasts were fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%), stained with crystal violet (10% in methanol), and lysed by incubation with 100 μl of SDS (1%), and finally, absorbancy was measured at 550 nm.

It includes mutations that allow disulfide bond formation between the Cys at α411 and both Cys-87 of γ and Cys-108 of ε, two covalent cross-links that block enzyme function (Aggeler, R., and Capaldi, R. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 13888–13891). A cross-link is also generated between the Cys at α2 and Cys-140 of the δ subunit, which has no effect on functioning (Ogilvie, I., Aggeler, R., and Capaldi, R. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16652–16656). CuCl2 treatment of the mutant αQ2C/αS411C/εS108C generated five major cross-linked products. These are α-γ-δ, α-γ, α-δ-ε, α-δ, and α-ε. The ratio of α-γ-δ to the α-γ product was close to 1:2, i.e. in one-third of the ECF1F0 molecules the γ subunit was attached to the α subunit at which the δ subunit is bound. Also, 20% of the ε subunit was present as a α-δ-ε product. With regard to the δ subunit, 30% was in the α-γ-δ, 20% in the α-δ-ε, and 50% in the α-δ products when the cross-linking was done after incubation in ATP + MgCl2. The amounts of these three products were 40, 22, and 38%, respectively, in experiments where Cu2+ was added after preincubation in ATP + Mg2+ + azide. The δ subunit is fixed to, and therefore identifies, one specific α subunit (αδ). A distribution of the γ and ε subunits, which is essentially random with respect to the α subunits, can only be explained by rotation of γ-ε relative to the α3β3 domain in ECF1F0.

F1F0-type ATPases are found in the plasma membrane of bacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. These enzymes can both use a proton gradient to synthesize ATP and in the reverse direction hydrolyze ATP to establish a proton gradient for subsequent substrate and ion transport processes (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 3Capaldi R.A.

The F1 part of the enzyme fromEscherichia coli, ECF1F0, is composed of α, β, γ, δ, and ε subunits in the stoichiometry 3:3:1:1:1. This part is linked by a narrow stalk to the F0part that is composed of a, b, and c subunits in the stoichiometry 1:2:9–12 (3Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Cross R.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Senior A.E. Annu.

These two subunits may provide a second separate connection (8Junge W. Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Ber. Bunsenges. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 2014-2019Crossref Google Scholar, 9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and, more recently, a high resolution structure of the mitochondrial F1 (11Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) have shown that the α and β subunits alternate in a hexagonal arrangement around a central cavity. These two large subunits have a similar fold, each with three domains, an N-terminal β barrel domain on top and away from the F0, a middle nucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain (11Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Three catalytic sites are present and located predominantly on β subunits. The other three nucleotide binding sites on the α subunits appear to have mostly a structural role. A part of the γ subunit is found within the α3β3barrel and organized as two α helices. A third short α helical segment of this subunit was also resolved in the crystal structure of mitochondrial F1 (11Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). This lies under the C-terminal domain of one of the β subunits where it interacts with the so-called “DELSEED” region (the sequence of residues of this part). The ε subunit in ECF1 is a two-domain protein (12Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 10-stranded β barrel region interacts with the γ subunit through the length of the stalk (7Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and with the c subunit oligomer at one end (14Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The helix-loop-helix C-terminal domain of ε lies under the α3β3 subunit barrel and interacts with the DELSEED region (15Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of a different β subunit from the one that binds to the short α helix of γ (16Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There is now considerable evidence that F1F0-type ATPases are highly cooperative enzymes with all three catalytic sites involved (2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 17Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cooperativity of both ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis is currently best described by the alternating site model (18Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8503-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this model at any time during functioning, one catalytic site is involved in the bond cleavage reaction and is essentially closed; a second is opening to release the tightly bound product, and the third is closing to trap the substrate. An important tenet of the binding change mechanism is that catalytic sites are sequentially linked to the proton channel for energy coupling by a rotation of the small subunits. Early evidence for such rotation came from cryoelectron microscopy studies on ECF1 that showed the γ subunit distributed at all three β subunits rather than fixed at one site (19Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea of rotation of γ within the α3β3 domain, cross-linking of this subunit to α or β subunits was found to fully inhibit the functioning of ECF1 (16Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for rotation of the γ subunit relative to the α3β3 domain has been provided more recently by Duncan et al. (22Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These authors isolated a complex containing a (unlabeled) β and γ subunit, stably linked by a disulfide bond between Cys-87 of γ and a Cys introduced at position 380 of β. They mixed this β-γ complex with a35S-labeled β subunit along with α, δ, and ε subunits to regenerate a functional F1. This reconstituted enzyme was then shown to undergo subunit switching when the disulfide bond was broken and MgCl2 + ATP was added, i.e.the γ moved from unlabeled to labeled β subunits. Sabbert et al. (23Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) have also provided evidence of rotation of the γ subunit in chloroplast F1. Finally, rotation of the γ subunit in the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 has been visualized directly in recent elegant single molecule studies (24Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). However, all of the above studies have focused on the movements of the γ subunit in F1, and in terms of functional relevance it remains important to show that rotation of the γ subunit in conjunction with other subunits (e.g. the ε subunit) occurs in the intact F1F0. Also, for an understanding of the coupling mechanisms, it is necessary to establish which subunits are moving with the γ subunit and which are fixed with respect to the α3β3 subdomain. One attempt to examine rotation in ECF1F0 has been reported recently by Cross and colleagues (25Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the same cross-linking and reconstitution approach they used before for F1. They showed an ATP-driven and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive scrambling of γ relative to β subunits, although the level of this scrambling was lower than would be expected if all enzyme molecules were active. We have previously observed that disulfide bonds can be formed from an α subunit via a Cys at position 2 to the δ subunit (in the mutant αQ2C (26Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) and via a Cys at residue 411 to the γ and ε subunits (in the mutant αS411C/εS108C (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Here, we report cross-linking studies with ECF1F0 from the mutant αQ2C/αS411C/εS108C where cross-linking from the α subunit to all three small subunits can be obtained at the same time. The combinations of cross-linked products obtained provide information about which subunits have to be moving in the ATP synthase and which do not. The triple mutant pRA170 (αQ2C/αS411C/εS108C) was obtained by ligating the 5.8-kilobase XhoI/NsiI fragment of pRA140 (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which contains the mutations αS411C and εS108C, to the 6.8-kilobaseXhoI/NsiI fragment of pIO1 (26Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which contains the mutation αQ2C. Mutant pRA141 (αS411C) was created by ligation of the 2.9-kilobase SstI/NsiI fragment of pRA100 (27Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the 9.7-kilobase SstI/NsiI fragment of pRA140. We have recently found that both ECF1 and ECF1F0 can be obtained in purer form by usingE. coli strains that do not make cytochrome bo(28Grüber, G., Hausrath, A., Sagermann, M., and Capaldi, R. A. (1997) FEBS Lett., in press.Google Scholar). For this reason pRA170 was incorporated in RA1, aunc −/cyo− E. colistrain that was created by P1 transduction of Δ(uncB-uncC)ilv::Tn10 from DK8 (29Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to GO104 (F − , thi, rpsL, Δcyo::Kan). GO104 was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Gennis, University of Illinois. Successful transduction was shown by Southern blotting (30Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar). ECF1 and ECF1F0 were isolated as described by Gogolet al. (31Gogol E.P. Lucken U. Bork T. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Aggeler et al. (32Aggeler R. Zhang Y.-Z. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7107-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), respectively. ECF1F0 was reconstituted in egg lecithin on a Sephadex G-50 column (medium, 1.5 × 60 cm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mmDTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and 10% glycerol, and cross-linking of the enzyme was carried out with CuCl2 in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol as described by Aggeler et al. (16Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cross-linked products were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by resolving cross-linked products in a first dimension without prior treatment with reducing agents on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. A portion of a lane was cut out and exposed to 50 mm DTT in dissociation buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The gel piece was rotated 90° and positioned with agarose on a stacking gel of a 10–18% polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay from Pierce. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (34Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cross-linked products were identified with Western blotting, using monoclonal antibodies against F1 subunits (35Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The experiments described here utilize the mutant αQ2C/αS411C/εS108C. The ATP hydrolysis rates of this mutant were in the range of 25–30 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg, which is the same as for wild-type enzyme. Also, the ECF1F0 displayed efficient proton pumping activity as determined by ATP-dependent 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence quenching in inner membranes (result not shown). Therefore, the introduction of three different mutations did not disrupt the functioning of the enzyme. Previous work with ECF1 and ECF1F0from the mutant αS411C/εS108C has shown that CuCl2treatment induces cross-linking between the Cys at 411 of one α subunit and the intrinsic Cys-87 of the γ subunit and between the Cys-411 of a second α subunit and Cys-108 of ε (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of α to γ, as obtained in an αS411C mutant, or of α to ε obtained at low CuCl2 concentrations in the αS411C/εS108C mutant fully inhibited ATPase activity. Studies using the ECF1 and ECF1F0 from the mutant αQ2C have shown that CuCl2 causes full yield cross-linking between an α and the δ subunit involving the Cys at position 2 of α and the two intrinsic Cys residues of δ,i.e. Cys-64 and Cys-140. The cross-linking of α to δ is without significant effect on either ATPase activity or ATP-coupled proton translocation as measured by the 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence quenching method (26Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The effect of CuCl2 treatment on ECF1F0 isolated from the triple mutant αQ2C/αS411C/εS108C is shown in Fig.1. These experiments were conducted using 50 or 200 μm CuCl2 with incubation for 1 h at room temperature. All of the subunits of the complex are resolved in Fig. 1 A. The δ and ε subunits are each essentially missing, and the γ subunit is much reduced in the gel, having been cross-linked with the α subunit. The band of the α subunit is also greatly reduced (by around 85%). In Fig. 1 B, the cross-linked products are optimally resolved. Each was identified by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against each of the subunits. Five main cross-linked products were generated; in order of decreasing apparent molecular weight, these are α-δ-γ, α-γ, α-δ-ε, α-δ, and α-ε, respectively. Other cross-linked products were obtained but only in small amounts. These include an α-α product that has also been resolved after cross-linking of the αQ2C mutant and probably involves a disulfide bridge from Cys-2 of one α and Cys-90 of a second α subunit. In several different experiments the cross-linked products involving the δ subunit, i.e. α-δ-γ, α-δ-ε, and α-δ, appeared to be in almost equal amounts based on immunostaining of the Western blots with the anti-δ monoclonal antibody (e.g.Fig. 1 C). To better quantitate the yields of these cross-linked products, CuCl2-treated enzyme was subjected to two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with separation in the first dimension in the absence of DTT and in the second dimension in the presence of DTT. A typical result is shown in Fig. 2 A. It is clear from these data that the amounts of γ, δ, and ε not in the major products identified in the figure are very small, i.e. less than 5% for each subunit. A scan of the three peaks of δ subunit released from α-δ-γ, α-δ-ε, and α-δ products by DTT dissociation is shown in Fig. 2 B. The relative percentage of these three peaks was 30, 20, and 50% (averages of two experiments), respectively. Similar quantitation of percentages of the γ subunit in the α-δ-γ and α-γ bands gave 31 and 69%, respectively, and for the ε subunit in the α-δ-ε and α-ε gave 19 and 81%, respectively. The experiment in Fig. 2 involved cross-linking of ECF1F0 after preincubation in MgCl2+ ATP. When cross-linking was performed after preincubation in MgCl2 + NaN3 + ATP the distribution of α-δ-γ, α-δ-ε, and α-δ was 40.3 ± 1.0, 21.7 ± 0.9, and 38.0 ± 0.2% (averages of three experiments), respectively. The question of whether there is rotation of the γ subunit between the three α-β pairs during the functioning of F1 has been convincingly answered as reviewed in the Introduction. ATP hydrolysis clearly drives a movement of the γ subunit such that it visits all three α-β subunit pairs during cooperative catalysis (23Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 24Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). A priori, this rotational movement could be an artifact of a freedom of the γ subunit that is allowed only when the F1 is dissociated from the F0. However, the results of Zhou et al. (25Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the data presented in this study are evidence that this is not the case. The key observations here are that in ECF1F0 from the mutant αQ2C/αS411C/εS108C there is cross-linking of γ and ε subunits each separately to the same α subunit that binds the δ subunit (Fig.3). However, the γ and ε subunits are never bound to the same α subunit. The significance of these results is clear when the activity effects of cross-linking of the γ, δ, or ε subunits to α subunits are considered. Covalent cross-linking of the δ to an α subunit has been found to have little or no effect on either cooperative ATP hydrolysis or on the proton pumping function of ECF1F0 (26Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the cross-linking of γ or ε to α subunits, which completely blocks functioning (21Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The conclusion from these activity data is that movements of γ and ε but not δ are an essential part of the functioning of the enzyme. It follows that the δ subunit must be fixed with its interaction thereby identifying one of the three α subunits (αδ) that can be visited by both γ and ε since both α-δ-γ and α-δ-ε cross-linked products were obtained. The distribution of cross-linked products observed is understandable when it is considered that the experiments reported here involve a population of ECF1F0 molecules that are not synchronized. Thus, at any time during enzyme turnover after ATP hydrolysis has stopped, around one-third of any rotating subunits should be at each of the three α-β pairs. This is approximately the observed distribution of both γ and ε subunits in our experiments whether enzyme activity was ended by substrate depletion or by addition of azide. In previous studies it was shown that cross-linking of ε to the γ subunit did not block activity (7Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), indicating that these two subunits move together as a mobile domain. In electron microscopy studies (19Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we have seen movements of the γ subunits relative to ε, but this is because the antibody fragments to α and ε used to tag specific subunits release ε from γ so that it is fixed at one α-β subunit pair. In summary, the scrambling of γ and ε subunits with respect to the three α subunits, one of which is clearly distinguished by interaction of the δ subunit, is evidence for rotational movements of the main stalk forming subunits in ECF1F0. The only other explanation of the data, that ECF1F0assembles with a fixed random distribution of the small subunits, does not seem tenable. The γ and ε subunits appear to move as one domain, although there may be small movements of the two relative to one another as part of the coupling between catalytic sites and proton channel functioning (6Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Wilkens S. Grüber G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For rotational movements of the γ and ε subunits to occur within ECF1F0, the α3β3domain must be fixed relative to the F0 part by a stator. Recent evidence suggests that this stator is contributed by the δ with the b subunits (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32737-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For coupling, ATP hydrolysis-driven movements of the γ-ε domain must be linked to proton translocation. It has been established that both the γ and ε (Refs. 7Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and 14Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, respectively) interact directly with the c subunit oligomer of the F0 subunit. The covalent cross-linking of γ or ε to the c subunit ring does not block ATP hydrolysis (7Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which implies that the rotatory element in ECF1F0 is a γ-ε-c oligomer domain moving relative to the α3-β3-δ-a-b2 complex.

https://openalex.org/W1635454239,"Recognition of a functional 3' splice site in pre-mRNA splicing requires a heterodimer of the proteins U2AF65/U2AF35. U2AF65 binds to RNA at the polypyrimidine tract, whereas U2AF35 is thought to interact through its arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain with other RS-domain-containing factors bound at the 5' splice site, assembled in splicing enhancer complexes, or associated with the U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex. It is unclear, however, how such network interactions can all be established through the small RS domain in U2AF. Here we describe the function of a U2AF35-related protein (Urp), which is the human homologue of a mouse imprinted gene. Nuclear extracts depleted of Urp are defective in splicing, but activity can be restored by addition of recombinant Urp. U2AF35 could not replace Urp in complementation, indicating that their functions do not overlap. Co-immunodepletion showed that Urp is associated with the U2AF65/U2AF35 heterodimer. Binding studies revealed that Urp specifically interacts with U2AF65 through a U2AF35-homologous region and with SR proteins (a large family of RS-domain-containing proteins) through its RS domain. Therefore, Urp and U2AF35 may independently position RS-domain-containing factors within spliceosomes."

Incubation in vitro of CNF1 with recombinant small GTPases induces a modification of Rho (but not of Rac, Cdc42, Ras, or Rab6) as demonstrated by a discrete increase in the apparent molecular weight of the molecule. Preincubation of cells with CNF1 impairs the cytotoxic effects of Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inactivates Rho but not those of Clostridium sordellii LT toxin, which inhibits Ras and Rac. As shown for Rho-GTP, CNF1 activates, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, a cytoskeleton-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase. However, neither the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) nor the phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI 3,4-P2) or 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) cellular content were found increased in CNF1 treated HEp-2 cells. Cellular effects of CNF1 were not blocked by LY294002, a stable inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Incubation of HEp-2 cells with CNF1 induces relocalization of myosin 2 in stress fibers but not in retraction fibers. Altogether, our data indicate that CNF1 is a toxin that selectively activates the Rho GTP-binding protein, thus inducing contractility and cell spreading.

Actin filaments are common targets for several bacterial protein toxins that exert their activities by either directly or indirectly breaking the actin cytoskeleton. Toxins such as Clostridium botulinum C2 or iota from Clostridium perfringensdirectly modify globular actin by ADP-ribosylating arginine 177 (1Aktories K. Wegner A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1385-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).

To this family belong proteins (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), known to be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (2Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). RhoA and RhoC are constitutively produced, whereas RhoB is an early growth factor-induced gene (3Jahner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

RhoA, B, and C have apparently identical activities on actin polymerization consisting in the formation of actin stress fibers (5Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Rac controls membrane ruffling (6Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

Nature. 1991; 353: 668-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Cdc42 has been shown to regulate the formation of F-actin filaments in filopodia (8Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). Exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosylates RhoA, B, and C at asparagine 41 (9Chardin P. Boquet P. Madaule P. Popoff M.R. Rubin E.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CdA and CdB are glucosyltransferases, which modify Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by covalently linking a glucose moiety from UDP-glucose at threonine 37 of such GTP-binding proteins (11Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 12Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Clostridium sordelliilethal toxin (LT) is, like CdA or CdB, a glucosyltransferase that also induces actin reorganization (13Giry M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by selectively modifying Ras, Rap, and Rac at threonine 35 (corresponding to threonine 37 of Rho), but not Rho or Cdc42 (14Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although most toxins active on the cytoskeleton cause the distruption of F-actin structures, newly studied toxins named cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNF1 and CNF2) have been described to induce a dose-dependent increase in membrane ruffling and stress fibers (15Fiorentini C. Arancia G. Caprioli A. Falbo V. Ruggeri F.M. Donelli G. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CNF1 and CNF2, produced by a number of pathogenicEscherichia coli strains (16Caprioli A. Falbo V. Roda L.G. Ruggeri F.M. Zona C. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also interact with small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (17Fiorentini C. Giry M. Donelli G. Falzano L. Aullo P. Boquet P. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Suppl. 1994; 24: 404-405Google Scholar, 18Oswald E. Sugai M. Labigne A. Wu H.C. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. O'Brien A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3814-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) by probably causing a permanent activation of Rho (19Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, Bordetella bronchiseptica dermonecrotic toxin, which shares some sequence homology with CNFs (20Walker K.E. Weiss A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3817-3828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to induce actin reorganization and to interact with Rho (21Horiguchi Y. Senda T. Sugimoto N. Katahira J. Matsuda M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3243-3251PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family often serve as intracellular targets for bacterial protein toxins. A certain number of cellular proteins have been suggested to control or to be controlled by the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins. For instance, phosphoinositide 5-kinase (PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase), whose product is PtdIns-4,5-P2, has been shown to be activated by Rho GTP (22Chong L. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence point out that the elevation of PIP2 can lead to increased actin polymerization. It has been reported, in fact, that PIP2 is able to interact with actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin, inhibiting their interaction with microfilaments (23Schafer D.A. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 497-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and also to activate molecules implicated in F-actin binding such as vinculin (24Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) or ezrin (25Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), stimulating the assembly of focal adhesions. Furthermore, PIP2 has been shown to uncap the barbed ends of actin filaments, provoking bursts of actin polymerization (26Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases may thus control the actin cytoskeleton by regulating the local concentration of PIP2. Recently, it has been shown that Rho GTP, by stimulating the Rho kinase (27Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), induces phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase 130-kDa subunit (28Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K Science. 1996; 273: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation provokes, by inhibiting the MLC phosphatase activity, the calcium sensitization of smooth muscle contraction (29Gong M.C. Iisuka K. Nixon G. Browne J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F. Sugai M. Kobayashi S. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rho-stimulated contractility has been proposed to drive the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (30Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrated that CNF1 i) is a cytosolic acting toxin, the microinjection of it into cells triggering the formation of actin stress fibers; ii) activates the Rho GTP-binding protein since it modifies Rho in vitro; and iii) provokes an increasein vivo of a cytoskeleton-associated PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase activity, which is known to be stimulated by Rho activation (22Chong L. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that CNF1 promoted, in HEp-2 cells, contractility and cell spreading, two Rho-dependent phenomena (2Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), since it induced the same actin-myosin pattern previously described by Mitchison and coworker (31Cramer L.P. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) in postmitotic spreading cells. This was characterized by the relocalization of myosin 2 within stress fibers but not within retraction fibers, the last being long, thin, actin-rich fibers where the spreading edges move outward over (31Cramer L.P. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Taken altogether, our results suggest that CNF1 activates Rho, which in turn induces contractility and cell spreading. Recombinant small GTP-binding proteins were produced in E. coli under GST-fusion proteins and then processed by thrombin as described previously (14Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HEp-2 and Vero cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK), 1% non-essential amino acids, 5 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The subcultures were serially propagated after harvesting with 10 mm EDTA and 0.25% trypsin in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4). CNF1 was purified from E. coli TG1 in which the CNF1 gene was cloned. Purification of CNF1 from bacterial extracts was achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE ion exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and finally ion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia, Orsay, France). 2G. Flatau and P. Boquet, manuscript in preparation. C. sordellii LT was purified as reported previously (33Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified CdB was a gift of Dr. C. von Eichel-Streiber (Mainz, Germany). Twenty-four h after seeding on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (initial inoculum 104cells/ml), HEp-2 cells were treated with toxins. For each toxin, the following concentrations have been used: 10−9m for CNF1, 10−9m for C. difficile toxin B, and 10−7m forC. sordellii LT. CNF1 (2.5 μg/ml) diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7,5, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0,1 mmdithiothreitol (microinjection buffer) containing 0.5 mg/ml non-immune rabbit antibodies (to localize microinjected cells) was microinjected into Vero cells with a Transjector 5246 system (Eppendorf, Germany). Microinjections were performed in DMEM medium containing 25 mm Hepes buffer to maintain a pH of 7.3 and rabbit anti-CNF1 antibodies to neutralize possible leakages of CNF1 outside the microinjected cells. The microinjection step lasted for 5 min and then cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with both FITC-phalloidin for F-actin detection and rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) for detecting the microinjected cells. Samples were examined and photographed with a fluorescence equipped photomicroscope. PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase activity associated to the cytoskeleton was assayed as described (34Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 105 cells/cm2 in 10 cm-diameter dishes whether or not treated with CNF1. After incubation, monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS and then cytoskeleton was prepared by extraction with 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 mm sodium orthovanadate. After 15 min at 4 °C, cytoskeleton extracts were scraped off the dishes with a rubber policeman and pelleted in Eppendorf tubes at 12000 × gfor 1 min at 4 °C. Cytoskeleton extracts were washed twice at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of the same buffer but without Triton X-100 and finally resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, assayed for protein concentration, and immediately used for enzymatic assay. The lipid kinase assay was performed in a final volume of 200 μl, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 25 μm ATP, 50 μg of phosphatidylinositol 4-P (Sigma), 100 μg phosphatidylserine (Sigma, l'Isle d'Abeau, France) (before addition to the reaction, these lipids were dried under N2 stream resuspended with 50 μl of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and sonicated 3 times for 10 s on ice), 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham, France), and 100 μg of each cytoskeleton preparation. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1). Before extraction, each sample was acidified by adding HCl to a final concentration of 0.4m. After extraction, the lower organic layers were collected, dried under nitrogen, then resuspended in a minimum volume of chloroform to collect all the radioactivity, and spotted onto silica plates. Plates were developped in chloroform, methanol, 4.3m ammonium hydroxide (90:70:20) (v:v:v), as solvent. Unlabeled phospholipid standards were visualized by iodine vapors, and radiolabeled lipids were by autoradiography. Radioactivity associated with PIP2 was measured by extracting the spots from the plate and counting them by Serenkov radiation. Cellular amounts of PI 3,4-P2, PIP3, and PIP2 was assayed as follows. HEp-2 (1 × 106) cells were seeded in 75 cm2flasks and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then transferred in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h and labeled with 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham) in DMEM without phosphate (ICN, France) supplemented with glutamine and 0.5% fetal calf serum. After 2 h of labeling, CNF1 was added to the cell culture medium at a concentration of 10−9m and incubated for 8 h in the labeling medium. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold HCl (2.4 n), and cells were recovered by scraping. Lipids were then extracted as described previously (28Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K Science. 1996; 273: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography, and radiolabeled PI 3,4-P2, PIP2, and PIP3 were recovered by scraping the appropriate bands. Separation and analysis of deacylated products by high pressure liquid chromatography were done as described (34Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Butanedione Monoxime (Sigma) was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at the concentration of 1 m. Since BDM is stable for only 1 h in tissue culture media, HEp-2 cells were incubated with CNF1 (10−8m) for 2 h, and then BDM (10 mm) was added for 40 min. Cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence for F-actin and myosin 2 as described below. The reversibility of BDM activity on CNF1-induced actin reorganization was studied as follows. HEp-2 cells were incubated with CNF1 (10−8m) for 2 h, and then BDM (10 mm) was added for 40 min. Cell medium was removed, monolayers were washed once with DMEM, and cells were reincubated with fresh DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum at 37 °C for an additional 1 h. Cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence for actin and myosin 2 as described below. HEp-2 or Hela cells were grown on square glass coverslips in separate wells (5 × 104 cells/well). Following toxin treatments, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde prepared in the same buffer for 20 min. After being washed three times with PBS, free aldehyde groups were quenched by incubation with 50 mmNH4Cl for 10 min, and the monolayers were washed three times in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. For F-actin detection, cells were incubated with FITC-phalloidin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. For microinjection experiments, cells already stained for F-actin detection were incubated with the first appropriate anti-rabbit antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. This primary antibody binding was detected by 30 min of incubation at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham). For myosin 2 detection, the monoclonal antibody CC212 (35Klotz C. Bordes N. Laine M.C. Sandoz D. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used undiluted on cells fixed with cold methanol. Incubation of cells with monoclonal antibody CC212 first and then with the Texas Red anti-mouse antibody as well as the washing procedure were performed as described above. Finally after washing, coverslips were mounted with Moviol (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Ca), observed, and photographed with a fluorescence microscope. For scanning electron microscopy, control and CNF1-treated cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 20 min. Following postfixation in 1% OsO4 for 30 min, cells were dehydrated through graded ethanols, critical point dried in CO2, and gold coated by sputtering. The samples were examined with a Cambridge 360 scanning electron microscope. In addition to the increase in actin stress fibers and to the promotion of cell spreading, CNF1 induced, in HEp-2 cells, the formation of actin-rich retraction fibers (Fig. 1, e andf, arrows). All these actin structures (stress fibers, spreading-dependent membrane folding, and retraction fibers) are clearly visible, observing cells by scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Prolonging the time of exposure to CNF1 (micrographs in Fig. 1 were taken at 3 and 18 h), all the above described actin structures became more evident. We have previously shown that incubation of HEp-2 cells with CNF1 or CNF2 induces an increase in the apparent molecular weight of Rho as visualized, after exoenzyme C3 ADP-ribosylation, by a shift in the electrophetic mobility of the GTPase (17Fiorentini C. Giry M. Donelli G. Falzano L. Aullo P. Boquet P. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Suppl. 1994; 24: 404-405Google Scholar, 18Oswald E. Sugai M. Labigne A. Wu H.C. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. O'Brien A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3814-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have thus tested whether an in vitro incubation of Rho, Rac, Cdc42, Ras, or Rab6 with purified CNF1 was able to induce a change in the electrophoretic mobility of one or more of these GTPases. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of CNF1 for 2 h at 37 °C with the recombinant GTPases induced a shift of the electrophoretic mobility of the Rho GTPase only. CNF1 can protect cells against CdB activity (19Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. sordellii LT is a toxin immunologically and structurally closed to CdB. LT glucosylates at threonine 35 (identical to threonine 37 of Rho) of the small GTP binding proteins Ras, Rap, and Rac (14Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether CNF1 activity was specific on Rho, HEp-2 cells were first incubated with CNF1 for 18 h and then challenged with either CdB or LT (Fig.3). As expected from our previous results (19Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), effects of CdB on HEp-2 cells were prevented by preincubation of cells with CNF1 (Fig. 3 d). LT induces in HEp-2 cells a strong cytopathogenic effect, consisting in the rounding up of cell bodies together with the formation of filopodia (13Giry M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same effects were detectable also in cells pretreated with CNF1 (Fig.3 f), thus probably excluding Ras, Rap, and Rac as possible direct substrates for CNF1. Microinjection of CNF1 into cells was performed to demonstrate that this toxin acts on Rho from inside the cytosol. When microinjected into cells, CNF1 induced a massive formation of stress fibers (Fig. 4 b), comparable with that caused by external added CNF1. Control microinjection with buffer and rabbit non-immune antibodies alone did not induce actin reorganization (Fig.4 a). This result clearly indicates that CNF1 acts on Rho in the cytosol and not via a transmembrane signaling mechanism. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with 40 μm LY294002, a stable inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase (36Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 10 min followed by incubation of cells with 40 μmLY294002 together with CNF1 could not inhibit the cytoskeletal effects induced by the toxin (Fig. 5). This finding indicates that CNF1 does not trigger its effects on the actin cytoskeleton via an activation of the PI 3-kinase. Since it has been shown that Rho-GTP activates the PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase (22Chong L. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M.

HEp-2 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with CNF1 for 8 h. After lipid extraction, phosphoinosites content was determined as described previously (28Kimura K.

As shown in Table I, no increase of PIP2, PI 3,4-P2, or PIP3 was observed in CNF1-treated HEp-2 cells compared with control preparation. It is worthy to note that LY294002 at 40 μm not only reduced the PI 3-kinase activity but also had some noticeable effects on the PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase activity (Table I).Table IEffect of CNF1 on the level of 32 P-labeled inositol lipids in HEp-2 cellsPtdIns-3PPtdIns-4PPtdIns 3,4-P2PIP2PIP3Control780 ± 3634564 ± 1352Traces66886 ± 13580+CNF1920 ± 4326443 ± 1031Traces54268 ± 10900+CNF1+LY294002492 ± 2211379 ± 443Traces26436 ± 5280Cells prelabeled with 32P for 2 h were incubated with 10−9m CNF1 or with 10−9mCNF1 in the presence of 40 μm LY294002 for 8 h at 37 °C.

MLCs phosphorylation leads to myosin 2 interaction with actin filaments and development of contractility. In control HEp-2 cells, myosin 2 was observed as diffuse throughout the cytosol but also concentrated around cell edges (Fig.7 b). F-actin staining of control cells showed a few stress fibers and retraction fibers (Fig. 7 a). After 3 h of incubation of HEp-2 cells with CNF1, relocalization of myosin 2 was detectable in stress fibers but not in retraction fibers (Fig. 7, c and d). BDM, an inhibitor of skeletal myosin ATPase (32Osterman A. Arner A. Malmqvist U. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has been used to demonstrate that Rho-stimulated contractility drives the formation of actin stress fibers (30Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). BDM also has been utilized to show the involvement of myosins in cell spreading (31Cramer L.P. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used this compound to study the effects of CNF1 on both the formation of actin stress fibers and on the induction of cell spreading. As shown in Fig. 8, a andb, BDM incubated with HEp-2 cells for 40 min at a concentration of 10 mm did not modify the F-actin and myosin immunoflorescent cell patterns, compared with control preparations (Fig. 7, a and b). BDM did block CNF1-induced stress fibers, myosin 2 relocalization (Fig. 8,e and f), however, being without effects on CNF1-induced retraction fibers (Fig. 8 e). The effects of BDM on CNF1-induced formation of stress fibers, relocalization of myosin 2, and cell spreading were totally reverted within a few minutes by replacing the cell culture medium, containing BDM, with fresh medium (data not shown). In the present study, by further investigating the activity of CNF1 at the molecular level, we have shown that CNF1 can provokein vitro a modification of Rho, inducing an increase in the molecular weight of the GTPase. This activity was probably specific on the Rho protein since Rac, Cdc42, Ras, and Rab6 did not show any alteration in their molecular weights after incubation with CNF1. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the gel electrophoresis system used to analyze the mobility of the different GTPases after exposure to CNF1 treatment could be unable to resolve the modified forms of Rac, Cdc42, Ras, and Rab. Other findings supporting the specific activity of CNF1 on Rho came from studies carried out with bacterial toxins acting on p21 Ras-like proteins. As shown previously (19Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CNF1 blocks most of the cytopathogenic effects of CdB on cells. CdB is a toxin known to monoglucosylate Rho (but also Rac and Cdc42) at threonine 37 (11Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that the CNF1-induced modification of Rhoin vitro does not impair the CdB glucosylation of this GTPase also when performed in vitro.2 It has been shown that Rho in the GTP-bound form is a weak substrate for CdB glucosylation (11Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). One possibility is that in vivo the CNF1-modified Rho has lost its ability to hydrolyze GTP, therefore being permanently bound to GTP and thus protected from the enzymatic activity of CdB. By contrast, CNF1 does not protect cells againstC. sordellii LT, which acts specifically on Ras, Rac, and Rap (by adding a glucose moiety at threonine 35 which corresponds to threonine 37 of Rho), but not on Rho (14Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have recently observed that, upon microinjection, CNF1-activated RhoA could induce the CNF1-phenotype. 3G. Flatau and P. Boquet, submitted for publication. This finding, together with the results obtained by microinjecting CNF1 directly into cells, clearly indicates that, inside the cells, CNF1 is able to trigger the same accumulation of actin stress fibers that occurs when cells are incubated with the toxin. Thus, CNF1 is a cytosolic-acting toxin and not a molecule inducing a cellular response through activation of an external membrane receptor, and Rho is, therefore, its cytosolic target. Several previous studies have suggested pathways by which Rho may affect the cytoskeletal organization (for review, see Ref. 2Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In particular, Rho has been shown to stimulate the activity of PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase, leading to an increase in PIP2 level in response to adhesion (22Chong L. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). CNF1 induced, in HEp-2 cells, an increase in the activity of PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase, this result indicating that the Rho protein was in its GTP-bound form or in a GTP-bound form-like upon activation by CNF1. In contrast, the PI 3-kinase activity in CNF1-treated HEp-2 cells resulted in being unaffected since i) the toxin-induced effects were not blocked by LY294002, a potent inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase, and ii) PI 3,4-P2 and PIP3amounts in treated cells were not increased. These findings indicate that the cascade of signaling molecules modulating the activity of the PI 3-kinase is not used by CNF1 to trigger its effects on the actin cytoskeleton. It is curious, however, that the increase in the in vitro measured activity of the PdtIns-4-P 5-kinase enzymatic activity associated with the cytoskeleton of CNF1-treated cells did not lead to a measurable accumulation of PIP2 into treated cells. It has been previously reported that serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells incubated with lysophosphatidic acid, a specific ligand activator of the Rho GTP-binding protein (2Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), did not accumulate PIP2(37Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that PIP2 syntesized under the control of Rho-GTP can be very rapidly hydrolyzed by a phospholipase. Accumulation of PIP2 in cells is probably harmful or lethal since this phosphoinositide is used for controlling of many different regulatory and enzymatic proteins. Recently, it has been shown that PIP2 allowed vinculin, one of the major proteins of focal contact points (38Jockush B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl C. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M. Rùdinger M. Schùlter K. Stanke G. Winkler J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), to be activated (24Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Upon interaction with PIP2, vinculin unmasks cryptic binding sites for talin and F-actin, thereby linking the cytoplasmic domain of integrins to stress fibers (38Jockush B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl C. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M. Rùdinger M. Schùlter K. Stanke G. Winkler J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our data concerning myosin 2 relocalization into stress fibers in CNF1-treated cells together with our results obtained with BDM are in favor of a mechanism in which activation of Rho by CNF1 may induce actin reorganization by the mechanism of acto-myosin tension. We cannot rule out, however, the possibility that in cells exposed to CNF1, a rapid transient increase in PIP2 does occur, thus adding to the above reported contractility mechanism, the one driven by vinculin activation proposed by Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge (30Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Finally, we would like to stress that CNF1, by activating Rho, might be a useful new toxin in studying this GTP-binding protein. We thank Heidy Schmid-Antomarchi (INSERM U364, Nice, France) for help in the PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase assay and Bernard Payrastre (INSERM U326, Hospital Purpan, 31059 Toulouse, France) for help in the determination of the cellular phosphoinositides content."
https://openalex.org/W2317053903,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) are two dominantly inherited disorders caused by germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. The RET gene codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase. The majority of MEN2A and FMTC mutations are clustered in the extra-cellular cysteine-rich domain and result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase through the formation of disulfide-bonded RET homodimers. Recently, two novel point mutations have been identified in the germline of five distinct FMTC families. Both mutations occur within the catalytic domain of the RET kinase and lead to the substitution of either glutamic acid 768 or valine 804 by an aspartic acid and a leucine respectively. We have introduced each FMTC mutation in two RET isoforms: RET51 the long isoform (1114 aa) and RET9 the short isoform (1072 aa) which differ in the C-terminal region of the protein. The RET51 isoform carrying either E768D or V804L mutation was autophosphorylated, displayed a transforming activity upon expression in Rat1 fibroblasts and induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. However, the transforming capacity of these RET51-FMTC mutants was found to be severalfold less potent compared to the same isoform carrying either the MEN2A mutation (C634R) or the MEN2B mutation (M918T). In contrast, RET9 containing mutations E768D or V804L was not autophosphorylated, exhibited a poor oncogenic potential in fibroblasts and did not promote neuritic outgrowth upon expression in PC12 cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate that mutations E768D and V804L are gain-of-function mutations that confer to the long RET isoform the capacity to exert a biological effect, although these mutations are more weakly activating than the MEN2A and MEN2B mutations. These results may provide a biochemical basis as to why the phenotypic consequences of these mutations are restricted to thyroid C-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2076036347,"To determine whether nitric oxide (NO) can modulate bradykinin (BK) signaling pathways, we treated endothelial cells with an NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), to determine its effect(s) on G-proteins (Gi and Gq) that are coupled to the type II kinin (BK2) receptor. Radioligand binding assays and Western analyses showed that GSNO (10–500 μm, 0–72 h) did not alter the expression of BK2 receptor, Gi, or Gq. However, GSNO caused a 6-fold increase in basal cGMP production and decreased high affinity BK bindings sites and GTPase activity by 74 and 85%, respectively. The cGMP analogue, dibutyryl-cGMP, also inhibited BK-stimulated GTPase activity by 74% suggesting that some of the effects of NO may be mediated through activation of guanylyl cyclase. The NO synthase inhibitor,N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine, inhibited endogenous NO synthase activity and cGMP production by 91 and 76%, respectively, but increased BK-stimulated GTPase activity by 61%. To determine which G-proteins are affected by NO, we performed GTP binding assays with [35S]GTPγS followed by immunoprecipitation with specific G-protein antisera. Both GSNO and dibutyryl-cGMP increased basal G-protein GTP binding activities by 18–26%. However, GSNO decreased BK-stimulated Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαq/11 GTP binding activity by 93, 61, and 90%, respectively, whereas epinephrine-stimulated Gαs GTP binding activity was unaffected.

The cellular effects of BK are mediated by seven transmembrane-spanning receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) (3Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J.

We have previously shown that bovine aortic endothelial cells contain predominantly the type II kinin (BK2) receptor that is coupled to G-proteins of the Gi and Gq family (5Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both Gi and Gq can activate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, which mobilizes intracellular calcium via the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (5Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Taylor S.J. Chae H.A. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H.

This intracellular calcium signal is necessary for many of the vascular responses elicited by BK including the release of endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) (8Loeb A.L. Izzo N.J. Johnson R.M. Garrison J.C. Peach M.J. Am. J. Cardiol. 1988; 62: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The stimulation of Gi proteins and phospholipase A2 by BK leads to the production of arachidonic acids and leukotrienes, which are important in mediating the inflammatory response (9Buckley B.J. Barchowsky A. Dolor R.J. Whorton A.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation of Gi proteins by BK can potentially decrease cAMP production via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (10Simonds W.F. Goldsmith P.K. Codina J. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7809-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The cAMP-dependent pathway serves to counteract many of the clinical symptoms associated with immune hypersensitivity reactions (11Austen K.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 291: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indeed, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as epinephrine, which activates the Gs-adenylyl cyclase pathway, are often administered to alleviate anaphylactic reactions (12Golbert T.M. Lucena G.E. Falleroni A.E. Booth B.H. Patterson R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1968; 278: 1180-1181PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, factors that modulate BK2 receptor-coupled G-proteins may influence the course and outcome of BK-mediated inflammatory processes. Sustained high levels of NO are produced during inflammatory conditions by cytokine-inducible type II NO synthase in resident and nonresident vascular cells (13Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J.

Although both BK and NO are released during immune hypersensitivity reactions, the effects of NO on BK-mediated responses are not known. Recent studies suggest that exogenous NO donors can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and stimulate p21 ras via S-nitrosylation of these signaling molecules (16Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 17Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been proposed for the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by NO in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (18Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies demonstrated activation of basal heterotrimeric G-protein activity by NO, it is not known which G-proteins are affected and how NO affects agonist-stimulated G-protein activity. Because BK and NO are important inflammatory mediators, the effects of NO on BK-mediated responses may have important clinical implications. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine whether NO can regulate BK signaling pathways via its effects on G-proteins that are coupled to the BK2 receptor.

All passages were performed with a disposable cell scraper (Costar Inc., Cambridge, MA), and only endothelial cells of less than 6 passages were used. Confluent endothelial cells (∼5 × 106) were treated with various concentrations of GSNO, dibutyryl-cGMP, and LNMA for the indicated time intervals. Treatment with GSNO was renewed every 12 h. Partially purified membranes were prepared from control and GSNO-treated endothelial cells as described previously (5Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin.

All reaction tubes and filters were pretreated overnight with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% polyethyleneimine, respectively, to decrease nonspecific binding. The assays were terminated by vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filters. Each filter was counted for 2 min in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 1800). Bovine aortic endothelial cell membrane contain only one kinin receptor, the BK2 subtype (22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm of HOE-140 (IC50 of 0.1 μm) and accounted for approximately 8% of total binding. The BK2 receptor density (B max) and affinity (K d) were determined by the Ligand Program of Munson and Rodbard (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal.

Membrane proteins (25 μg) and molecular weight markers were separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% running, 4% stacking gel) as described previously (5Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) prior to the addition of the following dilutions of specific rabbit polyclonal antisera: P4 (1:400), EC/2 (1:1000), QL (1:1000), and RM/1 (1:1000). The membranes were washed twice with PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then treated with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:4000) (Amersham Corp.). Radiographic chemiluminescence was performed several times at 23 °C, and the appropriate exposures were subjected to densitometric analysis. Membranes (30 μg) from endothelial cells treated with the indicated conditions for 24 h were incubated for 90 min at 22 °C in the presence or the absence of the indicated specific COOH-terminal antisera prior to GTPase assay. Preliminary studies revealed that maximal inhibition of receptor-G-protein coupling was achieved by the antisera at the following dilutions: P4 (1:50), EC/2 (1:50), QL (1:50), and RM/1 (1:100). The assay was initiated by the addition of BK (10 nm) to the reaction mixture consisting of [γ-32P]GTP (0.5 μm), GTP (2 μm), MgCl2 (5 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), NaCl (50 mm), creatine phosphate (4 mm), phosphocreatine kinase (5 units), ATP (0.1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), bacitracin (140 μg/ml), Captopril™ (1 μm), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (50 μg/ml), 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm), BSA (0.2%), and triethanolamine HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 22 °C and terminated with 500 μl of ice-cold 10% activated charcoal in 50 mm phosphoric acid. The mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and 300 μl of the supernatant containing the liberated [32P]Pi was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of GTPγS (10 μm) and represented between 4 and 15% of total activity. BK-stimulated GTPase activity was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific activity and expressed as mol/min/mg of membrane protein. Assays were performed in duplicate with less than 10% variation. Endothelial NO production was measured by [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline conversion as described previously (24Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent endothelial cells were treated with LNMA (5 mm), GSNO (0.5 mm), or dibutyryl-cGMP (0.1 mm) for 24 h. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and placed in 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer containing NaCl (118 mm), KCl (4.7 mm), CaCl2 (2.5 mm), MgSO4 (1.2 mm), KH2PO4 (1.2 mm), NaHCO3(25 mm), and glucose (11 mm), pH 7.4. After 5 min, [3H]arginine (10 μCi) and l-arginine (10 μm) were added to the buffer for 10 min followed by stimulation with BK (10 nm) for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The assay was terminated with ice-cold PBS containingl-arginine (5 mm) and EDTA (5 mm). The supernatant was removed, and the cells were scraped and lysed by a probe sonicator (Model W185F, Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY). Approximately 4 ml of this cellular extract and supernatant was applied to a column containing 2 ml of Dowex 50WX-8 resin (pre-equilibrated with NaOH) followed by elution of [3H]citrulline with 2 ml of water. A sample of the elutant (1 ml) was counted for 2 min in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 1800). The Dowex columns extracted >95% of [3H]arginine and retained <8% of [3H]citrulline (24Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Nonspecific activity was determined by [3H]citrulline production in the presence of excessl-arginine (5 mm) and represented approximately 7% of total activity. Cell number (5 × 106/T-150 cm2 culture flask) was determined using duplicate sets of confluent endothelial cells in another flask under corresponding treatment conditions followed by trypsinization and counting on a dispersion grid. The basal and BK-stimulated intracellular cGMP production were determined by cGMP radioimmunoassay as described previously with some modifications (25Schini V.B. Boulanger C. Regoli D. Vanhoutte P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 581-585PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent endothelial cells grown in 35-mm dishes were treated with LNMA (5 mm) or GSNO (0.5 mm) for 24 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in a buffer containing indomethacin (10 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm), Captopril™ (10 μm), NaCl (154 mm), KCl (5.6 mm), CaCl2 (2.0 mm), MgCl2 (1.0 mm), NaHCO3 (3.6 mm), glucose (5.6 mm), and HEPES (10 mm, pH 7.4). The endothelial cells were then stimulated with BK (10 nm) for 5 min, the medium was rapidly removed, and the reaction was terminated with 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%). Cells were disrupted by a probe sonicator and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant was extracted twice with three volumes of water-saturated ether prior to lyophilization and resuspension in a sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.2). The cGMP production was determined by a radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) using [125I]cGMP and expressed as picomoles/106 cells. Each experiment was performed in triplicate with corresponding standard curve in acetate buffer. Membrane proteins (30 μg) from control and GSNO-treated endothelial cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing [35S]GTPγS (20 nm), GTP (2 μm), MgCl2 (5 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), NaCl (50 mm), creatine phosphate (4 mm), phosphocreatine kinase (5 units), ATP (0.1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), bacitracin (140 μg/ml), captopril (1 μm), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (50 μg/ml), 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm), BSA (0.2%), and triethanolamine HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4). The assay was initiated by the addition of BK (10 nm) and terminated after 30 min with unlabeled GTPγS (100 μm). Samples were then resuspended in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%), SDS (0.1%), NaCl (150 mm), EDTA (5 mm), Tris-HCl (25 mm, pH 7.4), leupeptin (10 μg), aprotinin (10 μg), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). The following G-protein antisera with their corresponding final dilutions were added to the mixture: αi2 (P4, 1:20), αi3 (EC/2, 1:100), αq/11 (QL, 1:100), and αs (RM/1, 1:100). The samples were allowed to incubate for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The antibody-G-protein complexes were then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Preliminary studies indicated that all αi2,3, αq/11, and αs were completely precipitated by this procedure because Western blot analysis of the supernatant with the P4, EC/2, QL, and RM/1 antisera did not reveal the presence of 40–41 kDa proteins. The pellets were washed three times in a buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.4), NaF (100 μm), sodium phosphate (50 mm), NaCl (100 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), and SDS (0.1%). The final pellet containing the immunoprecipitated [35S]GTPγS-labeled G-protein was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 1800, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of unlabeled GTPγS (100 μm). Band intensities were analyzed densitometrically with the NIH Image program (26Rasband, W. (1993) NIH Image Program, version 1.49, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.Google Scholar). All values are expressed as means ± S.E. compared with controls and among separate experiments. EC50 and IC50 values were calculated by linear or logarithmic extrapolation. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine any significant changes in values. A significant difference was taken forp values less than 0.05. Relatively pure (>95%) bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures were confirmed by morphologic features and immunofluorescent staining with Factor VIII antibodies (results not shown). There were no observable adverse effects of GSNO, LNMA, or dibutyryl-cGMP on cell number, morphology, or immunofluorescent staining. Untreated bovine aortic endothelial cell membranes contain 94 ± 8 fmol/mg of BK2 receptor with a K d of 0.48 ± 0.07 nm. Treatment of endothelial cells with GSNO (10–500 μm) for 24 h did not affect total BK2 receptor density (B max of 95 ± 7 fmol/mg) or overall BK2 receptor affinity (K d = 0.52 ± 0.1 nm) (p > 0.05 for both). In a concentration-dependent manner, treatment with GSNO did not significantly affect the amount of Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαq/11 after 24 h as determined by densitometric analysis of band intensities on three separate Western blots (Fig.1 A). Similarly, in a time-dependent manner, GSNO (500 μm) had no effect on Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαq/11 protein levels for up to 72 h (Fig.1 B). The P4 (αi2), EC/2 (αi3), and QL (αq/11) antisera were quite specific because recognition of their respective α subunits could be blocked only in the presence of excess decapeptides from which they were derived (5Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,21Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, LNMA (5 mm), also did not affect the amount of any G-protein α subunits. In addition, the amount of αs and common β subunit as determined by the RM/1 and SW/1 antisera, respectively, was also unaffected by GSNO (500 μm) or LNMA (5 mm). We have previously shown that the type II kinin (BK2) receptor is the predominant BK receptor subtype in bovine aortic endothelial cells (22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding studies showed that untreated endothelial cell membranes contain two BK2 receptor binding sites (Fig.2 A). The high affinity agonist binding site that constitutes 32% of the total BK2receptor sites has a K d of 14 ± 3 pm and a B max of 27 ± 5 fmol/mg. The low affinity BK2 binding site that constitutes 68% of the total BK2 receptor sites has aK d of 480 ± 42 pm and aB max of 67 ± 6 fmol/mg. Treatment with increasing concentrations of GSNO (1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μm) for 24 h progressively decreased the amount of BK2 receptor high affinity binding site (IC50value of 54 ± 11 μm) (Fig. 2 B). Maximal decrease in BK2 receptor high affinity binding site occurred at a GSNO concentration of 500 μm, which converted 74% of BK2 receptor high affinity agonist binding sites (20 fmol/mg) to low affinity binding sites (K d of 520 ± 40 pm,B max of 87 ± 5 fmol/mg) (Fig.2 A). Complete conversion of BK2 receptor high affinity agonist binding sites to low affinity sites (K d of 520 ± 64 pm,B max of 94 ± 5 fmol/mg) was observed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS (10 μm). In a concentration-dependent manner, stimulation of endothelial cell membranes with of BK (0.1–100 nm) produced a progressive increase in GTPase activity with maximal activity (15.0 ± 2.0 pmol/min/mg) occurring at a BK concentration of 10 nm (Fig.3 A). The EC50value for BK-stimulated GTPase activity was 2.4 ± 0.4 nm. When membranes from endothelial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GSNO (10–500 μm), there was a progressive decrease in BK-stimulated GTPase activity (Fig.3 B). The calculated IC50 for GSNO by logarithmic extrapolation was 32 ± 6 μm. At a GSNO concentration of 500 μm, a maximal 85% reduction in BK-stimulated GTPase activity (2.3 ± 0.7 pmol/min/mg) was observed (p < 0.01). Untreated or control endothelial cells have a basal cGMP production of 0.24 ± 0.08 pmol/106 cells. Stimulation with increasing concentrations of BK (0.1–100 nm) produced a progressive increase in cGMP levels with an EC50 of 1.9 ± 0.3 nm and a maximal 10.3-fold increase in cGMP production at a BK concentration of 10 nm (2.5 ± 0.3 pmol/106 cells, p < 0.001) (Fig.4 A). Inhibition of endothelial NO synthase by 5 mm of LNMA (IC50 of 0.8 ± 0.1 mm) resulted in 63 and 92% reductions in the corresponding basal and BK-stimulated cGMP levels (0.09 ± 0.04 and 0.21 ± 0.07 pmol/106 cells, respectively) (p < 0.05 for both) (Fig. 4 B). Endothelial cells treated with 500 μm of GSNO (EC50 of 44 ± 6 μm) showed a maximal 6-fold increase in basal cGMP levels after 24 h (0.24 ± 0.08 pmol/106 cells to 1.5 ± 0.2 pmol/106cells, p < 0.01). However, stimulation with BK (10 nm) did not result in any further increase in cGMP production from basal levels in GSNO-treated cells (1.8 ± 0.2 pmol/106 cells, p > 0.05). Compared with untreated or control cells, GSNO-treated cells showed a 28% decrease in BK-stimulated cGMP production (2.5 ± 0.3 pmol/106cells versus 1.8 ± 0.2 pmol/106 cells,p < 0.05). To determine whether endogenous NO, GSNO, or dibutyryl-cGMP can regulate BK-stimulated G-protein and NO synthase activity, endothelial cells were treated with 5 mm of LNMA (EC50 of 0.6 ± 0.1 mm), 500 μm of GSNO (EC50 of 45 ± 6 μm), or 100 μm of dibutyryl-cGMP (EC50 of 23 ± 5 μm) for 24 h. Control endothelial cells have a BK-stimulated GTPase and NO synthase activity of 15 ± 2.0 pmol/min/mg and 23 ± 2.1 pmol/min/107 cells, which represent a 3- and 11-fold increase from basal GTPase and NO synthase activity, respectively (Fig.5). Treatment with LNMA (5 mm) caused a maximal 86% reduction in endothelial NO synthase activity (2.0 ± 0.9 pmol/min/107 cells, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5). This inhibition of endothelial NO synthase activity by LNMA corresponded to a 61% increase in BK-stimulated GTPase activity (24 ± 3.4 pmol/min/mg, p < 0.05), suggesting that endogenous endothelial NO production serves to tonically inhibit BK-stimulated G-protein activity. Pretreatment with GSNO (500 μm, 24 h) caused a 81 ± 5% and 77 ± 4% decrease in BK-stimulated GTPase and NO synthase activity, respectively (p < 0.001 for both) (Fig. 5). Comparable 80 ± 5% and 75 ± 5% decrease in BK-stimulated GTPase and NO synthase activity were observed when endothelial cells were treated with dibutyryl-cGMP (100 μm, 24 h) (p > 0.05 for both values when compared with GSNO treatment). These findings suggest that the mechanism by which endogenous and exogenous NO exerts its inhibitory effects on BK-stimulated G-proteins and NO synthase is mediated through cGMP-dependent pathways. In control (untreated) endothelial cells, basal GTPase activity was 4.8 ± 0.5 pmol/min/mg. Stimulation with BK (10 nm) produced a maximal 3.1-fold increase in GTPase activity (15 ± 3.7 pmol/min/mg, p < 0.01) (Fig.6 A). Treatment with 500 μm of GSNO (EC50 of 45 ± 6 μm) caused a greater increase in basal GTPase activity than treatment with 100 μm of dibutyryl-cGMP (EC50 of 25 ± 5 μm) (7.2 ± 0.6versus 6.0 ± 0.4 pmol/min/mg, p < 0.05). However, treatment with either GSNO or dibutyryl-cGMP completely inhibited BK-stimulated GTPase activities to their corresponding basal levels (6.8 ± 0.5 and 6.5 ± 0.7 pmol/min/mg, respectively,p < 0.05). To determine whether GSNO inhibited BK-stimulated GTPase activity via direct uncoupling of BK2 receptor from Gi and Gq, we performed BK- and epinephrine-stimulated GTPase assays on membranes from untreated (control) or GSNO-treated cells in the presence of antibodies directed against the carboxyl terminus of specific G-protein α subunits. We have previously shown that 1:50 dilutions of P4, EC/2, and QL antisera maximally and specifically uncouple αi2, αi3, and αq/11from the BK2 receptor in bovine aortic endothelial cells, respectively (5Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of these antibodies can be reversed only in the presence of excess peptides from which the antibodies were generated. In control or untreated cells, BK-stimulated GTPase activity was decreased by 42 ± 3, 52 ± 6, and 66 ± 6% in the presence of P4 (αi2), EC/2 (αi3), and QL (αq/11), respectively (p < 0.05 for all) (Fig. 6 B). The combination of P4, EC/2, and QL reduced BK-stimulated GTPase activity by 95 ± 3% (p < 0.01). The RM/1 antibody (αs) had no effect on BK-stimulated GTPase activity but did decrease isoproterenol (10 μm)-stimulated GTPase activity by 79 ± 4% in control cells (p < 0.01). In cells treated with GSNO (500 μm, 24 h), BK-stimulated GTPase activity was reduced by 78 ± 3% (p < 0.01), whereas isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity was completely unaffected (p > 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2010106126,"The translocated and normal bcl-2 alleles in the DHL-4 cell line with the t(14;18) translocation were separated by pulsed field electrophoresis. An in vivofootprint over a potential WT1 binding site in the bcl-2 5′-flanking sequence was identified on the normal silent allele. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the bcl-2 WT1 site demonstrated a single specific complex. UV cross-linking and Western analysis revealed that this gel shift complex contained WT1 protein. Deletion or mutation of the WT1 site resulted in an increase in activity of the bcl-2 promoter in DHL-4 cells. Cotransfection with a 3:1 ratio of a WT1 expression vector to thebcl-2 promoter construct led to a 3.0-fold repression of the bcl-2 promoter. Cotransfection with a WT1 expression vector and the bcl-2 promoter with the mutated WT1 site resulted in only 1.2-fold repression. We conclude that the WT1 site functions as a negative regulatory site for the normal silentbcl-2 allele in t(14;18) lymphomas. The WT1 site is not occupied on the translocated bcl-2 allele.

We conclude that the WT1 site functions as a negative regulatory site for the normal silentbcl-2 allele in t(14;18) lymphomas. The WT1 site is not occupied on the translocated bcl-2 allele. The bcl-2 gene was originally identified by its involvement in the t(14;18) translocation that is associated with human follicular lymphoma (1Yunis J.J. Science. 1983; 221: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The translocation of bcl-2 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus leads to deregulated expression ofbcl-2, and high levels of bcl-2 mRNA are detected in cells with the t(14;18) translocation (2Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 3Graninger W.B. Seto M. Boutain B. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of bcl-2 is entirely from the translocated allele and that the normal allele is silent (3Graninger W.B. Seto M. Boutain B. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of the deregulation of bcl-2 is unknown, regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin locus may play a role. It is also not known how the normal allele is silenced. The deregulatedbcl-2 gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma. Transgenic mice containing abcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene show a polyclonal expansion of B cells with prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Progression to high grade lymphomas is seen in these mice (4McDonnell T.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The major transcriptional promoter for bcl-2 in B cells, P1, is located 1386–1423 base pairs upstream of the translation start site (5Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This is a TATA-less, GC-rich promoter that displays multiple start sites. A minor promoter, P2, utilized in some cell types, is located 1.3 kilobases downstream from the first one (5Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Several negative regulatory sites have been described in the bcl-2 promoter region. One of these negative regulatory elements, is located upstream of the P2 promoter (6Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The proteins that bind to this element have not been identified, although p53 was shown to mediate down-regulation ofbcl-2 either directly or indirectly through a 195-base pair segment of this region (7Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously described three π1 binding sites, which are negative regulators of bcl-2 expression in pre-B cells (8Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal pre-B cells express very littlebcl-2, and extensive cell death by apoptosis occurs at this developmental stage. Levels of Bcl-2 protein are increased in mature B cells. We have found that the three π1 sites are not functional in mature B cells (8Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of the bcl-2 promoter by the WT1 protein in HeLa cells has been described recently (9Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. McDonnell T.J. Rauscher F.J.I. Saunders G.F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5386-5389PubMed Google Scholar). There are several potential WT1 binding sites in the bcl-2 promoter, and it is not clear whether all of them are functional. We have recently characterized the regulatory regions, including a cAMP-responsive element (CRE), 1The abbreviations used are: CRE, cAMP-responsive element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor II; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. that are responsible for the positive regulation of bcl-2 expression during B-cell activation in mature B cells and during rescue from calcium-dependent apoptosis of immature B cells (10Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We have found that a CRE element mediates the increase in bcl-2 expression following surface immunoglobulin cross-linking in mature B cells or treatment with phorbol esters in both mature and immature B cells. We are studying in vivo protein binding to both the normal and translocated bcl-2 alleles in follicular lymphoma cells with a t(14;18) translocation. We identified an in vivofootprint at a CRE site in the 5′-flanking sequence of the translocatedbcl-2 gene, and we demonstrated that CREB family proteins bound to this site in vitro and that the maximal increase inbcl-2 promoter expression mediated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers in transient transfection experiments was dependent on the CRE site (11Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the CRE site functions as a positive regulatory element for the translocatedbcl-2 allele in follicular lymphoma with the t(14;18) translocation. We now describe an in vivo footprint over a potential WT1 site on the normal bcl-2 allele; this site is not occupied on the translocated allele. The putative Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (wt1) encodes a zinc finger DNA binding protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor (12Rauscher R.J.I. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III., R.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The WT1 protein binds to the target sequence GNGNGGGNG, which is also recognized by the zinc finger transcription factors EGR-1, EGR-2, and EGR-3. The gene for WT1 is mainly expressed in the developing kidney, testis, ovary, and spleen (14Pritchard-Jones K. Fleming S. Davidson D. Bickmore W. Porteous D. Gosden C. Bard J. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Housman D. Heyningen V.V. Hastie N. Nature. 1990; 346: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the WT1 protein may play an important role in hematopoiesis, since it is expressed in immature hematopoietic cells and also in acute myeloid, acute lymphoblastic, and chronic myeloid leukemia cells (15Fraizer G.C.

The erythrocyte/megakaryocyte transcription factor GATA-1 is a positive regulator of WT1 expression in certain hematopoietic cells (18Wu Y. Fraizer G.C. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5944-5949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that WT1 protein binds to a consensus binding site in the bcl-2 promoter and that cotransfection of a WT1 expression vector decreases expression from the bcl-2 promoter. The presence of the immunoglobulin 3′-enhancers abrogates the repression by WT1. The bcl-2-promoter-luciferase constructs have been described previously (10Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 11Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol.

A construct with a mutated WT1 site was generated from the −1640 construct using a technique described by Higuchi (19Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. Recombinant PCR. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequence used for the PCR primer is (mutated bases are in boldface and the WT1 site is underlined): CCCCTTCCTAATGCGCCCGCCC. All plasmid sequences were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical). The WT1 expression vector consisted of the full-length coding region of the gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (20Patwardhan S. Gashler A. Siegel M.G. Chang L.C. Joseph L.J. Shows T.B. LeBeau M.M. Sukhatme V.P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 917-928PubMed Google Scholar). DHL-4 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. This cell line has a t(14;18) translocation. DNA transfections were performed with cells in log phase (5–6 × 105 cells/ml). The cells were washed with RPMI and resuspended at 3 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI medium containing 25 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (21Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6739-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A total of 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA was added, and electroporation was performed with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 960 microfarads and 320 mV. Transfected cells were cultured in 25 ml of supplemented RPMI medium for 48 h. Reporter gene activity was determined by the luciferase assay system (Promega), and luminescence was quantitated with an LKB 1251 luminometer. Variation in transfection efficiency was controlled for by cotransfection with 5 μg of a Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat-β-galactosidase plasmid. Each assay was performed at least three times in duplicate with at least two different plasmid preparations. The normalized average values with standard deviations were plotted. DHL-4 cells were embedded in agarose plugs, lysed with detergent, and treated with proteinase K as described (22Zelenetz A. Chu G. Galili N. Bangs C.D. Horning S.J. Donton T.A. Cleary M.L. Levy R. Blood. 1991; 78: 1552-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NotI digestion was performed, and the samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA for 23 h at 160 V (5.5 V/cm) at room temperature with a pulse time of 55 s. The translocated bcl-2 gene yields a 520-kilobase band (11Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with dimethyl sulfate was performed as described previously (23Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2699-2706PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis of the DNA, one lane of the gel was transferred to a filter; a probe forbcl-2, pFL1 (25Cleary M.L. Sklar J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7439-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and a probe for JH (26Ravetch J.V. Siebenlist U. Korsmeyer S. Waldmann T. Leder P. Cell. 1981; 27: 583-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) were used sequentially to locate the two bcl-2 alleles. The DNA in these two regions was eluted from the gel. Cleavage with piperidine was performed according to the Maxam-Gilbert procedure (27Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Chemically modified and cleaved DNA was then subjected to amplification by ligation-mediated PCR essentially as described by Mueller and Wold (28Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), Pfeifer et al. (29Pfeifer G. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D.

A. 1992; 89: 1021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Sequenase was used for first strand synthesis, and Taq DNA polymerase was used for PCR. Conditions used for amplification were 95 °C for 2 min, 61 °C for 2 min, and 76 °C for 3 min. After 20–22 cycles of PCR, samples were hybridized with end-labeled primers (primer#3 of each primer set) and amplified by one more cycle of PCR. The reaction mixes were resolved in a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The primers used for PCR were purified on Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide purification cartridges. The common linkers used were GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC and GAATTCAGATC. The primers for the coding strand were TTCGCTGGCAGCGGCGG, GGCGGGGCCACGGAG, and GGCGGGGCCACGGAGAG. The noncoding strand primers were GACGTTACGCACAGGAAACCG, TCGGGCTGTGCAGAGAATGAAG, and CGGGCTGTGCAGAGAATGAAGTAAG. Quantitation of footprints was performed as described previously (23Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2699-2706PubMed Google Scholar) with ImageQuant software version 4.15 (Molecular Dynamics). Percent protection values of below 20% were considered too low and were not interpreted as footprints. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used for EMSA of the WT1 region are shown below with the WT1 site underlined and the mutated bases in boldface. The B1 WT1 site in the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) P3 promoter was used as a positive control (31Drummond I.A. Rupprecht H.D. Rohwer-Nutter P. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Madden S.L. Rauscher F.J.I.

Binding conditions were as follows: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 ng (104 cpm) of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 10 μg of protein from crude nuclear extract. Leupeptin (0.3 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm), antipain (0.3 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml) were included in all nuclear extract buffers. Samples were incubated in the presence or absence of excess competitor oligonucleotides for 15 min at room temperature. Electrophoresis was performed at 30 mA at 4 °C in a 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA 5% polyacrylamide gel. For the supershifts, 1 μg of an antibody specific for a region near the N terminus of WT1 (180 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an antibody specific for a region near the C terminus of WT1 (C-19 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in EMSA with the conditions above. EMSA was performed as described above. UV cross-linking was performed as described previously (32Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 12.5.1-12.5.6Google Scholar) with a short-wavelength UV light box at 4 °C for 60 min. An autoradiograph of the wet gel was used to locate the EMSA complexes. Regions of the gel containing the complexes were cut out, and the individual complexes were eluted at room temperature overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The eluted protein was precipitated with four volumes of acetone, washed with ethanol, and dried. After resuspension in Laemmli loading buffer, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The Amersham ECL kit was used for Western analysis. The WT1 antibodies, 180 and C-19, are described above. The translocated and normal bcl-2 alleles from DHL-4 cells were separated by pulsed field electrophoresis as described previously (11Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated PCR was performed on each one. With primer sets that cover a region of the bcl-2 5′-flanking region, we found a footprint located on the normal bcl-2 allele that was not present on the translocated bcl-2 allele (Fig.1). Two guanine residues were protected on the coding strand, and six guanine residues demonstrated protection on the noncoding strand. The protected sequence is similar to the WT1 consensus sequence. Although there are several potential WT1 sites in the bcl-2 promoter, we found protection of only one of these sites. A double-stranded oligonucleotide that encompassed the protected sequence was used in EMSA. Two complexes were formed with thebcl-2 WT1 oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A, lane 1). Competition with excess cold oligonucleotide demonstrated that only the more rapidly migrating complex was specific (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 3). A 100-fold molar excess of the mutated WT1 oligonucleotide did not compete against the specific complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). The mutated WT1 oligonucleotide did not form the specific complex (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6–10). Cross-competition with the IGF-II P3 B1 site was performed in EMSA to determine whether the same protein bound to the bcl-2 WT1 site and the IGF-II P3 B1 site. As shown in Fig. 2 B(lanes 1–3), the IGF-II site competed with thebcl-2 WT1 site for protein binding. The bcl-2 WT1 site also competed with the labeled IGF-II site for protein binding (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6). Supershift experiments were performed with antibodies that recognize either a region near the N terminus of the WT1 protein or a region near the C terminus of WT1. As shown in Fig. 2 B (lane 8), the specific EMSA complex was decreased in intensity in the presence of the antibody against the N terminus of WT1, and a supershifted complex was visible. The addition of the antibody against the C terminus of WT1 caused a reduction in the intensity of the specific complex, but no supershifted complex was visible (Fig.2 B, lane 9). It is possible that this antibody interferes with efficient binding of WT1 to DNA since the DNA binding domain is located near the C terminus. To further characterize the proteins that bind to the bcl-2 WT1 site, UV cross-linking followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with the specific EMSA complex (Fig.3 A). UV cross-linking yielded a protein of 63 kDa. Correction for bound oligonucleotide predicted a protein of 50 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Western analysis was performed on the UV cross-linked protein with an antibody against a region near the C terminus of WT1. As shown in Fig.3 B (lane 2), the protein present in this EMSA complex reacted with an antibody against WT1. In addition, a reactive protein of 50 kDa was also seen. Most likely this was uncross-linked protein that was present in the EMSA complex. To obtain a more accurate estimate of the molecular mass of the protein in this complex, Western analysis without UV cross-linking was performed. A protein of molecular mass of 50 kDa was observed (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). When the Western analysis of the UV cross-linked protein was performed with an antibody against a region near the N terminus of WT1, the same protein bands were seen (Fig. 3, compare D, lane 2, with B, lane 2). No cross-linked protein or protein reactive with either WT1 antibody was observed when the corresponding region of the gel from EMSA with the mutated WT1 site was analyzed (Fig. 3, A–D, lane 1). From these results, one can conclude that WT1 does not simply comigrate with the EMSA complex during electrophoresis through the nondenaturing gel. To determine whether the WT1 site in thebcl-2 5′-region had any functional activity, transient transfection experiments were performed. The constructs for the transient transfection experiments are illustrated in Fig.4 A. As shown in Fig.4 B, deletion of the bcl-2 WT1 site resulted in an increase in activity of approximately 2.1-fold. The activity of these deletion constructs of the bcl-2 was low because the positive regulatory region had been deleted. To study the function of the WT1 site in the context of the full-length promoter, a mutation was constructed in this site. Mutation of the WT1 site resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in promoter activity compared with the full-length wild-type promoter (Fig. 4 C). To ascertain whether WT1 was the active transcription factor, cotransfection experiments were performed. Transfection of a WT1 expression vector with the full-length bcl-2 promoter resulted in a 1.4-fold decrease in activity at a 1:1 ratio and a 3.0-fold decrease at a 3:1 ratio of WT1 to bcl-2 construct (Fig. 5 A). The majority of this repression was mediated through the single WT1 site because mutation of this site in the bcl-2 promoter resulted in a reduced level of repression of the promoter. At a 3:1 ratio, the activity was decreased by 1.2-fold (Fig. 5 B). Addition of enhancer regions 3′ of the murine immunoglobulin gene to the bcl-2 promoter-luciferase construct (diagrammed in Fig.6 A) resulted in a 20-fold increase in activity (Fig. 6 B). We wished to determine whether mutation of the WT1 site would lead to a further increase in activity in the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers. The WT1 site was mutated, and transient transfection experiments were performed in DHL-4 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 B, there was no significant change in the bcl-2 promoter activity when the WT1 site was mutated in the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers. We also examined the effect of cotransfection of a WT1 expression vector on the bcl-2 promoter activity in the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers. Even at a ratio of 3:1 WT1 expression vector to the bcl-2-luciferase construct, there was no significant change (1.07-fold decrease) in the bcl-2 promoter activity (Fig. 6 C). These results suggest that the immunoglobulin enhancers modify the activity or accessibility of the WT1 site in thebcl-2 promoter. In vivo footprinting has been used to identify a region in the bcl-2 promoter that is occupied on the silent normal allele but not on the translocated allele. We have shown by several different techniques that the WT1 protein binds to this site in vitro. Two complexes were observed with EMSA with thebcl-2 WT1 site. Only the faster migrating complex was specific, and it contained a protein of 50 kDa as demonstrated by UV cross-linking studies. Western analysis showed that this protein reacted with two antibodies against WT1. The B1 WT1 site of the IGF-II P3 promoter competed for binding in EMSA with the bcl-2 WT1 site. We have shown that the WT1 site has functional activity in DHL-4 cells. Deletion or mutation of this site resulted in an increase inbcl-2 promoter activity. Cotransfection with a WT1 expression vector repressed the bcl-2 promoter activity, and the majority of the repression was relieved by mutation of the WT1 site in the bcl-2 promoter. Although WT1 and EGR1 bind to similar DNA sequences, we believe that the in vivo footprint we observed is most likely due to WT1, since it is associated with negative regulatory activity and because cotransfection with an EGR1 expression vector had no effect on bcl-2 promoter activity. 2E. Mochon and L. M. Boxer, unpublished data. However, it is possible that EGR1 can also bind to this site in vivo and influence bcl-2 promoter activity. Hewitt et al. (9Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. McDonnell T.J. Rauscher F.J.I. Saunders G.F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5386-5389PubMed Google Scholar) described repression of thebcl-2 promoter by WT1 in cotransfection experiments in HeLa cells. Because there are several potential WT1 sites in thebcl-2 promoter, it was not clear which site or sites mediated this repression. We found an in vivo footprint over a single WT1 site on the normal bcl-2 allele. Our studies with cotransfection of WT1 and mutation of this site suggest that, at least in DHL-4 cells, this is the major functional site. In transient transfection experiments, we showed that the WT1 site in the bcl-2 promoter demonstrated little activity in the presence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers. Mutation of this site did not lead to an increase in bcl-2 promoter activity. In cotransfection experiments with a WT1 expression vector, we were not able to demonstrate significant repression of thebcl-2 promoter in the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers. These findings and the results of the in vivofootprinting studies suggest that the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers prevents repression of the bcl-2 promoter by WT1. It is possible that the activity of the WT1 protein is influenced by the immunoglobulin enhancers; for example, the activators bound to the enhancers may be able to overcome the repression function of WT1. It is interesting to note that two tumor suppressor gene products, WT1 and p53, have been shown to negatively regulate the bcl-2 promoter. These genes are frequently deleted or mutated in malignancies, and this may lead to increased bcl-2 expression and an increased resistance to apoptosis. WT1 protein is expressed in the DHL-4 cell line, and it participates in the repression of the normal bcl-2 allele, while it has no effect on the translocated allele. We have shown that the CRE site in the bcl-2 promoter functions as a positive regulatory element in transfection studies (10Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and we believe that it is involved in the expression of the translocated bcl-2 allele in t(14;18) lymphomas. This site is occupied on the translocated bcl-2 allele and not on the normal allele, as indicated by in vivo footprinting (11Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is likely that the deregulation of the translocated bcl-2 allele is a consequence of interactions between the bcl-2 promoter region and regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin locus. Previously we have demonstrated that several of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancers increase bcl-2 promoter activity and that the maximal increase is dependent on an intact bcl-2 CRE site (11Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We now show that a WT1 site is occupied on the normal silent bcl-2 allele and that it functions as a negative regulatory site. This site appears to have little activity in the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers. We are currently investigating the interactions between the transcription factors that bind the immunoglobulin enhancers and the transcription factors that bind to the translocated bcl-2 promoter in t(14;18) lymphoma cells."

Proteins of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; Hsc70, the constitutive isoform of Hsp70; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair. family participate in numerous cellular functions such as protein folding, protein translocation across membranes, and reorganization of macromolecular complexes (1Hartl F.U.

The underlying basis of these apparently diverse functions is the ability of Hsp70 proteins to interact reversibly with extended polypeptide segments of at least 7 residues generally containing large hydrophobic and basic side chains (3Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp70 proteins contain an amino-terminal 44-kDa ATPase domain, a 18-kDa substrate-binding domain, and a 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain (4Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain is the least conserved of the three Hsp70 domains and is therefore also referred to as the variable domain (5McKay D.B. Wilbanks S.M. Flaherty K.M. Ha J.H. O'Brian M.C. Shirvanee L.S. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 137-177Google Scholar). The type of nucleotide present in the ATPase domain determines the accessibility of the substrate-binding site for substrates. Thus ATP promotes and ADP inhibits substrate release (6Palleros D.R.

The structure of a recombinant fragment of DnaK (bacterial Hsp70) that includes the substrate-binding domain and most of the 10-kDa variable domain reveals that the first half (Asp391-Ile501) has the form of a β-sandwich while the second (Glu509-His606) folds into five α-helical segments (8Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Substrates bind in an extended conformation to a channel formed by loops of the β-sandwich. The second helix, designated αB, covers the binding channel like a lid, thereby presumably preventing the escape of bound substrates (see Fig.9). It has been suggested that the binding of ATP induces conformational changes that expose the substrate-binding channel by displacement of the αβ-helix (8Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP would have the opposite effect. The intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70 is very low but is synergistically stimulated by substrates and by members of the DnaJ protein family. Other factors, such as GrpE in bacteria (9Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Hip in eukaryotes, respectively, enhance or inhibit nucleotide exchange (10Höhfeld J.

Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The feature common to all DnaJ homologues is the J domain, a conserved module of about 70 residues, which is essential for the interaction with Hsp70 proteins (12Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Patel D. Hartl F.U. McColl D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Two of the helices are engaged in coiled-coil interactions. The absolutely conserved and functionally essential tripeptide, “HPD,” forms part of a connecting loop between the two antiparallel helices. Less conserved charged residues on the helix exteriors may recognize particular Hsp70 isoforms (15Qian Y.Q. Patel D. Hartl F.U. McColl D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Other unrelated domains in DnaJ proteins are believed to be involved in recognition of substrates for Hsp70s (11Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, the combination of a given J domain with a substrate recognition domain allows the targeting of a Hsp70 protein to a specific substrate or class of substrates. DnaJ and auxilin appear to be representatives of two types of DnaJ class proteins; the former displays affinity for a broad range of denatured polypeptides (11Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) wheras auxilin acquired a high specificity for assembled clathrin (17Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E.

Clathrin is the major structural component of the regular polygonal lattice that encases a certain type of intracellular transport vesicle (20Pearse B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Binding of auxilin to assembled clathrin initiates Hsc70-dependent release of clathrin protomers (triskelia) from the vesicle membrane (18Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Although the auxilin J domain differs considerably from that of DnaJ or Hdj-1, key residues, known to be engaged in the formation of the hydrophobic core, and the essential HPD segment are conserved (18Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Moreover, the auxilin J domain binds to Hsc70 and stimulates its ATPase (19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nothing less than intact Hsc70 has previously been reported to uncoat clathrin-coated vesicles (4Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsai M.Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5958-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chymotryptic 60-kDa fragment lacking the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain would bind only to free clathrin triskelia and to unfolded peptide substrates. More recently a DnaK mutant with a deletion of 94 residues at the carboxyl terminus was reported to interact poorly with immobilized DnaJ (22Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and similarly, a human Hsp70 lacking the conserved carboxyl-terminal motif EEVD could no longer be stimulated by the DnaJ homologue Hdj-1 and failed to refold denatured luciferase (23Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations seemingly imply that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Hsp70 interacts with DnaJ homologues and is essential for a complete Hsp70-mediated reaction cycle. The ATP-induced complex between the auxilin J domain and Hsc70 is relatively stable (19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Jiang R.-F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This made it possible to isolate complexes containing both proteins. It should therefore be in principal possible to identify the Hsc70 domains that participate in this interaction. Here we demonstrate that the variable 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain of Hsc70 is not required for the binding of auxilin or for the in vitro uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. Our results suggest instead that in the ATP-bound state of Hsc70 the ATPase domain interacts with the substrate-binding domain to create a binding site for the J domain. The construction of plasmids used for the expression of GST-auxilin-(547–910), GST-auxilin-(813–910), and GST-auxilin-(547–814) has been described in detail elsewhere (19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). BovHsc70.pRSET which was used for the construction of recombinant Hsc70 fragments was a kind gift from Dr. McKay (Stanford). The construct no longer contained a mutation present in the original clone (25DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which changed the glutamic acid at position 543 to a lysine. 2D. B. McKay, personal communication. For the construction of PGEXHsc70-(1–540) BovHsc70.pRSET was digested with NdeI and EcoRI. The 1621-bp fragment was treated with Klenow enzyme and inserted into the SmaI site of the expression vector PGEX-4T-1. PGEXHsc70-(373–650) was obtained by digestion of BovHsc70.pRSET with Nar1 andHindIII. The resulting 876-bp fragment was blunted using Klenow enzyme and inserted into the SmaI site of the expression vector PGEX-4T-1. PGEXHsc70-(373–540) was obtained byEcoRI digestion of PGEXHsc70-(373–650). The excised 368-bpEcoRI fragment was removed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the vector with the remaining insert re-ligated. PGEXHsc70-(540–650) was constructed by ligation of the 368-bpEcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of PGEX-4T-3. All restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The pGEX-vectors were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Coated vesicles and clathrin were purified from frozen bovine brains and adrenal gland (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR) as detailed elsewhere (26Campbell C.H. Fine R.E. Squicciarini J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2628-2633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ungewickell E. Plessmann U. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Adrenal clathrin coats were prepared by extracting clathrin and adaptors from adrenal coated vesicles with 0.5 m Tris-Cl (28Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were reassembled into coats by dialysis against buffer A (0.1 mMes, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5). The coats were harvested by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in buffer C (20 mmHEPES, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NH4SO4, pH 7.0). Bovine Hsc70 was purified as described previously (29Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang T.F. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaK was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain TG1 which was transformed with plasmid pJMII (31McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 764-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described elsewhere (30Wang T.F. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Hsp70 was expressed in BL21 which was transformed with the construct pETWTHsp70 (32Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), kindly supplied by Dr. Evan Eisenberg (National Institutes of Health). The bacteria were grown for 3 h at 36 °C and after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for another 3 h at 28 °C. Hsp70 was isolated from the bacterial lysate following a procedure developed for the purification of recombinant rat Hsc70 (33Wang C. Lee M.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GST-Hsc70 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli Bl21. The cells were grown for 3 h at 36 °C in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then for 3 h at 22 °C in presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were lysed by sonication as described elsewhere (32Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's instructions. In most cases the fusion proteins were further purified by gel filtration in buffer C on Superose 12 (Pharmacia). GST-Hsc70-(1–540) used for ATPase determinations was further purified by hydroxyapatite adsorption chromatography. Approximately 2 mg of protein were applied to a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The protein was eluted with a 20-ml gradient ranging from 0 to 500 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and then once more affinity purified on GSH-Sepharose. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically. Extinction coefficients were calculated from the amino acid compositions. In some instances the GST moiety of GST-auxilin-(547–910) and GST-auxilin-(547–814) was cleaved by digesting 1 mg of fusion protein with 1 unit of thrombin (number 154163 from ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 16 h at 20 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. The reaction was terminated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The GST moiety was removed by affinity chromatography and thrombin by gel filtration on Superose 12. The purified fusion proteins were concentrated in Centricon microconcentrators and stored frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C. To convert Hsc70 into its ATP- or ADP-bound state, the protein was preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C in buffer C supplemented with either 3 mm ATP or 3 mm ADP. Digestions with chymotrypsin were carried out as detailed in the legend to Fig. 3. The reaction was terminated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm. Coated vesicles (0.4 μm) from bovine brain in buffer C were supplemented with GST-auxilin-(547–910) (0.2 μm) before they were used as substrate in the uncoating assay. This was done to make sure that the endogenous auxilin was not a limiting factor in the uncoating reaction. Dissociation experiments were performed in volumes of 75–100 μl in buffer C supplemented with 2 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), and 5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) (34Braell W.A. Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The incubation time was 15 min and the temperature 25 °C. Protein concentrations are stated in the legends to the figures. Dissociated clathrin was separated from baskets by ultracentrifugation (20 min at 109,000 × g) using a Beckman TLA-45 rotor in a TL-100 benchtop centrifuge. The amount of clathrin present in the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by densitometry after SDS-PAGE using a Molecular Dynamics instrument (35Lindner R. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16567-16573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparative uncoating experiments with digested Hsc70, brain coated vesicles (0.52 mg of protein) were incubated with 19 μg of GST-auxilin-(547–910) and 0.28 mg of chymotrypsin-digested hsc70 (composed mainly of 60- and 45-kDa fragments) for 20 min at 25 °C in the presence of 4 mm ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding hexokinase to a final concentration of 10 units/ml and 5 mm glucose. Released clathrin was separated from intact baskets by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was applied directly to a Superose 6 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.1 mm ADP. The column was eluted at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A chymotryptic digest of Hsc70, prepared in ADP or ATP, respectively, or recombinant Hsc70 fragments without their GST-moieties, were incubated in buffer C with GST-auxilin-(813–910) for 10 min at 25 °C. As indicated in the figures, the buffer contained either 3 mm ATP or 3 mm ADP, respectively. Incubations with GST served as controls. At the end of the incubation period, 20–40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min on ice to allow the fusion proteins to attach to the beads. The beads were pelleted by a 30-s spin at maximum speed in an Eppendorf benchtop centrifuge at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed in buffer C containing either 0.1 mm ATP or 0.1 mm ADP, as detailed elsewhere (19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and then resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer to extract the bound protein which was subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To determine ATPase activities, 1.3 μm Hsc70 or 1.8 μmGST-Hsc70-(1–540), respectively, were incubated alone or with 0.5–2.1 μm GST-auxilin-(547–910) at 25 °C or 0.6–2.6 μm GST-auxilin-(547–814) in 30 μl of buffer C with 14 μm ATP, containing 0.3 MBq [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.). The reaction was stopped by spotting a 1-μl aliquot onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, and the ratio of ATP to ADP was determined by densitometry. Controls consisted of incubations of ATP without added proteins and with 2.1 μmGST-auxilin-(547–910), respectively. To follow the hydrolysis of Hsc70-bound ATP, 1 nmol of Hsc70 or GST-Hsc70-(1–540) was incubated for 6 min at 25 °C with 2 nmol of [α-32P]ATP (0.07 MBq). Unbound nucleotides were removed on a NAP-5 column as described before (19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hsc70ATP or GST-Hsc70-(1–540)ATPwas then incubated in the presence and absence of GST-auxilin-(547–910) or GST-auxilin-(547–814) for 5 min at 25 °C as indicated in the figure legends. The ratio of ATP to ADP was determined as described above. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (35Lindner R. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16567-16573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the members of the Hsp70 family are generally highly conserved proteins, the sequence of the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain can vary considerably (5McKay D.B. Wilbanks S.M. Flaherty K.M. Ha J.H. O'Brian M.C. Shirvanee L.S. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 137-177Google Scholar). This prompted speculations about a possible involvement of the 10-kDa domain in the interaction with other cellular components, notably DnaJ homologues (21Tsai M.Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5958-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To explore how different Hsp70 proteins function in the auxilin-dependent uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, we compared the activity of bovine Hsc70 with those of human Hsp70 and bacterial DnaK. Human Hsp70 was chosen, because its 10-kDa domain has 62% identity with that of bovine Hsc70 (Fig. 1 A), and both proteins have the EEVD motif at their carboxyl termini. In DnaK the EEVD motif is replaced by EEVK and is followed by the sequence DKK. Overall there is only 19% identity between the carboxyl-terminal domains of DnaK and Hsc70. The degrees of identity between the substrate- and nucleotide-binding domains of Hsc70 and DnaK are 56 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Both, Hsp70 and DnaK were purified from overexpressing bacteria (Fig. 1 B). To assess uncoating activity, a constant amount of clathrin-coated vesicles was incubated for a fixed time in the presence of ATP with increasing concentrations of Hsp70 proteins. The liberated clathrin was separated from the vesicle membrane by pelleting and quantitated by SDS-PAGE. Bovine Hsc70 and human Hsp70 dissociated bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles with similar efficiency, but the activity of DnaK was about 10 times lower (Fig. 2). This could result from a lower affinity for the auxilin J domain or for clathrin or, as seems probable, from a combination of both; we observed earlier that DnaK has a lower affinity than Hsc70 for auxilin (19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and current attempts to isolate DnaK-clathrin complexes by gel filtration in the presence of ADP proved unsuccessful, indicating that the complexes that would have formed in the course of the uncoating reaction were unstable (data not shown). In contrast, complexes of Hsc70 with clathrin are readily demonstrated by this procedure (4Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Holstein S.E.H. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,36Prasad K. Heuser J. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In sum, when compared with bovine Hsc70, both human Hsp70 and bacterial DnaK, showed uncoating activity, strong in one case and weak in the other, despite extensive sequence differences between the three variable 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal domains and lesser differences between the other domains. While these results fall short of establishing definitively whether or not the variable domain participates, as had been supposed, in an interaction with DnaJ class proteins, they nevertheless place the issue in doubt. To eliminate any possibility that the in vitro uncoating assay may not have been sensitive enough to discriminate between an interaction of the 10-kDa domain with a “cognate” as against a “non-cognate” J domain, we extended our study to fragments of Hsc70. Limited proteolysis of Hsc70 with chymotrypsin progresses through a 66-kDa fragment, which gives rise to two closely spaced bands of about 60 kDa and finally a stable 45-kDa fragment (Fig. 3). On immunoblots of the digest the Hsc70-specific monoclonal antibody 1B5 (37Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) stained only intact Hsc70 and the fusion protein GST-Hsc70-(540–650) that was included as a control. This suggested that the 66-kDa fragment was missing a carboxyl-terminal segment of about 5 kDa. The 60-kDa fragment is known to contain the ATPase and substrate-binding domains of Hsc70, whereas the stable 45-kDa fragment comprises only the ATPase domain (4Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed previously for DnaK and Hsp70 (23Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 38Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the type of nucleotide present in the nucleotide-binding domain influenced the course of the digestion (Fig.3). With bound ATP, the 60-kDa fragment proved significantly more stable than with ADP. This suggests that the region in between the ATPase and the substrate-binding domains is less accessible to chymotrypsin in the ATP-bound state. In the ADP-bound state the site near the carboxyl terminus, which is cleaved when the 66-kDa fragment is generated, appears to be slightly less accessible. It is conceivable that it forms part of the mechanism that locks the “lid” in a place over the substrate-binding channel. To eliminate as much of the intact Hsc70 as possible, the digestion time was increased to 60 min. This resulted in a mixture of predominantly 60- and 45-kDa fragments (Fig. 3). No intact Hsc70 remained, but a small amount of 66-kDa material, amounting to about 1.5% of the combined staining intensities of the 60- and 45-kDa bands, could be detected. When these fragments were tested in the uncoating assay they were found to be active (Fig.4 A). It could be presumed that the activity was associated with the 66-kDa and especially the much more abundant 60-kDa fragment, because both contain the ATPase- and substrate-binding domains. Based on the concentration of the 60-kDa fragment, which was estimated by densitometry after SDS-PAGE, it appeared to have half the activity of Hsc70 (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the 60-kDa fragment was bound to clathrin at the end of the reaction, coated vesicles were uncoated on a semi-preparative scale. The reaction was stopped by addition of hexokinase and glucose. The supernatant containing the released clathrin was immediately applied to a S6 gel filtration column. Analysis of the clathrin-containing fractions by SDS-PAGE demonstrated the presence of the 60-kDa fragment and some 66-kDa fragment (Fig.5). This result was in agreement with previously published data which showed that the 60-kDa fragment but not the 45-kDa nucleotide-binding domain can bind to clathrin (4Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Association of the 60-kDa chymotryptic Hsc70 fragment with clathrin.

Tomomura M. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and the chicken retinoic-inducible heparin-binding protein (3Raulais D.

Both, PTN and midkine are developmentally regulated proteins which exibit neurite outgrowth, angiogenic and mitogenic properties (reviewed in Ref. 4Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Lewis C.M. Bicknell R. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar), and which enhance plasminogen activator activity (5Kojima S. Inui T. Muramatsu H. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PTN and midkine share 50% of sequence homology, but they have no homology with the fibroblast growth factor family of heparin-binding growth factors which display several overlapping biological properties (reviewed in Ref. 6Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The mitogenic activity of PTN is a subject of controversy as conflicting results were reported by different laboratories. On one hand, PTN purified from tissues or expressed in bacteria and in insect cells is devoid of mitogenic activity but still promotes neurite outgrowth (7Hampton B.S. Marshak D.R. Burgess W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Takamatsu H. Itoh M. Kimura M. Gospodarowicz D. Amann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1991; 180: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported mitogenic activity after purification of PTN from bovine brain. On the other hand when expressed in eukaryotic cells, PTN is capable of stimulating thymidine incorporation and cell growth in different cell systems including fibroblasts (11Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), epithelial cells (11Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J.

Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The failure of purifying mitogenically active PTN in the former systems listed above may be explained by either loss of mitogenic activity during the purification or erroneous folding of the protein when highly expressed. This latter explanation would be in agreement with the findings of Laaroubi et al.(13Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that PTN expressed in NIH3T3 cells is produced in two forms distinct in their structure and properties. These two forms can be separated in two peaks on a Mono S column; the first peak containing mitogenically active PTN and the second peak containing non-mitogenic PTN. Thus the mitogenic activity of PTN would depend on the balance between the active form(s) and the non active form(s). Further support of the role of PTN in cell growth is provided by experiments showing that transfection of the PTN cDNA in SW13 cells and NIH3T3 cells conferred a growth advantage in soft agar and tumorigenesis in nude mice (11Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chauhan A.K. Li Y.C. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, recent results from our laboratory show that depletion of PTN from human melanoma and choriocarcinoma cells with ribozymes inhibits tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (15Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21358-21363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Czubayko F. Schulte A.M. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together these results point to an important role of PTN in cell proliferation and differentiation as well as in tumor progression. In this report we study the signal transduction pathways involved in the mitogenic activity of PTN and show an implication of the MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways. Orthovanadate, genistein, tyrphostin A25, and pertussis toxin were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Wortmannin was from Sigma. PD98059 was obtained from Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [3H]Thymidine and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Myelin basic protein was obtained from Sigma. Bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Anti-PTN antibody was a generous gift of Dr. A. Seddon (American Cyanamide Co.). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-panERK and anti-SHC antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Akt1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and UBI. Bovine epithelial lens (BEL) cells were a generous gift of Dr. J. Courty (Universite Paris 12, France) and routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), and 1 ng/ml bFGF. PTN overexpressing SW13 cells (SW-13/PTN cells clone W28), produced by stable transfection with the pRcCMV vector containing the PTN cDNA (11Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies). This assay was carried out essentially as described in Ref. 12Delbe J. Vacherot F. Laaroubi K. Barritault D. Courty J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. BEL cells were seeded in 24-well plates for 2–3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 2.2 g of sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies). The cells were then serum starved for 24 h after which test samples were added. In the experiments involving inhibitors of signal transduction, the cells were pretreated with the drugs for 1 h prior to adding the growth factors. The cells were then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and then [3H]thymidine was added. After an additional incubation period of 6 h the cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with water, and lyzed overnight with 0.3 n NaOH. Total radioactivity incorporated was counted using a Beckman scintillation counter. Each experiment included buffer or vehicle as controls. Conditioned media from approximately 109 SW-13/PTN cells grown for 4 to 5 days in 1.5 liters of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% FCS was adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl and was passed through a 2-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Piscataway). The column was then washed with 40 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl and heparin-bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1m NaCl. The eluate was diluted to 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl and passed through a Mono S column using an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The column was washed extensively in the same buffer containing 0.45m NaCl and the bound proteins eluted using a gradient from 0.45 to 2 m NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, quickly aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. After separation in SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 150 mAmps/gel unless indicated otherwise in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% powdered milk and probed with the antibodies at appropriate dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) for 1 h. After additional washing in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, bound antibody was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents system from Amersham. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 15-cm dishes, serum starved for 48 h, and then stimulated with PTN or bFGF for 10 min. Cell lysates were prepared by scrapping the cells in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μmokadaic acid, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and incubating for 15 min at 4 °C in a rotating rack. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein content was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 0.5 to 1 mg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 ° C with 20 μl of 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody coupled to agarose beads (UBI). The beads were then washed in IP buffer and proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting. Cell lysates, prepared as described above and precleared with protein G-Sepharose, were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of sheep anti-Akt1 antibody (UBI). The immunocomplexes were captured with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol and the kinase assay was carried out as described in Ref. 18Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar with a slight modification: the beads were resuspended in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μmATP, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 25 μg/ml myelin basic protein, and 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 × sample buffer and boiling. Samples were then electrophoresed, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane processed for autoradiography. Unless stated otherwise data points were run in triplicate and experiments repeated at least twice. Typically the mean ± S.E. from a representative experiment is presented. As appropriate, Student's t test or ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of differences between measurements (Statview 4.02 program; Abacus Concepts Inc.; Berkeley, CA). The respective p values are given in the text.p < 0.05 was considered significant. PTN was purified from 1.5 liters of SW-13/PTN conditioned media by a two-step procedure. The first step involved heparin-Sepharose chromatography and elution with a buffer containing 1 m NaCl. For the second step of purification, the 1 m NaCl eluate was diluted to 0.25m NaCl and applied to a Mono S column on fast protein liquid chromatography. PTN was then eluted from the column with a gradient of NaCl. PTN eluted from this column at 0.75 mNaCl. The fractions containing the peak were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining for purity and by Western blot to identify PTN. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a >95% purification was achieved. Two major bands of apparent molecular mass of 14 and 18 kDa were detected by silver staining and were identified as PTN by Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B). Although elution of the two PTN forms appears to overlap, it is obvious from Fig.1 A that the 14-kDa protein is eluted first and thus has a slightly lower affinity for the column. This result is consistent with a truncation of positively charged amino acids. As the C terminus of the protein is rich in lysines, it is likely that the 14-kDa PTN protein represents a C-terminally truncated form of PTN as demonstrated using an anti-PTN antiserum raised against a 10-mer peptide from the N terminus of PTN. 2A. Wellstein, unpublished data. The mitogenic activity of PTN was assayed on serum-starved and growth-arrested BEL cells which have been shown to be stimulated by this growth factor (12Delbe J. Vacherot F. Laaroubi K. Barritault D. Courty J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that the heparin-Sepharose 1 m NaCl fraction and Mono S fractions 2 and 3 induced thymidine incorporation by 5–6-fold. Fraction 1 contained only weakly active material and fraction 4 showed no activity. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with the empty pRc/CMV vector processed for purification under the same conditions showed no mitogenic activity (data not shown). These results indicate that the purified PTN was a mixture of mitogenic and non-mitogenic proteins. Since the mitogenically active form eluted first from the column, it is conceivable that mitogenic activity is mostly due to the truncated protein. The Mono S fraction number 3 was used in the following experiments. It has been demonstrated previously that bFGF is a potent mitogen for BEL cells (12Delbe J. Vacherot F. Laaroubi K. Barritault D. Courty J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility of contamination of the PTN fractions by bFGF produced endogenously by SW-13 cells (19Wellstein A. Lupu R. Zugmaier G. Flamm S.L. Cheville A.L. Delli Bovi P. Basilico C. Lippman M.E. Kern F.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar) and to demonstrate that the mitogenic activity of PTN is independent from that of bFGF, we carried out the experiments shown in Fig. 2. A dose-response curve of bFGF is shown in Fig. 2 B. The plateau of stimulation was reached at 1 ng/ml bFGF. When BEL cells were stimulated with bFGF or PTN in the presence of anti-bFGF neutralizing antibodies, only the bFGF activity was reduced (Fig. 2 A) demonstrating that PTN is not contaminated by bFGF. Finally, when BEL cells were stimulated with very high concentrations of bFGF (2 and 10 ng/ml), addition of PTN still stimulated the cells above the stimulation achieved by bFGF alone (Fig.2 C). This result indicates that the effects of PTN and bFGF on DNA synthesis are mutually independent and suggests that the PTN receptor is different from the FGF receptor. To determine which signal transduction pathway(s) is(are) used for mitogenic signaling by PTN, we initially utilized different inhibitors of signal transduction and bFGF, as well as serum, as positive controls. bFGF is known to signal through membrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (20Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) and serum contains a mixture of factors that use different signal transduction pathways. Pertussis toxin had no effect on DNA synthesis stimulated by PTN and bFGF, but markedly inhibited DNA synthesis induced by serum (Fig.3 A). This result indicates that the mitogenic signals of PTN and bFGF are not mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin A25 strongly inhibited DNA synthesis induced by PTN, bFGF, and serum, whereas the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate did not (Fig.3 A). Rather, orthovanadate slightly enhanced PTN-, bFGF-, and serum-induced thymidine incorporation. These results indicate that PTN like bFGF stimulates DNA synthesis through tyrosine kinase pathways and that probably the PTN receptor is not a tyrosine phosphatase. Interestingly, tyrphostin A25 was less potent against PTN than against bFGF since 2 μm of this inhibitor inhibited the bFGF effect by more than 60% and the PTN effect by less than 30% (p < 0.01 for inhibition of PTN versusinhibition of bFGF). This suggests that some of the tyrosine kinases involved in the signaling of both growth factors are distinct. The effects of inhibitors of the MAP kinase and the PI 3-kinase pathways on PTN activity were also studied. The MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 inhibited PTN-, bFGF-, and serum-induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, PTN-stimulated mitogenesis was more sensitive than bFGF- and serum-stimulated mitogenesis. The PTN effect was completely inhibited at 10 μm of the inhibitor whereas a less than 50% inhibition was seen for the other two factors. Similarly, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin strongly inhibited the PTN effect (by 75%; p < 0.01 for PTN versus control) and less efficiently the bFGF effect (by 35%; p < 0.01 for bFGF versus control; Fig. 3 C). Serum-induced DNA synthesis was not affected by wortmannin at 10 nm (Fig.3 C). Taken together, these results indicate that the MAP kinase and the PI 3-kinase pathways are involved in the mitogenic signal of PTN as well as of bFGF. The apparent selectivity of different inhibitors signifies that the coupling of the signaling steps in the PTN and bFGF pathways are distinct and/or that additional pathways may be used by bFGF and not by PTN. Furthermore, the incomplete inhibition of DNA synthesis by wortmannin indicates that mitogenesis is only partly dependent on a functional PI 3-kinase pathway. In BEL cells PTN stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of a predominant 190-kDa protein as assessed by Western blotting of total cell lysate or after immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4, top). A less prominent 215-kDa protein is tyrosine phosphorylated in addition to the 190-kDa species (Fig. 4, bottom, and Fig. 5,top). The phosphorylation of p190 and p215 was specific for PTN since both proteins were not phosphorylated after bFGF stimulation (Fig. 4, bottom) although ERK1 and ERK2 were found tyrosine phosphorylated in response to bFGF (data not shown). In addition, several low molecular weight proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated following PTN stimulation. These proteins have apparent molecular masses of 66, 52, 46, 44, and 42 kDa corresponding to the 3 molecular forms of SHC and to ERK1 and ERK2, respectively (Fig. 5,bottom). A Western blot for SHC (Fig. 5, bottom) and for ERK (see Fig. 6) confirmed that indeed SHC and ERK1/ERK2 were phosphorylated after PTN stimulation of the cells. Pretreatment of the cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not influence phosphorylation of any of the above proteins as expected from the separate signaling pathways.Figure 5PTN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, ERK1, and ERK2. Cell lysate (25 μg) from control cells (lane 1) or from cells stimulated with PTN (10 ng/ml; 10 min) without (lane 2) and with pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (10 nm; 1 h) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins present in the lysates were detected by Western blotting with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (WB PY). Both panels represent blots from the same gel transferred for 2 h (bottom) and then overnight (top) using a second nitrocellulose membrane.

Phosphorylated (pERK) and non-phosphorylated (ERK) ERKs are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To independently confirm phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 following PTN stimulation, cell extracts from unstimulated and stimulated cells were analyzed by Western blotting using a panERK antibody. After PTN stimulation a discrete increase in upward-shifted forms of ERK1 and ERK2 were observed in the Western blots (Fig. 6). This mobility shift is typical of phosphorylated forms of the ERKs. Upon closer inspection a single band of ERK1 was detected in the control cells corresponding to the non-phosphorylated form. Following PTN stimulation, all of the ERK1 was shifted to an apparently higher molecular mass suggesting complete phosphorylation of ERK1 (Fig. 6). For ERK2, a doublet was detected in the control cells corresponding to both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Upon PTN stimulation, all of the non-phosphorylated ERK2 shifted to the higher mobility form as expected from pERK2. These results are corroborated by the anti-phosphotyrosine blots in Fig. 5 (bottom). As expected from the separate signaling pathways, pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin did not affect phosphorylation of either ERK1 or ERK2. Since wortmannin inhibited PTN-induced mitogenesis, we decided to also assay for PI 3-kinase activation and used anin vitro assay of the Akt1 kinase to address that. Akt1 (protein kinase B) has been previously shown to be a substrate of PI 3-kinase and to be activated by phosphorylation (21Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tchilis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). For our studies, Akt1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of unstimulated or stimulated cells and immunoprecipitates were used for in vitrophosphorylation of myelin basic protein. The data presented in Fig.7 show an increase of phosphorylation of myelin basic protein following PTN stimulation and a reversal by pretreatment with 10 nm wortmannin. These results indicate that Akt1 activation by PTN was mediated by PI 3-kinase. We conclude from this that PTN also activates the PI 3-kinase pathway to exert its mitogenic effect. PTN is a heparin-binding growth factor that is involved in cell growth and differentiation processes. It stimulates neurite outgrowth, fibroblast, endothelial, and epithelial cell growth (reviewed in Ref.4Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Lewis C.M. Bicknell R. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar). We report here a role of MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways in the mitogenic activity of PTN. Experiments carried out in the presence of signal transduction inhibitors showed that drugs interfering with the tyrosine kinase pathway, genistein and tyrphostin A25, inhibited the mitogenic effect of PTN whereas an inhibitor of the G-protein coupled pathway, pertussis toxin, did not. This result demonstrates that PTN stimulates cell division through a tyrosine kinase pathway and that the PTN receptor is not a G protein-coupled receptor. Interestingly, the different inhibitors showed a different sensitivity of the PTN-versus the bFGF-induced DNA synthesis which indicates to us a differential sensitivity either of the respective receptor tyrosine kinases or of their coupling to the pathway downstream. Furthermore, we also found two novel, yet unidentified 190- and 215-kDa phosphoproteins in response to the PTN stimulus and not after bFGF stimulation. The apparent molecular mass of the p190 is consistent with that of a protein described to be phosphorylated after PTN stimulation of NIH3T3 cells (22Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In our opinion these proteins are most likely receptor molecules for PTN. We utilized several well characterized inhibitors to dissect the downstream signaling pathways of PTN in more detail and found that the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 as well as the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the mitogenic activity of PTN (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that the growth factor exerts its mitogenic effect through both the MAP kinase and the PI 3-kinase pathways. MEK1 is a component of the MAP kinase pathway which is downstream of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (23Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar, 24Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Intermediary steps involve the docking and phosphorylation of adaptor proteins (25Pawson T. Nature London. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar) and we demonstrate here that the adaptor protein SHC becomes phosphorylated upon stimulation of BEL cells by PTN (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Activated SHC has been shown to bind the complex Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound 2) and SOS (son of sevenless) which activates Ras by GTP exchange. Ras activates Raf, which in turn activates MEK1. The next step in the cascade is the activation by phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine, and threonine of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 by MEK1 which culminates in activation of several transcription factors (26Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Following stimulation by PTN, ERK1 and ERK2 were indeed phosphorylated as demonstrated by Western blotting and the mobility shift of the proteins (Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, tyrosine kinase and MEK1 inhibitors blocked PTN-induced mitogenesis (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that the activation of the above signaling molecules was crucial for the growth factor activity of PTN. Finally, we studied the participation of PI 3-kinase in the PTN signaling. PI 3-kinase is a heterodimeric protein kinase formed by two subunits of 85 and 110 kDa (27Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit is a regulatory protein that mediates, via its SH2 domains, binding of PI 3-kinase to activated receptor tyrosine kinases. The p110 subunit possesses the catalytic domain of the protein. Following binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase, PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphoinositides which serve as second messengers in the activation of downstream kinases. Two pathways diverge from PI 3-kinase: one leads to phosphorylation of the p70 S6K ribosomal subunit and the other one to activation of the Akt1 and Akt2 proteins (21Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that antisense Akt2 RNA inhibited tumor growth of transfected pancreatic cancer cells linking the PI 3-kinase pathway to tumor growth (29Cheng J.Q. Ruggeri B. Klein W.M. Sonoda G. Altomare D.A. Watson D.K. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase and Akt were implicated in the prevention of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 30Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). Our results show that stimulation of cells with PTN leads to activation of Akt1 (Fig. 7) and this activation as well as mitogenesis of PTN was inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Figs. 3 C and 7). Taken together, these results show that the PI 3-kinase pathway is important for the mitogenic signaling of PTN. It is important to note that pretreatment of cells with wortmannin did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins involved in the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway, indicating that it functions independently from the PI 3-kinase pathway and that both pathways are essential for a full mitogenic signal. We thank Joannah Hackenbruck for help in some of the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1522412585,"To address the role of a plausible protease cascade in daunorubicin-triggered apoptosis, we evaluated the effect of cell-permeant protease inhibitors on its signal transduction pathway. Treatment of U937 and HL-60 cells with 0.5-1 μM of the chemotherapeutic drug daunorubicin induced a greater than 30% activation of neutral sphingomyelinase activity within 4-10 min with concomitant sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation. DNA fragmentation and the classical morphological features of apoptosis were observed within 4–6 h. Pretreatment of cells with the serine protease inhibitors N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (20 μM) or dichloroisocoumarin (20 μM) for 30 min inhibited daunorubicin-induced neutral sphingomyelinase activation, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, ceramide generation, and apoptosis. Other cell-permeant protease inhibitors such as pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain had no such effect. The apoptotic response could be restored by the addition of 25 μM cell-permeant C6-ceramide. Daunorubicin-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited by dichloroisocoumarin but not by N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, suggesting that this transcription factor can be activated independently of ceramide and is not directly implicated in the apoptotic pathway. These results suggest that inhibitors of serine proteases can act upstream of ceramide in drug-triggered apoptosis and that neutral sphingomyelinase activation is either directly or indirectly serine protease dependent.—Mansat, V., Bettaïeb, A., Levade, T., Laurent, G., Jaffrézou, J.-P. Serine protease inhibitors block neutral sphingomyelinase activation, ceramide generation, and apoptosis triggered by daunorubicin. FASEB J. 11, 695–702 (1997)"
https://openalex.org/W1669474892,"Similarities of the skull are commonly used to support hypotheses of ancestor–descendant relationships between fossil and living ape genera, especially between the late Miocene apes Sivapithecus and Dryopithecus from Eurasia and the living orang-utan (Pongo) from Borneo and Sumatra1,2,3,4. Yet determining whether craniofacial traits shared by extant and Miocene apes are primitive or derived is severely hampered by the rarity of well-preserved fossil crania, particularly of early members of their closest outgroup, the Old World monkeys (Cercopithecoidea). The discovery of a complete and undistorted skull of Victoriapithecus at middle Miocene deposits from Maboko Island, Kenya, provides evidence of intact cranial-vault and basicranial morphology, brain size and craniofacial hafting for a primate from between 32 and 7 million years ago. Victoriapithecus represents a branch of Old World monkey that is intermediate between extant cercopithecids (Colobinae and Cercopithecinae) and the common ancestor they shared with apes (Hominoidea)5,6,7,8. The skull preserves traits widely thought to be derived for extant and fossil members of a proposed Sivapithecus/Pongo clade, but which now appear to be primitive features of ancestral Old World higher primates in general."
https://openalex.org/W2067610852,"Drugs containing strong basic nitrogen functional groups can be N-oxygenated to genotoxic products. While the reduction of such products is of considerable toxicological significance, most in vitro studies have focused on oxygen-sensitive reductase systems. However, an oxygen-insensitive microsomal hydroxylamine reductase consisting of NADH, cytochromeb 5, its reductase, and a third unidentified protein component has been known for some time (Kadlubar, F. F., and Ziegler, D. M. (1974) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 162, 83–92). This report describes the isolation and identification of all of the components required for the reconstitution of an oxygen-insensitive liver microsomal system capable of catalyzing the efficient reduction of primary N-hydroxylated structures such as amidines, guanidines, amidinohydrazones, and similar functional groups. In addition to cytochrome b 5 and its reductase, the reconstituted system requires phosphatidylcholine and a P450 isoenzyme that has been purified to homogeneity from pig liver. The participation of cytochrome b 5 and NADH cytochrome b 5 reductase in cytochrome P450-dependent biotransformations has previously only been described for oxidative processes. The data presented suggest that this system may be an important catalyst in the reduction of genotoxicN-hydroxylated nitrogen components in liver. Their facile reduction by cellular NADH may be the reason whyN-hydroxylated products can be missed by studies in vivo. Furthermore, the enzyme system is involved in the reduction of amidoximes and similar functional groups, which can be used as prodrug functionalities for amidines and related groups.

Furthermore, the enzyme system is involved in the reduction of amidoximes and similar functional groups, which can be used as prodrug functionalities for amidines and related groups. The metabolism of nitrogen-containing functional groups has become a topic of considerable interest since the early discovery thatN-hydroxylated intermediates are often responsible for the toxic and/or carcinogenic properties of aromatic amines, hydrazines, and amides (1Testa B. Testa B. Caldwell J. The Metabolism of Drugs and other Xenobiotics. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 415-433Google Scholar). On the other hand, the more facileN-oxygenation of secondary and tertiary alkylamines to hydroxylamines and N-oxides was considered as a route for detoxication (2Bickel M.L.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1969; 21: 325PubMed Google Scholar, 3Coutts R.T. Beckett A.H. Drug Metab. Rev. 1977; 6: 51-69Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and it was generally assumed that the strongly basic nitrogen compounds were metabolically stable. However, we have demonstrated that even the protonated hydrophilic amidines (4Clement B. Xenobiotica. 1983; 13: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Clement B. Kämpchen T. Chem.

The N-oxygenation of these functional groups produces more reactive metabolites, and the genotoxic properties of benzamidoxime are well known (9Clement B. Schmezer P. Schlehofer J.R. Schmitt S. Pool B.L. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 114: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During investigations of the metabolic fate of strongly basic N-hydroxylated xenobiotics, we observed that they were readily reduced both in vivo andin vitro by a microsomal system present in all mammalian species (rats, rabbits, pigs, and humans) tested to date (10Clement B. Schmitt S. Zimmermann M. Arch. Pharm. 1988; 321: 955-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Hauptmann J. Paintz M. Kaiser B. Richter M.

Pharm. 1988; 321: 955-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) had many of the characteristics of the microsomal O2-insensitive hydroxylamine reductase described by Kadlubar et al. (14Kadlubar F.F. McKee E.M. Ziegler D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 156: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,15Kadlubar F.F. Ziegler D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which required NADH-cytochrome b 5reductase, cytochrome b 5, and a third unidentified protein component. In this report, we describe the isolation, purification, and characterization of this component from pig liver microsomes and show that the system catalyzing the O2-insensitive reduction of benzamidoxime requires NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase, cytochromeb 5, a cytochrome P450, and phospholipid (Fig.1). Pig liver microsomes were prepared by fractional acid precipitation according to the procedure of Ziegler and Pettit (16Ziegler D.M. Pettit F.H. Biochem. 1966; 5: 2932-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (7Clement B. Jung F. Pfundner H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 335-342PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochromeb 5, NADH-cytochrome b 5reductase, and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase were separated by modifications of the procedure described by Kling et al.(17Kling L. Legrum W. Netter K.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thesit (Boehringer Mannheim) was used in place of Emulgen 913 to solubilize the microsomal proteins and in the elution buffers. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The solubilized pig liver microsomes were applied to an octyl-Sepharose CL 4B (Pharmacia, Freiburg, FRG) column (inner diameter, 3.8 cm; length, 38 cm), and enzymes were eluted by a stepwise increase in the detergent concentration and a decrease in the salt concentration in elution buffers (buffer A: 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA (Serva, Heidelberg, FRG), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) sodium cholate, and 0.5 m NaCl; buffer B: 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.44% (w/v) sodium cholate, 0.2% (w/v) Thesit, and 0.5 m NaCl; buffer C: 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) sodium cholate, and 2% (w/v) Thesit). The flow rate was 50 ml/h; the volume of the fractions collected was 8.5 ml; and the eluate was monitored at 280 nm (Fig. 2). The fractions containing NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase activity (Fig. 2, peak 2) and those containing NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity (Fig. 2,peak 4) were collected. In addition, the fractions with the highest absorbance at 417 nm (cytochrome b 5) were combined (Fig. 2, peak 3). NADH-cytochromeb 5 reductase (Fig. 2, peak 4) was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on 5′-AMP-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) similar to the procedure described for the purification of NADPH-P450 reductase (18Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions containing the highest NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity were combined and concentrated, followed by gel filtration (NAP 10, Pharmacia). The specific activity of the purified reductase was 27 units/mg, and only one band was detectable on SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DLPC,l-α-dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine. (data not shown). Cytochromeb 5, present in the highest concentration in peak 3 (Fig. 2), was purified on a DEAE-cellulose column (inner diameter, 2.5 cm; length, 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer D (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) sodium cholate). After equilibration, elution was performed with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl in buffer D, collecting 10-ml fractions, and those with the highest absorbance at 417 nm were combined (data not shown) and further processed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 (inner diameter, 1.5 cm; length, 45 cm), equilibrated in buffer D, at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. The fractions containing cytochrome b 5 were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Witten, FRG; exclusion size, 10 kDa), and the buffer was changed to buffer D, lacking sodium cholate, by gel filtration on NAP 25 columns (Pharmacia). The final cytochromeb 5 fraction contained 10.2 nmol of cytochromeb 5/mg of protein and exhibited one band at 16 kDa after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (Fig. 2, peak 2) was further purified by affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) and subsequently by gel filtration chromatography on acrylamide-agarose (AcA 44 Ultrogel; Pharmacia), as described by Yasukochi and Masters (18Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation also appeared homogenous on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Preliminary measurements indicated that in addition to cytochromeb 5 and its reductase, further components present in fractions 88–101 (Fig. 2, peak 4) were also required for reconstitution of amidoxime reductase. The combined fractions 88–101 were concentrated by ultrafiltration (exclusion size, 30 kDa; Amicon), desalted by gel filtration (NAP10, Pharmacia), and chromatographed on an anion exchange column by preparative HPLC with a conventional HPLC system (L-6210 Intelligent Pump, 655 A-22 UV detector, D-2500 integrator; Merck/Hitachi, Darmstadt, FRG). 1 mg of protein was applied to a semipreparative Fractogel EMD TMAE 650(S) column (inner diameter, 10 mm; length, 150 mm; particle size, 25–40 μm; Merck), which had been equilibrated with buffer E (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) Thesit, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). After equilibration, fractions were eluted with a one-step increase in the salt concentration up to 500 mm in buffer E at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions with the highest absorbance at 280 nm (Fig.3) were pooled and concentrated by pressure dialysis, tested for NADH cytochrome b 5reductase activity, and tested for benzamidoxime reductase activity in the reconstituted system. TM1 showed only one band on SDS-PAGE (Fig.4).Figure 4SDS-PAGE of the prepurified enzymes after preparative HPLC separation on a Fractogel-TMAE(S) column. STD, protein standards.

Activity was recovered quantitatively in the effluent, which showed only one band (50 kDa) on SDS-PAGE (like TM1 in Fig. 4). This fraction is named the third protein or the third component. Detergents were removed from the purified enzymes by shaking the concentrated fractions for 4 h with Calbiosorb (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) at 4 °C. Benzamidoxime was synthesized by a published method (19Krüger P. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1885; 18: 1055-1060Crossref Google Scholar). Benzamidine was obtained from Aldrich-Chemie (Steinheim, FRG), dextromethorphan was from Sigma, and dextrophan-d-tartrate was from ICN Biochemicals Inc. NADPH and NADH were purchased from Merck. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed with a Kontron Uvicon 930 spectrophotometer. For HPLC analysis, a conventional system was used: L-5000 controller, 655 A-11 HPLC gradient pump, L-422 UV detector, AS-2000 autosampler, and D-2500 integrator (Merck/Hitachi). Amino acid sequence analyses on peptide fragments of the purified proteins were carried out by TopLab (Munich, FRG). All protein concentrations were measured using the method described by Smith et al. (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18507) Google Scholar) with bicinchoninic acid (BCA reagent kit; Pierce). The SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out by the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar), with a 3% stacking gel. For cytochromeb 5 preparations a 12% separation gel was used, while all other preparations were separated on an 8% gel (1.5-mm thickness). Staining was performed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Serva, Heidelberg, FRG). Standards and samples were pretreated with β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 90 °C. The following proteins were used as standards (high molecular weight calibration kit; Pharmacia): myosin (M r 205,000), β-galactosidase (M r 116,000), phosphorylase b(M r 94,000), albumin (M r67,000), ovalbumin (M r 45,000), and carbonic anhydrase (M r 29,000). Cytochromeb 5 concentration was determined by recording the reduced minus the oxidized spectrum (absorbance 185 mm−1 cm−1) as described by Estabrook and Werringloer (22Estabrook R.W. Werringloer J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 concentrations were determined by measuring the carbon monoxide difference spectra after reduction with dithionite as described by Omura und Sato (23Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of TM1 protein, cytochrome P450 was also quantified by CO difference spectra after reduction (50 μg of protein) with 3 units of NADPH-P450 reductase, 1.5 mm NADPH and 40 μml-α-dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) (Sigma) in a total volume of 1 ml of 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4. After preincubation for 5 min at 25 °C, the cuvettes were saturated with CO, and the difference spectra were recorded. NADH-cytochromeb 5 was measured by its NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity (1 unit = 1 μmol of reduced ferricyanide/min) as described by Mihara and Sato (24Mihara K. Sato R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase activity was measured by following the reduction of cytochrome c (type 4 horse heart; Sigma) as described (25Williams Jr., C.H. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (18Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (1 milliunit = 1 nmol of reduced cytochrome c/min). The incubation mixture for the reconstituted enzyme system consisted of 50 pmol of cytochrome b 5, 0.5 unit of NADH cytochromeb 5 reductase, 5 μg of fraction TM1 (Fig. 3,peak 1) or 5 μg of third protein, 7.5 μg of DLPC (final concentration, 40 μm; Sigma), and 150 nmol of benzamidoxime (final concentration, 0.5 mm) in a 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. After a 5-min preincubation period at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH (final concentration, 1 mm) to a total volume of 300 μl. After 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 300 μl of methanol on ice. Precipitated proteins were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC (26ät zu KielWohlers, H. (1994) Studien zur Biotransformation von Guanidinen und Amidinen mit Hepatozyten und Mikrosomen, Ph. D. thesis, ChristianAlbrecht-Universität zu Kiel.Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μl were injected into a LiChrospher RP-Select B column (125 × 5 mm, 5 μm; Merck) with an RP-Select B precolumn (4 × 4 mm; Merck). The separation was carried out at room temperature with 3 mm1-octanesulfonic acid, pH 2.5 (adjusted with 85% phosphoric acid)/acetonitrile (88:12, v/v) as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 229 nm. The retention time for benzamidine was 16.5 ± 0.4 min and 14.3 ± 0.2 min for benzamidoxime when injected as controls (Fig.5). The rate of product formation was linear for about 60 min, and the limit of detection of benzamidine was 10 pmol/injection. Standard curves with 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, and 50.0 μm benzamidine were constructed and found to be linear over this range with correlation coefficients >0.9993. The recovery of benzamidine from incubation mixtures was 98.5 ± 1.3% (n = 36) of that obtained using samples that contained the same amount of benzamidine dissolved in phosphate buffer. The reductase activities of pig and human liver microsomes were measured by following the reduction of benzamidoxime, as described above for the reconstituted system, in 300 μl of 100 mm phosphate, pH 6.3, containing 500 μm benzamidoxime, 1 mm NADH, and 0.05–0.1 mg of human liver microsomes or 0.2 mg of pig liver microsomes. Ten different samples of human liver microsomes obtained from Human Biologics, Inc. (Phoenix, AZ) were tested. Various enzymatic activities related to specific human P450 subfamilies had been determined by Human Biologics, Inc. TheO-demethylation of dextromethorphan was carried out essentially as described (27Jaruratanasirikul S. Hortiwakul R. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in 100 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 units of NADPH-cytochrome-P450 reductase, 5 μg of third protein component or 5 μg of fraction TM1 (Fig. 3), 40 μm DLPC, and 3.3 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 300 μl. The reconstituted assay for the reduction of benzamidoxime was carried out with 0.1 mm NADH (final concentration), and the oxidation of NADH during the incubation was monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. Further procedures were performed as described above. The data summarized in TableI demonstrate that reduction of benzamidoxime by NADH requires three proteins purified to apparent homogeneity from pig liver microsomes. The fastest rates were consistently observed with mixtures containing 0.5 units of NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase, 50 pmol of cytochrome b 5, and 5 μg of the third protein isolated from peak 4 (Fig. 2) along with DLPC in phosphate buffer. DLPC was the least essential ingredient, and omitting this phospholipid decreased activity by only 30%. On the other hand, omitting either cytochrome b 5 or its reductase virtually abolished activity, and omission of the third protein component decreased activity by almost 90% compared with rates obtained with the complete system (Table I). Replacing NADH with NADPH at the same initial concentration (1 mm) reduced activity by almost 60%. The consumption of NADH was linear during the incubation with the complete system. The molar ratio of benzamidine production and depletion of NADH was 1. In the absence of the third protein component, the decrease of absorbance was the same as the blank (without substrate).Table IN-Reduction of benzamidoximeComposition of incubation mixturen 1-aNumber of determinations.Activity1-bActivity values are in nmol of benzamidine/min/mg of third protein ± S.D.Percentage1-cBased upon activity in the complete system.%Complete system1298.8 ± 7.8100Without NADH9ND1-dND, not detectable.0.0Without NADH/with NADPH (1 mm)937.2 ± 4.937.7 ± 5.0Without cytochromeb 592.1 ± 0.72.1 ± 0.7Without NADH cytochrome b 5reductase9ND 1-dND, not detectable.0.0Without third protein910.6 ± 0.910.7 ± 0.9Without DLPC970.3 ± 1.671.1 ± 1.6With superoxide dismutase (500 units/ml)9148.2 ± 2.5150 ± 2.5A complete incubation mixture for optimized conditions consisted of 50 pmol of cytochrome b 5, 0.5 unit of NADH cytochromeb 5 reductase, 5 μg of third protein, 0.5 mm benzamidoxime, 1 mm NADH, 7.5 μg of DLPC (final concentration, 40 μm), in 0.3 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5.

Values are mean ± S.D. Benzamidoxime reductase activity of the reconstituted system was insensitive to catalase and cyanide. A complete inhibition of the benzamidoxime reductase activity was observed upon the addition of 0.5 mm N-methylhydroxylamine (data not shown). Superoxide dismutase (500 units/ml) increased the rate of reduction with some preparations as much as 50%. We also investigated the addition of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. The presence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in the reconstituted system decreased the benzamidoxime reductase activity by 35% (TableII). In addition to this, added NADPH (1 mm) resulted in a further 25% inhibition compared with the complete system. The inhibitory effect of NADPH-P450 reductase was reversed by the addition of superoxide dismutase. The replacement of NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase by NADPH-P450 reductase in presence of superoxide dismutase diminished activity by about 80%; in the absence of superoxide dismutase, however, there was no detectable activity (Table II).Table IIInfluence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase on the reconstituted systemComposition of incubation mixture2-afp1, NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase; fp2, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (0.5 units); SOD, superoxide dismutase (final concentration, 500 units/ml).n 2-bNumber of determinations.Activity2-cActivity values are in nmol of benzamidine/min/mg of third protein ± S.D.Percentage2-dBased upon activity in the complete system.%Complete system12147.9 ± 5.3100 ± 3.6With fp2895.4 ± 8.764.5 ± 5.9With fp2/with SOD4220.7 ± 3.7149.2 ± 2.5With fp2/with NADPH861.5 ± 14.541.6 ± 9.8Without fp1/with fp2/with SOD429.1 ± 1.820.1 ± 1.2Without fp1/with fp24ND2-eNot detectable.0.0The assays were performed as described in Table I.

The addition of dextromethorphan (final concentration, 0.5 mm), NADPH-P450 reductase (0.5 unit), and NADPH (final concentration, 1 mm) to the reconstituted benzamidoxime reductase system diminished the appearance of the benzamidine product by about 30% in presence of superoxide dismutase (500 units/ml) (data not shown). In addition to benzamidoxime, the reconstituted system also catalyzed the reduction of guanoxabenz and N-hydroxydebrisoquine (data not shown). Although the reduction of these N-hydroxylated substrates by NADH required the same components, the optimal pH for reduction of N-hydroxydebrisoquine (near pH 7) was higher than that for the reduction of guanoxabenz (pH 6) or benzamidoxime (pH 5.5). Spectra of this protein purified to apparent homogeneity from peak TM1 (Fig. 3) were similar to those of other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and, like the latter, gave typical reduced minus oxidized difference spectra in the presence of CO (data not shown). The amino acid sequences of three peptides isolated from a proteolytic digest of the purified protein are shown in Table III. The sequence of peptide 2 is identical to that of a sequence in P450 2D described by Tsuneoka et al. (28Tsuneoka Y. Matso Y. Higuchi R. Ichikawa Y. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W1975564459,"We report the identification of the large subunit of the DNA replication factor, DSEB/RF-C140, as a new substrate for caspase-3 (CPP32/YAMA), or a very closely related protease activated during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. DSEB/RF-C140 is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein with sequence homology to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This similarity includes a consensus DEVD/G cleavage site for caspase-3. Cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 is predicted to occurs between Asp706 and Gly707, generating 87-kDa and 53-kDa fragments. An antiserum raised against the amino-terminal domain of DSEB/RF-C140 detects a new 87-kDa protein in Jurkat T cells in which apoptosis is activated by a monoclonal antibody to Fas. This cleavage occurs shortly after PARP cleavage. In vitro translated DSEB/RF-C140 is specifically cleaved into the predicted fragments when incubated with a cytoplasmic extract from Fas antibody-treated cells. Proteolytic cleavage was prevented by substituting Asp706 by an alanine in the DEVD706/G caspase-3 cleavage site. The cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 is prevented by iodoacetamide and the specific caspase-3 inhibitor, tetrapeptide aldehyde Ac-DEVD-CHO, but not by the specific ICE (interleukin-1-converting enzyme) inhibitors: CrmA and Ac-YVAD-CHO, indicating that the protease responsible for the cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 during Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells is caspase-3, or a closely related protease. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that recombinant caspase-3 but not caspase-1 reproduced the “in vivo” cleavage. Inasmuch as the cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 separates its DNA binding from its association domain, required for replication complex formation, we propose that such a cleavage will impair DNA replication. Recent in vitromutagenesis support this proposal (Uhlmann, F., Cai, J., Gibbs, E., O'Donnel, M., and Hurwitz, J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 10058–10064).

Programmed cell death or apoptosis is well recognized as a physiological process essential for normal tissue homeostasis within multicellular organisms (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev.

Cells undergoing apoptosis are characterized by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, contraction of the cytoplasm, and blebbing of the plasma membrane (5Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

Some of the molecular processes responsible for the morphological changes observed during apoptosis in mammalian cells have been elucidated in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans (7Ellis H.M.

Due to a frenetic pace in the identification of new members of this protease family, a nomenclature committee has recently recommended the use of the termcaspase to refer to those cysteine proteases that belong to the ICE/CED-3 family (49Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Signals generated from inside the cells due to cellular damage or genetically determined space-time switches during development, and the presence or absence of cell-specific extracellular signals, can irreversibly trigger the biochemical cascade that results in programmed cell death. Extracellular signals such as the occupation of the Fas/APO-1 receptor by the Fas ligand or an antibody with agonist properties constitutes a well characterized model in which to study the events responsible for the initiation and execution of the apoptotic program (11Stanger B.Z. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 7-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fas-dependent apoptosis in mammalian cells resembles programmed cell death in C. elegans, inasmuch as both require the activation of ICE/CED-3 proteases (12Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C.

The sequential activation of ICE (caspase-1)-like and CPP32/YAMA (caspase-3)-like proteases during apoptosis has been suggested (13Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S.

It remains unknown whether the elimination of a particular protein or class of proteins essential for cell viability and integrity is the target of the caspase protease cascade, or the degradation of multiple substrates without a particular essential role, individually, could overcome the capacity for cells to repair themselves (29Martin S.L. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). The mammalian DNA replication factor complex C, also called activation complex A1, is a multimeric complex formed by five polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 140, 40, 38, 37, and 36 kDa (30Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is required for DNA replication in mammalian cells. It recognizes and binds the primed DNA template in the replication fork and recruits PCNA to allow the assembly of a replication complex with the DNA polymerases δ (delta) and ε (epsilon) (31Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We fortuitously cloned the large subunit of this complex (designated DSEB) while searching for a nuclear protein with capacity to bind a differentiation-specific element (DSE) in the angiotensinogen gene promoter (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of DSEB to the DSE enables irreversible induction of angiotensinogen expression during adipocyte differentiation (34McGehee Jr., R.E. Ron D. Brasier A.R. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). The large subunit of the replication factor C, DSEB/RF-C140 is responsible for recognition of the primed DNA template and the recruitment of the other four polypeptides of the RF-C complex to the replication fork (31Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large carboxyl-terminal region with extensive homology to the other subunits of the RF-C is required for their association (35Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F. Finkelstein J. O'Donnel M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Domain B within the carboxyl-terminal region is required for the direct interaction of DSEB/RF-C140 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (36Fortedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hubscher U. Fortedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have mapped the DNA-binding domain of DSEB/RF-C140 to an amino-terminal region of 126 amino acids (residues 367–493) (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). This domain has extensive homology to the prokaryotic DNA ligases and the eukaryotic enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, involved in the recognition of DNA breaks and the orchestration of a DNA repair response (37Cherney B.W. McBride O.W. Chen D.F. Alkhatib H. Bhatia K. Hensley P. Smulson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8370-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Huppi K. Bhatia K. Siwarski D. Klinman D. Cherney B. Smulson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3387-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In its domain B, DSEB/RF-C140 also shares with PARP a conserved region with the consensus sequence DEVDG that is the cleavage site for caspase-3 during apoptosis. This homology suggests that DSEB/RF-C140 could also be a substrate for caspase-3 (CPP32/YAMA). Such a cleavage would inactivate DSEB/RF-C140 by separating the DNA-binding domain from the association domain required for its interaction with the other subunits of the replication factor C (35Uhlmann F.

Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hubscher U. Fortedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our results confirm the predictions and indicate that DSEB/RF-C140 is cleaved into two fragments during Fas-induced apoptosis in T cells. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the Asp706 residue to be essential for the cleavage. This residue is contained in the DEVD/G sequence with homology to the CPP32 cleavage site in PARP. Furthermore, by using specific protease inhibitors, we identified caspase-3 (CPP32) or a very close homolog protease, and not caspase-1 (ICE) as the cleaving protease. As in the case of PARP and other substrates, for the CED3-like proteases, the exact relevance of their cleavages in apoptosis remains to be determined. However, the identification of DSEB/RF-C140 as a substrate cleaved by caspase-3 or a closely related protease may be an important clue for understanding the role that ICE/CED3-like proteases play during programmed cell death. DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Boehringer Mannheim. Radioactive compounds were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Nucleotides were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Tissue culture media and reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The cowpox-virus serpin CrmA was obtained from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Tukwila, WA). ICE and CPP32 specific tetrapeptide aldehyde antagonists were obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Jurkat cells were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml). To induce apoptosis, 1-ml aliquots containing 2 × 106 cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations (01–1 μg/ml) of the anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY) for the indicated periods of time. The 3.6-kilobase pair cDNA containing the entire protein coding sequence for DSEB/RF-C140 was inserted into the pCDNA-1 vector described previously (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). By using site-directed mutagenesis, a mutated version of DSEB/RF-C140, DSEB Asp706 → Ala, was generated. In this mutated protein, the normal Asp residue at position 706 was converted to an alanine residue. Oligonucleotides ATGGATGAGGTCGCTGGCATGGCAGGCAATGAAGAC and GCCTGCCATGCCAGCGACCTCATCCATGAGGGCGTG were used to create the mutation using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique. Full-length RF-C140/DSEB protein was synthesized in reticulocyte extracts byin vitro transcribing and translating the cDNA sequence contained in the pCDNA-DSEB plasmid (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar), using T7 RNA polymerase in the TNT system (Promega, Madison, WI). The incorporation of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) into the protein and the use of an autoradiography enhancer (NEN Research Products) allowed its visualization after autoradiography. Prior to the cleavage assay, immunoprecipitation with a specific antiserum to DSEB/RF-C140 (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar) was performed to eliminate the possible interference of other reticulocyte constituents with the protease cleavage assay. Incubation of in vitro translated DSEB/RF-C140 with a cytoplasmic extract from Fas antibody-treated or non-treated Jurkat cells, or a bacterial extract containing recombinant ICE or CPP-32, gift from Dr. J. Yuan (Harvard University, Boston, MA), was performed at 37 °C during 1 h in a final 20-μl volume. After addition of Laemmli buffer, samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Cytosolic extracts were prepared by two different methods. No difference between their cleavage capacity was observed. The first method was a modification of a previously described method (13Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubations, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer containing 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, then repeated cycles of freezing and thawing were applied. The second method used also has been described (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaftner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing in cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A containing: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, then incubated on ice during 15 min and disrupted by vortexing after addition of 25 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40. Genomic DNA was isolated by a method described previously (40Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were collected and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% w/v SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. Then phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation was performed and RNA was digested with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml). After an additional phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA (5 μg) was resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer and loaded in a 1.5% agarose gel. DNA was stained with Sybr Green I dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and scanned with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Aliquots of cells (2 × 106) processed in parallel with those for DNA degradation assay were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted by the addition of Laemmli buffer prior separation in 10% SDS-PAGE. After overnight transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, Western immunoblots were performed with a 1:10,000 dilution of the DSEB/RF-C140 primary antiserum raised against its amino-terminal domain (residues 1–510) (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Bio-Rad) at 1:25,000 dilution was used as the secondary antibody. Immune complexes were detected with the ECL system (Amersham), according to manufacture's recommendations. PARP cleavage was detected on the same filter by stripping and reprobing with a commercially available PARP monoclonal antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). As a consequence of screening cDNA expression libraries for proteins that bind to a DSE in the angiotensinogen gene promoter (34McGehee Jr., R.E. Ron D. Brasier A.R. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar), previously we cloned a nuclear DNA-binding protein, DSEB (differentiation specific element-binding protein), the expression of which is induced during the process of the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipoblasts into adipocytes (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). Although initially no related sequences were available in the GenBank™ data base, an identical cDNA sequence was published that encoded the large subunit of the DNA replication factor C (41Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11014-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Luckow B. Bunz F. Stillman B. Lichter P. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have mapped the DNA-binding domain of DSEB to a region comprising residues 367–493 (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). This region is structurally related to two major families of proteins: bacterial DNA ligases and PARP (38Huppi K. Bhatia K. Siwarski D. Klinman D. Cherney B. Smulson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3387-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PARP is also a large nuclear protein, which is able to recognize and bind damaged DNA. PARP is important in the process of DNA repair because, once bound to DNA, it becomes active and orchestrates the repair process by ADP-ribosylating a number of nuclear proteins including itself. During the process of programmed cell death, PARP is inactivated due to specific cleavage of the protein into two fragments, one containing the DNA-binding domain and the other containing the catalytic domain. The active form of caspase-3 (CPP32/YAMA), an ICE/CED3-like protease, is responsible for PARP cleavage through recognition of a specific site with the sequence DEVD/G (10Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3803) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the homology between the amino acid sequences of DSEB/RF-C140 and PARP. Significant regions of homology are found in the DNA-binding domain of DSEB/RF-C140 and two domains of PARP with no ascribed function. A small region in DSEB/RF-C140 with homology to the “DEAD box” family of RNA helicases, and residing in the recently mapped domain B required for PCNA interaction is identical to the consensus DEVD/G CPP32 cleavage site of PARP. To determine whether DSEB/RF-C140 is also a substrate for ICE/CED-3 proteases during programmed cell death, we have used Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas-reactive antibodies, a well established model for apoptosis. Jurkat T cells were incubated with anti-Fas-reactive monoclonal antibodies, and the appearance of apoptosis was measured by determining the pattern of migration of DNA in agarose-gel electrophoresis (DNA laddering) (Fig.2 A). Incubation of Jurkat cells with increasing concentrations of Fas antibodies causes a DNA laddering degradation pattern characteristic of apoptosis. Western immunoblot analyses were performed on the same cell extracts that were examined for DNA laddering. The antiserum used for the immunoblot analysis was raised against an amino-terminal fragment of DSEB/RF-C140 (33McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 487-501PubMed Google Scholar). The antiserum detects the DSEB/RF-C140 in control Jurkat cells and, upon the addition of Fas antibody to the cells, a new immunoreactive protein with a molecular mass of 87 kDa appears (Fig. 2 B). The size of this new protein is consistent with a cleavage at the predicted DEVD/G site, between Asp706 and Gly707. By using the lower effective dose (0.1 μg/ml) of Fas antibody, we determined whether the cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 occurred earlier or later than the Fas-dependent apoptosis as measured by DNA degradation. Fig. 2C indicates that some DNA degradation is observed after 1 h of Fas antibody treatment and becomes intense after 2 h. A Western immunoblot prepared from cells incubated in parallel in the same experiment indicates that a marked cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 occurs after 2 h of treatment with Fas antibodies (see Fig. 2 D). After stripping and reprobing the same filter with a PARP monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 E), we observed that PARP cleavage occurs also in parallel with DNA degradation, starting 1 h after the addition of the Fas antibody. Although PARP cleavage seems to occur earlier than DSEB/RF-C140 cleavage, an increased concentration of PARP per cell or a more accessible pool could also explain an earlier detection. This finding indicates that the cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 does not precede degradation of the DNA, but instead occurs in conjunction with DNA degradation and the reported cleavage of the other known CPP32 substrates (25Song Q. Lees-Miller S.P. Kumar S. Zhang Z. Chan D.W. Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Alnemri E.S. Litwick G. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 28Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). An in vitroproteolysis system was established to study the cleavage pattern in DSEB/RF-C140 induced by cytosolic extracts from Fas-treated Jurkat T cells. DSEB/RF-C140 synthesized by coupled cell-free transcription and translation in a reticulocyte lysate was isolated by immunoprecipitation and incubated with a cytosolic extract from control or Fas-stimulated cells. In the presence of Fas-treated but not untreated cytosolic extracts, DSEB/RF-C140 was cleaved into two smaller fragments (Fig. 3), the large fragment corresponding in molecular weight to the amino-terminal fragment observed in the Western immunoblot studies with an antibody that recognizes the amino-terminal domain of DSEB/RF-C140. A new polypeptide with an estimated molecular size of 53 kDa was also observed. Depending on the electrophoresis conditions, the smaller protein fragment migrates as a duplex, perhaps indicating the existence of two different conformations or a secondary cleavage event. Although both the size of the cleaved fragments and the immunoreactive pattern indicate that the predicted CPP32 consensus, DEVDG(703–707) is the cleavage site during Fas-dependent apoptosis, we confirmed the possibility by replacing the Asp706 residue with an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. As was anticipated, this new mutant protein was not cleaved by a Fas antibody-treated extract (Fig. 3). A similar Asp to Ala substitution in another CPP32 substrate, steroid response element-binding protein (SREBP), was also shown to prevent cleavage by CPP32 (27Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We further characterized the proteolytic activity responsible for DSEB/RF-C140 cleavage in Fas-treated Jurkat cells. Two different classes of proteases have been determined to be activated during Fas-dependent apoptosis in T cells: 1) a very early initial ICE-like activity, inhibited specifically by the tetrapeptide aldehyde Ac-YVAD-CHO; and 2) a later appearance of a CPP32-like activity, inhibited by the tetrapeptide aldehyde Ac-DEVD-CHO. By using the in vitro cleavage assay, we examined the capacity of these different compounds to inhibit DSEB/RF-C140 cleavage activity in cytosolic extracts prepared from Jurkat cells treated with Fas antibodies. Fig.4 A shows that only the nonspecific cysteine-protease inhibitor iodoacetamide and the CPP32-specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO prevent the cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 by the cytosolic extracts prepared from cells undergoing apoptosis. A non-cysteine protease inhibitor such as leupeptin and the ICE-specific inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO did not prevent cleavage. These experiments indicate that CPP32, or a very close homolog of CPP32, which shares its pattern of response to certain protease inhibitors, is responsible for the cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140. The cowpox-virus CrmA serpin, a potent inhibitor of ICE without a significant effect on caspase-3 activity, does not prevent DSEB/RF-C140 cleavage, further indicating that ICE is not the protease responsible for DSEB/RF-C140 cleavage in cytosolic extracts from Fas antibody-treated cells (Fig. 4 B). It has been shown that activation of ICE-like proteolytic activity is a very early event during Fas-induced apoptosis, whereas activation of CPP32 occurs later in parallel with the degradation of DNA (13Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). These data, reported earlier, are in agreement with our observations. Further confirmation that only caspase-3 (CPP-32) and not caspase-1 (ICE) is the proteolytic activity responsible for DSEB/RF-C140 cleavage was obtained by using a bacterial preparation of recombinant proteases (gift from Dr. J. Yuan). Fig. 4 C shows that when “in vitro” translated DSEB/RF-C140 is incubated in the presence of recombinant CPP-32, cleavage occurs. This cleavage has the same pattern as the one induced by cytoplasmic extracts from Fas-treated Jurkat cells. On the other hand, recombinant ICE (caspase-1) has no cleavage activity on DSEB/RF-C140 as is predicted by the studies using specific inhibitors. Caspase-3 cleavage of DSEB/RF-C140 at Asp706 during apoptosis results in disappearance of the normal full-length protein and the generation of two new fragments. These two newly formed proteins still contain clusters of functional domains of the wild-type DSEB/RF-C140 that theoretically could support some DNA replication activity. However, during the preparation of this manuscript, an extensive study of the replication function of the RF-C140 was published (50Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnel M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study two deletion mutants, p140C555 (residues 1–555) and p140C976 (residues 1–976), which comprise the amino-terminal fragment (residues 1–706) generated by caspase-3 during programmed cell death, lack the capacity to form the replication complex and therefore are inactive in DNA replication (Fig.5). Two additional deletion mutants, also lacking DNA replication activity, comprise the carboxyl-terminal fragment (residues 707–1131) generated by caspase-3 cleavage; these are p140N687 (residues 687–1131) and p140N604 (residues 604–1131) (see Fig. 5 and Ref. 50Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnel M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the reported deletion mutants deficient in DNA replication comprise the same clusters of functional domains as the two caspase-3 generated fragments, it is concluded that both fragments are inactive and do not support DNA replication. Activation of CPP32, as defined by inhibition by the tetrapeptide Ac-DEVD-CHO, is an early event during programmed cell death and its exact role in apoptosis is unknown. Activated CPP32 has been shown to cleave only a selected number of nuclear substrates: PARP (10Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3803) Google Scholar), DNA-PK (25Song Q. Lees-Miller S.P. Kumar S. Zhang Z. Chan D.W. Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Alnemri E.S. Litwick G. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 28Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and the U1–70 kDa subunit of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (20Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study adds a fourth protein, DSEB/RF-C140, to this relatively short list of specific nuclear substrates. In all these instances, cleavage occurs between an anchoring domain (DNA- or RNA-binding domains) and a functional or catalytic domain (Fig. 6). Cleavage of these substrates occurs in parallel with nucleosomal DNA degradation. This circumstance may indicate that cleavage of substrates and DNA degradation are not causally linked and that they occur independently from one another. This concept has recently received experimental support (43Darmon A.J. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21699-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because both PARP and DNA-PK are involved in DNA repair processes, it has been proposed that their cleavages, if not essential, at least would facilitate the completion of the apoptotic process by blocking the DNA repair capacity of those cells committed to the programmed cell death (44Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Because RF-C is required for PCNA loading onto DNA, and PCNA is not only required for DNA replication but also for the DNA excision-repair mechanisms (45Shivji M.K.K. Kenny M.K. Wood R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the RF-C could also participate in certain types of DNA repair processes where PCNA is involved. If this were the case, cleavage of the DSEB/RF-C140 by disruption of its B domain required for PCNA interaction (36Fortedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hubscher U. Fortedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) would almost certainly impair its role in DNA repair, contributing to the completion of DNA degradation. However, another and perhaps more interesting possibility is that suppression of DNA replication, especially the elongation phase of DNA replication performed by polymerase δ and ε, is a necessary or facilitating step for the completion of DNA degradation and the apoptotic process. It seems unquestioned that both suppression of DNA synthesis, as well as suppression of DNA repair mechanisms are logical events that might occur in a cell that is degrading its DNA as part of its commitment to a predetermined and organized suicide program. Another feature that the known CPP32 substrates share among themselves is that they are abundant ubiquitously distributed proteins (25Song Q. Lees-Miller S.P. Kumar S. Zhang Z. Chan D.W. Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Alnemri E.S. Litwick G. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). DSEB/RF-C140 itself is present in at least 10,000 molecules/cell (42Luckow B. Bunz F. Stillman B. Lichter P. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They also share the capacity to consume ATP as a source of energy. Therefore, the inactivation of the CPP32 substrate proteins during apoptosis would save a considerable amount of energy that can be applied to processes of endonucleolytic cleavages during apoptosis (46Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 47Deleted in proofDeleted in proof.Google Scholar). If such a circumstance does exist, it is expected that the rate of DNA degradation would increase, resulting in a shortening of the critical time required for the completion of the apoptotic process.

We also thank Dr. J. Yuan for providing us with recombinant ICE and CPP-32 proteins."

Plasmids are autonomously replicating extrachromosomal elements. In addition to replicating within a single organism, many of these elements possess the ability of intraspecies and interspecies transfer. Hence, many plasmids can be classified as mobile genetic elements. These mobile genetic elements are often clinically relevant as many of these “promiscuous” plasmids can encode polypeptide(s) that confer resistance to single/multiple antibiotic(s) and heavy metal ion(s). These resistance genes are often contained within a transposon that has integrated into the plasmid molecule (for reviews, see Refs. 1Guiney D.G. Clewell D.B. Bacterial Conjugation.

Plasmid RP4 is a 60,099-base pair broad host range, transmissible genetic element that belongs to the IncPα incompatibility group.

The majority of DNA metabolic enzymes used by plasmid RP4 are host-encoded; however, the plasmid itself encodes several specialized DNA metabolic enzymes within its genome.

Of the transfer genes, the traI gene encodes a specialized DNA topoisomerase activity, the “nickase,” which is responsible for catalyzing the single-strand cleavage of plasmid molecules required for the initiation of transfer (11Pansegrau W.

ThetraE gene encodes a putative polypeptide with extensive protein sequence similarity to Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase III (Topo III) 1The abbreviations used are: Topo III, topoisomerase III; Topo I, topoisomerase I.1The abbreviations used are: Topo III, topoisomerase III; Topo I, topoisomerase I. (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a preliminary step in the elucidation of the role of the TraE protein in plasmid RP4 DNA metabolism, the traE gene was cloned, and its gene product was overproduced and purified. The purified TraE protein has been shown to possess topoisomerase activity and can substitute for Topo III in vivo; therefore, this topoisomerase is a true homologue of E. coli Topo III. An understanding of the role of the TraE protein in plasmid RP4 DNA metabolism may shed light on the role of Topo III in cellular DNA metabolism. φX174 replicative form I DNA (covalently closed, negatively supercoiled DNA molecule(s)) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA oligonucleotides were prepared by the University of Maryland Biopolymer Laboratory. Radiolabeled nucleoside triphosphate was purchased from Amersham Corp. Acrylamide, restriction enzymes, and agarose were from Life Technologies, Inc. DE52 and P-11 cellulose were from Whatman. Trypsin inhibitor-agarose and single-stranded DNA-cellulose was from Sigma. Sephacryl S-200 was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Sciences, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The labeled oligonucleotides were fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel. The region containing the labeled oligonucleotide was excised, and the DNA was isolated by direct elution of the fragment into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 22 °C) and 1 mm EDTA. The radiolabeled oligonucleotides were diluted to a specific activity of 5000 cpm/pmol by the addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide. The gene encoding the TraE protein was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the following primer sequences: 5′-GAGGGTAGGGGGACATATGCAATTTGAACG-3′ (amino-terminal) and 5′-ATCATGGATCCCTTTCACTCCTGGTTGGTG-3′ (carboxyl-terminal). The amplified product contained an NdeI restriction site (shown in boldface) encompassing the initiation codon of thetraE open reading frame and a BamHI site (shown in boldface) after the termination codon of the traE open reading frame. The amplified product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated withNdeI/BamHI-digested plasmid vector pET-3c (pTraE). To ensure that no mutations occurred during the polymerase chain reaction amplification process, the expression vector was also constructed using site-specific mutagenesis. A 3348-base pairSphI fragment of plasmid RP4 that encompassestraE was subcloned into M13mp19 replicative form DNA. Uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was isolated using this construct, and oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zankour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) was used to create the NdeI and BamHI sites at the beginning and end of the gene, respectively. The mp19 DNA (replicative form I) that contained the altered traE gene was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, isolated, purified, and ligated with NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-3c. The biochemical properties of the purified TraE protein obtained from either construct were indistinguishable. The induction of the TraE polypeptide was initiated by infection of the expression strain, harboring the pTraE plasmid DNA, with bacteriophage λ CE6 (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Chromatography on trypsin inhibitor-agarose was included in the purification to reduce proteolysis (18Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent any contamination of the TraE protein with endogenous Topo III, it was purified fromE. coli strain BL21 in which the gene encoding Topo III (topB) had been disrupted (18Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TraE protein was purified by a modification of a previously described protocol that included DE52, Bio-Gel HT, single-stranded DNA-cellulose, and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography (19DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superhelical DNA relaxation reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 40 mmHepes-KOH buffer (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 1 mm magnesium acetate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 200 ng of φX174 replicative form I DNA, and the indicated amount of topoisomerase (20Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 52 °C for 10 min, and the reaction products were separated on an agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide as described previously (19DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The replication oforiC-containing DNA in vitro was performed as described previously (18Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The replication products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (21Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of replication products existing as form II molecules (nicked or gapped circular DNA molecule(s)) was quantified using a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphoimager. Reaction mixtures (5 μl) contained 40 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm magnesium acetate (pH 7.0), and 5 pmol of a radiolabeled 45-base oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide was 5′-CAGAATCAGAATGAGCCGCAACT↓TCGGGATGAAAATGCTCACAAT-3′, where the arrow indicates the site of Topo III cleavage. The indicated amounts of Topo III and TraE were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS to 2%. The reactions were adjusted to 45% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol and heat-denatured for 5 min at 90 °C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 50% (w/v) urea. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Bacteriophage P1 lysates were prepared from E. coli strain K38topB:kan r. This strain contains a topBgene disruption where a kanamycin resistance cassette has been inserted into the EcoRV site within the gene (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. colistrain DM750, harboring the appropriate plasmid DNAs, was grown overnight in LB medium (5 ml) containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of sterile 0.1m magnesium sulfate and 5 mm calcium chloride. The resuspended cells were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. The cells (0.1 ml) were mixed with 0.1 ml of the P1 lysate and allowed to stand for 20 min at 37 °C. Sodium citrate (0.2 ml of a 1 m solution) was then added to the mixture, and 0.2 ml of the mixture was distributed onto LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and the number of kanamycin/ampicillin-resistant colonies was recorded. The mixture was also plated on agar medium containing only ampicillin to determine the total number of transductants in the experiment. A search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant data base has revealed that E. coli topB shows extensive protein sequence similarity to the plasmid RP4 traE gene (Fig. 1 A). The traE open reading frame is capable of encoding an 82-kDa polypeptide. The similarity between the polypeptides encoded bytraE and topB extends through their first 600 amino acid residues and then diverges in the carboxyl-terminal residues. The region of the similarity is identical to that observed between E. coli topB and topA (the gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I)) (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Margolin P. Zumstein L. Sternglanz R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5437-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal residues of the putative TraE protein contain two potential zinc-finger motifs that show protein sequence similarity to one of the zinc-finger motifs of Topo I (23Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to each other (Fig. 1 B). To assess whether the traE gene encoded a DNA topoisomerase activity, the gene was subcloned from plasmid RP4 into plasmid pET-3c, a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-based transient expression plasmid (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Cells containing the traEexpression plasmid pTraE were induced by the addition of bacteriophage λ CE6, which contains the gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the bacteriophage λ PL promoter. The TraE protein was then purified from the induced cells using the same purification protocol as that used for E. coli Topo III (19DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final preparation contained a polypeptide with the expected molecular mass of 82 kDa and two minor proteolysis products (Fig.2). The purified TraE polypeptide was assayed for superhelical DNA relaxation activity. A titration of TraE revealed that the protein possessed DNA relaxation activity comparable to that of Topo III (Fig.3). In addition, the superhelical DNA relaxation activity of TraE exhibited virtually the same biochemical properties as that of Topo III. TraE-catalyzed relaxation of superhelical DNA was stimulated by increasing temperatures (Fig. 4,lanes 2–6 and 7–11) and inhibited by increasing concentrations of Mg2+ (compare lanes 2–6 and7–11).Figure 4Effect of magnesium concentration and temperature on TraE-catalyzed relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA. DNA relaxation assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Reactions (25 μl) contained no TraE protein (lanes 1 and 12) or 120 fmol of TraE protein (lanes 2–11). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C (lanes 2 and 7), 37 °C (lanes 3 and8), 42 °C (lanes 4 and 9), 52 °C (lanes 5 and 10), and 65 °C (lanes 6 and 11) in the presence of either 5 mm(lanes 1–6) or 1 mm (lanes 7–12) magnesium acetate. The reaction products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. oc, open circle nicked or gapped circular DNA;sc, negatively supercoiled circular DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Type 1 DNA topoisomerases act by binding to DNA, making a transient single-stranded break in the DNA, catalyzing a strand passage event, and resealing the transient break (for a review, see Ref. 24Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Although E. coli Topo I and Topo III possess a high degree of protein sequence similarity (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two enzymes cleave single-stranded DNA substrates at different sites (19DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dean, F. B. (1984) Studies on the Mechanism of Escherichia coli Topoisomerase I. Ph.D. thesis, University of Chicago.Google Scholar); therefore, the TraE protein was analyzed for its cleavage site specificity (Fig.5). In contrast to Topo I (Fig. 5, lanes 8–10), TraE-catalyzed cleavage of a 45-base oligonucleotide substrate (lanes 5–7) generated a pattern identical to that of Topo III (lanes 2–4). The 45-base substrate contained one predominant Topo III cleavage site and multiple minor sites. TraE protein-catalyzed cleavage of the substrate occurred predominantly at the major Topo III cleavage site (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4and 5). Since only a small number of Topo III cleavage sites are present on the substrate, it is possible that TraE protein-catalyzed cleavage of single-stranded DNA can occur at sites distinct from those of Topo III. However, at a minimum, the two enzymes do have a subset of cleavage sites in common. Cleavage of the substrate by the TraE protein and Topo I is more efficient than cleavage by Topo III. In addition, with increased levels of TraE protein, a cleavage product accumulates that is identical to that of Topo I (Fig. 5, compare lanes 7 and 8). This product has also been observed using large amounts of Topo III in a cleavage reaction (26Zhang H.L. Malpure S. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23700-23705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that E. coli Topo III and Topo I catalyze distinctly different reactions in vitro (18Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerase I was very efficient in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA (i.e. removing intramolecular linkages), whereas DNA topoisomerase III was very efficient in the decatenation of multiply interlinked plasmid DNA dimers and the resolution of DNA replication intermediates (i.e. intermolecular linkages). To assess whether the TraE protein was capable of resolving DNA replication intermediates, the enzyme was included in an in vitro replication reaction. The products of the reaction were separated on an agarose gel, and the products were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 6). Similar to Topo III, the TraE protein was capable of resolving plasmid replication intermediates (Fig. 6, lanes 2–5). The specific activity of the TraE protein was 30% of that of Topo III (Fig. 6, lanes 7–10). In the course of constructing E. coli strains that lack the activities of the two type 1 topoisomerases, Topo I and Topo III, it has been observed that it is extremely difficult to transduce a topBgene disruption into topA deletion strains that contain gyrase compensatory mutations (i.e. DM750 and DM800 (27Pruss G.J. Manas S.H. Drlica K. Cell. 1982; 31: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar,28DiNardo S. Voelkel K.A. Sternglanz R. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. Cell. 1982; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)); however, in the presence of a Topo III expression plasmid, pDE1 (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the disruption of the chromosomal copy of topB in these strains is easily accomplished. 2S. Malpure and R. J. DiGate, unpublished data. This is presumably because promiscuous transcription of topB from the expression plasmid provides the cell with sufficient amounts of the enzyme to remain viable in the absence of the chromosomal gene. Western blot analysis of cell extracts prepared from cells harboring plasmid pDE1 reveals clearly detectable amounts of Topo III, whereas cell extracts prepared from cells that do not contain the expression plasmid do not reveal detectable quantities of the enzyme (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the extremely low abundance of Topo III in E. coli (19DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the TraE protein can substitute for Topo III in vivo, a P1 transduction experiment was performed in which the DM750 cells (ΔtopA) being transduced to topB(using a P1 lysate prepared from cells with atopB:kan r disruption) contained the traEexpression vector pTraE (traE in vector pET-3c). As can be seen in Table I, cells harboring the topBexpression plasmid pDE1 (topB in vector pET-3c (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and thetraE expression plasmid pTraE could be transduced totopB:kan r. DM750 cells harboring a topAexpression plasmid, pTI1 (topA in vector pET-3c (18Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), or plasmids incapable of producing an active Topo III polypeptide (pDE2 contains a topB frameshift mutation (14DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in vector pET-3c, and pF328 contains a topB mutation that changes the active-site tyrosine residue to phenylalanine in vector pET-3c (20Zhang H.L. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Zhang H.L. Malpure S. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23700-23705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) exhibited a 15–63-fold reduced transduction frequency compared with cells containing pTraE and a 44–179-fold reduced transduction frequency compared with cells harboring pDE1. The observation that the transduction frequency of cells containing pF328 is 48–136-fold lower than that of cells containing pTraE and pDE1 indicates that the presence of the topoisomerase activity of the TraE protein or Topo III is absolutely essential to observe transduction; however, Topo I activity cannot substitute for either enzyme. These results indicate that the TraE protein is a true functional homologue of Topo III.Table IRelative P1 transduction frequencies of E. coli strain DM750 harboring different plasmidsPlasmidNonepDE1pTraEpTI1pDE2pF328Relative transduction frequency1340.5119.67.71.92.5Bacteriophage P1 transductions each were performed as described by Miller (42Miller J.H.

The polypeptide encoded by the plasmid RP4 traE gene exhibits extensive protein sequence similarity to E. coliDNA topoisomerase III. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of the TraE protein contain two potential zinc-finger motifs and more closely resemble E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. To ascertain whether the TraE protein was a topoisomerase, the traE gene was cloned into the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-based transient expression vector. The polypeptide was induced, purified to apparent homogeneity, and shown to possess DNA topoisomerase activity in vitro. The enzyme, unlike E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, exhibits biochemical properties virtually identical to those Topo III. The TraE protein is stimulated by both low concentrations of Mg2+and high temperature. In addition, TraE protein-catalyzed cleavage of a single-stranded substrate occurs at sites identical to those of Topo III. Perhaps the most distinguishing biochemical property of E. coli Topo III is the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the resolution of DNA replication intermediates in vitro. Topo III and DNA topoisomerase IV are unique among the bacterial topoisomerases in their ability to efficiently decatenate multiply interlinked plasmid DNA dimers and resolve plasmid replication intermediates (19DiGate R.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10362-10368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Topo I has been shown to be incapable of resolving plasmid replication products in vitro (18Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the TraE protein has features that are common to both Topo I and Topo III, it was of interest determine whether the enzyme was capable of resolving plasmid replication intermediates in vitro. Analysis of the TraE protein using an oriC-based in vitro replication system indicated that the protein could efficiently resolve DNA replication intermediates and that the specific activity of the protein was one-third that of Topo III. The traE protein can also effectively substitute for Topo III in vivo. The presence of a plasmid that carries the traEor topB gene in cells that contain a deletion oftopA is sufficient to allow the disruption of the chromosomal copy of topB. This cannot be efficiently accomplished in the presence of plasmids that encode Topo I or an inactive Topo III polypeptide. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the TraE protein is a true homologue of Topo III. The role of the TraE protein in plasmid RP4 DNA metabolism is unclear. The genes encoding the essential enzymes for plasmid replication have been mapped and do not include traE (33Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 79: 1935-1939Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Thomas C.M. Meyer R. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Thomas C.M. Stalker D.M.

The gene is located in the primase gene cluster (5Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G. Haas D. Helinski D.R. Schwab H. Stanisich V.A. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 623-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and is embedded in a region that contains genes essential for plasmid transfer; however,traE has not been found to be essential for this process (36Barth P.T. Grinter N.J. Bradley D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 43-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lessl M. Balzer D. Lurz R. Waters V.L. Guiney D.G. Lanka E. J.

Plasmid. 1989; 22: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The finding that the TraE protein is a true homologue ofE. coli Topo III may explain why no function has been ascribed to the traE gene. The majority of studies concerning both RP4 plasmid replication and conjugative transfer have used E. coli as the host organism. In addition, many organisms may possess Topo III-like activities. It is not surprising that the role of TraE remains undefined when the host(s) contains a homologous enzyme that possesses analogous properties; however, although the TraE protein can substitute for Topo III in vivo, it remains to be seen whether the converse is also true. To address this issue, our laboratory is in the process of constructing a RP4 plasmid in which only traE has been deleted. The replication and transfer properties of this plasmid will be examined in isogenic strains in which topB remains intact or has been disrupted. In addition to the plasmid RP4 gene product, a search of the NCBI nonredundant data base using the BlastP program (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) revealed that there are 12 additional open reading frames that show extensive protein sequence similarity to topB (Table II). Interestingly, seven of the eight homologues that show the greatest protein sequence similarity to topB have been found on conjugative plasmids (perhaps eight of nine if one considers that theStreptococcus agalactiae homologue is a partial sequence; Table II) that have been isolated from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.Table IIBlastP analysis of the NCBI nonredundant data baseOrganismSourceGenep valueRef.Haemophilus influenzaeChromosomaltopB2.5e−29943Fleischmann R.D.

One could envision that the plasmid-encoded topB homologue could be involved in two distinct processes. Many of the conjugative plasmids are large, low copy number genomes. To ensure that these large plasmids are faithfully segregated, these plasmids often encode their own partitioning systems that actively segregate the newly synthesized plasmid DNA molecules into the daughter cells. A component of such a system may be a potent decatenase. Presumably, this activity would serve as a “fail-safe” mechanism to ensure that the replicated chromosomes are always fully decatenated prior to partitioning of the newly synthesized plasmid molecules. In addition, in the case of broad host range, conjugative plasmids, the presence of a plasmid-encoded topoisomerase/decatenase would always guarantee the presence of a functional and compatible topoisomerase activity, regardless of the host organism. Alternatively, one could envision a role for these enzymes during conjugative transfer. The topoisomerase could serve as a swivel to facilitate the unwinding of the donor strand that is transferred to the recipient host. In either case, the presence of multiple examples of Topo III homologues contained on conjugative plasmids is compelling and suggests that the presence oftopB-like genes may define a distinct subclass of these types of plasmids.

https://openalex.org/W2411070638,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (Rb) binds directly to the largest TFIID subunit, TATA-binding protein associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. Here we map the domains in Rb and TAFII250 important for their interaction in vitro and in vivo. Both the amino terminus and the large pocket of Rb are able to associate independently with TAFII250. The binding domain(s) within the large pocket are distinct from the viral oncoprotein and E2F binding region since certain pocket mutations, which abolish E1A binding, do not abolish TAFII250 binding. Consistent with the large pocket of Rb binding to TAFII250, the large pocket domains of both p107 and p130 are able to bind to TAFII250 in vivo. We also demonstrate that at least two regions of TAFII250 are able to bind to the large pocket of Rb independently whereas the amino terminus of Rb binds to a distinct domain in TAFII250. We further demonstrate that Rb can bind to TFIID in vitro, presumably in part through an interaction with TAFII250. Our results suggest a complex interaction between Rb and TAFII250 and imply that TAFII250, TFIID, and potentially other basal transcription factors are targets for regulation by Rb and Rb-related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1983432664,"Insulin-induced desensitization to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulated mitogenesis in bovine fibroblasts involves steps distal to IGF-I binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor. When quiescent cultures of bovine fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 nm IGF-I and total cell lysates immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we observed a band at ∼97 kDa, representing the β-subunit of the IGF-I receptor, and a predominant tyrosyl-phosphorylated species migrating as a broad band between 170 and 190 kDa. The majority of proteins in this latter band were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 and not by antibodies against IRS-1. Pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with 10 nm insulin for 48 h blocked subsequent IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis and the IGF-I-induced increase in tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-2. Insulin pretreatment did not alter IRS-1 or IRS-2 expression by these cells, as assessed by metabolic labeling and direct immunoblotting with IRS antibodies. The interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokine receptor also has IRS-2 as its major substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation. Although 10 nm IL-4 was as effective as 10 nm IGF-I in stimulating IRS-2 phosphorylation, 10 nm IL-4 did not have comparable mitogenic power in these cells. Nonetheless, pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with IL-4 inhibited IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis by 50–60%, concomitant with a decrease in IGF-I-induced IRS-2 phosphorylation. Insulin-induced desensitization could be prevented if a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), but not an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD98059), was present during the preincubation period. LY294002 also prevented the shift in IRS-2 molecular mass in response to prolonged incubation of cells with insulin. These data indicate that, in a nontransformed cell system, IRS-2 plays a key role in cellular desensitization to IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis most likely through a feedback mechanism in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Furthermore, they suggest that signaling through IRS-2 may provide an important point of integration for hormone, growth factor, and cytokine receptor systems that regulate critical cellular growth responses. Insulin-induced desensitization to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulated mitogenesis in bovine fibroblasts involves steps distal to IGF-I binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor.

Furthermore, they suggest that signaling through IRS-2 may provide an important point of integration for hormone, growth factor, and cytokine receptor systems that regulate critical cellular growth responses. Peptide growth factors bind to specific transmembrane receptors to initiate intracellular events that must be highly coordinated and controlled to elicit appropriate changes in nuclear gene expression and consequent cell replication. This coordination must include important molecular mechanisms that operate to restrain mitogenic signaling as well, since constitutive activation of growth factor pathways would be dysfunctional. Thus, negative feedback mechanisms and internal checks are implicit, if not always explicit, in every important regulatory system involved in cell growth. Furthermore, cross-talk and overlap in receptor intracellular signaling pathways, especially as they apply to heterologous interactions, are a powerful means of processing and coordinating external signals to set cell context and generate an appropriate response to the environment. Little is known about the molecular basis of these interactions, however. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IL-4, interleukin-4; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; αPY20, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody; SFM, serum-free medium; Shc, Src-homology 2/α-collagen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is an essential growth-promoting peptide that shares structural and functional features with insulin (1Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that IGF-I is a potent mitogen for normal bovine fibroblasts in culture (2Conover C.A. Ronk M. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment with physiologic insulin concentrations rendered these cells refractory to subsequent IGF-I stimulation of DNA synthesis (3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This insulin-induced desensitization to IGF-I is selective (i.e. no loss of responsiveness to serum), is mediated by specific insulin receptors on bovine fibroblast, and involves events proximal to induction of the nuclear proto-oncogene, c-myc, 2C. A. Conover and L. K. Bale, submitted for publication. and distal to IGF-I receptor binding and activation (3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data suggested that insulin controlled cell response to IGF-I at an intracellular step along a mitogenic pathway shared by insulin and IGF-I. The biological effects of insulin and IGF-I are mediated by specific cell surface receptors. These receptors are structurally homologous α2β2 heterotetramers belonging to the family of ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases (4Nissley P. Lopaczynski W.

Extracellular binding of ligand to receptor α-subunits induces conformational changes and phosphorylation of receptor β-subunits on tyrosines leading to autoactivation of the receptor tyrosine kinase toward specific intracellular proteins. The major receptor substrates include IRS (insulin receptor substrate) and Shc (Src-homology 2/α-collagen) proteins. In most cell systems studied, IRS-1 (∼170 kDa) is the predominant substrate phosphorylated in response to stimulation by insulin or IGF-I (8White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Recent data suggest that feedback from secondary signals may attenuate the initial signaling potential of IRS-1 through activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases and/or serine/threonine kinases (17Kenner K.A.

Phosphorylated IRS-1 can also activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (8White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Shc phosphorylation is stimulated strongly by mitogens and growth factors, and appears to act primarily through MAP kinase activation (20Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, MAP kinase has been suggested to be a point of integration for multiple intracellular signals transmitted by various mitogens, and to serve as the cytoplasmic connection between plasma membrane and nuclear events (21Ruderman J.V. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). IRS-2 was discovered as an alternative insulin receptor substrate in IRS-1 knock-out mice (22Tobe K. Tamemoto H.

IRS-2 is slightly larger (∼190 kDa) and immunologically distinct from IRS-1, but in most in vitro systems IRS-2 appears to function as does IRS-1,i.e. IRS-2 has the potential to link insulin and IGF-I signaling to both PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase activation (22Tobe K.

A physiologic role for IRS-2 has not been documented as yet, although two phosphotyrosine binding elements in IRS-2, which are not found in IRS-1, suggest a distinct functional role in vivo (26He W.

In addition, IRS-2 was found to be identical to 4PS, the major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor (23Patti M.-E. Sun X.-J. Bruening J.C. Araki E.

Unlike the insulin and IGF-I receptors, the IL-4 receptor is not a tyrosine kinase itself, but upon activation it stimulates an associated Janus kinase, which phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the IL-4 receptor (23Patti M.-E.

The purpose of this study was to define the molecular events underlying insulin-induced desensitization to IGF-I using the nontransformed bovine fibroblast model. Herein we report a novel role for IRS-2, an intracellular signaling molecule shared by IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4 receptors, in regulating the cells' mitogenic response to IGF-I. Recombinant human IGF-I and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Crystalline bovine insulin was kindly provided by Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). IL-4, fetal bovine serum and radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Tissue culture media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine (αPY20) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and antibodies against IRS-1 (αIRS-1) and IRS-2 (αIRS-2) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A monoclonal IGF-I receptor antibody generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to sequences in the C terminus of the β-subunit was generously provided by Dr. R. J. Smith (Boston, MA). PD98059 and LY294002 were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) and Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. Bovine dermal fibroblasts (GM06034) were purchased from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine, and containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were used between passages 7 and 14. For all experiments, confluent cells were washed and incubated for 48 h in serum-free Waymouth's medium:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (SFM) with or without the indicated additions (3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After this preincubation period, cells were treated as described for the different methodologies. Cells were washed three times and the medium changed to SFM with or without peptide stimulus. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml; 1.5 μm) was added at 22 h, and the cells were harvested at 26 h. Details of this method have been reported previously (2Conover C.A. Ronk M. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the percent of total counts in the incubation medium incorporated into acid-precipitable material. Cells were acutely treated with peptide stimulus, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm Na3VO4, and then lysed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and aprotonin (10 μg/ml). Cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein content of the lysate was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). Equal amounts of lysate protein (∼100 μg) were processed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions (100 mm dithiothreitol) using a 5–15% linear gradient, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were blocked for 4–6 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody or nonspecific IgG, washed, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody reactions were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Life Sciences). Cell lysates were incubated for 4–6 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of primary antibody/mg of total protein. Protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science Inc., Uniondale, NY) were added and incubation continued overnight as described previously (30Conover C.A. Perry J.E. Tindall D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 987-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed and analyzed by immunoblot. Confluent bovine fibroblasts were incubated in SFM for 24 h with and without additions and then changed to methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and Tran35S-label (50 μCi/ml, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) with and without the same additions for 24 h. Cell lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 5–15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The resultant gel was soaked in Enlightening reagent (NEN Life Sciences Products Inc.) and analyzed by autoradiography. MAP kinase activity was determined using an in-gel renaturation assay modified from Gotoh et al. (31Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamishata T. Hoshi M. Kawkami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cells were treated without and with IGF-I or insulin for 5 and 90 min at 37 °C. Total cell lysates (25 μg of protein) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein. The gel was rinsed four times for 20 min with 20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and then denatured by two 30-min washes with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 5 mmmercaptoethanol. Renaturation proceeded overnight with four changes of 5 mm mercaptoethanol and 0.04% Tween 40 in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer. The following morning the gel was incubated in assay buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 30 °C. The in-gel kinase reaction was then initiated with the addition of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (90 μCi), and allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by washing the gel 6 times for 20 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid with 1% sodium pyrophosphate. After these washes the gel was vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. Bovine fibroblasts possess abundant IGF-I receptors and respond to exogenous IGF-I with marked increases in nuclear proto-oncogene expression,2 DNA synthesis, and cell replication (2Conover C.A. Ronk M. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To investigate the initial signaling events in IGF receptor activation, quiescent cultures of bovine fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 nm IGF-I for 10 min and total cell lysates were prepared. Lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (αPY20). With IGF-I treatment, we observed a band at ∼97 kDa, and a predominant tyrosyl-phosphorylated species migrating as a broad band between 170 and 190 kDa (Fig. 1). Using a specific IGF-I receptor antibody with broad species recognition, the 97-kDa protein was documented to represent the β-subunit of the IGF-I receptor (data not shown). The 170–190-kDa band approximated the size of IRS protein, and we initially presumed it represented IRS-1, the major insulin and IGF-I receptor substrate. However, the majority of tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein in this 170–190-kDa band was immunoprecipitated by antibodies against IRS-2 and not by antibodies against IRS-1 (Fig. 2). The protein immunoprecipitated by αIRS-2 appeared to represent the higher molecular weight component of the 170–190-kDa band. Nonspecific IgG did not precipitate any αPY20 reactivity.Figure 2IGF-I induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. Bovine fibroblasts were treated as in Fig. 1 without (−) and with (+) IGF-I. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1, αIRS-2, or nonspecific IgG followed by immunoblotting with αPY20.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins could be identified by metabolic labeling of cultured bovine fibroblasts with Tran35S-label, followed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). The antibodies used to identify IRS-1 and IRS-2 were specific for each of the molecules, since the two proteins could be distinguished by migration on SDS-PAGE. The labeled protein species immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1 migrated at ∼170 kDa; the species immunoprecipitated with αIRS-2 migrated at ∼190 kDa. No cross-reactivity of antibodies and antigens was evident. As shown in Fig.4, preincubation but not co-incubation with low concentrations of insulin desensitized bovine fibroblasts to the mitogenic effects of IGF-I. Bovine fibroblasts were washed and changed to serum-free medium for 48 h without or with 10 nminsulin. Cells were washed extensively and then 10 nmIGF-I, 10 nm insulin, or 10 nm IGF-I plus 10 nm insulin added, and [3H]thymidine incorporation determined. IGF-I stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation 45-fold. Insulin alone produced a much smaller but significant increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. The co-addition of insulin had no significant effect on IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis. However, pretreatment with the same amount of insulin inhibited IGF-I-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by 85%. This insulin-induced cellular desensitization has been characterized previously and cannot be accounted for by changes in IGF-I receptor binding (3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Investigating where the insulin-induced desensitization occurs along the IGF-I receptor signaling pathway, bovine fibroblasts were treated as in Fig. 4 and total cell lysates immunoblotted for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 5). IGF-I stimulation was associated with the appearance of bands on αPY20 immunoblots at 97 and 170–190 kDa, as in Fig. 1. Pretreatment with 10 nm insulin for 48 h alone had no visible effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 170–190 kDa, but completely prevented the ability of IGF-I to induce phosphorylation of the higher molecular weight bands associated with IRS-2. The lower molecular weight bands in this complex, presumably including IRS-1, did not appear to be affected by insulin pretreatment. A specific decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 was verified by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Prolonged insulin treatment also diminished IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of the 97-kDa band associated with IGF-I receptor β-subunit, even though some IGF-I receptor-mediated responses are not impaired under these conditions (Ref. 3Conover C.A. Clarkson J.T. Bale L.K. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, and see Fig.8).Figure 8MAP kinase activity. Bovine fibroblasts were preincubated without (C) and with 10 nminsulin (ins), washed, and stimulated without and with 10 nm IGF-I for 5 or 90 min. MAP kinase activity in total cell lysates was determined with an in-gel renaturation assay using myelin basic protein as substrate (see “Experimental Procedures.”).Arrows indicate p42/p44 MAP kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment with 10 nm insulin for 48 h had little or no effect on IRS-1 or IRS-2 protein content as assessed by direct immunoblotting with IRS antibodies (not shown) or by metabolic labeling (Fig. 3). The level of IRS-1 and IRS-2 protein present with and without insulin treatment was nearly equal, as determined by measuring the radioactivity in each band by scintillation counting (TableI). However, following insulin treatment, IRS-2 migrated slower and as a broader band on SDS-PAGE. This decrease in mobility, despite the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation, is often associated with increased serine/threonine protein phosphorylation (10Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G.

Background radioactivity (i.e. gel bands in the same positions for IRS-1 and -2 on IgG lanes) has been subtracted. Since the IL-4 cytokine receptor also has IRS-2 as its major substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation, we assessed the influence of IL-4 in our cell system. As shown in Fig. 6, 10 nm IGF-I stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation 30-fold, whereas IL-4 showed no significant dose-dependent stimulation. However, pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with 10 nm IL-4 inhibited IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis by 50–60% (p< 0.05) in four separate experiments. Pretreatment with two other cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, had no effect on IGF-I action in these experiments. In parallel experiments, 10 nm IL-4 was as effective as 10 nm IGF-I in stimulating IRS-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A), even though, as noted in Fig. 6, this did not translate into a comparable mitogenic effect. Nonetheless, pretreatment with 10 nm IL-4 inhibited IGF-I-induced IRS-2 phosphorylation. This was not due to down-regulation of IRS-2 since IL-4 had no effect on IRS-2 protein content (Fig. 7 B). Pretreatment with IL-1β or IL-6 had no effect on IRS-2 phosphorylation or expression in these cells (data not shown).Figure 7IRS-2 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IGF-I: effect of IL-4 preincubation.
