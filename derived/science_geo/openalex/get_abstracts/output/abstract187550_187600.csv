https://openalex.org/W2064348191,"When mixed with imidazolium ion-based room-temperature ionic liquid, pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes formed gels after being ground. The heavily entangled nanotube bundles were found to untangle within the gel to form much finer bundles. Phase transition and rheological properties suggest that the gels are formed by physical cross-linking of the nanotube bundles, mediated by local molecular ordering of the ionic liquids rather than by entanglement of the nanotubes. The gels were thermally stable and did not shrivel, even under reduced pressure resulting from the nonvolatility of the ionic liquids, but they would readily undergo a gel-to-solid transition on absorbent materials. The use of a polymerizable ionic liquid as the gelling medium allows for the fabrication of a highly electroconductive polymer/nanotube composite material, which showed a substantial enhancement in dynamic hardness."

The performance of this non-precious metal catalyst compares favorably with that of platinum-based catalysts for production of hydrogen from ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol. The addition of tin to nickel decreases the rate of methane formation from C-O bond cleavage while maintaining the high rates of C-C bond cleavage required for hydrogen formation."

Crystal structures of Fab 2G12 and its complexes with the disaccharide ManÎ±1-2Man and with the oligosaccharide Man 9 GlcNAc 2 revealed that two Fabs assemble into an interlocked V H domain-swapped dimer. Further biochemical, biophysical, and mutagenesis data strongly support a Fab-dimerized antibody as the prevalent form that recognizes gp120. The extraordinary configuration of this antibody provides an extended surface, with newly described binding sites, for multivalent interaction with a conserved cluster of oligomannose type sugars on the surface of gp120. The unique interdigitation of Fab domains within an antibody uncovers a previously unappreciated mechanism for high-affinity recognition of carbohydrate or other repeating epitopes on cell or microbial surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2070691915,"The sorting of sodium channels to axons and the formation of clusters are of primary importance for neuronal electrogenesis. Here, we showed that the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains II and III of the Na v 1 subunit contains a determinant conferring compartmentalization in the axonal initial segment of rat hippocampal neurons. Expression of a soluble Na v 1.2II-III linker protein led to the disorganization of endogenous sodium channels. The motif was sufficient to redirect a somatodendritic potassium channel to the axonal initial segment, a process involving association with ankyrin G. Thus, this motif may play a fundamental role in controlling electrical excitability during development and plasticity."

Although local conditions affect the type and amplitude of response, a compilation of reported observations of hydrological response to earthquakes indicates that the maximum distance to which changes in stream flow and water levels in wells have been reported is related to earthquake magnitude. Detectable streamflow changes occur in areas within tens to hundreds of kilometers of the epicenter, whereas changes in groundwater levels in wells can occur hundreds to thousands of kilometers from earthquake epicenters."

Co-expression of EF hand-containing Ca2+-binding proteins termed KChIPs with pore-forming Kv4 α subunits causes changes in the gating and amplitude of Kv4 currents (An, W. F., Bowlby, M. R., Betty, M., Cao, J., Ling, H. P., Mendoza, G., Hinson, J. W., Mattsson, K. I., Strassle, B. W., Trimmer, J. S., and Rhodes, K. J. (2000) Nature 403, 553–556). Here we show that KChIPs profoundly affect the intracellular trafficking and molecular properties of Kv4.2 α subunits. Co-expression of KChIPs1–3 causes a dramatic redistribution of Kv4.2, releasing intrinsic endoplasmic reticulum retention and allowing for trafficking to the cell surface. KChIP co-expression also causes fundamental changes in Kv4.2 steady-state expression levels, phosphorylation, detergent solubility, and stability that reconstitute the molecular properties of Kv4.2 in native cells. Interestingly, the KChIP4a isoform, which exhibits unique effects on Kv4 channel gating, does not exert these effects on Kv4.2 and negatively influences the impact of other KChIPs. We provide evidence that these KChIP effects occur through the masking of an N-terminal Kv4.2 hydrophobic domain. These studies point to an essential role for KChIPs in determining both the biophysical and molecular characteristics of Kv4 channels and provide a molecular basis for the dramatic phenotype of KChIP knockout mice. Kv4 potassium channels regulate action potentials in neurons and cardiac myocytes.

Voltage-gated potassium or Kv channels, specifically those mediating low threshold, rapidly inactivating Ito and IA currents, are known to regulate cardiac and neuronal membrane excitability, respectively (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 136-139Google Scholar). In cardiac cells, Ito is a major determinant of the falling phase of the cardiac action potential (2Oudit G.Y. Kassiri Z. Sah R. Ramirez R.J. Zobel C. Backx P.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 851-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, dendritic IA can limit the peak of back-propagating action potentials as well as modulate incoming synaptic information, exerting profound effects on information processing (3Johnston D. Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Poolos N.P. Watanabe S. Colbert C.M. Migliore M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 75-81Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Kv channels are composed of homo- or heterotetramers of transmembrane pore-forming and voltage-sensing α subunits (4Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels.

Available evidence suggests that Shal or Kv4 family α subunits underlie Ito in cardiac myocytes, and IA in dendrites of many central nervous system neurons. The expression of specific Kv4 family mRNAs correlates precisely with the level of Ito in cardiac myocytes (6Dixon J.E. Shi W. Wang H.S. McDonald C. Yu H. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Circ.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have recently described a highly related family of four Kv4 Channel Interacting Proteins (KChIPs1–4) that binds to the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of Kv4 α subunits (16An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 23Holmqvist M.H. Cao J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When co-expressed in heterologous cells, KChIP1, KChIP2, and KChIP3 dramatically alter the inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation of Kv4 channels and boost the amplitude of obtained current (16An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The effects of the KChIP4a splice variant are distinct from other KChIPs, due to a unique N terminus (23Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S. An W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). KChIPs may contribute to both constitutive and dynamic regulation of Kv4 channels. KChIPs are Ca2+-binding proteins. The conserved KChIP core region contains four EF hand-containing Ca2+-binding motifs (16An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), and studies with a minimal KChIP isoform suggest Ca2+-dependent effects on inactivation (24Patel S.P. Campbell D.L.

Anderson A.E. Mayne A. Pfaffinger P.J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10123-10133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The essential role of KChIPs was acutely demonstrated by genetic ablation of KChIP2 expression in mice, which completely eliminated the cardiac Ito current resulting in a predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias (26Kuo H.C. Cheng C.F. Clark R.B. Lin J.J. Lin J.L. Hoshijima M. Nguyen-Tran V.T. Gu Y. Ikeda Y. Chu P.H. Ross J. Giles W.R. Chien K.R.

Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the molecular pathophysiology of the phenotype of this knockout is not as clear.In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying KChIP regulation of cardiac and neuronal excitability, we have investigated the effects of KChIP co-expression on the intracellular trafficking and molecular characteristics of Kv4.2 channels. We found that co-expression of KChIP1, KChIP2, and KChIP3, but not KChIP4a, leads to a conspicuous subcellular redistribution of Kv4.2 channels, from being ER-retained to being expressed on the cell surface, via a mechanism that may involve masking of a cytoplasmic trafficking and/or solubility determinant. KChIPs also induce a striking transformation in the overall molecular properties (expression level, phosphorylation, detergent solubility, and stability) of Kv4.2, leading to characteristics more typical of those observed for Kv4.2 in native cells. The dramatic differences between different KChIP isoforms in inducing these effects suggest that the precise KChIP composition of Kv4 channels impacts diverse aspects of function. Thus KChIPs induce dramatic effects on not only the biophysical properties but also the cell biological and molecular characteristics of Kv4 α subunits that dramatically impact the function, abundance, and distribution of Kv4 channels in excitable cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—We have recently 2K.

An anti-calnexin rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Stressgen (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Fluorescent species-specific and mouse isotype-specific secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from ICN (Aurora, OH).Immunofluorescence Analyses of Transfected COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (both from Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were maintained in plastic tissue culture dishes or on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in plastic Petri dishes. Cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors for Kv4.2 and KChIPs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (37Shi G. Kleinklaus A.K. Marrion N.V. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

The total cellular Kv4.2 pool was detected by EGFP fluorescence or with cytoplasmic directed rabbit polyclonal antibody Kv4.2N following detergent permeabilization. No difference in the intrinsic localization or KChIP-induced effects was observed between wild type and EGFP-tagged Kv4.2.Bound primary antibodies were detected using Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and, if needed, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Cells were viewed under indirect immunofluorescence on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. Cells with detectable surface staining (red) and with total green fluorescence or staining, indicating successful transfection, were scored under narrow wavelength Texas Red and fluorescein filter sets, respectively. For some experiments standard double immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized COS-1 cells was performed as described (35Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Images of cells were captured into a Zeiss Axiocam (Oberkochen, Germany) cooled CCD 24-bit color digital camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope with a 100×, 1.4 numerical aperture objective, using the software supplied with the camera.Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Analyses of COS-1 cell lysates prepared from transfected cells were performed as described (37Shi G.

In brief, to harvest COS-1 cells and prepare detergent lysates, cells were first washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed for 5 min on ice in 1 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer solution containing TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The detergent lysate was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 13,000 × g to pellet nuclei and debris, and the resulting supernatant (cleared lysate) was saved for analysis. For immunoblots, the cleared lysate was added to an equal volume of 2× reducing SDS sample buffer and fractionated on 9 (for Kv4.2) or 15% (for KChIPs) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Note that “lauryl sulfate” (Sigma L-5750; 69% lauryl sulfate (SDS), 26% myristyl sulfate, 5% cetyl sulfate) was used in SDS gel recipes to accentuate electrophoretic mobility differences between different phosphorylation states of Kv4.2, as has been described previously for other proteins (37Shi G.

Science. 1985; 227: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quantitation of immunoreactivity was performed by densitometry and analysis using Image J software, a public domain Java image processing program (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).For immunoprecipitation reactions, 200 μl of detergent lysate was diluted to 1 ml in ice-cold lysis buffer. Affinity-purified polyclonal Kv4.2C antibody (5 μg) was added, and the mixture was incubated on a tube rotator at 4 °C for 16 h. The antibody-antigen complex was immobilized by adsorption onto 15 μl of protein A-agarose (Pierce) by incubation on a tube rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads were washed six times in lysis buffer and then incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP, 0.1 unit/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. The beads were then resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Cycloheximide Treatment—To evaluate the stability of Kv4.2 by blocking total cellular protein synthesis, cultured COS-1 cells 24 h post-transfection were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for the indicated times and then analyzed by immunoblotting.Primary Rat Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures—Low density primary embryonic rat hippocampal cultures were prepared according to established protocols (41Banker G.A.

Briefly, an astrocyte culture was prepared from cerebral hemispheres of neonatal rats and cultured for 5 days in 6-well tissue culture plates in minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 0.6% glucose prior to plating of hippocampal neurons. The day before the hippocampal dissection, the astrocyte medium was changed to neuronal maintenance medium (minimum essential medium containing N2 supplements, 0.1% ovalbumin, and 0.1 mm sodium pyruvate) for conditioning. Hippocampi dissected from embryonic day 18 rat embryos were dissociated by treatment with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min. The hippocampal preparation were plated in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 0.06% glucose onto 22-mm square coverslips (72 cells/mm2) or 60-cm plastic tissue culture dishes (177 cells/mm2) previously coated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Neurons were incubated in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 for 4 h to attach to the coverslips, and then the coverslips transferred, inverted on wax pedestals, to the 6-well tissue culture plates that contained the previously established astrocyte cultures as a feeder layer. For neurons on plastic dishes, the media were changed to the serum-free media conditioned with a separate astrocyte culture. After 3 days, cytosine arabinoside was added to the media to 1 μm final concentration. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. One-half of the culture medium was changed weekly.Immunofluorescence Staining of Cultured Neurons—Staining of cultured neurons was performed as described previously (43Antonucci D.E. Lim S.T. Vassanelli S. Trimmer J.S. Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured neurons were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Blotto-T (4% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were then incubated in primary antibodies for 3 h or overnight. Cells were then washed three times in Blotto-T to remove excess primary antibody, followed by incubation in the appropriate secondary antibodies (diluted to 1:2000 in Blotto-T) for 1 h. After three washes in PBS-T, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in a 90% (v/v) glycerol solution containing 0.1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine in PBS, pH 9.0.Biochemical Analysis of Proteins in Cultured Neurons—Hippocampal neurons cultured on plastic dishes were washed twice with ice-cold Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), harvested, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were extracted by adding reducing SDS sample buffer, size-fractionated on 7.5% SDS-acrylamide gels, and immunoblotted for Kv4.2 (K57/1).RESULTSKChIP Co-expression Leads to Changes in the Intracellular Trafficking of Kv4.2—To begin to address the effects of KChIP co-expression on Kv4 channels, we analyzed the immunofluorescence staining pattern of COS-1 cells expressing either Kv4.2 alone or Kv4.2 plus KChIP1, KChIP2, KChIP3, or KChIP4a. We found that virtually all of the Kv4.2-expressing COS-1 cells had robust intracellular Kv4.2 staining in a perinuclear pattern typical for ER-retained membrane proteins (Fig. 1A). Moreover, no detectable cell surface staining of intact cells with anti-ectodomain Kv4.2 antibodies was observed (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the intracellular pool of Kv4.2 was in fact associated with the ER, we double-labeled COS-1 cells expressing Kv4.2 alone for Kv4.2 and the resident ER protein calnexin, which yielded precisely co-localizing perinuclear immunofluorescence staining patterns (Fig. 1F). Consistent with the ER localization of Kv4.2, double staining for Kv4.2 and the Golgi apparatus marker Lens culinaris agglutinin revealed no overlap (Supplemental Fig. 1).Co-expression of Kv4.2 with KChIP1, KChIP2, or KChIP3 at a Kv4:KChIP cDNA ratio of 2:1 resulted in a dramatic change in the subcellular distribution of Kv4.2 (Figs. 1 and 2). Kv4.2 staining now extended to the periphery of the cell, and the transfected cells now displayed robust cell surface Kv4.2 staining (Figs. 1 and 2). The residual intracellular Kv4.2 pool was no longer associated with the ER but with the Golgi, as indicated by the co-localization of intracellular Kv4.2 with Lens culinaris agglutinin (Fig. 1G) and loss of co-localization with calnexin (Supplemental Fig. 1). However, cells co-transfected with Kv4.2 and KChIP4a did not respond in this manner and resembled cells expressing Kv4.2 alone in both a lack of Kv4.2 surface staining and the presence of an ER-localized pool of Kv4.2 (Figs. 1E and 2H).Fig. 2KChIPs exhibit distinct localizations in transfected COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with KChIP1 (A), KChIP2 (B), KChIP3 (C), or KChIP4a (D) and stained with KChIP-specific antibodies (KChIP1, K55/7; KChIP2, K60/41; KChIP3, K90A/16; and KChIP4a, 1G2) after detergent permeabilization. E–H, permeabilized COS-1 cells expressing EGFP-Kv4.2 and KChIP1 (E), KChIP2 (F), KChIP3 (G), and KChIP4 (H) were stained with the relevant KChIP-specific antibodies (right panels); EGFP-Kv4.2 localization is shown as EGFP fluorescence (left panels). Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether the lack of KChIP4 effects on Kv4.2 localization was simply due to differences in steady-state expression level relative to other KChIPs, the dose dependence of the effects of KChIP2 and KChIP4a on Kv4.2 surface expression was examined (Fig. 1H). Increased KChIP2 expression yielded a dose-dependent increase in the fraction of Kv4.2-expressing cells with detectable surface expression, with initial effects apparent at a KChIP2:Kv4.2 cDNA ratio of 1:128 and maximal effects at 1:8–1:4. Interestingly, the percentage of Kv4.2-expressing cells that exhibited detectable surface staining reached a plateau at ≈60%. The basis for this observed lack of quantitative response is not known but is not due to simple lack of co-expression as >95% of the cells expressed both Kv4.2 and KChIP2. It should be noted that a similar ceiling was observed in our previous studies of Kvβ subunit effects on Kv1.2 surface expression (38Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). KChIP4a co-expression did not yield any detectable increases in Kv4.2 surface expression at any dose tested (Fig. 1H).Interestingly, KChIP4a also had a subcellular distribution distinct from the other KChIPs when expressed either alone or with Kv4.2. KChIPs1–3 expressed alone or with Kv4.2 in COS-1 cells generally exhibited a diffuse distribution throughout the cell (Fig. 2, A–C), although KChIP3-expressing cells also exhibited additional nuclear staining (Fig. 2C) consistent with its previously described DNA binding function (44Spreafico F. Barski J.J. Farina C. Meyer M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, KChIP4a staining was perinuclear (Fig. 2D), suggesting an association with the ER.KChIPs Induce Profound Changes in the Molecular Characteristics of Kv4.2—COS-1 cells expressing Kv4.2 alone exhibit a single pool of expressed protein with an apparent mass of 65 kDa on SDS gels (Fig. 3). However, two distinct populations of Kv4.2 protein, at 65 and 70 kDa, are observed when Kv4.2 is co-expressed with KChIP1, -2, or -3 (Fig. 3, A–C). The 70-kDa form is similar to the M r of native rat brain Kv4.2 (see below). The dose dependence of the induction of the surface expression and increased M r values of Kv4.2 upon co-expression of KChIPs1–3 were quite similar (Fig. 3E). Increased steady-state expression levels of Kv4.2 were also observed with increased co-expression of KChIPs, suggesting that KChIPs may also affect Kv4.2 turnover rates (Fig. 3 and see below). Moreover, similar to its lack of effect on Kv4.2 surface expression, KChIP4a co-expression did not affect the M r or steady-state expression level of Kv4.2 at any dose teste"

In mammals, thyroid hormone depletion leads to decreased LDL receptor expression and elevated serum cholesterol. The clinical association in humans has been known since the 1920s; however, a molecular explanation has been lacking. LDL receptor levels are subject to negative feedback regulation by cellular cholesterol through sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). Here we demonstrate that the SREBP-2 gene is regulated by thyroid hormone and that increased SREBP-2 nuclear protein levels in hypothyroid animals results in thyroid hormone-independent activation of LDL receptor gene expression and reversal of the associated hypercholesterolemia. This occurs without effects on other thyroid hormone-regulated genes. Thus, we propose that the decreased LDL receptor and increased serum cholesterol associated with hypothyroidism are secondary to the thyroid hormone effects on SREBP-2. These results suggest that hypercholesterolemia associated with hypothyroidism can be reversed by agents that directly increase SREBP-2. Additionally, these results indicate that mutations or drugs that lower nuclear SREBP-2 would cause hypercholesterolemia.

Hunt H.M. Hurxthal L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1930; 203: 1273-1278Crossref Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate that low LDL-cholesterol uptake in hypothyroid patients is stimulated by thyroid hormone treatment (2Thompson G.R. Soutar A.K. Spengel F.A. Jadhav A. Gavigan S.J. Myant N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2591-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and studies in experimental animals have established that the levels of LDL receptor mRNA and protein in the liver are directly associated with serum thyroid hormone levels (3Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Ness G.C. Lopez D. Chambers C.M. Newsome W.P. Cornelius P. Long C.A. Harwood Jr., H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although there is one report of activation of the LDL receptor promoter by the addition of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and 3,3′, 5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) to transfected HepG2 cells, there was no putative TR site in the promoter region under study, and direct TR binding was not evaluated (5Bakker O. Hudig F. Meijssen S. Wiersinga W.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Even though these studies cannot rule out the existence of a functional binding site for TR, they do not address the possibility of a TR site at a remote location in the LDL receptor locus; they do suggest that the regulation by TR may be at least partly indirect. In contrast to the lack of defined TR sites in the LDL receptor promoter, there are well defined functional sites through which cholesterol regulates gene expression (6Osborne T.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The key site binds the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (7Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 185-197Crossref Google Scholar). There are three major SREBPs that are encoded by two genes (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and -1c are from overlapping mRNAs encoded by one gene and the single SREBP-2 is encoded by a separate gene. All three are synthesized and first inserted into membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope where they cannot directly influence gene expression (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). When the sterol level of a cell falls, a multistep maturation process is initiated by a sterol-dependent alteration in membrane trafficking that culminates with the proteolytic release of SREBPs from the membrane (10Osborne T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The soluble SREBPs enter the nucleus and activate overlapping sets of genes that are primarily involved in lipid metabolism (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 preferentially activates the LDL receptor and other genes directly involved in cholesterol homeostasis and SREBP-1 products primarily activate genes of fatty acid metabolism (8Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). The biological effects of thyroid hormone are through hormone-dependent changes in gene expression (11Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). TR complexes with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and the heterodimer binds to specific DNA sites in target genes (12Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). The liganded receptor then helps to initiate a multistep process that ultimately results in gene activation. The current studies indicate that SREBP-2 is directly regulated by TH, and we propose that SREBP-2 is an important link between TH and cholesterol metabolism. Our studies demonstrate that SREBP-2 mRNA and nuclear protein levels are both down-regulated when mice are deprived of thyroid hormone. LDL receptor mRNA is also repressed under these conditions consistent with previous studies (3Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We further show that an independent feeding regimen that increases nuclear SREBP-2 independently of TH results in both a restimulation of LDL receptor mRNA expression and a significant decline in serum cholesterol. We also demonstrate that the SREBP-2 promoter is activated directly by TR in a ligand-dependent manner and that there is at least one TR-binding site in the 5′-flanking DNA. These studies identify SREBP-2 as a direct thyroid hormone target and indicate that increased nuclear SREBP-2 can reverse the hypercholesterolemic effects of hypothyroidism independently of TH itself. Furthermore, our results indicate that genetic modifications or pharmacological treatments that lower SREBP-2 levels would result in hypercholesterolemia. Animal Feeding Studies—Four-week-old B6129 male mice were obtained from Taconic and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (dark cycle was from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) with free access to food and water. The mice were allowed to adapt to the new environment at least 1 week before experiments and were randomly divided into three groups: control, TH-deprived, and TH-supplemented groups. The control group was fed ad libitum with normal chow diet. For the TH-deprived group, mice were fed an iodine-deficient diet supplemented with 0.15% propylthiouracil (PTU) (Harlan Teklab) for 3 weeks. On the 18th day of the iodine-deficient diet supplemented with PTU, the TH-supplemented group of mice was given 1 μg of T3 (ICN) per gram of body weight by intraperitoneal injections daily for 4 days. For the cholestid/lovastatin study, each group of mice was fed the respective diet, and, where indicated, the diet was supplemented with cholestid (Amersham Biosciences and The Upjohn Company) (4%, w/w) and lovastatin (Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.) (0.1%, w/w) for the final 7 days. The mice were sacrificed between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., and livers were removed and divided into pieces. One piece was used immediately to prepare nuclear protein. Others were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA was extracted as described below. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA (20 μg) were fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Nytran (Schleicher and Schuell BioScience). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes (1 × 106 cpm/ml) overnight at 42 °C. An 80-base HindIII/EcoRI fragment of rat ribosomal protein L32 cDNA (a gift from Tom Lane, University of California, Irvine) was used as a probe to normalize total amounts of RNA/lane. Every blot was rehybridized with the L32 probe for normalization. After hybridization, blots were washed and exposed to a Kodak BioMAX film followed by scanning with an HP 7400c flat bed scanner, and mRNA levels were then quantified using the Quantity one software (Bio-Rad). The following cDNA probes were used: HMG CoA reductase, an 0.6-kb HindIII/BamHI fragment from pBluescript mouse Red; PGC-1α, a 1.5-kb BglII/NcoI fragment from the pSV-SPORT-PGC-1 (gift of Peter Tontonoz, UCLA); FAS, an 0.2-kb EcoRI fragment from mouse FAS cDNA; LDL receptor, an 0.3-kb PstI/BamHI fragment from pBluescript mouse LDLR; 5′-deiodinase, an 0.8-kb BamHI/EcoRI from pCR2.1-mouse-5′DI. RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA samples (20 μg) were subjected to the RNase protection assay using the RPAII kit (Ambion, Inc.). 32P-labeled cRNA probes were generated from pBluescript-mSREBP-1c, mSREBP-2-pGEM-T, and L32-pGEM constructs by in vitro transcription using the MAXIscript kit (Ambion, Inc.). The RNase protection assays were performed by adding a cRNA probe for either SREBP-2 or SREBP-1c mRNA (1 × 105 cpm) and a cRNA probe (1 × 105 cpm) for L32 mRNA. L32 cRNA probe was used to normalize total amounts of RNA/lane. After digestion with RNase A/RNase T1, protected fragments were resolved on 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and processed as described above. Protein Isolation and Blotting—Fresh slices of the same livers used above for RNA analysis were processed for nuclear proteins (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed first by Ponceau S staining to confirm that equal amounts of total protein were both loaded and transferred in each lane. Then, the blot was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against mouse SREBP-2 (from Jay Horton, University of Texas, South-western) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reactivity was then detected with the ECL kit (Pierce). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay—HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. One day before transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 350,000 cells/well. After incubation for 16 h, cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described (14Magaña M.M. Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4726-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with 2 μg/well of the indicated SREBP-2 promoter-luciferase reporter, 2 μg/well of the cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and indicated expression vectors for CMX-hTR-β (2 μg) or CMX-hRXR-α (0.5 μg). Salmon sperm DNA was added to equalize total amounts of DNA. After 4–6 h, cells were treated with 10% glycerol, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and refed with a serum-free minimum essential medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenite, 5 μl/ml defined lipid mix (Invitrogen), and 0.11% de-lipidated bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 1 μm 3,3′, T3. The cells were incubated for an additional 40 h before harvest. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays and normalization were described previously (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Values represent the mean of duplicate ± S.D. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Plasmids—The 5′-deletion mutants of the SREBP-2 promoter were constructed by PCR-based amplification and cloning upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic. Mouse genomic DNA isolated from B6129 mouse liver was used as a template for PCR. The following forward primers were used: –1019/SREBP-2.Luc, 5′-ACGATGCCCTGATATTCTACTGTTTG-3′; –1509/SREBP-2.Luc, 5′-AGAAACCCTGTCTCTTGCTCAGTTCT-3′; –2053/SREBP-2.Luc, 5′-CACCAGAAGAGGGCATCAGATCCTGTTACA-3′. The reverse primer for all was 5′-GCTTGGCGCAGAGTCCCCCGTGAGGTCCAG-3′. SacI and HindIII were added to the forward and reverse primers, respectively, for cloning purposes. The PCR fragments were cloned into SacI/HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. –4316/SREBP-2.Luc was generated by cloning of a PCR fragment from –4316 to –1704 into SacI/EcoRV sites of –2053/SREBP-2.Luc. The primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′-ATCTGTTCCCAGCATCCATATGGTAGCTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGACTAACAAGGGGCTGGATATCACGAC-3′. Mouse cDNA was produced from total RNA using cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen) and used to generate cDNA fragments for type I 5′-deiodinase and SREBP-1c by PCR. A 5′-deiodinase PCR fragment was ligated into pCR2.1. pBluescript mouse SREBP-1c was constructed by blunt-end ligation of a PCR fragment into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS. The following primer pairs were used: 5′deiodinase, 5′-GCAAGGTGCTAATGACGCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-AGACATCTGTACTGGTGTGGGAAAG-3′; mSREBP-1c, 5′-ATCGGCGCGGAAGCTGTCGG-3′ and 5′-TTGTTGATGAGCTGGAGCATGT-3′. Mouse SREBP-2-pGEM-T was a generous gift from Jay Horton (University of Texas, Southwestern). CMX-hTR-α and CMX-hTR-β were from Dr. Bruce Blumberg, University of California, Irvine, and CMX-hRXR-α and pCMX-hLXR-α were from Dr. Peter Tontonoz (UCLA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—hTR-α, hTR-β, hLXR-α, and hRXR-α proteins were produced using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The sequences of one strand of the complementary oligonucleotide probes were as follows: SREBP-2, 5′-CGGACCTGATGCCCTTTTCTGACCTTGGGCACTGGGCATATG-3′; DR-4, 5′-CTAGAGCTTCAGGTCACAGGAGGTCAGAGAGCT-3′; mutant TRE, 5′-TCCCGCTATGCAAATCTGAGCTGCTG-3′. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, and, where indicated, they were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 20 min in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 12.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 4 μg of poly(dI·dC), 5 μg of nonfat dry milk, and 5% (w/v) Ficoll. T3 or cold DNA competitors were added to the binding buffer at the concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Serum Cholesterol Measurements—Serum total cholesterol levels were measured using the Infinity cholesterol reagent kit (Sigma, catalog no. 401-25P) and Cholesterol standards (Sigma, catalog no. C0534). To study the effects of thyroid hormone depletion in an animal model system, mice are fed an iodine-deficient diet and PTU, which inhibits the 5′-deiodinase enzyme required to convert the T4 form of TH into the more bio-active T3 isoform (15Yamada T. Chopra I.J. Kaplowitz N. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1981; 4: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, serum TH levels fall significantly, and the effect can be reversed by injecting the animals with exogenous T3 (16Weiss R.E. Forrest D. Pohlenz J. Cua K. Curran T. Refetoff S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3624-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the changes in serum T3, the level of mRNA for putative thyroid hormone target genes in the liver decline, and they return to normal when T3 is added back (17Takeuchi Y. Murata Y. Sadow P. Hayashi Y. Seo H. Xu J. O'Malley B.W. Weiss R.E. Refetoff S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1346-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Several genes involved in de novo lipogenesis including FAS are regulated in this manner (18Swierczynski J. Mitchell D.A. Reinhold D.S. Salati L.M. Stapleton S.R. Klautky S.A. Struve A.E. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17459-17466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, we showed that FAS displayed this pattern of regulation (Fig. 1A). Genes of cholesterol metabolism exhibit a similar pattern of expression, and in agreement with these previous observations (3Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) mRNA levels for HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor follow this classic T3 regulated pattern (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, expression of other genes, including those encoding SREBP-1c and the PPAR-γ coactivator (PGC-1α) (19Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar), is not T3-responsive (Fig. 1, E and F). Importantly, the level of SREBP-2 mRNA followed the pattern of a typical T3-regulated gene; however, the magnitude was somewhat lower than for the other T3 target genes (Fig. 1D). Because SREBP-2 activates key genes of cholesterol metabolism, it is possible that the response to variations in TH is secondary to the changes in SREBP-2. This would provide a mechanism for linking cholesterol metabolism to thyroid hormone levels and would explain why genes of cholesterol metabolism follow a classic TR-regulation pattern. If a decrease in active nuclear SREBP-2 protein was primarily responsible for the repression of LDL receptor mRNA levels in the experiments above, then an increase in nuclear SREBP-2 protein while animals were maintained in a TH-deprived state should result in reactivation of LDL receptor mRNA expression. Therefore, we repeated the experiments of Fig. 1 but we included groups of animals fed a diet containing lovastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, and cholestid, a bile acid sequestrant. This feeding protocol is designed to simulate a low cholesterol environment in the liver, and it results in activation of genes of cholesterol metabolism (20Liscum L. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8450-8455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This regimen also increases the nuclear accumulation of SREBP-2 protein (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We prepared both RNA and nuclear protein from the livers of these animals. First, to evaluate whether nuclear SREBP-2 levels were altered by the PTU/low iodine diet and increased upon feeding cholestid and lovastatin, we measured the nuclear SREBP-2 protein levels by Western blotting (Fig. 2). In agreement with previous studies performed in the hamster (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), nuclear SREBP-2 levels are low when animals are fed a chow diet and they are induced by the addition of cholestid and lovastatin (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with lower levels of SREBP-2 mRNA, the PTU/low iodine diet resulted in a decrease in nuclear SREBP-2 protein (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 3). Importantly, treatment of the TH-deprived animals with cholestid and lovastatin resulted in an increase in nuclear SREBP-2 protein (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4). T3 supplementation resulted in an increase above the PTU/low iodine diet (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). RNA blotting with samples from these animals demonstrated that LDL receptor mRNA was down-regulated normally by TH depletion (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Interestingly, the level of LDL receptor mRNA was increased by the lovastatin/cholestid combination under TH-deprived conditions (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3 and 4). The SREBP-2 gene is auto-regulated (21Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and its expression pattern exhibited a similar regulation profile (Fig. 3B). For specificity, we analyzed hepatic type I 5′-deiodinase, which is a sensitive target of thyroid hormone and TR (22Berry M.J. Kates A.L. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Its mRNA followed a classic T3 response pattern in our experiments (Fig. 3C). Importantly, it was unaffected by the addition of cholestid and lovastatin (Fig. 3C) indicating that cholestid and lovastatin did not have a secondary affect on thyroid hormone regulation. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the drop in LDL receptor mRNA that occurs under TH deprivation is secondary to the decrease in SREBP-2. The LDL receptor protein is responsible for high affinity uptake of LDL-cholesterol in the liver, and a TH-deprived state results in hypercholesterolemia because of the down-regulation in LDL receptor expression (23Dumas L.H. Thyroid. 2002; 12: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To evaluate this in our studies, we measured whether the increase in LDL receptor mRNA resulted in a decrease in serum cholesterol (Fig. 4). As expected, serum cholesterol was down-regulated by cholestid and lovastatin in the normal chow-fed animals (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2). In the TH-deprived animals, the cholesterol level was dramatically increased as expected (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 3). Importantly, inclusion of lovastatin and cholestid resulted in a significant drop in serum cholesterol levels of these otherwise TH-deprived animals. This indicates that the increase in LDL receptor mRNA resulted in functional expression of LDL receptor protein. The studies presented so far indicate that the SREBP-2 gene might be directly activated by TH. To evaluate this, we fused 4316 bases of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SREBP-2 gene to the luciferase reporter and used it in a HepG2 cell-based transfection assay that we established to evaluate thyroid hormone and TR regulation. When the transfected cells were cultured in a serum-free defined medium, the addition of expression vectors for TR and RXR coupled with T3 selectively induced luciferase activity ∼6-fold (Fig. 5A). This stimulation required expression vectors and T3 hormone. A similar pattern of activation was observed for the control murine leukemia virus luciferase (MLVLuc) reporter, which has been used as a model T3-responsive promoter (24Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The pGL3 vector was expressed at a very low level and showed a minimal response to TR/RXR that was not further stimulated by the addition of T3 (Fig. 5A) Deletion of the 5′-flanking region of the SREBP-2 promoter from –4316 to –2053 resulted in a modest drop in T3 stimulation, and further truncation down to –1019 showed that a moderate level of stimulation by TR/RXR and T3 was retained (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the SREBP-2 gene is directly activated by TR, and it is likely that there are more than one TR-binding site spread throughout the 5′-flanking region. Because there was a modest drop in T3 regulation upon deletion of the DNA from –4316 to –2053, we scanned this region for the presence of putative DR-4-like response elements, which are known to be high affinity TR sites (25Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We noticed there was a recognizable match to this consensus in this sequence interval (noted in Fig. 5A), and we designed complementary oligonucleotides encompassing this putative TR site for use in a gel mobility shift assay with TR and RXR (Fig. 6). Heterodimers of each TR isoform with RXR bound efficiently to this SREBP-2 DR-4 site (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–11). Efficient binding by both TR-α and TR-β required RXR, and binding was unaffected by the presence of thyroid hormone. A similar DNA binding pattern was observed for a synthetic consensus DR-4 site (Fig. 6A, lanes 12–20). The formation of the TR/RXR-specific complex was sensitive to competition by the unlabeled SREBP-2 probe and to the consensus DR-4 site but not to DNA containing a mutated DR-4 element (Fig. 6B). The current studies reveal a molecular mechanism for the association between hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism. It has been established previously that expression of the LDL receptor gene and protein was repressed when thyroid hormone levels were artificially decreased (3Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but the mechanism for this drop in expression had not been defined previously. In the present report, we demonstrate that the gene encoding SREBP-2, a major transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cholesterol uptake and synthesis, is directly regulated by thyroid hormone. Both SREBP-2 mRNA (Fig. 1) and nuclear protein (Fig. 2) fall in parallel when mice are fed a diet designed to lower serum levels of TH. Nuclear SREBP-2 levels increase when the diet of chow-fed animals is supplemented with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and a bile acid sequestrant (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). When the TH-deprived animals in our studies were fed this same mixture, SREBP-2 nuclear protein and LDL receptor mRNA levels both increased (Figs. 2 and 3, respectively), and serum cholesterol levels decreased (Fig. 4). The activation of LDL receptor was not because of an effect of cholestid or lovastatin on TH regulation, as the mRNA level for hepatic 5′-deiodinase, which is another TR-regulated gene was not affected (Fig. 3C). These results form the basis for a model to account for hypothyroid-linked hypercholesterolemia. The model predicts that as thyroid hormone levels fall, SREBP-2 levels decline followed closely by a drop in LDL receptor mRNA. This results in a decline in high affinity LDL cholesterol uptake in the liver resulting in hypercholesterolemia, which is fundamentally linked to thyroid hormone status. TH depletion in animals not only lowers liver LDL receptor mRNA and protein (26Ness G.C. Lopez D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but hypothyroid humans have increased serum LDL cholesterol (27Abrams J.J. Grundy S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 323-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduced LDL uptake that can be reversed by adding T3 (2Thompson G.R. Soutar A.K. Spengel F.A. Jadhav A. Gavigan S.J. Myant N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2591-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, our model would account for the association between low serum TH levels and hypercholesterolemia in humans as well. Because hypercholesterolemia associated with low TH levels is effectively reversed by T3 supplementation (2Thompson G.R. Soutar A.K. Spengel F.A. Jadhav A. Gavigan S.J. Myant N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2591-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the therapeutic significance of our findings is not immediately obvious. However, our data provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical association and may be helpful in designing therapeutic strategies to help treat patients with more complicated diseases such as resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) where patients have mutations that directly inactivate the TRβ gene (28Weiss R.E. Refetoff S. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2000; 1: 97-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study provided evidence that the LDL receptor promoter was activated in HepG2 cells when an expression construct for TR was added along with T3 (5Bakker O. Hudig F. Meijssen S. Wiersinga W.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, TR binding was not directly evaluated in this earlier study and the results observed are consistent with TR activating endogenous SREBP-2, which could then activate the LDL receptor gene. Our results indicate that TR directly activates SREBP-2, and it is well established that SREBP-2 activates the LDL receptor gene (13Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies clearly establish an indirect mode of regulation for the LDL receptor by T3. However, further studies are required to establish whether there is also a direct effect of TR. Our studies demonstrate that TR directly activates expression of the SREBP-2 gene, and we have identified at least one binding site for TR in the 5′-flanking sequence (Fig. 6). Based on the gradual loss in T3 responsiveness in the analysis of the promoter deletions, there are likely other functional binding sites for TR and further studies are needed to characterize these additional elements. SREBP-2 is also autoregulated by SREBPs (21Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and SREBP-2 mRNA was also up-regulated by the cholestid and lovastatin under the TH-depleted conditions shown in Fig. 3. SREBPs and TR functionally cooperate to activate both the rodent S14 and chicken acetyl-CoA carboxylase promoters (29Jump D.B. Thelen A.P. Mater M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34419-34427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Yin L. Zhang Y. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 356-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether SREBPs and TR functionally interact to stimulate expression of the SREBP-2 promoter as well.

Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the heat shock proteins may play a role in regulating the NF-κB pathway. The heat shock proteins (Hsps) can be divided into five major families on the basis of their size, structure, and function and include the Hsp110, Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp60 in addition to Hsp27 and other small heat shock proteins (25Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). The expression of these proteins is induced by a wide variety of different physical, chemical, and biological stimuli including oxidative stress, heavy metals, osmotic stress, and heat shock (25Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the small heat shock proteins, which include the AB-crystallins and Hsp27, are oligomeric phosphoproteins whose expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner (26Arrigo AP M.P.

While investigating the role of Hsp90 and other heat shock proteins on IKK activation, we found that TNFα increased p38-MK2 phosphorylation of Hsp27 to enhance its association with IKKβ and thus decrease IKK activity. Treatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of p38 disrupted the interaction of Hsp27 and IKKβ and resulted in increased IKK activity. These studies indicate that Hsp27 plays a negative role in TNFα-mediated IKK activity and may be involved in down-regulating IKK activity at later times after TNFα stimulation.

At 24 h post-transfection, HeLa cells were stimulated with either human TNFα (20 ng/ml) or IL-1 (5 ng/ml) for 6 h. Antibodies and Reagents—SB203580 (CalBiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 1 μm, and recombinant human TNF-α (20 ng/ml) and IL-1 (5 ng/ml) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Anti-IKKα (catalog number 556532), anti-IKKβ (catalog number 550621), and anti-p38 (catalog number 612168) were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Hsp27 (catalog number spa-803) and mouse anti-Hsp27 (catalog number spa-800) were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). Anti-phospho-Hsp27 (Ser78) (catalog number 05-645) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Hsp90 (catalog number sc-1055), anti-HA (catalog number sc-805), and anti-IKKα (sc-7182), as well as goat anti-Hsp70 (catalog number sc-1060) and anti-HSC 70 (catalog number sc-1059) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-IκBα (catalog number 9242), anti-phospho-IκBα (catalog number 9241), and anti-phospho-p38 (catalog number 9211) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-FLAG M2 and antiactin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant MAPK-activated protein kinase kinase 2 and Hsp27 proteins were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Plasmids—For the construction of expression vector encoding Hsp27, this cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA and subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). The expression vector encoding Hsp27 phosphorylation mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RNA Oligonucleotides—Small interfering RNA (siRNAs) with two thymidine residues (dTdT) at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotides were designed for Hsp27 (5′-ACG GUC AAG ACC AAG GAU G-3′), HTLV-1 Tax (5′-GAU GGA CGC GUU AUC GGC U-3′) genes, GFP (5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′), and their complementary RNA oligonucleotides as described (34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar) (Dharmacon Research Inc, Lafayette, CO). These RNAs were dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) as 200 μm solutions and annealed at room temperature following heating to 95 °C in buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm magnesium acetate). Transfection of siRNAs—Approximately, 1 × 106 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to 30–50% confluency, and transfection of the RNA oligonucleotides was performed as described previously (35Surabhi R.M. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12963-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), resulting in a final RNA concentration of 20 nm. After 48 h, the cells were treated with either TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or IL-1 (5 ng/ml) for the times indicated and lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 2 mm NaPPi, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science) and then used in immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (37He K.L. Ting A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6034-6045Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Coimmunoprecipitation—The cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of Hsp27 antibody for overnight and further incubated for 2 h following the addition of 30 μl of protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western blot analysis using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or Super Signal (Pierce). In Vitro Kinase Assays—The cells were incubated with lysis buffer followed by the addition of anti-IKKα antibody. The immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NaF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min (38Park K.J. Choi S.H. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Substrates used in these kinase reactions were either GST-IκBα (1 μg) containing wild type (amino acids 1–54) or mutant sequences that in residues 32 and 36 were substituted with alanine or Hsp27 (1 μg). The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then detected by autoradiography. Hsp27 Is Associated with the IKK Proteins—First we addressed whether other members of the heat shock protein family in addition to Cdc37 and Hsp90 (24Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) could also associate with the IKK complex. HeLa lysates were prepared from non-stimulated HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against specific heat shock proteins as indicated, and associated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Hsp27 interacted with both IKKα and IKKβ under nonstimulated conditions (Fig. 1, lane 1), whereas Hsp90 interacted with only IKKα (Fig. 1, lane 4). Other family members including Hsp70 and Hsc70 did not interact with either IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). Immunoprecipitation of these extracts with normal IgG followed by Western blot analysis with the IKK antibodies revealed no detectable association of these proteins, indicating the specificity of IKK interactions with Hsp27 and Hsp90 (Fig. 1, lane 5). Western blot analysis of these extracts showed equivalent expression of these proteins (Fig. 1, bottom panels). These results indicate that Hsp27, like Hsp90, can specifically associate with the IKK complex. Hsp27 Association with IKKβ Is Increased in a TNFα-dependent Manner—To determine whether the interaction of Hsp27 with IKKα and IKKβ could be altered by treatment with either TNFα or IL-1, HeLa cells were stimulated with either TNFα or IL-1 followed by immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against Hsp27 or IgG and Western blot analysis to detect IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 2). Although both IKKα and IKKβ were associated with Hsp27 under nonstimulated conditions, the binding of Hsp27 with IKKβ was increased at both 5 and 30 min post-TNFα stimulation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3, second panel) whereas the binding of Hsp27 to IKKα did not change (Fig. 2A, top panel). In contrast to the results with TNFα treatment, the interaction of Hsp27 with IKKα and IKKβ did not change following IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). Control immunoprecipitates with normal rabbit IgG did not demonstrate an association of Hsp27 with the IKKs (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis demonstrated equal expression of these proteins (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom panels). Taken together, these results, which were seen in four independent experiments, demonstrated that TNFα treatment results in increased interaction of Hsp27 with IKKβ. Hsp27 Down-regulates IKK-mediated NF-κB Activation— The role of Hsp27 in regulating TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation was addressed in transfection studies using an NF-κB luciferase reporter (Fig. 3). HeLa cells were cotransfected with an NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct using either a CMV expression vector alone or encoding Hsp27. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were either left untreated or treated with TNFα for 6 h, and then luciferase activity was assayed. TNFα-treated cells resulted increased NF-κB activity (∼70-fold increase) as compared with the untreated cells, whereas overexpression of Hsp27 dramatically suppressed TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A). To determine whether Hsp27-mediated decreases in NF-κB activity were dependent on IKKβ, the effects of Hsp27 on IKKβ-induced NF-κB luciferase activity was tested. IKKβ increased NF-κB luciferase activity, and this increase was dramatically reduced by the expression of Hsp27 (Fig. 3B). To test the specificity the effects of Hsp27 on the NF-κB pathway, HeLa cells were cotransfected a TK-luciferase reporter construct in either the presence or absence of an Hsp27 expression vector (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast to the results with the NF-κB reporter, Hsp27 did not alter the expression of the TK-luciferase reporter in either the presence of TNFα (Fig. 3C) or IKKβ (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that Hsp27 inhibits both TNFα- and IKKβ-mediated NF-κB gene expression likely via its ability to interact with IKKβ. Hsp27 siRNA Increases TNFα-mediated Activation of the NF-κB Pathway—Because our data indicated that Hsp27 overexpression could inhibit IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation, it seemed likely that inhibition of Hsp27 expression would result in increased TNFα-mediated NF-κB activity. HeLa cells were transfected with Oligofectamine alone or siRNA directed against Hsp27 or GFP as a control. After 48 h of siRNA transfection, an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct was cotransfected along with an RSV-β-galactosidase expression vector. After an additional 24 h, the cells were stimulated with TNFα for 6 h. Hsp27 siRNA but not control or GFP siRNA up-regulated TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation and also slightly increased the basal NF-κB activity (Fig. 4A, top panel), Western blot analysis demonstrated that Hsp27 siRNA, but not control or GFP siRNA, specifically reduced the expression of Hsp27 but not actin (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). In vitro kinase assays were performed to confirm the effects of Hsp27 siRNA on TNFα-induced IKK activity (Fig. 4B). HeLa cells were transfected with Oligofectamine alone or either Hsp27 siRNA or Tax siRNA as a negative control. After 72 h post-transfection of these siRNAs, the cells were treated with TNFα for 10 min, and in vitro kinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitated IKK complex using as substrates either wild type GST-IκBα (1–54) or mutant GST-IκBα (1–54) containing mutations of serine residues 32 and 36 to alanine. TNFα stimulation increased the level of IKK activity in both Oligofectamine and Tax siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 4B, lane 4), and there was a further increase in TNFα-mediated IKK activity in Hsp27 siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 4B, lane 5). Hsp27 siRNA, but not Tax siRNA, specifically reduced the expression of Hsp27 but not the expression of IKKα, IKKβ, or actin (Fig. 4B, bottom panels). These results demonstrate that the reduction of Hsp27 leads to increased TNFα-mediated IKK activity. Finally, we determined whether inhibition of endogenous Hsp27 expression altered TNFα-mediated IκBα degradation. Hsp27 siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells, and at 72 h post-transfection TNFα was added for the indicated times. Western blot analysis with antibody directed against the IκBα demonstrated that Hsp27 siRNA enhanced TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα as compared with Oligofectamine-treated or GFP siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that Hsp27 down-regulates TNFα-induced IKK and NF-κB activity. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 Down-regulates TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation by Increasing Its Interaction with IKKβ— Previous reports demonstrated that phosphorylation of serine residues 15, 78, and 82 in Hsp27 is induced in response to heat shock and cytokine treatment (39Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to address whether TNFα-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 is involved in regulating IKK activity. HeLa cells were treated with TNFα for the indicated times, and the phosphorylation state of Hsp27 in these extracts was determined Western blot analysis. Hsp27 was maximally phosphorylated at 30 min post-TNFα treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 3, top panel), and this correlated with the peak of TNFα-induced binding of Hsp27 with IKKβ (Fig. 2A). IL-1 stimulated Hsp27 phosphorylation with similar kinetics as seen with TNFα (data not shown and Ref. 41Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In contrast, maximal TNFα-induced IκBα phosphorylation occurred at 5 min post-treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 2, middle panel). To further characterize the role of Hsp27 phosphorylation on regulating its interaction with IKKβ, wild type, or Hsp27 mutants in specific phosphorylation sites at residues 15, 78, and 82 were constructed and assayed following cotransfection into HeLa cells with HA-tagged IKKβ (Fig. 5B). Following immunoprecipitation of these FLAG-tagged Hsp27 proteins, Western blot analysis was then performed to detect HA-tagged IKKβ. Wild type Hsp27 strongly associated with IKKβ, whereas the Hsp27 phosphorylation mutants S15A and S78A/S82A were unable to associate with IKKβ, even though similar amounts of these proteins were present (Fig. 5B, top panel). In contrast, a mutant that substituted aspartate for serine residues 78 and 82 to mimic Hsp27 phosphorylation resulted in similar interactions with IKKβ as wild type Hsp27 (Fig. 5B, top panel). These results indicated that phosphorylation of Hsp27 is involved in mediating its interaction with IKKβ. To determine whether phosphorylation of Hsp27 alters TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation, expression vectors encoding wild type or mutant Hsp27 proteins were analyzed for their effects or NF-κB luciferase activity in the presence and absence of TNFα treatment. Similar to the results seen in Fig. 3A, TNFα induced a ∼70-fold increase of NF-κB activity, whereas wild type Hsp27 inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 5C). However, transfection of the Hsp27 phosphorylation mutants did not suppress TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5C). There was no effect of the wild type or mutant Hsp27 constructs on the TK-luciferase construct (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Hsp27 is important in regulating its ability to modulate the TNFα-mediated NF-κB activity. TNFα-dependent Interaction of Hsp27 with IKKβ Is Disrupted by a p38 Kinase Inhibitor—Because Hsp27 is associated with IKKβ, it is possible that IKK may be involved in the phosphorylation of Hsp27. Baculovirus-purified wild type IKKβ or a kinase defective mutant (SS/AA) was tested in in vitro kinase assays using Hsp27 as the substrate (Fig. 6A). As a positive control, bacterial expressed MK2, which is a direct substrate of p38 MAPKα and β (30Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 31Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and has been directly demonstrated to phosphorylate Hsp27, was utilized (41Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (41Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), MK2 but not IKKβ was found to directly phosphorylate Hsp27 (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 4). These results suggest that TNFα-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 was predominantly due to activation of the p38-MK2 cascade pathway. To extend these results, the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 was utilized to test whether inhibition of the p38 signal pathway prevented TNFα-induced phosphorylation of Hsp27. HeLa cells were treated with either Me2SO or the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 for 1 h prior to TNFα stimulation. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed with Hsp27 antibody followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against either IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 6B). Following TNFα treatment, Hsp27 was strongly associated with IKKα in both Me2SO- and SB203580-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–8, top panel), whereas its association with IKKβ was increased in Me2SO-but not SB203580-treated cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–8, second panel). The decreased association of Hsp27 with IKKβ seen in SB203580-treated cells correlated with decreased Hsp27 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B, third panel). These results indicate that the p38-MK2 cascade pathway is involved in both TNFα-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 and its ability to associate with IKKβ. Next, we addressed whether decreased Hsp27 phosphorylation altered IKK activity. IKK activity was enhanced in the SB203580-treated HeLa cells as compared with Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 6C, top panel, lanes 1–8). However, treatment of cells with SB203580 reduced TNFα-mediated NF-κB luciferase reporter activity likely via inhibition of the MSK-1 kinase, which has been demonstrated to phosphorylate and thus activate p65 transactivation (data not shown and Ref. 42Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Berghe W.V. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicated that p38-MK2 phosphorylation of Hsp27 increases the association of Hsp27 with IKKβ to inhibit of TNFα-mediated IKKβ activity. TNFα is a proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in diverse cellular responses that are dependent on the activation of various inducible transcription factors, among them NF-κB (4Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Following exposure of cells to cytokines such as TNFα, the IKKs are activated and stimulate the NF-κB pathway (7Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 8Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Recently other proteins in addition to IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ/NEMO have been demonstrated to be associated with IKK complex (24Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 43Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol.

J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether these proteins regulate IKK activity in a positive or negative manner and how TNFα-mediated activation of different signal transduction pathway is involved in cross-talk between these pathways. In this study, we present data that the Hsp27 regulates TNFα-mediated NF-κB activity. First, Hsp27 association with IKKβ is increased in a TNFα-dependent manner. Second, Hsp27 down-regulates both TNFα- and IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation, and Hsp27 siRNA reverses this negative effect on NF-κB activation. Finally, the association of Hsp27 with IKK is mediated by its phosphorylation as demonstrated using Hsp27 phosphorylation mutants and the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580. These results suggest that Hsp27 functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway likely by down-regulating IKK activity following TNFα treatment. Hsp27 is a small heat shock protein that is involved in a variety of biological activities such as chaperone function, preventing apoptosis, and stabilizing the cytoskeleton (33Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2661-2667PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp27 is ubiquitously expressed in most human cells (47Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 48Wilkinson J.M. Pollard I. Anat. Rec. 1993; 237: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and its expression is increased to high levels in some tumor cells, including breast cancer, neuroblastoma, human astrocytomas, and gastric cancer (49Vargas-Roig L.M.

Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unlike Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90, Hsp27 is an ATP-independent chaperone. A recent study demonstrated that Hsp90/Cdc37 are components of the high molecular weight IKK complex and regulate its activity via recruitment to the TNFα receptor (24Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These results suggested that heat shock proteins are involved in regulating a critical step in IKK activation and led to our analysis of the roles of these proteins on this process. Our data indicated that Hsp27 is a negative regulator of TNFα-mediated NF-κB activity via its association with IKK. Hsp27 interaction with IKKβ is regulated by TNFα treatment but does not change following IL-1 stimulation, suggesting that Hsp27 is specifically involved in regulation of TNFα-mediated signaling (Fig. 2). Although the Hsp90/Cdc37 complex was previously demonstrated to bind to both IKKα and IKKβ (24Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we observed that Hsp90 interacted with only IKKα (Fig. 1). This discrepancy in our analysis and a previous study could be due to differences in assay conditions. Furthermore, we found that unlike Hsp27 siRNA, which up-regulates TNFα-mediated activation of IKK and NF-κB reporter assays, Hsp90 siRNA down-regulates TNFα-mediated NF-κB activity (data not shown). These results are consistent with the role of Hsp90 as a positive regulator of the NF-κB pathway. Other heat shock family members, Hsp70 and Hsc70, did not associate with IKK complex or regulate NF-κB activity, indicating that not all members of heat shock proteins are involved this process. It is unclear why TNFα treatment increases the association of Hsp27 with IKKβ without changing its association with IKKα. Both IKKα and IKKβ can form heterodimers and homodimers, and dimerization of these kinases is critical for their kinase activity. Hsp27 could independently associate with either IKKα or IKKβ homodimers, and its association with IKKβ could block the formation of an IKKα/β-heterodimer following TNFα stimulation. Further studies will be required to better understand its role as a negative regulator of IKK activity following TNFα treatment. Hsp27 is phosphorylated by stimulation of the p38 MAPK cascade and subsequent activation of MK2 and MK3 in response to different treatments including heat shock, cytokines, growth factors, and peptide hormones (39Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hsp27 on serine residues 15, 78, and 82 is critical for its biological role in response to environmental stress, heat shock, TNFα, and IL-1 (29Benn S.C. Perrelet D. Kato A.C.

Although wild type Hsp27 interacts with IKKβ, the Hsp27 phosphorylation mutants S15A and S78A/S82A, but not S78D/S82D, were unable to efficiently bind to IKKβ (Fig. 5B) and could not suppress TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5C). Finally, treatment with the p38 specific inhibitor SB203580 disrupted the association of Hsp27 with IKKβ in response to TNFα (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these data suggest that p38-MK2-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 increases its association with IKKβ to suppress TNFα-mediated IKK activity. The differential ability of Hsp90 and Hsp27 to serve as chaperones that bind the IKK complex can result in both positive and negative effects on TNFα-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway. Our results indicate that p38-MK2 phosphorylation of Hsp27 increases its association with IKKβ and reduces IKK activity. The mechanism by which Hsp27 reduces IKK activity is unknown, although its ability to prevent IKKβ association with other components of IKK complex may decrease its interactions with the TNF receptor following TNFα treatment. Further studies will be needed to better define the mechanism by which Hsp27 reduces IKK activity and how cross-talk between the p38 and NF-κB pathways is involved in regulating these important signal transduction pathways.

EGFR sorting to lysosomes depends on its kinase domain and its ubiquitination by Cbl proteins. Proteasomes have also been proposed to regulate EGFR degradation, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Here we evaluated EGFR activation, Cbl recruitment, EGFR ubiquitination and degradation in response to EGF, TGFα, and E4T. We also determined the fate of activated EGFRs and Cbl proteins by using v-ATPase (bafilomycin A1) and proteasome (lactacystin) inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that E4T and TGFα provoke decreased Cbl recruitment, EGFR ubiquitination and EGFR degradation compared with EGF. Furthermore, bafilomycin treatment blocks EGFR but not c-Cbl degradation. In contrast, lactacystin treatment blocks EGF-induced c-Cbl degradation but does not block EGFR degradation, even though lactacystin causes a minor delay in EGFR degradation. Surprisingly, even though bafilomycin completely blocks EGFR degradation, it does not prevent EGFR de-ubiquitination upon prolonged EGF stimulation. Strikingly, when combined with bafilomycin, lactacystin treatment stabilizes the ubiquitinated EGFR and prevents its de-ubiquitination. We conclude that the enhanced EGFR recycling that has been observed in HER-14 cells following TGFα or E4T stimulation correlates with decreased EGFR ubiquitination and EGFR degradation, and that proteasomal activity is required for de-ubiquitination of the EGFR prior to its lysosomal degradation.

Polypeptide growth factors play an important role in the regulation of cell division. In various types of epithelial carcinomas the overexpression of human transforming growth factor α (TGFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFα, transforming growth factor α; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; MPV, mean pixel value; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MVB, multivesicular body; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. is frequently observed. This is often accompanied by overexpression of ErbB receptors (ErbB1 also called the EGFR, ErbB2) and has been associated with poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy (1Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar, 2Klapper L.N. Kirschbaum M.H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). EGF and TGFα are highly homologous molecules; both are members of the epidermal growth factor family (3Carpenter G. Whal M.I. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Vol. 1. Springer Verlag New York Inc., New, York1991: 69-171Google Scholar) and exert their biological function through binding to the EGFR, a member of the ErbB receptor family. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization is a prerequisite for receptor activation, which triggers the intrinsic kinase activity resulting in the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues at the C-terminal region of the receptor (4Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for several SH2 domain-containing proteins thereby conveying the biological signal from outside to the inner side of the cell. Multiple protein-protein interaction cascades follow, resulting in the activation of MAPK and eventually in cell division. Ligand binding to the EGFR also triggers the internalization and subsequent degradation of the activated receptor (4Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). This process leads to clearing of activated receptors from the cell surface thereby desensitizing the cells for mitogenic signals (5Sorkin A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d729-d738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends.

Clathrin-coated pits maturate into clathrin-coated vesicles, which subsequently fuse with the early endosome. From the early endosome, free EGFRs recycle back to the cell surface, whereas ligand-bound receptors undergo receptor kinase-dependent sorting into the internal vesicles of the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (8Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The maturation of early endosome to late endosome is accompanied by accumulation of EGF-EGFR complexes in the internal vesicles of MVBs (9Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) resulting in sequestration of the cytoplasmic domain, thereby preventing it from interacting with cytoplasmic target molecules. Subsequently, the late endosome fuses with pre-existing lysosomes leading to lysosomal degradation of ligand-receptor complexes by the lysosomal proteases (10Authier F. Metioui M. Bell A.W. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33723-33731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pH of the lumen of the endocytic compartments decreases along the endocytic route due to the action of the vacuolar ATPase. The EGF-EGFR complex is resistant to the mildly acidic pH of early and late endosomes and remains intact along the endocytic route (5Sorkin A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d729-d738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon reaching the lysosome, both ligand and receptor are degraded by the lysosomal proteases (9Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J.

Ubiquitination of cargo proteins requires the ATP-dependent activation and covalent binding of the 76 amino acids ubiquitin molecule by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (designated E1), after which ubiquitin is transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. E2 enzymes ubiquitinate target substrate proteins in concert with either E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes or with E3 RING finger adapter proteins. This results in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules to a lysine residue on a substrate protein. This process is often iterated resulting in multiple attachments of ubiquitin molecules to either a different lysine residue on a substrate protein or to a lysine residue on previously attached ubiquitin (17Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of the EGFR is critically dependent on the activity of Cbl adapter proteins (18Meisner H.

Both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGFR activation (20Galisteo M.L. Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Langdon W.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

This dual binding property of Cbl proteins facilitates recruitment of the ubiquitination machinery to activated EGFRs, an event that results in polyubiquitination of the EGFRs. Interestingly, Levkowitz et al. (12Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oncogenic Cbl proteins inhibit down-regulation and enhance recycling of internalized EGFRs. In general, polyubiquitin serves as a signal for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Thus, even though degradation of activated EGFRs can be mediated by lysosomal proteases (5Sorkin A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d729-d738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Authier F. Metioui M. Bell A.W. Mort J.S. J. Biol.

Indeed, blocking proteasomal activity with the non-proteasome-specific peptide aldehyde MG132 resulted in accumulation of full length EGFR and prevention of receptor degradation (16Ettenberg S.A. Magnifico A. Cuello M. Nau M.M. Rubinstein Y.R. Yarden Y. Weissman A.M. Lipkowitz S. J. Biol.

Therefore, the exact mechanism responsible for the degradation of the EGFR remains obscure and in particular the role of the proteasome in the degradation process of the EGFR is an issue of debate. Multiple EGFR ligands are known to differ in their mitogenic activity. For example in various model systems, TGFα is a more potent mitogen than EGF (26Schreiber A.B. Winkler M.E. Derynck R. Science. 1986; 232: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 27Barrandon Y. Green H. Cell. 1987; 50: 1131-1137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 28Ebner R.

Sela M. van Zoelen E.J. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3385-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Moreover, several chimeric EGF-TGFα growth factors that were generated in our department, show superagonist activity in both 32D1 and HER-14 model systems and are able to induce similar mitogenic responses as EGF but at 10-fold lower concentrations (29Lenferink A.E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. van de Poll M.L. van Vugt M.J. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Waterman H. Sela M. van Zoelen E.J. Yarden Y.

J. 1997; 327: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One such superagonist ligand is E4T, in which EGF sequences after the fourth cysteine of the EGF module have been replaced by the corresponding residues of TGFα. In addition, similar to TGFα, EGFR binding capacity of these superagonists was found to be more sensitive to low pH compared with EGF (30Lenferink A.E. Kramer R.H. van Vugt M.J. Konigswieser M. Di Fiore P.P. van Zoelen E.J. van de Poll M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consequently, TGFα and the superagonists might dissociate earlier in the endosomal system than EGF leading to enhanced recycling of the EGFR. Indeed, while EGFR internalization kinetics are similar in response to EGF, TGFα, or E4T (29Lenferink A.E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. van de Poll M.L. van Vugt M.J. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Waterman H.

In addition, superagonist ligands, including E4T, show enhanced on/off rates as measured by Biacore experiments (31Lenferink A.E. van Zoelen E.J. van Vugt M.J.

Pinkas-Kramarski R. van de Poll M.L. van Vugt M.J. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Waterman H. Sela M. van Zoelen E.J. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3385-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To study the enhanced receptor recycling induced by TGFα and EGF/TGFα chimeric superagonist ligands we hypothesized that Cbl proteins are inefficiently “coupled” to these growth factors. In the present study the functional coupling of Cbl adapter proteins to EGF, TGFα and superagonist ligand E4T was investigated. The degradation process of the EGFR was further analyzed by studying the differential effects of lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors on the degradation of the EGFR. We have found that the lysosomal degradation of the EGFR is preceded by its de-ubiquitination. Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with human EGFR (HER-14) (32Honegger A. Dull T.J. Bellot F. van Obberghen E. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were used throughout this study. Cells were cultured on flasks coated with 0.1% gelatin and grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Cells were trypsinized when confluent and seeded in flasks for regular maintenance. Antibodies and Materials—anti-c-Cbl (clone R2) was a generous gift from W. Langdon. Anti-c-Cbl (clone C15), anti-Cbl-b (clone H121), and anti-EGFR antibodies (mAb 528 and polyclonal antibody 1005) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-EGFR mAb LA22 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-ubiquitin antibody from Sigma (pr. no. U5379). Anti-EGFR (clone13), as well as goat anti-rabbit (GARPO) and goat anti-mouse (GAMPO) antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Anti-EGFR antibody Ab12 was obtained from Neomarkers. Recombinant growth factors were produced and quantified as previously described (30Lenferink A.E. Kramer R.H. van Vugt M.J. Konigswieser M. Di Fiore P.P. van Zoelen E.J. van de Poll M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sepharose beads coupled to protein A were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Bafilomycin A1 and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Stimulation and Pretreatment with Inhibitors—Near confluent HER-14 cells were first washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h. Growth factors were then resuspended in DMEM containing 50 mm BES (N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), pH 6.8. Then, growth factors were added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Lactacystin and bafilomycin A1 were dissolved in Me2SO and further diluted in serum-free DMEM (final concentration of lactacystin is 10 μm and bafilomycin is 0.25 μm) and added to cells one hour prior to stimulation. Cell Lysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and adherent cells were lysed during a 20-min incubation at 4 °C in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Brij97, 5 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysis buffer did not contain inhibitors of de-ubiquitinating enzymes. Cell lysates were subsequently transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 1.104 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge to remove nuclei and cell debris. Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis by adding Laemmli sample buffer to cleared whole cell lysates and then heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to loading SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Immunoprecipitation, Recapture, and Immunoblotting—Anti-c-Cbl clone C15 or anti-c-Cbl R2 antiserum were used to immunoprecipitate c-Cbl protein. Anti-EGFR clone 528 was used throughout this study to immunoprecipitate EGFR. Antibodies used in the immunoprecipitation were first coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads for 30–60 min at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysates were then added to the antibody-absorbed beads and incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound cellular proteins were then removed by washing 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Immunocomplexes were then resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and kept at –20 °C or loaded directly onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunocomplexes separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Blots were first blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, except for ubiquitin blots, which were blocked with 5% milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline-Tween). After incubation with primary antibody, filters were washed in TBST, incubated with appropriate HRP-linked secondary antibodies, and washed again with TBST prior to visualization of proteins with enhanced chemiluminescence. For recapture experiments, primary anti-EGFR (clone 528) precipitates were split in two equal parts during the phosphate-buffered saline wash, of which one part was processed as detailed above. 50 μl of 1% SDS was added to the other part of the primary immunoprecipitate and subsequently incubated for 5 min at 95 °C to denature all proteins in the immunoprecipitate. After boiling, samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and 950 μl of lysis buffer was added to dilute the SDS, after which samples were centrifuged briefly. The resulting supernatants were transferred to beads coated with 2 μg of anti-EGFR recapture antibodies (LA22 or clone13) for 16 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above. Image analysis was performed using the NIH-Image software program available from rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image. Briefly, signals of interest were overlaid by a defined rectangle and the mean pixel value (MPV) of these boxed areas was calculated. In addition, the background MPV values was determined in areas not containing any specific signal. The background MPV value was then subtracted from experimental (including experimental control) MPV values. The resulting values were then normalized relative to the appropriate and similarly calculated control bands, or they were expressed as a percentage of time 0, and plotted as shown in the figures. All experiments shown are representative of at least two, and mostly three or more independent experiments (data not shown). Inefficient EGFR Ubiquitination following Superagonist Stimulation—Although EGF, TGFα, and the superagonist E4T induce similar initial EGFR kinase activation and EGFR internalization, TGFα and E4T differ markedly from EGF in their mitogenic potency (29Lenferink A.E.

However, the kinetics of EGFR activation in response to these growth factors has not been studied in detail. To investigate this issue, HER-14 cells were serum-starved and treated with saturating concentrations of EGF, TGFα, or E4T for various periods of time followed by evaluation of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the EGFR. As seen in Fig. 1A (and data not shown), the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 180-kDa species of the EGFR is comparable for all growth factors, consistent with the use of saturating ligand concentrations which lead to similar cell surface receptor occupancy levels. In addition, Fig. 1, A and B show that in response to EGF stimulation the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoreacted with high molecular weight species of the EGFR, represented by the smear above the 180-kDa band. The high molecular weight smear is markedly decreased in TGFα- and E4T-treated cells compared with EGF. This decrease is already visible after 5 min of EGFR activation (see Fig. 1B) and becomes more prominent after 15 min of receptor stimulation. It is well established that ligand-dependent EGFR activation induces receptor polyubiquitination (12Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), which leads to a variable increase in the molecular weight of the EGFR according to the number of ubiquitin molecules that are covalently attached to the receptor. This influences the electrophoretic mobility of ubiquitinated EGFR on a SDS-PAGE gel and as a result ubiquitinated EGFRs appear as a smear above the 180-kDa positions that corresponds with the non-ubiquitinated EGFR. To determine whether the phosphorylated high molecular weight smear corresponds with polyubiquitinated species of the EGFR, HER-14 cells were stimulated with EGF, TGFα, and E4T for the indicated period of time. The EGFR was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotting was performed with antiubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C and quantitatively evaluated in Fig. 1D all growth factors induced receptor ubiquitination. However, there is a marked difference in the kinetics of EGFR ubiquitination. EGF induced peak EGFR ubiquitination at 15-min post-receptor activation, whereas TGFα and E4T induced peak receptor ubiquitination at 5 min, when a large fraction of stimulated EGFRs is already internalized, as previously demonstrated (30Lenferink A.E. Kramer R.H. van Vugt M.J. Konigswieser M. Di Fiore P.P. van Zoelen E.J. van de Poll M.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, and in contrast to the prolonged presence of the tyrosine phosphorylated 180-kDa EGFR species (Fig. 1A), the ubiquitinated EGFR rapidly declined upon prolonged stimulation. As it is formally possible that the ubiquitinated proteins observed in anti-EGFR (528) immunoprecipitates are derived from proteins that coprecipitate with the EGFR, we further denatured primary anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates by boiling in 1% SDS. Denatured proteins that were released into the supernatant were then used for recapture experiments with anti-EGFR (LA22 and clone 13) antibodies that recognize EGFR proteins under denaturing conditions (e.g. during immunoblotting). The anti-EGFR mAb 528 cannot be used for recapture experiments (data not shown) as it recognizes a conformational epitope in the extracellular domain of the EGFR that is destroyed upon denaturation. As illustrated in Fig. 1E, after stimulation of HER-14 cells with EGF, ubiquitinated species were still observed in anti-EGFR recapture experiments of denatured primary anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates, demonstrating that the >180 kDa ubiquitinated proteins indeed represent ubiquitinated EGFRs, consistent with earlier studies (11Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that the decreased ubiquitin signal observed in the secondary recapture (LA22 or c13) immunoprecipitates relative to the primary anti-EGFR (528) immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1E, upper panel) correlates with a decreased 180-kDa EGFR signal (Fig. 1E, lower panel), indicating that recapture of the EGFR is not quantitative. As excess amounts of antibody were used during the recapture (data not shown), we suggest that inefficient recapture of the denatured EGFR is due to poor recognition of the denatured EGFR by these antibodies. It is also noteworthy that, although Eps15 and Cbl can associate with the EGFR, the ubiquitinated species of these proteins run well below the 180-kDa mark, indicating that it is highly unlikely that ubiquitinated forms of these proteins contribute significantly to the observed ubiquitin signal in EGFR precipitates. The data presented in Fig. 1 suggest that although EGF, TGFα, and E4T do not"

We analyzed the evolution of nonaxisymmetric magnetic flux at the core surface over the past 400 years. We found that the most robust feature is westward motion at 17 kilometers per year, in a belt concentrated around the equator beneath the Atlantic hemisphere. Surprisingly, this motion is dominated by a single wavenumber and persists throughout the observation period. This phenomenon could be produced by an equatorial jet of core fluid, by hydromagnetic wave propagation, or by a combination of both. Discrimination between these mechanisms would provide useful constraints on the dynamics of Earth's core."
https://openalex.org/W1761520044,"Global sea levels have been rising over the past century. It remains hotly debated, however, how fast this rise has been and which of the two causes--expansion of ocean waters due to warming, or freshwater input from the continents-has dominated. In his Perspective, [Munk][1] argues that a recent survey of global ocean salinity may point to a dominant contribution from freshwater input. He cautions, however, that uncertainties in sea ice melting rates and possible biases in tide gage data do not yet allow a definitive answer. Even with global satellite coverage, several decades of data will be required for good estimates of the role of global warming in sea level rise.

Although heterozygous Titf1 PM/+ mice were unaffected, homozygous Titf1 PM/PM mice died immediately following birth. In contrast to Titf1 null mutant mice, which lack peripheral lung tissues, bronchiolar and peripheral acinar components of the lung were present in the Titf1 PM/PM mice.

Lung formation begins with the outpouching of endodermal tissues from the laryngeal-tracheal-esophageal groove at embryonic day (E) 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day; VEGF, vascular endothelial cell growth factor; αSMA, α-smooth muscle actin; CCSP, Clara cell secretory protein; PECAM, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule; EST, expressed sequence tag; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; SP, surfactant protein. 9–9.5 in the mouse embryo. Epithelial lined tubules invade the splanchnic mesenchyme and undergo branching morphogenesis to form bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar regions of the adult lung. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (genomic designation Titf1; also termed TEBP, or Nkx2.1) is a phosphorylated, homeodomain-containing, nuclear transcription factor expressed in respiratory epithelial cells of the developing lung, thyroid, and central nervous system (1Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. DiLauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the trachea and main stem bronchi were formed in Titf1 null mutant mice, peripheral components of the lung, including bronchioles, acinar ducts, and respiratory saccules were lacking in these mice, causing death at the time of birth (2Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of surfactant proteins was lacking in the Titf1 null mice (3Tichelaar J.W. Wert S.E. Costa R.H. Kimura S. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem.

TTF-1 is critical for formation of the lung and thyroid, regulating distinct subsets of genes expressed in both organs (2Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M.

TTF-1 binds to regulatory elements located in the promoters of a number of transcriptional targets in the lung (e.g. secretoglobin 1A, and the surfactant proteins Sftpa, Sftpb, and Sftpc) (5Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In thyroid and pulmonary epithelial cells, TTF-1 is phosphorylated at serine and/or threonine residues (7Francis-Lang H. Zannini M. de Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

Although the protein kinases and sites of phosphorylation mediating the interactions of TTF-1 with its various protein partners or DNA at cis-acting sites are not known with certainty, activation of protein kinase A enhanced transcriptional activation of Sftpb (8Yan C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, direct effects of phosphorylation of TTF-1 on activity or DNA binding to thyroid-specific transcriptional target genes were not found in FRTL5 or HeLa cells in vitro (7Francis-Lang H.

Hypophosphorylation of TTF-1 was observed in transformed thyroid cells in which TTF-1 target genes were not expressed; however, TTF-1 phosphorylation did not alter its binding to the thyroglobulin promoter (11Velasco J.A. Acebrón A. Zannini M. Martín-Pérez J. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2796-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulated phosphorylation of TTF-1 in several cell types; however, the effects of cAMP-dependent protein kinase on TTF-1-dependent transcription were not directly mediated by its phosphorylation (12Feliciello A. Allevato G. Musti A.M. De Brasi D. Gallo A. Avvedimento V.E. Gottesman M.E. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 649-654PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, TTF-1 is highly phosphorylated in many cell types, but the role of phosphorylation on transcriptional activation of target genes or on cell differentiation in target tissues remains unclear. TTF-1 interacts directly or indirectly with other transcription factors and co-factors, including Foxa2, NF-1, GATA-6, AP-1, retinoic acid receptors, and associated co-factors, at or near TTF-1 binding, cis-acting elements located in regulatory regions of its target genes (5Bohinski R.J.

Furthermore, TTF-1 expression is spatially regulated during lung morphogenesis, being more highly expressed in peripheral regions of the growing lung buds with advancing development (1Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. DiLauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the postnatal lung, TTF-1 is most abundant in type II epithelial cells in the alveolus, where it regulates surfactant protein synthesis. Thus, the activity of TTF-1 may be regulated by stochastic mechanisms, by interactions of TTF-1 with various protein partners, and by phosphorylation, oxidation-reduction, and cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking (7Francis-Lang H.

Because TTF-1 phosphorylation mutants retained transcriptional activities in vitro, the ability of TTF-1PM to replace TTF-1 during lung morphogenesis was assessed in vivo. TTF-1PM substantially, but not completely, corrected the defects in lung morphogenesis characteristic of Titf1 null mice. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes for which expression was influenced by the Titf1 PM/PM gene. Generation of Titf1PM/PM Mice—Mouse Titf1 gene was isolated from a strain 129/SV mouse genomic library (Stratagene) using a probe corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of rat Titf1 (Fig. 1). To prepare the targeting vector, a fragment extending from bp 4656 to bp 10443 of the reported mouse genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession no. U19755), containing the entire coding sequence for Titf1, was cloned in pBlueScript. A fragment, spanning from the translation start site of Titf1 (bp 7957) to the end of homeobox (bp 9480) was removed and replaced by the sequence encoding S80, a phosphorylation mutant allele of rat Titf1 in which seven serine phosphorylation sites were replaced by alanine codons as described (10Zannini M.

The SV40 poly(A) sequence was inserted downstream of the S80 stop codon. The construct includes HSV-tk and PGK-neo cassette for selection of transfected ES cells. The target construct was introduced by electroporation in MPI1-ES cells and selected as described (20Mansouri A. Voss A.K. Thomas T. Yokaota Y. Gruss P. Development. 2000; 127: 2251-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from neomycin resistance clone was digested with BamHI and analyzed by Southern blotting using as a 500-bp probe from nucleotide 10512 to nucleotide 11042 of the 3′-untranslated region of the mouse Titf1 gene (GenBank™ accession no. U19755). Chimeric mice were generated by aggregation of ES cells to CD1. Chimeras were mated to CD1 mice. Animals—The colony of Titf1 PM/+ mice was maintained by crossing heterozygous mice with CD1 wild type animals. Embryonic day was estimated considering noon of the day of a vaginal plug as E0.5. Fetuses were collected at E18.5 by Cesarean section. Genotyping—To genotype Titf1 PM/PM mice, DNA was obtained from a piece of tail from the mouse fetuses. The tissue was incubated overnight at 60 °C with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K), and genomic DNA was extracted by adding 0.3 volumes of 6 m NaCl and then precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. The genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and analyzed by Southern blotting. Lung Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and in Situ Hybridization— Lungs were obtained from fetuses at E18 and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Lung tissue was processed according to standard methods and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of lung tissue were cut at 5 μm for histochemical analysis. Staining for the surfactant proteins SP-B and proSP-C, TTF-1, the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), PECAM (CD31), and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) was performed as described previously (17Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization for SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and VEGF-A mRNAs were performed using 35S-labeled riboprobes as previously described (21Wert S.E. Dey C.R. Blair P.A. Kimura S. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Slides were coated in NTB-2, emulsion exposed for 2–5 days, and developed with Kodak D19. RNase Protection and Western Blot Analysis—RNase protection assays for SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and CCSP mRNAs were performed on lung RNA using 32P-end labeled DNA probes as previously described (22Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.I. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar); L32 mRNA was used to normalize loading. Blots were scanned and differences compared by Student's t test. Proteins from lung homogenates from wild type and Titf1 PM/PM mice (E18) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted using antisera against proSP-B, SP-B, proSP-C, (Chemicon AB3430, AB3436, and AB3428, respectively), and napsin (kidney-derived aspartyl proteinase). To generate napsin antibody, the mouse napsin A cDNA was amplified from type II epithelial cell cDNA, sequenced, and the region encoding pronapsin cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-21 (Novagen). Recombinant napsin protein was purified from bacterial lysates by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and injected into rabbits. The napsin antibody detected a single protein band (M r of 38,000) in immunoblots of mouse kidney. RNA Microarray and Promoter Analysis—Total RNA from lungs at E18 Titf1 PM/PM and wild type littermates was subjected to reverse transcription using oligo(dT) with T7 promoter sequences attached, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis. Antisense cRNA was amplified and biotinylated using T7 RNA polymerase, prior to hybridization to the version 2 of murine genome U74 set, which consists of three GeneChips and ∼36,000 full-length mouse genes/ESTs (Affymetrix Inc.), using the Affymetrix recommended protocol (23Cho R.J. Huang M. Campbell M.J. Dong H. Steinmetz L. Sapinoso L. Hampton G. Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 24Notterman D.A. Alon U. Sierk A.J. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3124-3130PubMed Google Scholar). Affymetrix MicroArray Suite version 5.0 was used to scan and quantitate the GeneChips using default scan settings. Intensity data was collected from each chip and scaled to a target intensity of 1500. The results were analyzed using GeneSpring 5.0 (Silicon Genetics, Inc.), JMP4 (SAS Institute, Inc.), and Spotfire 7.12 (Spotfire, Inc.) software. A total of 18 chips were used in this experiment. Hybridization data (∼216,000 data points) were sequentially subjected to normalization, transformation, filtering, clustering, and function classification as previously described (25Xu Y. Clark J.C. Aronow B.J. Dey C.R. Liu C. Wooldridge J.L. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7674-7682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Data were normalized to enable the direct comparisons across chips and across genes. Statistical differences between Titf1 PM/PM and control littermates were identified by distribution analysis and Welch's t test at p value ≤ 0.05. Variations related to processing and biological replicates were calculated and separated from the candidate genes to identify primary genotype response. Fold changes were calculated for each gene against its specific control to determine relative gene expression. Additional filters included minimal absolute intensity ≥ 30, a minimum of 4 detectable judgments for A-set (12 chips) and 2 detectable judgments for B and C-sets (6 chips), and coefficient of variation among replicates ≤ 50%. Genes with average fold changes ≥ 2 and genes that were cross-validated via different probes on the same chip, or the same gene on different chips (A, B, and C sets), were prioritized. Differentially expressed genes were classified into functional categories based on gene ontology definitions. To determine representation of functional categories in the selected gene list, the binomial probability was calculated for each category using corresponding U74Av2 genome as the reference dataset. Hierarchal clustering was applied to visualize and further group the selected genes based on their expression similarity. Pearson correlation was used for similarity measure. Clusters were constructed by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. Mouse and human promoter sequences were downloaded from the Harvard-Lipper Center for Computational Genetics (www.arep.med.harvard.edu). Upstream sequences (1 kb) of selected genes were retrieved from above promoter sequence data base and searched for potential TTF-1 regulatory sites. A 15-bp sequence NNWCTCAAGTRYWNN from the Genomatix matrix library was used as the TTF-1 consensus binding site with the core similarity (CAAG) setting as 1 and maximal of 2 mismatches (Genomatix, Inc.). Heterozygous Titf1 PM/+ mice have been maintained in the vivarium for more than 1 year without apparent abnormalities in activity or reproduction. Although Titf1 PM/PM fetuses were present at E18 in numbers consistent with that expected by Mendelian inheritance, Titf1 PM/PM pups were never observed postnatally (Table I). At E18–18.5, homozygous Titf1 PM/PM mice were alive at birth, but died rapidly of respiratory failure. At E18, lung mass was visibly reduced. Total RNA and protein content was decreased, indicating pulmonary hypoplasia. The trachea and bronchi were intact and without the tracheo-esophageal fistulae characteristic of Titf1 null mice. In contrast to the lack of peripheral lung tissue characteristic of Titf1 null mice, bronchiolar and acinar regions of the lung were formed in Titf1 PM/PM mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Staining for TTF-1 was readily detected in the nuclei of respiratory epithelial cells. The intensity and distribution of staining was similar in Titf1 PM/PM and Titf1 +/+ controls (Fig. 2, C–F). Epithelial cell types characteristic of the conducting and peripheral airways were observed in proper proximal-distal gradients along the airway, although squamous cell differentiation was lacking in the lung periphery, perhaps indicating arrested terminal differentiation of type II cells. Abnormally dilated peripheral lung tubules were observed, however, in all of the mutant mice, indicating defects in formation of the lung parenchyma. Lobulation was normal as evidenced by four right lobes and one left lobe, supporting the concept that the TTF-1PM is sufficient to direct early lung morphogenesis. Deficits in vasculogenesis were indicated by decreased PECAM staining surrounding dilated peripheral lung tubules, in Titf1 PM/PM mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Extensive staining for αSMA was observed surrounding the abnormally dilated peripheral tubules (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating failure of peripheral mesenchymal differentiation. Staining for CCSP was decreased in the conducting airways of the mutant mice (Fig. 3, E and F).Table IGenotype of the progeny obtained from Titf1PM/PM × Titf1PM/PM matesAge of the miceNWild typeTitf PM/+Titf1 PM/PMPups (1-2 weeks)5816420Embryos (E10-E16)78233619Fetuses E18.5 (Cesarean section)286148aAll these pups died within 30 min after delivery by hysterotomy.a All these pups died within 30 min after delivery by hysterotomy.

In the wild type mice (A), PECAM immunostaining was detected in large vessels (v) and in the extensive capillary network located in the alveolar septa (arrowheads). In the Titf1 PM/PM mice (B), relatively few PECAM-positive capillaries (arrowheads) were detected in the mesenchyme surrounding dilated, bronchiolar-like, peripheral tubules (*), often found at the tips of the lung lobes. In the wild type control (C), αSMA-positive cells (arrows) were found adjacent to the basal side of the bronchiolar epithelium (br), in the wall of small veins (v), and in scattered, individual myofibroblasts located in the alveolar septa (arrowheads). In mutant mice (D), αSMA-positive cells (arrowheads) completely surrounded each of the dilated, bronchiolar-like, peripheral tubules (*). In controls, CCSP-staining cells were detected in abundance throughout the conducting airways (arrowheads) (E). In the mutant mice, the staining intensity and the number of CCSP-positive cells (arrowheads) were reduced in the conducting airways (F). The number of VEGF mRNA-positive cells detected by in situ hybridization was reduced in the Titf1 PM/PM mice (G and H), especially in dilated acinar tubules located at the periphery of the lung (arrowheads).

The reduction in both CCSP and VEGF-A mRNA expression appeared to be a result of decreased expression per cell and decreased numbers of cells expressing these RNAs. Changes in Expression of TTF-1-regulated Genes—Because TTF-1 is known to be required for the expression of a number of proteins selectively expressed in the respiratory epithelium, immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization was performed for SP-A, SP-B, proSP-C, and CCSP (Fig. 4). Immunostaining for proSP-C and SP-B, markers selective for acinar and type II epithelial cells of the peripheral lung, was detected in Titf1 PM/PM mice (data not shown). The proximal-distal distribution and intensity of surfactant protein staining for SP-B and proSP-C was similar to that in control littermates, although SP-B staining was generally extracellular in wild type and intracellular in mutant mice. Expression of SP-A mRNA was absent in the conducting airways and dramatically decreased in the peripheral airways of the mutant mice, whereas SP-C and SP-B mRNAs were relatively preserved (Fig. 4, E–H). Nuclease protection assays were utilized to quantify the effect of the Titf1 PM/PM on surfactant proteins and CCSP mRNAs (Fig. 5). Abundance of CCSP and SP-A were decreased ∼5–8-fold, whereas that for SP-B was decreased ∼50%. Although undetectable in Titf1 null mutant mice (data not shown), expression of surfactant proteins and CCSP was present in the Titf1 PM/PM mice. Thus, the decrease in expression of these target proteins was variable, and numbers of cells and levels of SP-A and CCSP were most decreased; in contrast, levels of expression of SP-B and SP-C were maintained in some cells, but the proportion of cells expressing these RNAs was altered in the mutant mice.Fig. 5S1 nuclease protection assay for SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and CCSP mRNA. Total lung RNA was isolated from control and Titf1 PM/PM littermates and subjected to S1 nuclease protection assay (A, 3 μg/lane). Gels were quantified by phosphorimaging and SP gene expression was normalized to corresponding control L32 mRNA. The mean values for wild type mice were set to 1 of each SP, and relative expression was plotted (B) as mean ± S.D. (n = 3); *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Decreased Surfactant Protein and Processing—Decreased but variable expression of known TTF-1 target genes suggested that the Titf1 PM/PM may function, at least in part, as a hypomorphic allele. Reduction of SP-B to less than 50% of normal levels causes lung dysfunction in mice (26Clark J.C. Weaver T.E. Iwamoto H.S. Ikegami M. Jobe A.H. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar); therefore, reduction in SP-B expression may contribute to lack of postnatal survival of Titf1 PM/PM mice. Because processing of proSP-B and proSP-C is known to be cell-specific and proteolytically processed SP-B peptide is required for surfactant function, processing of proSP-B was assessed in lung homogenates from Titf1 PM/PM mice. The active SP-B peptide (18-kDa dimer) was markedly decreased in lung homogenates from the mutant mice, whereas abundance of the 42-kDa proSP-B precursor was increased, indicating that proteolytic processing of SP-B was deficient (Fig. 6). RNA microarray data indicated a 21-fold decrease in expression of napsin (Kdap) (see below). Napsin, a type II epithelial cell-selective aspartyl protease, was decreased in lung homogenates of the Titf1 PM/PM mice (Fig. 6). Together with the previous report that an aspartyl protease is required for maturation of proSP-B, these findings support the likelihood that napsin plays a role in the processing of SP-B. Deficient processing of SP-B may contribute to the respiratory failure in the Titf1 PM/PM mice, although the observed alterations in lung morphogenesis likely contribute to respiratory failure after birth. Identification of Genes Influenced by the TTF-1 Phosphorylation Mutation—To identify genes responsive to Titf1 PM/PM, lung RNAs from Titf1 PM/PM mice (E18) and their wild type control littermates were compared using the Affymetrix murine genome U74Av2, which contains three GeneChips and ∼36,000 full-length mouse genes/ESTs. Data from 18 chips were normalized, and statistical differences between Titf1 PM/PM and control mice were identified with p values ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2. Using these criteria, 98 known genes were identified from the A chip (Tables II and III). Forty-nine mRNAs were increased and 49 were decreased in the lungs from Titf1 PM/PM pups. There were 97 ESTs in B and C chip that also met these criteria. Annotations for those ESTs were collected through a combination of homology searches against known mouse genes and retrieved ortholog information from rat and human genomes (NetAffx). Forty-seven genes with known annotations are listed in Table IV. Hierarchical clustering of these differentially regulated genes is shown in Fig. 7. Data are shown in two-dimensional matrix, and remarkably ordered gene expression profiles were displayed on genes selected from A chip (Fig. 7A) and B and C chips (Fig. 7B). At the chip level (top dendrogram), RNAs influenced by Titf1 PM/PM formed two distinct groups. Within the mutant group, samples collected from the same littermates were more closely related than those from different litters, whereas no differences among litters were observed in wild type controls. At the RNA level (see the dendrogram at the left of Fig. 7), genes were clearly separated into those mRNAs increased or decreased corresponding to the Titf1 genotypes.Table IIGenes up-regulated in TTF-1 phosphorylation mutant miceSymbolDescriptionCategoryChangep valueGenBank™-foldCdrapCartilage-der"

We report on WD absorption measurements by means of atmospheric long-path (18.34 kilometers) differential optical absorption spectroscopy of the near-infrared OH stretching mode 0>f 4>b overtone transition predicted to be located near 746 nanometers. Our observation is in reasonable agreement with the known thermochemistry, calculated and measured structure, and spectroscopy (band strength, shape, and width) of the WD. The observation implies that the WD 0>f 4>b band is located at 749.5 nanometers, with a full width at half maximum of approximately 19.4 wave numbers, and that its band strength ranges between 1.23 x 10(-22) and 5.25 x 10(-22) centimeters per molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2073337830,"In the mammalian CNS, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors serve prominent roles in many physiological and pathophysiological processes including pain transmission. For full activation, NMDA receptors require the binding of glycine. It is not known whether the brain uses changes in extracellular glycine to modulate synaptic NMDA responses. Here, we show that synaptically released glycine facilitates NMDA receptor currents in the superficial dorsal horn, an area critically involved in pain processing. During high presynaptic activity, glycine released from inhibitory interneurons escapes the synaptic cleft and reaches nearby NMDA receptors by so-called spillover. In vivo, this process may contribute to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia."

The genetic differences between these species which govern the pathology or site of infection are not known. We have therefore carried out detailed analysis of the A2 loci in L. major and L. donovani because A2 is expressed in L. donovani but not L. major, and A2 is required for survival in visceral organs by L. donovani. We demonstrate that although L. major contains A2 gene regulatory sequences, the multiple repeats that exist in L. donovani A2 protein coding regions are absent in L. major, and the remaining corresponding A2 sequences appear to represent non-expressed pseudogenes. It was possible to restore amastigote-specific A2 expression to L. major, confirming that A2 regulatory sequences remain functional in L. major. Although L. major is a cutaneous parasite in rodents and humans, restoring A2 expression to L. major inhibited its ability to establish a cutaneous infection in susceptible BALB/c or resistant C57BL6 mice, a phenotype typical of L. donovani. There was no detectable cellular immune response against L. major after cutaneous infection with A2-expressing L. major, suggesting that the lack of growth was not attributable to acquired host resistance but to an A2-mediated suppression of parasite survival in skin macrophages. These observations argue that the lack of A2 expression in L. major contributed to its divergence from L. donovani with respect to the pathology of infection.

Leishmania protozoa are the causative agents of human leishmaniasis, which is a serious infectious disease throughout the developing world (1Herwaldt B. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Leishmaniasis includes a wide range of pathologies ranging from severe lethal visceral infections to self-healing cutaneous lesions, and the specific pathologies are closely related to the species of Leishmania (2Berman J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). For example, L. donovani causes visceral leishmaniasis, known as Kala Azar in India and the Sudan, which is fatal if not successfully treated and is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, substantial weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver, and anemia (1Herwaldt B. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 2Berman J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In comparison, L. major infections, common throughout the Middle East, result in cutaneous lesions that usually heal spontaneously (1Herwaldt B. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 2Berman J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The molecular differences between the different species of Leishmania that govern the outcome of infection and pathogenesis in the human host are unknown.Leishmania protozoa are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected sandfly. In the sandfly vector, Leishmania exists as flagellated promastigotes, and once they enter the mammalian host after a blood meal, they differentiate into the non-flagellated amastigotes, where they multiply exclusively in the phagolysosomal compartment of macrophages (3Matlashewski G. Farrell J. Leishmania, World Class Parasites series. 4. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, the Netherlands2002: 105-113Google Scholar, 4Alexander J. Russell D.G. Adv. Parasitol. 1992; 31: 175-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Differentiation from promastigotes to amastigotes is a critical step for the establishment of infection in macrophages, and therefore genes that are specifically expressed in the amastigote stage are likely to be essential for survival in the mammalian host.The A2 gene family was first identified in L. donovani by virtue of its expression, which is specific to the amastigote stage of the life cycle (5Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and it has been established that the A2 protein is among the few widely accepted amastigote-specific molecular markers identified to date (reviewed in Ref. 6Gupta N Goyal N. Rastogi A. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The A2 protein represents a virulence factor because L. donovani amastigotes deficient in A2 protein through the use of antisense RNA (7Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or gene knock-outs (8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) are attenuated with respect to survival in visceral organs of infected mice. Moreover, intravenous injection of L. major genetically engineered to express A2 produced higher infection levels in the spleen than control L. major, further supporting the argument that A2 enhances survival in resident macrophages of visceral organs (8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Multiple copies of the A2 gene are clustered on the 850-kb chromosome of L. donovani, which encode a family of A2 proteins, each containing a secretory leader sequence followed by a 10-amino acid sequence that is repeated from 40 to >90 times, depending on the individual A2 gene (5Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with the A2 gene family structure and expression, a family of A2 proteins ranging from 42 to 100 kDa is specifically expressed in amastigotes but not in promastigotes (7Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Anti-A2 antibodies have been detected in >90% of the sera samples from visceral leishmaniasis patients, confirming that the A2 proteins are expressed in the human host (11Ghedin E. Zhang W.W. Charest H. Sundar S. Kenney R.T. Matlashewski G. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 530-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary karyotype analysis by Southern blotting revealed that L. donovani A2 protein coding sequences are not present in the genome of all Leishmania species and, notably, appeared to be absent in L. major and L. tropica (11Ghedin E. Zhang W.W. Charest H. Sundar S. Kenney R.T. Matlashewski G. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 530-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Few Leishmania species-specific genes have been identified, and it was therefore possible in the present study to define the genetic basis for the difference in A2 gene structure between L. donovani and L. major. Interestingly, L. major does contain A2 genes, but they are not expressed and lack the multiple repeats in the protein coding regions and therefore represent nonexpressed pseudogenes. Because L. major causes cutaneous infections, it was therefore possible to examine the phenotype associated with restored A2 expression on cutaneous infection and the host cellular immune response to A2-expressing L. major. The results of this study suggest that the inability of L. major to express A2 has contributed to its tropism for cutaneous infections.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 (B/6) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories or from the Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). All mice were maintained in the animal care facility under pathogen-free conditions.Leishmania Cells and Culture Conditions—For cutaneous infection in BALB/c mice and Northern blot analysis, L. major Friedlin V9 strain and L. donovani 1S/Cl2D strains were used. L. major and L. donovani promastigotes were routinely cultured at 27 °C in M199 medium (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The L. donovani 1S/Cl2D strain can replicate continuously as axenic amastigotes in vitro (12Doyle P. Engel J. Pimenta P. Pinto Da Silva P. Dwyer D. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). L. donovani differentiation into amastigotes was performed by shifting the promastigotes to amastigote culture conditions overnight (37 °C in RPMI 1640, pH 5.5), which mimics the host macrophage phagolysosome compartment as described previously (12Doyle P. Engel J. Pimenta P. Pinto Da Silva P. Dwyer D. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Likewise, L. major promastigote cultures were resuspended in the amastigote culture conditions overnight, and this resulted in viable amastigote-like cells, which were unable to proliferate.Plasmid Construction and Transfections—All plasmid constructs used in this study have been described previously (7Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The procedure for transfection was as described (13Zhang W.W. Charest H. Matlashewski G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4073-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transfected L. major promastigotes were selected and maintained in medium containing 50 μg/ml of G418. The pooled transfectants were used for all subsequent studies (Northern blot, Western blot, and mice infection experiments).Southern, Northern, and Western Blot Analysis—Southern, Northern, and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (7Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The DNA probes were as follows: A2, 769-bp XbaI and EcoRI fragment from L. donovani A2 3′ untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; ORF, open reading frame; neo, neomycin phosphotransferase.

Matlashewski G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); the 5′ A2rel-specific probe, 946-bp XhoI fragment from L. donovani 5′ A2rel gene (8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); and the 3′ A2rel-specific probe, 1274-bp XhoI and EcoRV fragment from L. donovani 3′ A2rel gene (8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For A2 protein analysis, the anti-A2 monoclonal antibody C9 was used as described previously (7Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Infection in Mice—For cutaneous infection, female BALB/c mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) weighing 18–20 g were infected subcutaneously with 5 × 106 stationary-phase promastigotes in their hind footpads. Disease progression was monitored by weekly caliper measurement of footpad swelling. Some infected footpads were removed and homogenized. The recovered amastigotes were cultured in promastigote culture medium, and the Leishmania parasite burdens were determined by limiting dilution. Some transformed promastigotes were then shifted to amastigote culture medium overnight and subjected to Western blot analysis.For cutaneous infection in C57BL/6 mice and migration experiments, L. major clone V1 (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin) promastigotes, L. donovani 1 S strain, A2, and control cosmid L. major transfectants were grown at 26 °C in medium 199 supplemented with 20% Hi-FCE (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 40 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm adenine (in 50 mm Hepes), 5 mg/ml of hemin (in 50% triethanolamine), and 1 mg/ml of 6-biotin (M199/S). Infective-stage promastigotes (metacyclics) were isolated from stationary cultures (4–5 days of age) by separation in Ficoll gradient enrichment (15Spath G.F. Berverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 99: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Mice were challenged in both ears using 1000 metacyclic promastigotes. Parasites were inoculated intradermally into the ear dermis using a 27–1/2 gauge needle in a volume of 10 μl. The evolution of the lesion was monitored by measuring the diameter of the induration of the ear lesion with a direct reading Vernier caliper (Thomas, Swedesboro, NJ).Parasite Quantitation—Parasite loads in the ears were determined as described previously (16Belkaid Y. Kamhawi S. Modi G. Valenzuela J. Nobentrauth N. Rowton E. Ribeiro J. Sacks D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1941-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ventral and dorsal sheets of the infected ears were separated, deposited dermal side down in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, liberase CI enzyme blend (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 50 μg/ml), and incubated for1hat37 °C.The sheets were cut into small pieces and homogenized using a Teflon-coated microtissue grinder in a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 μl of M199/S. The tissue homogenates were filtered using a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon Products, Inc., St. Louis, MO) and serially diluted in a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate containing biphasic medium, prepared using 50 μl of NNN medium containing 30% of defibrinated rabbit blood and overlaid with 50 μl of M199/S. The number of viable parasites in each ear was determined from the highest dilution at which promastigotes could be grown out after 7 days of incubation at 26 °C. The number of parasites was also determined in the local draining lymph nodes (retromaxilar). The lymph nodes were recovered and mechanically dissociated using a pellet pestle and then serially diluted as above.For cytokine measurement in culture supernatants, pooled cells from draining lymph nodes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin at 6 × 106 cells/ml, and 0.1 ml was plated in U-bottomed, 96-well plates. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with uninfected or L. major-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 production in 48-h culture supernatants were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Endogen).Macrophage and Dendritic Cell Infections—For the migration experiments, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and macrophages were obtained. Briefly, bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence of 20 ng/ml of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (to generate dendritic cells) or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 30% L929 conditioned medium (for macrophages). After 6 days, cells were collected, spun at 1500 rpm for 10 min, and seeded onto 6-well non-tissue culture-treated plates at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/well. Metacyclic promastigotes from the different strains were selected, and cells were infected at a ratio of 10 parasites:1 cell. Twenty-four h later, cells were detached from the wells using a syringe pestle, washed, and dyed with chloromethylbenzoylaminotetramethyl rhodamine, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Briefly, cells were resuspended in PBS and dyed for 15 min at room temperature with 5 μg/ml of the red fluorescent dye, washed three times with PBS/2% bovine serum albumin, cytospun, and stained with Diff Quick (Dade Behring, Dudinger, Switzerland) to determine the percentage of infection. In every case the percentage of infected cells was >80%, and it was comparable among the groups. Cells were resuspended at a final concentration of 107 infected macrophages/dendritic cells/ml.Adoptive Transfer of Infected Cells—C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg of ketamine (Wyeth Fort Dodge, Iowa) solution. Infected or uninfected cells were inoculated in the ear dermis in a volume of 10 μl, and 24 h later ears and draining lymph nodes from injected mice were collected. Ear dorsal and ventral sheets were separated with forceps and deposited dermal side down in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were allowed to migrate out of the ear for 16 h. The remaining ear tissue was incubated with Liberase Cl, cut in small pieces, and filtered through a 70-μm nylon cell strainer (Becton-Dickinson Mountain View, CA) before being washed twice in RPMI 1640, NaHCO3, penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.05% DNase (Sigma). Cells from draining lymph nodes were mechanically dissociated to single-cell suspensions, and the three cell compartments (cells migrating out of the ear dermis, ear tissue, and lymph node cells) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For the analysis of the presence of labeled cells, data were collected and analyzed using CELLQuest software and a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for the presence of positive cells on the FL-2 channel. The number of cells that spontaneously migrated out of the ear was determined as the number of labeled cells tracked in the media divided by the total number of cells tracked in every compartment (ears, medium, and draining nodes).RESULTSComparison of the A2 Gene Structure in L. donovani and L. major—Few genetic differences have been described between L. donovani and L. major, and therefore a comparison of the A2 gene loci provided an opportunity to perform a detailed comparison of a virulent gene family that differs between these Old World Leishmania species. Because A2rel genes neighbor the A2 genes and are conserved between L. donovani and L. major (11Ghedin E. Zhang W.W. Charest H. Sundar S. Kenney R.T. Matlashewski G. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 530-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an L. donovani A2rel DNA probe was used to identify A2rel DNA-containing L. major cosmids. Three nonoverlapping cosmids termed L5114, L4134, and L610 derived from chromosome 22 were isolated, and their orientation is shown in Fig. 1A. Cosmid L4134 was chosen for DNA sequencing. As also shown in Fig. 1A for comparison, the A2 gene family (white boxes) in L. donovani are clustered in tandem array alternating with the neighboring A2rel gene family (black boxes), and there is more than one cluster per chromosome as described previously for L. donovani (8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, in comparison with L. major, the sequence data revealed that the overall organization of the A2 (white boxes) and A2rel (black boxes) genes differed between L. donovani and L. major. It was, however, of interest that L. major did contain A2 gene sequences and that the flanking regions (shown as A2rel 5′ and A2rel 3′) of the A2-A2rel gene clusters were very well conserved between L. donovani and L. major (86% identity). Moreover, as with L. donovani, there is more than one cluster of A2 gene-containing sequence per chromosome in L. major. Nevertheless, there are many more copies of the A2 gene sequences (white boxes) in L. donovani than in L. major. The most remarkable difference was that nearly the entire A2 protein coding sequences in the open reading frame (ORF) were absent in the A2 genes in L. major. As a result, the 10-amino acid encoding repeat units of the ORF that are present in all of the L. donovani A2 genes were absent in L. major. Only one 10-amino acid unit remains in the L. major A2 genes preceded by the leader sequence (Fig. 1, B and C). As a result, the predicted corresponding L. major A2 protein would only be 53 amino acids, of which the first 32 N-terminal amino acids are a functional leader sequence. Remarkably, although most of the A2 protein coding sequence was absent in the A2 genes in L. major, the 5′ UTR and the 3′ UTR of the RNA non-coding region were >90% identical between L. donovani and L. major. This is unusual because protein coding sequences generally remain more conserved than the non-coding sequences, but the opposite is evident when comparing L. major and L. donovani A2 genes.Southern blot and PCR analysis of L. major genomic DNA and the other A2 cosmids derived from L. major confirmed that L. major has only the truncated version of the A2 genes shown in Fig. 1, B and C, and does not have the multiple copies of the alternating A2-A2rel genes as in L. donovani (data not shown). Taken together, these data revealed significant and unpredicted differences in the A2-A2rel gene clusters in L. major and L. donovani, where L. major has much fewer copies of the A2 genes, and more remarkably, the majority of the protein coding sequences within the remaining A2 genes are absent.Comparison of A2 Gene Expression in L. donovani and L. major—Northern blot analysis was performed to compare the expression of the A2 gene family in L. donovani and L. major using probes specific to the conserved 3′ UTR. As reported previously (5Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the A2 genes were abundantly expressed in L. donovani amastigotes and are expressed at much lower levels in promastigotes. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, it was not possible to detect any A2 gene transcripts in L. major by this overexposed Northern blot analysis using a conserved 3′ UTR probe, demonstrating these truncated L. major A2 genes are not transcribed or their transcripts are not stable. Taken together, the truncated A2 genes in L. major are not expressed, and this together with the data presented in Fig. 1 strongly suggests that the remaining truncated A2 genes in L major represent pseudogenes, one of the few such examples in Leishmania.Fig. 2Comparative Northern blot analysis of the transcripts derived from the A2 gene loci in L. donovani and L. major. Total RNA was isolated from L. donovani (L.d) or L. major (L.m) promastigotes (P) cultured at 27 °C, pH 7.4, or amastigote-like cells (A) cultured overnight at 37 °C, pH 5.5, and subjected to Northern blot analysis with a probe specific for the A2 3′ UTR sequence. The RNA gels were stained with ethidium bromide and transferred to the nylon membrane and photographed to confirm equal RNA loading before hybridization.

However, it was also evident that the A2 3′UTR regulatory sequence was conserved in L. donovani and L. major. It has been demonstrated previously that the 3′ UTR sequence was responsible for mediating amastigote-specific expression in L. donovani (9Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17081-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and that it was possible to express A2 in L. major (8Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It was therefore necessary to determine whether the A2 3′ UTR sequence retained the ability to mediate amastigote-specific expression in L. major.L. major promastigotes were transfected with the A2-expressing plasmid pKsneoA2, which contained a complete copy of the L. donovani A2 gene including the 5′ UTR, A2 protein coding region, and the regulatory 3′ UTR as shown in Fig. 3A. Promastigotes were also transfected with a control pKsneo plasmid with no A2 coding sequences. Western blot analysis was carried out to determine whether A2 expression could be induced under amastigote culture conditions in the transfected L. major culture. As shown in Fig. 3B, it was possible to induce A2 expression by shifting the culture to amastigote-like culture conditions overnight (pH 5.5, 37 °C). As described above, the sequence of L. major A2 3′ UTR has >90% identity to A2 3′ UTR in L. donovani, suggesting that the L. major A2 3′ UTR and associated regulatory factors remained functional in L. major with respect to mediating amastigote-specific expression.Fig. 3Conserved A2 3′ UTR function in L. major with respect to mediating amastigote-specific expression. A, schematic representations of the relevant regions of the A2 expression construct (pKsneoA2) and the control plasmid (pKsneo).

Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it was necessary to study other relevant phenotypes of A2-expressing L. major. It was determined whether A2 expression altered the growth properties of L. major in axenic culture or in in vitro cultured macrophages. As shown in Fig. 3C, L. major transfected with the pKsneoA2 plasmids grew equally well as the control transfected L. major under axenic culture conditions. Likewise, A2-expressing and the control L. major infected and replicated equally in bone marrow-derived macrophages after infection with metacyclic parasite cultures (Fig. 3, D and E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that it was possible to reconstitute amastigote-specific gene expression of A2 in L. major, and this did not alter the ability to replicate in axenic culture or replicate in in vitro cultured macrophages.Subcutaneous Infection of A2-expressing L. major in Genetically Susceptible BALB/c Mice—L. major infections cause cutaneous pathology, and the preceding gene structure and experimental data revealed that L. major lacks the ability to express the A2 gene.

Maintenance of genomic information relies on a variety of processes resulting in faithful DNA repair and replication. DNA polymerases are key players in most of these processes. It is not surprising, therefore, that the discovery of several novel DNA polymerases of unknown function has challenged the existing paradigms of replication and repair. Besides a number of translesion synthesis polymerases that constitute the family Y (1Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T.

Sequence comparisons have shown that it has 33% amino acid identity and shares the same domain organization with the best studied member of family X, DNA Pol β, an enzyme crucial in base excision repair (7Sobol R.W.

Members of the family X also include terminal transferase (TdT) (8Bollum F.J. Boyer P.E. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1974: 10Google Scholar), Pol μ (9Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. Lain de Lera T.

Christman M.F. Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite sharing a significant sequence similarity, the small, monomeric enzymes of this family possess remarkably different properties. For example, TdT is a template-independent polymerase involved in antigen receptor diversification during V(D)J recombination (11Gilfillan S. Benoist C. Mathis D. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 148: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: S45-S55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In contrast Pol β is a moderately faithful, template-dependent enzyme (13Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kunkel T.A. Pavlov Y.I. Bebenek K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that, in addition to its polymerase activity, possesses a 5′, 2′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dRP) lyase activity (15Matsumoto Y.

Bebenek, M. Garcia-Diaz, L. Blanco, and T. A. Kunkel, unpublished data. Early studies concluded that Pol λ is predominantly expressed in testis in stages of spermatogenesis coincident with meiotic recombination (4Garcia-Diaz M. Dominguez O.

Although the biological role of Pol λ is currently unknown, insights into its possible cellular functions come from studies of its biochemical properties. Unlike TdT, Pol λ is a template-dependent DNA polymerase (20Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Juarez R. Ruiz J.F.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Like most other members of family X, Pol λ lacks intrinsic 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (5Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Dahan A.

Like Pol β, Pol λ is distributive on an “open” template-primer (e.g. a template hybridized with a single primer), but it is processive when filling short gaps (e.g. 1–5 nucleotides) in DNA if the 5′ end of the gap contains a phosphate group (20Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Juarez R. Ruiz J.F. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13184-13191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, Pol λ has an intrinsic dRP lyase activity, and it can replace Pol β to conduct single-nucleotide base excision repair in vitro (22Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These properties make Pol λ a suitable candidate to perform some form of DNA repair in vivo. Interestingly, Pol λ has high affinity for dNTPs (20Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Juarez R. Ruiz J.F. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13184-13191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which suggests its possible involvement in DNA transactions occurring under low concentrations of DNA precursors. Another biochemical property that has been useful in understanding the in vivo function of a DNA polymerase is its fidelity. Because the error specificity of a DNA polymerase reflects the way it interacts with its substrates, investigation of error specificity may offer clues as to the DNA transactions the enzyme is able to conduct. For example, the low fidelity and the mutational specificity of DNA polymerases η and ι, both members of family Y, suggest that they participate in somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes (reviewed in Ref. 14Kunkel T.A. Pavlov Y.I. Bebenek K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a process responsible for generation of high affinity antibodies. Additional experimental results support this hypothesis (14Kunkel T.A. Pavlov Y.I. Bebenek K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Zeng X. Winter D.B.

Nature. 2002; 419: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similarly, non-templated additions are a signature of synthesis by TdT, implicating TdT in V(D)J recombination, essential for diversification of immunoglobulin genes (25Chang L.M. Bollum F.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 21: 27-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Also, analysis of the fidelity of human Pol γ, responsible for the replication and repair of the mitochondrial genome, showed that its mutational specificity is consistent with the nature of mutations associated with aging and disease (26Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This finding supports the hypothesis that accumulation of Pol γ errors leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Based on the logic that an error signature can be informative regarding possible functions, we present here a detailed analysis of the fidelity of Pol λ and discuss the implications for its possible function in vivo. Materials—All materials for the fidelity assays were from sources described previously (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of full-length Pol λ was described previously (20Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J.

Forward Mutation Assay—This assay scores errors in the lacZ α gene in M13mp2 during synthesis to fill a 407-nucleotide gap (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 1 nm gel-purified M13mp2 gapped DNA substrate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, and 10 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. Polymerization reactions were initiated by adding Pol λ (300 nm) or Pol β (20 nm), incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and terminated by adding EDTA to 15 mm. Reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Correct synthesis produces M13mp2 DNA that yields dark blue phage plaques upon introduction into an Escherichia coli α-complementation strain and plating on indicator plates. Errors are scored as light blue or colorless mutant phage plaques. DNA from independent mutant clones was sequenced to define the lacZ mutation. Because most of the mutant clones generated by Pol λ contained both phenotypically detectable and silent changes, the error rates are described as the number of observed mutations divided by the number of nucleotides sequenced. Error rates for Pol β were calculated as described (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Short Gap Frameshift Reversion Assay—Construction of the DNA substrate in which the 6-nucleotide gap contains a portion of the lacZ α-complementation sequence modified by the introduction of a TTTT sequence has been described (28Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because of the additional nucleotides, the resulting template encodes a colorless M13 plaque phenotype. Frameshift mutations that restore the reading frame result in blue plaques. Gap-filling reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 1.6 nm gapped DNA, 500 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 400 units of T4 DNA ligase, and 100 nm Pol λ or 50 nm Pol β. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to 15 mm; the products were separated on an agarose gel. The covalently closed circular DNA products were electroeluted from gel slices, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. DNA products were introduced into E. coli by electroporation and followed by plating as described (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Fidelity of Human Pol λ in the Forward Mutation Assay—An earlier study indicated that the fidelity of Pol λ was similar to that of Pol β for single-base substitution errors at a TGA codon in the lacZ gene (20Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Juarez R. Ruiz J.F. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13184-13191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To see if a more comprehensive view of the fidelity of Pol λ offered clues to its function, we used the M12mp2 forward mutation assay that detects a broad range of substitution, deletion, and addition errors in a large number of sequence contexts (Table I). This assay requires the enzyme to fill in a 407-nucleotide gap in an M13mp2 double-stranded circular DNA substrate. Pol λ was able to conduct complete gap-filling, as determined by DNA product analysis in an agarose gel (not shown, but see Fig. 3 in Ref. 27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

The gap-filled DNA products were introduced into E. coli cells and plated, and the plates were scored for total and mutant M13mp2 plaques (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a control, we carried out reactions with human Pol β. DNA synthesis by Pol β generated lacZ mutants at a frequency of 3.5%, consistent with previously reported values (28Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K.

Using the same reaction conditions, Pol λ generated mutants at a 6-fold higher frequency (21%, as observed in several independent determinations), indicating that Pol λ is less accurate than Pol β.Table ISummary of sequence changes generated by Pol λTotal mutants sequenced103Total bases sequenced41,921Total sequence changes253Single-base deletions190Single-base substitutions38Two-base deletions9Single-base additions7Other changesaOther changes included deletions of a larger number of nucleotides and complex changes.9a Other changes included deletions of a larger number of nucleotides and complex changes. Open table in a new tab Error Specificity—We sequenced DNA isolated from 103 independent lacZ mutants to determine the error specificity of Pol λ. Single-base substitution, deletion, and insertion errors were observed (Table I) and they were distributed throughout the template DNA present within the gap (Fig. 1). In addition, a few multiple-base changes were observed. The calculated error rates for the different types of errors made by Pol λ are presented in Table II, and Fig. 2 shows average single-base error rates in comparison to other exonuclease-deficient mammalian DNA polymerases examined with this same assay and template. These data reveal that Pol λ has the lowest single-base deletion fidelity of any of these DNA polymerases, and that its average single-base deletion error rate exceeds its single-base substitution error rate. Further, they show that Pol λ is, on average, 32-fold less accurate for single-base deletions than is homologous Pol β.Table IIPol λ error rates in the forward assayMutationError rate × 10-4Pol λPol βTotal frameshifts491.5-1 base frameshifts451.4-2 base frameshifts2.1<0.06+1 base frameshifts1.70.05Base substitutions9.02.3 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Error rates for Pol λ compared with other mammalian DNA polymerases.

Pol λ generated both transitions and transversions (Fig. 1, Table III), with the main error (13 of 38) being formation of a T·dGMP mispair (error rate of 14 × 10–4). The preference for this mispair has also been observed previously with other polymerases (29Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Bambara R.A. Kunkel T.A.

This error is the most prominent feature of Pol β base substitution error spectra (28Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

According to this mechanism, a correct insertion may occur on a transiently misaligned template-primer, followed by realignment to create a mispair that is extended to create a base substitution. Although we have no indication of dislocation mutagenesis by Pol λ at this particular site, the specificity of 22 of the 38 Pol λ-generated base substitutions shown in Fig. 1 is consistent with the possibility that some of these could result from dislocation.Table IIIPol λ base substitution error ratesMutationPol λPol βMutantsError rate × 10-4MutantsError rate × 10-4Transitions235.5251.4T → C131451.0G → A33.192.2Transversions153.6291.0T → GaT → G transversions excluding errors at position 103.0≤1.04 (22)1.0 (118)a T → G transversions excluding errors at position 103. Open table in a new tab The Frameshift Error Specificity of Pol λ—To consider possible mechanisms for the high single-base deletion error rate of Pol λ, we analyzed the sequence contexts in which these deletions occurred. The majority of –1 base deletions occurred at iterated nucleotides (Fig. 1). Deletion of iterated pyrimidines was more frequent than deletions of iterated purines, which could reflect weaker stacking interactions between adjacent template pyrimidines than between adjacent template purines. Deletion of nucleotides in repetitive sequences could result from classical template-primer slippage, a signature of which is an increase in error rate with an increasing number of repeat units in the repetitive sequence (33Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Therefore, we looked at the relationship between the error rate and homopolymeric run lengths for the single-base deletions generated by Pol λ. The results (Fig. 3) indicate a 6-fold increase in error rate for deletions in a two-nucleotide homopolymeric run as compared with the rate of deletions of non-iterated bases. Interestingly, no additional increase in error rate is observed as the run length increases further. This is in contrast to the results with Pol β, where deletion rates are lower (in Fig. 3, note difference in scale on y axis), and there is a more regular increase in error rate with increasing run length. Low Frameshift Fidelity during Short Gap Filling Synthesis—A number of observations with other DNA polymerases reveal a correlation between single-base frameshift error rates and the processivity of DNA synthesis (see Ref. 34Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This has led to the notion that a misaligned intermediate is more likely to form when a polymerase dissociates and/or reassociates with the template-primer. We have reported previously that Pol λ is distributive when copying an open template-primer such as the 407-nucleotide gap used in the forward mutation assay but is more processive when filling a 5-nucleotide gap in which the 5′ end is phosphorylated (20Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Dominguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcia-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Juarez R. Ruiz J.F. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13184-13191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the single-base deletion fidelity of Pol λ might be higher when processively filling a short gap. The assay (28Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) detects single-base deletions (as dark blue revertant plaques) within a 6-base gap containing the template sequence 5′-CTTTTA (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this assay, the frequency of Pol λ-generated revertants is also high, over 100-fold higher than that of Pol β (Table IV). Thus, even when filling a short gap, Pol λ produces deletions at an unusually high rate. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that 39 of 40 dark blue revertants lacked one of the four Ts, whereas only one resulted from a deletion of the template A. This result is consistent with the Pol λ specificity revealed in the forward assay (Fig. 1).Table IVPol λ fidelity during short gap-filling synthesisEnzymeFrameshiftsBase substitutionsTotal plaquesRevertants scoredMutant frequency × 10-4Mutant frequencyaResults from Ref. 20. × 10-4Pol λ exp.

The value is an average of three independent determinations. Open table in a new tab All mammalian DNA polymerases that we had examined previously in the forward mutation assay generated base substitutions at a higher average rate than they generated frameshift errors. In contrast, the data presented here (Fig. 2) reveal that human Pol λ is unusual in that its average single-base frameshift error rate is very high and exceeds its average rate of base substitutions. This finding has interesting functional and mechanistic implications. Pol λ has been implicated in base excision repair because, like Pol β, it possesses a dRP lyase activity in its 8-kDa domain, it shows a preference for filling short-gap substrates with a 5′-phosphate, and it can substitute for Pol β in a single-nucleotide base excision repair reaction in vitro. Despite these shared features and similar base substitution fidelity, the average single-base deletion fidelity of Pol λ is over 30-fold lower than that of Pol β (Table II). In fact, the average –1 base deletion error rate of Pol λ is even higher than those of polymerases of the Y family, which are renowned for their infidelity. Because of the increase in the single-base deletion rate for runs as compared with non-iterated nucleotides, some of these deletions may reflect classical strand slippage (33Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, the relatively high Pol λ deletion rate for non-iterated nucleotides (Fig. 3) and the lack of a further increase in rate with increasing run length suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms and/or unusual interactions of Pol λ with its substrates. Possibilities include misalignment in the polymerase active site (35Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R.

Here, we compare five hydrographic sections from 1936, 1965, 1987, 1995, and 2002 to show that upper thermocline waters (10 degrees C to 17 degrees C) changed little from 1936 to 1965, freshened from 1965 to 1987, and since 1987 have become saltier.

Geiter L.J. Snider Jr., D.E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1987; 135: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar). The insidious and indolent nature of these diseases and the lack of well defined diagnostic criteria have long contributed to the scarcity of knowledge of pulmonary NTM infection. Mycobacterium kansasii, also called the “yellow bacillus,” is one of the most frequent NTM mycobacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens (2Alcaide F. Richter I. Bernasconi C. Springer B.

Annual rates of infection in the general population have been in the range of 0.5 to 1 per 100,000. However, significant geographical variability is observed. An increase in M. kansasii disease has been observed because the onset of the AIDS epidemic (3Horsburgh Jr., C.R. Selik R.M. Am. Rev. Respir.

However, little is known about the virulence factors of M. kansasii and the mechanisms developed by these bacteria to invade and survive within the infected host. Lipoarabinomannans (LAMs) are important virulence factors for tuberculous mycobacteria and are complex lipoglycans restricted to the Mycobacterium genus and found in the envelope of all mycobacterial species (9Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). LAMs are composed of three structural domains: two homopolysaccharides, the d-mannan and the d-arabinan, constitute the carbohydrate backbone; the mannan core is terminated by the GPI anchor at its reducing end, and the arabinan domain is capped by either mannosyl (10Venisse A.

Mannosylated LAMs (ManLAM), characterized by the presence of mannosyl caps, are found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and Mycobacterium avium. Phosphoinositol-capped LAMs (PILAMs), characterized by the absence of manno-oligosaccharide caps and the presence of phosphoinositol caps, have been isolated from nonpathogenic species, such as Mycobacterium smegmatis.

However, it is noteworthy that subtle differences in the LAM structures dictate various functional properties. PILAMs are pro-inflammatory molecules capable of stimulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-12, and the inability of M. smegmatis to survive within activated macrophages correlates with the pro-inflammatory responses to PILAMs. On the other hand, ManLAMs are anti-inflammatory molecules, inhibiting the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-12 by human macrophages, and the capacity of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, or M. avium to survive and multiply within macrophages is related to the anti-inflammatory effect of their ManLAMs (15Nigou J. Gilleron M. Rojas M. Garcia L.F Thurner M. Puzo G. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the fine structures of LM and LAM from a clinical isolate of M. kansasii and investigated their ability to modulate apoptosis in human macrophages.

This strain was grown on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates supplemented with 10% oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment (Difco) or under shaking in liquid Sauton medium at 37 °C. Purification of KanPIM, KanLM, and KanLAM—Extraction and purification of KanLM and KanLAM was based on the Triton X-114 phase partitioning and separation by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column as reported earlier for the purification of CheLAM (14Guérardel Y.

The LMs and LAMs preparations contained less than 20 pg of lipopolysaccharide/10 μg of LMs or LAMs. Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs) were obtained from Tris deoxycholate-insoluble lipid fractions after KanLM and KanLAM purification. This material was extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (50:50:5) and applied onto a silica gel column (KG60 0.063–0.200 mm, Merck) irrigated with chloroform and then eluted with chloroform/methanol/water by increasing the methanol/water proportions. Lipoglycans, including lipo-oligosaccharides and PIMs, were eluted at a proportion of 50:50:5. PIMs were finally separated on a DEAE-cellulose (acetate form) column irrigated with chloroform/methanol/ammonium acetate by increasing proportions of methanol/ammonium acetate. Fractions containing purified PIMs were eluted with chloroform/methanol (1:2) containing 0.05 m ammonium acetate. Purity of the samples was assessed by GC/MS analysis. 1H homonuclear and 13C-1H heteronuclear HMQC NMR experiments were used to typify this fraction as PIM2. NMR Analysis—Prior to NMR spectroscopic analysis, LM (15 mg) and LAM (5 mg) were repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O (99.97% purity, Euriso-top, CEA Saclay, France) with intermediate freeze-drying and then dissolved in 250 μlofMe2SO-d6 (Euriso-top). Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm downfield from the signal of the methyl group of Me2SO-d6 (δ1H/trimethylsilyl = 2.52 ppm, δ13C/trimethylsilyl = 40.98 ppm at 343 K). The samples were analyzed in 200 × 5-mm BMS-005-B Shigemi® tubes on a Bruker ASX-400 spectrometer (Centre d'Analyses RMN, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France) (1H, 400.33; 13C, 100.66, 31P, 162.5 MHz) equipped with a double resonance (1H/X) Broad Band Inverse Z-gradient probe head. All NMR data were recorded without sample spinning. The one-dimensional proton 1H spectrum was measured using a 90° tipping angle for the pulse and 1.5 s as a recycle delay between each of 32 acquisitions of 2.4 s. The spectral width of 4006 Hz was collected in 16,384 complex data points. The one-dimensional 13C was recorded using a spectral width of 20,161 Hz, and 32,768 data points were collected to obtain a FID resolution of 0.6 Hz per point. The 31P spectra of both compounds were acquired with a spectral width of 16,233 Hz collected in 16,384 data points. Both experiments were recorded using a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition using the GARP sequence at the carbon or phosphorus frequency (27Shaka A.J. Barker P B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). An exponential transformation (line broadening factor = 5 for 13Cand3Hzfor 31P) was applied prior to processing the data points in the frequency domain. Two-dimensional homonuclear (1H-1H) spectra (COSY, ROESY, and TOCSY) were measured using standard Bruker pulse programs. ROESY spectra were acquired with various mixing times (50, 100, 200, and 400 ms) and acquired in the States mode according to Bax and Davis (28Bax A.D. Davis J. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar), whereas both COSY and relayed COSY were acquired in the magnitude calculation mode. Moreover, the two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum was recorded using an MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 120 ms. The spin lock field strength corresponded to a 90° pulse width of 35 μs. The spectral width was 4000 Hz in both dimensions. 512 spectra of 4096 data points with 32 scans per t1 increment were recorded giving a spectral resolution of 0.9 Hz/point in F2 and ∼8 Hz/point in F1. Heteronuclear data (1H-13C and 1H-31P) were obtained with standard Bruker pulse sequences, such as HMQC (inv4tp), HMQC-HOHAHA (inv4mltp), and HMBC (inv4lrnd). HMQC and HMQC-HOHAHA were acquired by the phase time proportional increment (TPPI) method, whereas HMBC was recorded in the magnitude mode calculation. All parameters (pulse widths, pulse powers, and delays) were optimized for each experiment. Chemical Cleavages—To study the structure of the capping motifs, LAM was subjected to mild hydrolysis in 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 1 h. The resulting hydrolysate was either reduced and permethylated prior to analysis by GC or fractionated by gel filtration on a P4 column (Bio-Rad) using acetic acid 0.5% (v/v) as the elution buffer. Elution was monitored by TLC analysis, and the oligosaccharidyl-containing fractions were subjected to 2-aminopyridine derivatization. The nature of the residue substituting the mannan core was investigated by subjecting 1 mg of LM to mild acetolysis in a mixture of acetic anhydride/acetic acid/sulfuric acid (10:10:1) at 40 °C for 3 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water. Acetolysis products were then extracted twice with chloroform before analysis by MALDI and by GC/MS. Gas Chromatography Techniques—Monosaccharides were analyzed as alditol-acetate derivatives. Lipoglycans were hydrolyzed in 4 m trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 100 °C and reduced with NaBH4 in 0.05 m NH4OH for 4 h. The reduction was stopped by dropwise addition of acetic acid until the pH reached 6.0, and borate salts were co-distilled by repetitive evaporation in dry methanol. Per-acetylation was performed in acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 2 h, and the derivatives were analyzed by GC on a BPX70 12-m × 0.22-mm inner diameter column (chrompack). Linkage analysis of monosaccharides was carried out by two steps of per-methylation (29Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), followed by derivatization with acetyl groups with acetic anhydride. Oligosaccharides generated by either mild hydrolysis or acetolysis were reduced using NaBH4 in 0.05 m NH4OH for 4 h and per-methylated prior analysis by GC/MS on a WCOT fused silica 30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter column (chrompack). Acylglycerols were released by cleaving the phosphodiester bond by acetolysis. Briefly, 100 μg of lipoglycans were treated with 400 μl of anhydrous acetic acid/acetic anhydride, 3:2 (v/v), at 110 °C for 12 h. Acetylated acylglycerols were extracted by cyclohexane and analyzed by GC/MS on a WCOT-fused silica 30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter column (chrompack). 2-Aminopyridine Derivatization—Oligosaccharides were dissolved in 20 μl of a 3 m 2-aminopyridine solution in acetic acid and incubated at 90 °C for 1 h. 70 μl of a 26 m borane solution was freshly prepared in acetic acid/water (8:5; v/v) and added before incubation of the mixture at 80 °C for 35 min. The reaction was stopped by increasing the pH to 9 with ammonia, and 500 μl of water was added. Excess of 2-aminopyridine was removed by 10 successive extractions with chloroform. Derivatized oligosaccharides were further purified on a graphite column, and the resulting tagged oligosaccharides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a 5 μm ODS Zorbax column (4.4 × 250, DuPont Institute, Paris) using a solution of water/acetonitrile (100:0; v/v for 10 min and then 100:0 to 80:20 in 40 min). These components were then subjected to ES/MS and NMR analyses. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight MS—The molecular mass of the per-acetylated oligosaccharides was measured by MALDI-MS on a Vision 2000 time-of-flight instrument (Finnigan Mat) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser; 1 μl of sample at a concentration of 100 pmol/μl was mixed with an equal volume of matrix (2,5-dihydroxy-benzoic acid dissolved in methanol/water, 70:30) and allowed to crystallize. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—All MS measurements were carried out in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK) fitted with an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray source. A mixture of polypropylene glycol was used to calibrate the quadrupole mass spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in methanol/water (50:50) at a concentration of 10 pmol/μl and infused using the nanoflow probe at 50 nl/min. Quadrupole was scanned from 200 to 2000 Da with a scan duration of 3 s and a scan delay of 0.1 s. The samples were sprayed using 1.4-kV needle voltage, and the declustering (cone) was typically set at 70 V. For collision-induced dissociation experiments, the pressure of argon in the cell was set at 4.10–3 mbar, and the collision energy was set to values ranging from 25 to 75 eV. Apoptosis Assay—The human promonocytic THP-1 cell line was grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2mml-glutamine, and 2 × 10–5m β-mercaptoethanol in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were distributed in 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) was added (20 ng/ml final) for 20 h to differentiate the THP-1 cells into adherent macrophages. The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and 500 μl of medium containing 5% human serum was added to each well. The purified glycoconjugates were added at the following final concentrations to duplicate wells: KanLM (10 μg/ml), KanLAM (20 μg/ml), KanPIM2 (10 μg/ml), and PILAM from a fast-growing Mycobacterium sp. (20 μg/ml). After incubation for 24 h, the apoptosis induced by the lipids was quantified by staining the cells with annexin V-Alexa 488 conjugates and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), as described by the manufacturer. Flow cytometry analysis was performed, and the apoptotic cells were defined as the annexin V-positive and propidium iodide-negative population. Experiments were performed three times in duplicates. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Guérardel Y. Maes E. Elass E. Leroy Y. Timmerman P. Besra G.S. Locht C. Strecker G. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30635-30648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except that the membrane was probed overnight with the antigenic factor 1 serum from the Candida Check (1:100 dilution; Iatron Laboratories, Japan) to test for the presence of Manα1–2-linked side chains. After washing, the membrane was subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:5000 dilution; Roche Applied Science). Considering the biosynthetic filiation between LM and LAM, and in order to ease attribution of the NMR signals, both lipoglycans were studied simultaneously. Due to the greater simplicity of LM, the structure of the mannan and the GPI domains was deciphered on LM (termed KanLM), whereas the structure of the arabinan domain and the cap was studied separately on LAM (termed KanLAM). Quantitative analysis of the alditol-acetate derivatives from KanLM and KanLAM led to Ara/Man/myo-inositol molar ratios of 4:38:1 and 65:56:1, respectively. Detection of arabinose residues in LM, which is generally devoid of arabinose, suggested a slight contamination of KanLM in the KanLAM preparation. These arabinose units were identified as t-Ara, 2-Ara, 5-Ara, and 3,5-Ara by methylation analysis. Subsequent NMR analyses showed that the arabinose units were identical in KanLM and KanLAM samples, indicating that these residues detected in the KanLM sample, estimated to about 4% (mol/mol), arose from a contamination by KanLAM. Analysis of partially methylated alditol-acetate derivatives revealed the presence of three major types of mannose units in KanLM, identified by their retention times and fragmentation patterns as t-Manp, 6-Manp, and 2,6-Manp. Small amounts of 2-Manp were also identified in the KanLM sample. The relative proportions of this residue (Table I) indicated that it originated from KanLM and not from a KanLAM contamination.Table IMethylation analysis of KanLM and KanLAMmol %KanLMKanLAMt-Ara32-Ara65-Ara4aValue originates from KanLAM contamination.383,5-Ara9t-Man44212-Man466-Man1972,6-Man2910a Value originates from KanLAM contamination. Open table in a new tab The exact arrangement of the monosaccharide units was further studied by NMR. The parameters (summarized in Table II) of the mannan domain from KanLM were assigned using one-dimensional 1H and 13C, as well as two-dimensional 1H-1H homonuclear and two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear NMR. Based on these parameters, spin systems of major t-α-Manp, 6-α-Manp, and 2,6-α-Manp units were unambiguously identified and labeled as the IV, VI, and VIII units, respectively (30Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Due to a strong overlapping of 2,6-α-Manp and 2-α-Manp signals, parameters from 2-α-Manp could not be unambiguously established. As seen in the anomeric region of the 1H homonuclear and 13C-1H heteronuclear NMR spectra (Fig. 1b), the VI unit showed a marked heterogeneity that led to the identification of two distinct 6-α-Man residues labeled VI1 and VI2 because of their H-1 chemical shifts at δ 4.70 and δ 4.78 ppm, respectively. This suggests that both 6-α-d-Manp units present distinct arrangements within the mannan core of KanLM. HMBC experiments unambiguously demonstrated that the mannan domain of KanLM is composed of a linear backbone of α1,6-linked α-d-Manp residues, partially substituted in the C-2 position mostly by α-d-Manp residues (Fig. 2). In particular, the occurrence of an extra-residual 3 J H-C correlation between IV H-1 and deshielded C-2 at δ 78.4 ppm established that all t-Man units (IV) substituted 2,6-Man units (VIII), or 2-Man units as suggested by the methylation analysis, in the C-2 positions. Then VIII H-1/VIII C-6, 6′, and VIII H-1/VI C-6,6′ correlations at δ 67.3 and 66.5 ppm, respectively, established that the VIII units substituted both VIII and VI units in the C-6 positions. Interestingly, H-1 of the VI1 and VI2 units showed distinct 3 J H-C correlations with VIII C-6 at δ 67.0 ppm and VI C-6 at δ 66.5 ppm, respectively. These distinct positions within the mannan backbone may in part account for the differences observed in the VI1 and VI2 H-1 chemical shifts. Furthermore, the slight differences of the chemical shifts found between C-6 positions of the VIII residues (δ 67.0 and 67.3) revealed the occurrence of two distinct populations of 2,6-Man residues, only differing in their C-6 parameters, VIII1 and VIII2, depending on the nature of the substituting unit in the C-6 position, 6-Man or 2,6-Man residues.Table IIKanLM 1H and 13C chemical shifts in Me2SO-d6 at 343 K n.d., not determined.Fig. 1Anomer regions (δ1H: 4.5–5.3, and δ13C, 98–110) of 13C-1H HMQC heteronuclear spectra: (a) KanPIM, (b) KanLM, and (c) KanLAM in Me2SO-d 6. * indicates Ara residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2Details of HMBC (δ1H: 4.5–5.3, and δ13C: 58–92) (a), 13C-1H heteronuclear HMQC (δ1H: 3.0–5.2, and δ13C 58–92) (b), and of 1H-1H ROESY (δ1H: 3.0–5.2 and 5.05–5.30) spectra from KanLM in Me2SO-d 6(c).

In order to investigate this issue, KanLM was submitted to acetolysis that specifically cleaves the α1,6-Man linkages. The resulting oligosaccharides were then analyzed by MALDI-MS. As shown in Fig. 3a, ions at m/z 989, 1005, 1277, and 1293, likely corresponding to [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+ adducts of per-acetylated Hex3 and Hex4 oligosaccharides, were observed. To establish whether these oligosaccharides originate from the presence of di- and trimannosidic side chains or from an incomplete acetolysis of the α(1–6) linkages, the acetolysis products were reduced, per-methylated, and analyzed by GC/MS at high temperature in the chem"
https://openalex.org/W1991748964,"Transcription-coupled DNA repair is dedicated to the removal of DNA lesions from transcribed strands of expressed genes. RNA polymerase arrest at a lesion has been proposed as a sensitive signal for recruitment of repair enzymes to the lesion site. To understand how initiation of transcription-coupled repair may occur, we have characterized the properties of the transcription complex when it encounters a lesion in its path. Here we have compared the effect of cisplatin-induced intrastrand cross-links on transcription elongation by T7 RNA polymerase and mammalian RNA polymerase II. We found that a single cisplatin 1,2-d(GG) intrastrand cross-link or a single cisplatin 1,3-d(GTG) intrastrand cross-link is a strong block to both polymerases. Furthermore, the efficiency of the block at a cisplatin 1,2-d(GG) intrastrand cross-link was similar in several different nucleotide sequence contexts. Interestingly, some blockage was also observed when the single cisplatin 1,3-d(GTG) intrastrand cross-link was located in the non-transcribed strand. Transcription complexes arrested at the cisplatin adducts were substrates for the transcript cleavage reaction mediated by the elongation factor TFIIS, indicating that the RNA polymerase II complexes arrested at these lesions are not released from template DNA. Addition of TFIIS yielded a population of transcripts up to 30 nucleotides shorter than those arrested at the lesion. In the presence of nucleoside triphosphates, these shortened transcripts could be re-elongated up to the site of the lesion, indicating that the arrested complexes are stable and competent to resume elongation. These results show that cisplatin-induced lesions in the transcribed DNA strand constitute a strong physical barrier to RNA polymerase progression, and they support current models of transcription arrest and initiation of transcription-coupled repair."
https://openalex.org/W2144099185,"Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of eight members of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene family from Drosophila melanogaster (polypeptide GalNAc transferase = pgant1–8). Full-length cDNAs were isolated from a Drosophila embryonic library based on homology to known ppGaNTases. Alignments with characterized mammalian isoforms revealed strong sequence similarities between certain fly and mammalian isoforms, highlighting putative orthologues between the species. In vitro activity assays demonstrated biochemical transferase activity for each gene, with three isoforms requiring glycosylated substrates. Comparison of the activities of Drosophila and mammalian orthologues revealed conservation of substrate preferences against a panel of peptide and glycopeptide substrates. Furthermore, Edman degradation analysis demonstrated that preferred sites of GalNac addition were also conserved between certain fly and mammalian orthologues. Semi-quantitative PCR amplification of Drosophila cDNA revealed expression of most isoforms at each developmental stage, with some isoforms being less abundant at certain stages relative to others. In situ hybridization to Drosophila embryos revealed specific staining of pgant5 and pgant6 in the salivary glands and pgant5 in the developing hindgut. Additionally, pgant5 and pgant6 expression within the egg chamber was restricted to the follicle cells, cells known to be involved in egg formation and subsequent embryonic patterning.

The recent completion of genome sequencing for many eukaryotic organisms as well as advances in proteomic analysis have placed new emphasis on the study of post-translation modifications. Glycosylation is by far the most abundant modification seen in nature. Protein substrates may be modified by the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides, O-linked fucose, O-linked xylose, O-linked galactose, O-linked mannose, O-linked GlcNAc, or O-linked GalNAc followed by subsequent sugar additions, resulting in the formation of very complex structures (1Ten Hagen K.G.

Mucin-type O-linked glycosylation involves the transfer of GalNAc from the nucleotide sugar UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group of either serine or threonine in protein substrates. A large, evolutionarily conserved family of enzymes, known as the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGaNTases) 1The abbreviations used are: ppGaNTase, UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; aa, amino acids; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: ppGaNTase, UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; aa, amino acids; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

To date, 13 distinct mammalian isoforms of this enzyme family have been functionally characterized, with each displaying a unique combination of expression patterns and well as substrate specificity. These enzymes have been shown to fall into two general categories as follows: those that will transfer GalNAc onto unmodified (as well as modified) peptide substrates (peptide transferases) and those that require the prior addition of a GalNAc on a peptide substrate before they will add additional GalNAc moieties (glycopeptide transferases) (4Ten Hagen K.G. Bedi G.S. Tetaert D. Kingsley P.D. Hagen F.K. Balys M.M. Beres T.M. Degand P. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17395-17404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Estimates based on homology searches of the human and mouse genome data bases predict a total of 24 members of this enzyme family in mammals (1Ten Hagen K.G. Fritz T.A. Tabak L.A.

Searches of the Drosophila genome data base indicate that up to 14 polypeptide GalNAc transferase (pgants) may be present. Of those, two have been cloned and functionally characterized (6Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J. Biol.

Given the potentially large size of the mammalian ppGaNTase family as well as overlapping substrate preferences and expression patterns, individual gene knockouts may not show distinct phenotypes. This potential problem necessitates the use of model organisms (where the family size is smaller and genetic analysis more tractable) to aid in dissecting the role of this enzyme family in vivo. In an effort to begin to use Drosophila as a model system in which to study the ppGaNTases, we performed genome data base searches and screened cDNA libraries to identify and characterize potential members of the ppGaNTase enzyme family. Sequence analysis of fly and mammalian transferases indicates that certain isoforms were present prior to the divergence of these species. In vitro analysis of the cloned isoforms demonstrates biochemical activity and reveals functional conservation between certain Drosophila and mammalian orthologues. Isolation of ppGaNTase Full-length cDNAs—The amino acid consensus sequence SPTMAGGLFAVNRKYFQHLGEY, derived from the conserved region of previously characterized mammalian ppGaNTases, was used to perform a tBLASTn search against the existing Drosophila melanogaster genome data base present in NCBI to identify all potential members of this enzyme family. The 14 predicted D. melanogaster ppGaNTase gene sequences obtained were aligned to identify highly conserved regions on which to base degenerate probes to screen cDNA libraries. The primers MAGGLF-S (dATGGCCGGCGGNCTGTTTGCCAT) and WGGEN-AS (dATCTCCANATTCTCGCCGCCCCA) were used to amplify a 100-bp fragment from D. melanogaster genomic DNA that should hybridize to all 14 predicted isoforms. This amplified genomic fragment was then radioactively labeled using the Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) and used to probe a D. melanogaster Canton-S embryo (2–14-h-old) UniZap XR cDNA library (Stratagene catalog no. 937602). Hybridizations were performed in 5× SSPE, 50% formamide at 42 °C with washes in 2×SSC, 0.5% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and for 15 min at 65 °C. Positively hybridizing clones were further screened with isoform-specific primers to eliminate duplicate clones, hybridizing in 5× SSPE, 50% formamide at 30 °C with washes in 2×SSC, 0.5% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and 15 min at 42 °C. Isoform-specific primers were as follows: FlyA (dAGCGCGAATCGCCACGGGGGATG) for pgant1, FlyC (dTGCGGATGCAGCTGTGAGTAGTG) for pgant2, FlyE (dTGCCGAGCATGTGAGCGGTGAGG) for pgant5, FlyF (dCGCAAGGAATGCCACTGCAGAGG) for pgant6, FlyG (dTGCTTTGCATCCCGCAGGTGAGG) for pgant7, and FlyI (dAGCCTCAAGTATTTTGTGGCAAG) for CG30463. Clones were then sequenced using the T3 and T7 primers to identify each isoform obtained. Clones containing complete open reading frames were completely sequenced on both strands (Lark Technologies, Inc.). cDNA clones of pgant3 (GH09147) (GenBank™ accession number AF145655), pgant4 (AT-25481) and pgant8 (RE06471) (GenBank™ accession number) were purchased from Research Genetics (Invitrogen). Amino Acid Alignments and Similarity Determinations—Amino acid sequences were aligned, one pair at a time, using the pairwise ClustalW (1.4) algorithm in MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). The following alignment modes and parameters were used: slow alignment, open gap penalty = 10, extended gap penalty = 0.1, similarity matrix = blosum, delay divergence = 40%, hydrophilic penalties, and residue-specific penalties. Best tree and bootstrap analyses were performed using the following parameters: neighbor joining; tie breaking = systematic; Poisson-correction; proportional gap distribution. Numbers at the nodes (Fig. 2B) represent reproducibility of particular groupings and are expressed as percentage of recovery in 1000 replicates. Nodes that appeared less than 50% of the time were not retained.

The following regions were amplified from each gene using the specified primer pairs: a 335-bp region of pgant1 using primers FlyA-1230S (dGGCTCTGGTTTGGATGGATGAG) and FlyA-1565AS (dAGGACATTTGTGTTGGTGAAGGAG); a 282-bp region of pgant3 using primers FlyB-1489S (dTTGTCACGAGAGTGGAAGCGAG) and FlyB-1771AS (dCGTTGCGGTTCTTTAGCATCTTG); a 255-bp region of pgant2 using primers FlyC-724S (dCGAGTGATTCGCAACGACAAG) and FlyC-979AS (dTCAGGTTCCAGTCAAAGCCG); a 259-bp region of pgant4 using primers FlyD-981S (dTAGCGGAAATAAGGACGGAGC) and FlyD-1241AS (dCAGGGAACATCCAACAGCATACC); a 334-bp region of pgant5 using primers FlyE-1085S (dATGAGATTGGCTCCTACGACGAGG) and FlyE-1419AS (dCAGATACCAGCGGAAACTCTTGC); a 259-bp region of pgant6 using primers FlyF-633S (dCAACGAATACCTGAGCGTGCTG) and FlyF-892AS (dCGTGGGAATCAAGGAAGATGAG); a 357-bp region of pgant7 using primers FlyG-966S (dCCTGTTCGCCATCAATAGGGAG) and FlyG-1323AS (dGCAGTTCAGTCGCTTCTTCAGC); an 845-bp region of pgant35A using primers FlyH-1330-S (dCCTCATCAAGTCGGAGAACG) and FlyH-2175-AS (dAGGCACAGCAACTTGTCCAG); a 213-bp region of pgant8 using primers FlyJ-1496S (dGATTCTATTGCTTGGAGGTGCG) and FlyJ-1709AS (dCACTGTTGCTTATGGTTCTTCGG). Primers pairs were used under the following PCR conditions: 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 5 °C below the lowest Tm for the primer pair for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. rp49 control PCR amplifications were performed according to the manufacturer's primers and instructions. Reaction products were electrophoresed in a 1% TAE-agarose gel and photographed on a Bio-Rad Fluor-S™ MultiImager. Generation of Secretion Constructs for Drosophila ppGaNTases— Each cDNA was cloned into an SV40 expression vector (pIMKF4) to generate a recombinant fusion protein containing an insulin secretion signal, a metal-binding site, a heart muscle kinase site, a FLAG™ epitope tag, and the transferase gene of interest. Fusions of each transferase gene begin after the transmembrane domain by introduction of an MluI site, so that the recombinant protein is efficiently secreted into the media. PCR products used in the cloning of each gene were sequenced to verify that no PCR-induced mutation had occurred. To clone pgant1, an MluI site was introduced into a fragment of the pgant1 cDNA (Fly-4a) by PCR amplification using the primers FlyA-59S (dATAACGCGTTGCAGCAGAATGGTTCACCA) and FlyA-925AS (dGAAGATCTGTACTGAAAGTCGTTGGCATCG); after digestion with MluI, the product was cloned into the MluI/BglII (blunt) sites of pIMKF4 to generate pF4-FlyA700. A 1.7-kb BsmBI/SacI fragment was isolated from the original cDNA clone for pgant1 (Fly-4a) and cloned into the same sites of pF4-FlyA700 to generate the pgant1 expression vector, pF4-FlyA. The expression vector for pgant3 was constructed by PCR amplification of a fragment from the pgant3 cDNA (GH09147) using the primers FlyB-MluI-S (dATAACGCGTTCCAGGGCGGGGACGCGGAG) and FlyB-BglII-AS (dGAAGATCTTGGGCGTCGAGGAAGGTCAGCAC); this fragment was digested with MluI/BglII and cloned into the MluI/BglII sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector pF4FlyB-640. A BspTI/XbaI(blunt) fragment from the pgant3 cDNA clone was then cloned into the BspTI/SacI(blunt) sites pF4FlyB-640 to generate the expression vector pF4-FlyB. The expression vector for pgant2 was generated by PCR amplification of a 374-bp fragment from the pgant2 cDNA clone (FlyC-1a) using the primers FlyC-MluIS (dATAACGCGTCAAGTGGTCGTGGCACCGAGGT) and FlyC-BglIIAS (dGAAGATCTCACTCGCACCTTGTCAATCTTCGCCA); after digestion with MluI, this product was cloned into the MluI/BglII(blunt) sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector, pF4FlyC-374. A 1.7-kb Bsu36I/XbaI(blunt) fragment from the pgant2 cDNA clone was then cloned into the Bsu36I/SacI(blunt) sites of pF4FlyC-374 to generate the expression vector pF4-FlyC. To generate the pgant4 expression vector, an MluI site was introduced into a fragment of the pgant4 cDNA (AT25481) by PCR amplification using the primers FlyD-185S (ATAACGCGTTGAAAAATGCGGCGGAGCTGA) and FlyD-1000AS (dAATCTTCATGCGAAATAGTATCCACCA); this product was digested with MluI/BglII and cloned into the MluI/BglII sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector, pF4-FlyD820. A 1.9-kb AflII/SmaI fragment from AT25481 was then cloned into the AflII/BglII(blunt) sites of pF4-FlyD820 to generate the expression vector, pF4-FlyD. The expression vector for pgant5 was generated by amplification of an 800-bp fragment from the pgant5 cDNA clone, pBSFlyE, using the primers FlyE-82S (dATAACGCGTACTCGGACTGCATCGGCA) and FlyE-900AS (dGAAGATCTAATCACATCAATAATCGGGCAC). This fragment was then digested with MluI/BglII and cloned into the MluI/BglII sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector, pF4FlyE-819. A 1.4-kb BsmBI/BglII fragment from pBSFlyE was then cloned into the BsmBI/BglII sites of pF4FlyE-819 to generate the expression vector, pF4-FlyE. The pgant6 expression vector was constructed by cloning the 570-bp MluI/BglII PCR fragment, obtained using primers FlyF-MluIS (dATAACGCGTTCTCATCTACTCCGGACACCAACA) and FlyF-BglIIAS (dGAAGATCTGCATCAGCACGCTCAGGTATTC) with the pgant6 cDNA (FlyF-1a), into the MluI/BglII sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector, pF4FlyF-570. Then a 1.9-kb BstBI/NdeI(blunt) from pBSFlyE was cloned into the BstBI/NotI(blunt) sites of pF4FlyF-570 to generate the expression vector, pF4-FlyF. The expression vector for pgant7 was generated by amplification of a 350-bp fragment from the pgant7 cDNA (Fly-42a) using the primers FlyG-MluIS (dATAACGCGTACAAGCGCGTCCAGGAGGCGTAT) and FlyG-BglIIAS (dGAAGATCTTGGAAGACAATGATGACGCTCGTGC); this fragment was digested with MluI/BglII and cloned into the MluI/BglII sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector, pF4FlyG-349. A 1.7-kb PciI/XhoI(blunt) fragment from Fly-42a was then inserted into the PciI/SacI(blunt) sites of pF4FlyG-349 to generate the expression vector, pF4-FlyG. A fragment from the pgant8 cDNA (RE06471) was amplified using the primers FlyJ-191S (dATAACGCGTTGGAGGGGGAGCGTGATG) and FlyJ-596AS (dGAGGATCCCGTCCACCAGGATAACCTCTCG); after digestion with MluI/BamHI, this fragment was cloned into the MluI/BglII sites of pIMKF4 to generate the vector, pF4FlyJ-405. A 1.7-kb BstBI/BamHI(blunt) fragment from RE06471 was then cloned into the BstBI/SacI(blunt) sites of pF4FlyJ-405 to generate the expression vector, pF4-FlyJ. Functional Expression Assays of Secreted Recombinant ppGaNTases in COS7 Cells—COS7 cells were grown to 90% confluency and transfected with pIMKF4, pF1-rT7, pF3-mT2, pF3-mT1, pF3-mT11, pF4-FlyA, pF4-FlyB, pF4-FlyC, pF4-FlyD, pF4-FlyE, pF4-FlyF, pF4-FlyG, or pF4-FlyJ and 64 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (14Hagen F.K.

Gels were dried under vacuum, exposed to film (XAR, Eastman Kodak Co.), and quantitated on a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Enzyme assays were conducted using equivalent amounts of FLAG-purified PGANT1, -2, and -5–7 based on gel densitometric measurements. Maximal amounts of FLAG-purified PGANT4 were used in assays as its activity was low relative to the other FLAG-purified isoforms. Assays for PGANT3 and PGANT8 were performed using cell media, as FLAG purification resulted in no detectable protein and loss of activity (likely due to an N-terminal cleavage of the recombinant proteins, resulting in loss of the FLAG site).

Reaction products were purified using anion exchange chromatography (AG 1-X8, Bio-Rad). Reactions using media or FLAG-purified material from cells transfected with vector alone yielded background values for each substrate that were subtracted from each experimental value. Adjusted experimental values for each substrate were then averaged, and standard deviations were calculated. Enzyme activity is expressed as dpm/h.

The observations are also consistent with a shallow substrate consisting of a layer with water ice overlain by a layer of drier soil. The lower ice-rich layer contains between 50 and 75 weight % water, indicating that the shallow subsurface at northern polar latitudes on Mars is even more water rich than that in the south."
https://openalex.org/W2055748333,"The effect of antifreeze protein type III (one type of fish antifreeze protein) on ice crystallization was examined quantitatively based on a “micro-sized ice nucleation” technique. It was found for the first time that antifreeze proteins can inhibit the ice nucleation process by adsorbing onto both the surfaces of ice nuclei and dust particles. This leads to an increase of the ice nucleation barrier and the desolvation kink kinetics barrier, respectively. Based on the latest nucleation model, the increases in the ice nucleation barrier and the kink kinetics barrier were measured. This enables us to quantitatively examine the antifreeze mechanism of antifreeze proteins for the first time.

Antifreeze proteins are found in the blood and tissues of organisms that live in freezing environments (1Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In these organisms, ranging from fish to bacteria, the effect of freezing is retarded or the damage incurred upon freezing and thawing is reduced (2Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 3Knight C.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4Knight C.A. Devries A.L. Oolman L.D.

Applications of the antifreeze effect of these antifreeze proteins (AFPs), 1The abbreviation used is: AFPs, antifreeze proteins. which is the capacity to inhibit ice crystallization, have been sought for maintaining the texture in frozen food, improving storage of blood, tissues, and organs, cryosurgery, and protecting crops from freezing (4Knight C.A. Devries A.L. Oolman L.D. Nature. 1984; 308: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Freezing is a process of ice crystallization from supercooled water. In this process, water should undergo the stage of ice nucleation, followed by the growth of ice (5Mutaftschiev B. Hurle D.T.J. Handbook of Cryst. Growth la Fundamentals: Thermodynamics and Kinetics. North-Holland, Amsterdam1993: 187-248Google Scholar). Actually, whether or not freezing takes place is determined to a large extent by ice nucleation. In other words, there would be no ice growth if ice nucleation did not occur. The freezing inhibition brought about by antifreeze proteins is actually to impede the nucleation and the growth of ice by reducing the associated kinetics. Previous studies of the AFPs were mainly focused on the modification of the crystal morphology of ice and the inhibition of ice crystal growth in terms of the adsorption of antifreeze protein molecules on specific surfaces of ice (6Raymond J.A. Devries A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2589-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 7Antson A.A. Smith D.J. Roper D.I. Lewis S. J. Mol.

Sonnichsen F.D. Deluca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Yeh Y. Feeney R.E. Chem.

A. 1989; 86: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that antifreeze proteins lower the freezing point of water merely by adsorbing their residues onto the ice crystal surfaces and thereby inhibiting their growth. Although some reports show the modification of the ice morphology caused by AFPs (7Antson A.A. Smith D.J. Roper D.I. Lewis S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), no study has thus far been carried out to show how AFPs inhibit ice crystallization, in particular ice nucleation. We notice that the neglect of the initial and key stage of ice crystallization, i.e. nucleation, is likely due to the fact that a well defined kinetics measurement is a difficult and challenging task. In this paper, we will present the first study on the effect of AFPs on the nucleation of ice in supercooled water using a newly developed technique, the so-called “double oil layer micro-sized ice crystallization technique” (12Du N. Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This technique allows us to minimize the influence of the wall of the container on the nucleation of micro-sized ice, therefore obtaining reliable and reproducible data on ice nucleation. Because the water is confined in a micro-sized droplet, it is a model system used to mimic the freezing of organisms and ice crystallization in the air, where water is normally distributed in micro or sub-micro sized droplets. Apart from this, our new model on nucleation (13Liu X.Y. Sato K. Furukawa Y. Nakajima K. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar) will be applied to analyze quantitatively the effect of AFP III on ice crystallization. This will be achieved by a quantitative measurement of the change of the free energy barrier associated with different dynamic steps in ice nucleation. Based on these results, we wish to obtain a new and comprehensive understanding on the AFP antifreeze mechanism, in particular that of the effect of AFPs on ice nucleation. We hope that this study will provide fresh physical insight into the phenomenon of AFP antifreeze, which will shed light on the identification of new and effective antifreeze proteins/agents. In most cases, the formation of a new crystalline phase from the ambient phase proceeds via nucleation followed by growth (5Mutaftschiev B. Hurle D.T.J. Handbook of Cryst. Growth la Fundamentals: Thermodynamics and Kinetics. North-Holland, Amsterdam1993: 187-248Google Scholar). This implies that in the case of ice crystallization, nucleation is the initial and one of the most important steps toward creating ice. Without this step, ice will never occur in supercooled water. In the following discussion, we will examine ice nucleation based on the newly developed model (13Liu X.Y. Sato K. Furukawa Y. Nakajima K. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). For ice crystallization, a positive thermodynamic driving force is required, which is defined as shown in Equation 1 (14Zettlemoyer A.C. Nucleation. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar), ΔμkT=μf-μskT=(ΔHm/Tm)ΔTKT(Eq. 1) where μf and μs are the chemical potential of solute molecules in the fluid phase and in the solid phase, respectively; ΔH m denotes the enthalpy of melting per molecule; T m denotes the melting temperature; ΔT is supercooling (ΔT = T m - T, where T is the actual temperature); and k is the Boltzmann constant. The nucleation process can be regarded as a kinetic process for ice nuclei to overcome a kinetics barrier, the so-called nucleation barrier under a given thermodynamic driving force Δμ/kT (14Zettlemoyer A.C. Nucleation. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar). By taking into account the effect of foreign particles on nucleation, the nucleation rate of ice, which is defined as the number of nuclei generated per unit of time-volume, is given according to the model shown in Equations 2–4, J=4παβkink|(Rs)2N0|f''(m)[f(m)]1/2Bexp(-κf(m)/(ΔT)2)(Eq. 2) κ=16πγcf3Ω2/3kTSm2(Eq. 3) B=14πα2ΩγcfkT1/2(Eq. 4) where γcf denotes the specific interfacial free energy between the crystals and the mother phase; Ω is the volume of the growth units; S m is the entropy of melting per molecule; a is the dimension of a growth unit; Rs and N 0 are the radius and the density of foreign bodies, respectively; βkink denotes the kink kinetic coefficient; n 1 indicates the density of growth units in the system; and m is a function of the interfacial free energy difference between the different phases shown in Equation 5, m=(γsf-γsc)/γcf(Eq. 5) where γ is the interfacial free energy; subscripts f, c, and s denote the fluid phase, the cluster of the crystalline phase, and the foreign body, respectively; and Equations 6 and 7 show f(m)=1/4(2-3m+m3)(Eq. 6) f''(m)=1/2(1-m)(Eq. 7) Notice that f(m) (Equation 8) is a factor describing the lowering of the nucleation barrier ΔG * due to the occurrence of foreign bodies (or substrate). f(m)=ΔG*/ΔGhomo*(Eq. 8) In the equations, ΔG * is the actual nucleation barrier, and ΔG *homo is the homogeneous nucleation barrier; m (-1 ≤ m ≤ 1) can be approximately regarded as cosθ (θ is the contact angle between the nucleating phase and the substrate (15Liu X.Y. J. Phys. Chem. 2001; 105: 9949-9955Google Scholar, 16Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2001; 79: 39-41Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). Both f(m) and f ″(m) change from 0 to 1, depending on the correlation and the structure match between the nucleating phase (ice) and the substrate (foreign bodies) (17Liu X.Y. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 7337-7345Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Liu X.Y. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 111: 1628-1635Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When the interaction between the nucleating phase and the substrate is optimal, one has m → 1 and f(m) → 0(cf. Equation 6). On the other hand, if the interaction between the nucleating phase and the substrate is very poor, one has m → -1 and f(m) → 1(cf. Equations 6 and 7), meaning that the substrate exerts almost no influence on nucleation. Under such conditions, the nucleation of ice will become very difficult. As demonstrated by our experiments (see “Results and Discussion” and Table I), we cannot completely eliminate the influence of foreign bodies, such as dust particles, that will in most cases promote ice nucleation. Therefore, in order to inhibit ice nucleation any antifreeze agent should be able to disrupt the interaction between ice nuclei and foreign bodies.Table IThe freezing temperature (for a droplet of constant volume) is dependent on the number and size of dust particlesFilter pore size (nm)20010020Freezing temperature (°C)-53-58-65 Open table in a new tab Apart from surpassing the nucleation barrier, the nucleation of ice is also affected by the incorporation of H2O molecules onto the surface of ice nuclei at the kink sites (cf. Fig. 1a). The rate of kink kinetics is described by βkink. βkink is associated with ΔG kink‡, the energy barrier to be overcome in order to remove other molecules adsorbed at the kink sites (cf. Fig. 1c), and is given by Equation 9, βkinkαexp(-ΔGkink/kT)(Eq. 9) Obviously, the adsorption of additives on the surface of ice, in particular at the kink sites (cf. Fig. 1b), will enhance ΔGkink‡ by Δ(ΔGkink‡)=ΔGkink‡'-ΔGkink‡(cf.Fig.1c,ΔGkink‡' denotes the kink kinetics barrier attributed to the adsorption of impurities/additives on the surface). Consequently, the integration of H2O units into ice crystals will be significantly slowed down or even terminated due to a very low βkink (or high ΔGkink‡) (cf. Equation 9). Notice that one of the most common ways to examine the nucleation kinetics is to measure the induction time t nucl of nucleation at different supercoolings instead of a direct measurement of the nucleation rate (cf. Equation 2) (13Liu X.Y. Sato K. Furukawa Y. Nakajima K. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). However, due to the crystallization sequence, what one then measures is the induction time t i for crystallization, which is defined as the mean time lapse for the appearance of the first crystal in the liquid. Actually, t i includes the nucleation induction time t nucl and the time t g necessarily required for ice crystals to grow from the critical size r c to an observable size. Because the free energy barrier of three-dimensional nucleation is much higher than that of growth, the growth of crystals then becomes in most cases much easier than nucleation. This is exactly the case for ice crystallization; once ice nuclei are formed, the rapid growth rate leads to instant freezing of the whole water droplet in less than 0.5 s. This implies that we have t g << t nucl, and then t i ≈ t nucl. According to the definition of the nucleation rate (Equation 10), one has J=1/(tnuclV)=1/(tiV)(Eq. 10) where V is the volume of the water droplet in the experiment. Combining Equations 2, 9, and 10 yields Equation 11, 1n(tnuclV)=kf(m)/(ΔT)2+ΔGkink‡/kT-1n{f''(m)[f(m)]1/2B'}(Eq. 11) where B′ = 4πa(Rs)2 N 0 CB, which remains constant under a given condition (C is constant). It follows from Equation 11 that for ice nucleation, the plot ln(τV) ∼ 1/(ΔT)2 will give rise to a straight line for a given f(m) (and f ″(m)) (cf. Fig. 3a) (f(m) can be utilized to derive the key parameters associated with the kinetics of ice nucleation. See the discussions in the following sections.). This equation will be applied in the following discussion to analyze the antifreeze effect of AFPs. In our experiments, AFP III (A/F Protein Canada) was used to examine the antifreeze effect. The protein is a compact, angular structure in which the overall fold composes numerous short β-strands and one turn of α-helix. To measure the induction time of ice nucleation, a newly developed experimental technique, the so-called double oil layer micro-sized crystallization technique (12Du N. Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was employed. This technique can minimize the influence of the container and dust particles on ice nucleation and also allows us to examine the effect of antifreeze proteins on ice nucleation kinetics quantitatively. The experiments of micro-sized ice crystallization were performed in a micro-sized water droplet, which was suspended in two layers of immiscible oil in a circular quartz cell (12Du N. Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). First, the lower layer of oil (Silicon Oil AR 1000 from Fluka), which has a larger density than water, was injected into the quartz cell up to one-half of its volume. Second, a drop of pure water or AFP III solution was carefully injected onto the surface of the oil using a microsyringe. Third, an oil (200/500 cS fluid from Dow Corning) with a density smaller than water was injected to fill the cell, which covers the water droplet and the lower oil layer. A glass coverslip was then placed on the top of the cell to avoid evaporation. Due to the density differences, the water droplet is suspended between the two layers of immiscible oils. In order to minimize the effect of dust particles, before the water and oils were injected into the cell, they were filtered twice using 20-nm filters to remove big particles. The water used in the experiments was in a highly pure deionized form (18.2 megohms). The ice crystallization was controlled by a Linkam THMS 600 heating and freezing stage, which is capable of controlling the temperature within 0.1 °C from the range of -192 to +600 °C where the cell was mounted. Nucleation was observed using a polarized transmitted microscope (Olympus, BX60-F) to which a 3CCD color video camera (Panasonic, KY-F55BE) with an S-VHS video recorder (Panasonic AG-MD830) was attached (Fig. 2). Any ice crystal occurring in the drop could immediately be detected by a polarized microscope. Our experiments show that under normal crystallization conditions, it is almost impossible to eliminate the influence of dust particles. This is evidenced by the fact that the freezing temperature (for a constant droplet volume) decreases progressively as the pore size of the filters is decreased progressively from 200 to 100 to 20 nm (cf. Table I). Actually, in most cases, the term “homogenous ice crystallization,” to which most authors refer (19Liu X.Y. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 112: 11550-11558Google Scholar), is a heterogeneous ice nucleation process promoted by dust particles. This implies that the effect of the dust particles on ice crystallization is inevitable and should be taken into account in our discussion. Just as an ice nucleation substrate, foreign bodies always lower the nucleation barrier by a factor f (cf. Equation 8). In the case of nucleation promotion, the adsorption of additives on foreign particles will improve the interaction and/or the structural match between the substrate (foreign particles) and the nucleating phase. This will then result in m → 1 and f → 0. Since for a given nucleation system, κ is constant under a given condition (see Equations 3 and 11), such a change can then be identified from the lowering of the slope and the increase of the intercept of ln(τV) ∼ 1/(ΔT)2 plot(cf. Equation 11). The shift from curve 0 to curve 1 in Fig. 3a illustrates this change. Conversely, if the adsorption of additives leads to a stronger repulsion and an interfacial structure mismatch between the substrate and the nucleating phase, one then has m → -1 and f → 1. This corresponds to an increase in the nucleation barrier (cf. Equation 8). The effect can be identified from the increase in the slope f(m) of ln(τV) ∼ 1/(ΔT)2 and the decrease of the intercept (from line 0 to line 2 in Fig. 3a). Apart from the aforementioned effect, AFP III may also adsorb onto the surface of ice nuclei, which, as shown in Fig. 1, b and c, will enhance ΔGkink‡. According to Equation 11, the variation in the intercept of the ln(τV) ∼ 1/(ΔT)2 plot at a constant f(m) corresponds to the change in ΔGkink‡/kT, as illustrated by Fig. 3b. In our experiments, AFP III was added to deionized water at 0.05 and 0.25% weight. When AFP molecules adsorb on these substrates (foreign particles) (cf. Fig. 5a), the interaction and the structure match between foreign particles and the nucleating phase will be significantly altered. As mentioned before, this adsorption on the substrate (dust particles) and the impact on nucleation can be quantified from the ln(τV) ∼ 1/(ΔT)2 plot. For the above experiments, the plots of deionized water without AFP III and with AFP III are given in Fig. 4. The slopes and intercepts resulting from the linear regression for these systems are listed in Table II. It follows that ice nucleation is inhibited by AFP III (longer induction time) at the two concentrations. The two effects can be quantified by the changing in the slopes and the intercepts compared with the deionized water within the range of supercoolings. For the details of calculating f(m), m, Δ(ΔGkink‡/kT)add, κ, from the slope and the intercept of ln(τV) ∼1/(ΔT)2, see Ref. 13Liu X.Y. Sato K. Furukawa Y. Nakajima K.

The adsorption of AFP III molecules on foreign particles turns out to strongly disturb the structural match between the nucleating ice and the dust particles. This can be identified from the variation of m (or f(m)), which decreases from 0.43 to 0.2 and 0.07 and the enhancement of the nucleation barrier by a factor 1.75 and 2.25, for a 0.05 and 0.25% weight solution, respectively. The results given in Fig. 4 and Table II show that AFP III will also adsorb onto the growing ice nuclei. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, the adsorption will suppress the incorporation of water molecules into the ice nuclei so as to inhibit ice crystallization. This can be seen from the increases in the desolvation kink kinetics barrier ΔGkink‡ (13.7 kT for 0.05% weight solution and 13.9 kT for 0.25% weight solution, cf. Table II). Note that as mentioned previously, in order to change the nucleation kinetics of ice, the AFP molecules should be able to adsorb onto either the surface of dust particles or the surface of ice nuclei as illustrated by Fig. 5, a and b. This implies that in the reported experimental condition, AFP III should be surface-active (13Liu X.Y. Sato K. Furukawa Y. Nakajima K. Advances in Crystal Growth Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2001: 42-61Crossref Google Scholar). Our latest results indicate that similarly to surfactant molecules, AFP molecules will accumulate and self-assemble on the surface of water. This is due to the fact that each AFP III molecule has both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic portions. When these molecules are introduced in the water, the hydrophobic dominant portion of the molecules will avoid water, consequently the molecules will assemble on the surface of water so as to have a portion pointing away from water (cf. Fig. 6). According to the Gibbs equation (see Ref. 20Adamson A.W. Physical Chemistry of Surfaces. 5th ed. John-Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar) (Equation 12), Γadd=-1dγRTd1nαadd(Eq. 12) where R is the gas constant; a add is the activity of AFP in the aqueous solutions, and Γadd is the surface excess of AFP in the chosen dividing surface; the accumulation of AFP III on the surface leads to a lowering of the surface tension γ. This is confirmed by the measurements given in Fig. 6. Note that when the surface is fully occupied (saturated) by AFP III molecules, γ will then reach its minimum. In analogy with surfactants, the further addition of AFP will cause the aggregation of AFP. This has been confirmed by our light scattering experiment and size exclusion chromatography. 2N. Du, X. Y. Liu, and C. L. Hew, unpublished results. Therefore, the lowermost point of the curve in Fig. 6 is defined as the critical aggregation concentration of the AFP. Similarly to other amphiphilic molecules, based on the surface active nature of AFP, we can also expect a self-assembly of AFP on the surface of ice and on the surface of dust particles. The adsorbed AFP III molecules will repel the approaching water molecules, causing a direct impact on ice crystallization (21Liu X.Y. Sawant P.D. Tan W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 15055-15063Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the presence of the AFP III molecules on the surface of the embryos causes also the interfacial free energy γcf between the crystalline phase c and mother phase f to decrease. Based on Equation 3, this change will lower κ and induce nucleation promotion. However, our analysis shows that this promotion effect is not dominant compared with the other two inhibition effects caused by AFP III. In summary, we have quantified here the inhibition effect of AFP III on ice nucleation at two different concentrations. This complex effect is caused by the interaction between AFP III and ice nuclei/crystals, as well as that between AFP III and foreign particles. The adsorption of AFP III on foreign particles will disturb the structural match between the nucleating ice and dust particles, whereas the adsorption on the surface of growing ice will inhibit the integration of water molecules into the ice lattice. These two effects can be identified from the increase of the ice nucleation barrier and the desolvation kinetics barrier. This new understanding of the antifreeze mechanism of AFP has never been examined before and is expected provide us with guidelines in identifying new antifreeze proteins. We are very much indebted to Dr. C. Strom for valuable suggestions and critical reading of the manuscript. We also thank A/F Protein, Inc., for providing us the AFPIII sample. We also greatly appreciate Dr. Shashikant Joshi for valuable discussions and kind assistance for the recycling of AFPIII."

This electron transfer is coupled to transfer of 1 H+/e- across the membrane. It is generally agreed that the complex functions through a Q-cycle mechanism (1Mitchell P. J. Theor.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The coupling to proton transfer depends on a bifurcated reaction at the Qo-site of the complex, in which the two electrons from QH2 are passed to two different chains. The initial acceptor of the first electron from quinol is the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), which feeds electrons via a bound c-type heme (cytochrome (cyt) c 1 in the bc 1 complex) to a mobile electron carrier protein (cyt c) that then reduces a terminal acceptor (cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial chain, an oxidized photochemical reaction center in photosynthetic systems). It is supposed from general principles of quinone chemistry (3Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) that a semiquinone intermediate is formed at the Qo-site, but this has not been detected. The second electron from quinol is passed to a lower potential chain, containing the low (cyt b L) and higher (cyt b H) potential hemes of cyt b, which spans the membrane and delivers electrons to a second quinone processing site on the other side. This is the Qi-site, at which quinone (Q) is reduced to quinol. Because this reaction requires two electrons, the Qo-site has to turn over twice, oxidizing two QH2, releasing 4 H+, and delivering two electrons successively to each chain. The Qi-site functions as a two-electron gate, storing the first electron as a bound semiquinone. The two successive one-electron reactions lead to uptake of two H+ on complete reduction of quinone. For the mitochondrial complex the overall reaction is shown in Equation 1; in α-proteobacteria, cyt c is replaced by cyt c 2.

A modified version of the original Q-cycle (Scheme 1) was proposed to explain apparent anomalies in the pre-steady-state kinetics of the bc 1 complex in chromatophores from the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus (2Crofts A.R.

Although the bacterial systems had provided some of the clearest examples of kinetic effects that were not easily accounted for by earlier Q-cycles (see Ref. 13Bowyer J.R. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 636: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), similar effects were reported in several studies of the pre-steady-state kinetics in mitochondrial complexes, most notably the extensive work from De Vries (14King T.E.

Chem. 1983; 258: 2122-2125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic disparities seemed to be well explained by the modified Q-cycle. The mechanism was highly constrained by the set of reactions, the stoichiometry of components, and by measured physicochemical parameters for rate and equilibrium constants. These constraints allowed discrimination from the many alternative models proposed at the time. In the explication of this mechanism, a critical feature was the recognition that the complex operated as an independent enzyme (21Garland P.B. Clegg R.A. Boxer D. Downie J.A. Haddock B.A. Quagliariello E. Papa S. Palmieri F. Slater E.C. Siliprandi N. Electron Transfer Chains and Oxidative Phosphorylation. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975: 351-358Google Scholar) and that oxidation of two equivalents of QH2 at the Qo-site were necessary for complete turnover of the complex (2Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 21Garland P.B. Clegg R.A. Boxer D. Downie J.A. Haddock B.A. Quagliariello E. Papa S. Palmieri F. Slater E.C. Siliprandi N. Electron Transfer Chains and Oxidative Phosphorylation. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975: 351-358Google Scholar). In the presence of antimycin as an inhibitor at the Qi-site, turnover of the complex was inhibited because electrons could not leave the b-heme chain. Although four oxidizing equivalents, two in each of the chains (ISPox and cyt c 1+, hemes b L and b H), were available to accept electrons from QH2, the two QH2 oxidation reactions had different equilibrium constants, and the low value for the second of these (K eq ∼ 1) effectively limited the antimycin-inhibited complex to oxidation of the first QH2. Furthermore, the first electron entering the oxidized high potential chain was shared between available acceptors, predominantly ISPox and ferricytochrome c 1, with a distribution at pH 7 that favored reduction of ISPox as the higher potential component. This fraction was therefore not seen in the kinetics measured at wavelengths appropriate for cyt c 1 and c 2 (cyt c t). These features appeared to account for the kinetic mismatch between the rates of reduction of cyt c t and b H in the absence or presence of antimycin that had previously seemed contrary to the Q-cycle. Although recent crystallographic structures have confirmed the main features expected from the Q-cycle, there were several unexpected findings. The most dramatic was the evidence for a large domain movement of the ISP to bring the [2Fe-2S] cluster to two distinct reaction sites (22Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K.

At the interface on cytochrome b near the Qo-site (b-interface), the ISP oxidizes quinol, and then moves through ∼25 Å to deliver an electron to cytochrome c 1 (at the c-interface). Mobility of the ISP extrinsic head has been the subject of much recent work, and the results have provided strong evidence that movement is required (Refs. 24Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-S.

The movement implies participation of five catalytic interfaces in turnover, the three sites (Qo, Qi, cyt c 1) expected from the modified Q-cycle model, and two more for the catalytic interfaces at which ISP reacts. The mobile extrinsic head acts as a second substrate at the Qo-site, and this introduces an additional level of complexity to the complications arising from the bifurcated nature of the reaction (24Crofts A.R.

Results from work in Rb. sphaeroides chromatophores had suggested that, apart from the rate-limiting first electron transfer, all reactions associated with movement of the ISP were rapid, that the kinetics of electron transfer from ISPH to cyt c 1 occurred with t ½ ≤ 10 μs, and that all these reactions had relatively low activation barriers (32Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The rapid electron transfer rates between ISP and c 1 have recently been confirmed by experiments using direct photoactivation of cyt c 1 oxidation through ruthenium complexes (34Sadoski R.C. Engstrom G. Tian H. Zhang L. Yu C. Yu L. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Engstrom G. Xiao K. Yu C.-A. Yu L. Durham B. Millett F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31072-31078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite these indications of a rapid movement, other groups have suggested that movement of the ISP extrinsic head itself might be limiting in transfer of the first electron to cyt c 1 and in the overall reaction. Several different scenarios have been discussed, in all of which rate limitation is suggested to occur at a step other than the first electron transfer reaction itself. In the simplest of these schemes, the kinetic disparity between rates of reduction of cyt c 1 and b H seen in mitochondrial complexes has been taken as evidence for a kinetic impediment at the level of ISP movement (36Hansen K.C. Schultz B.E. Wang G. Chan S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Schultz B.E. Chan S.I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Several groups have espoused more complex schemes involving “conformational gating” of electron transfer between the Qo-site and cyt c 1 through a conformational coupling; the reduced ISP is held in position close to cyt b until released by conformational changes linked to electron transfer events elsewhere in the complex. These events have been variously suggested to be the electron transfer from a semiquinone-ISPred complex to heme b L (39Link T.

In several of these, marked asymmetries between the two halves of the dimeric complex have been observed (43Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K.

In this paper we present evidence to show that in the native bc 1 complex assayed in situ in chromatophore membranes from Rb. sphaeroides the movement of the ISP is not limiting, and that the kinetic disparities can be accounted for entirely in terms of the postulates of the modified Q-cycle. We suggest that, with suitable modification of physicochemical parameters, the same explanations can account for the apparent kinetic anomalies observed in mitochondrial complexes. Growth of Cells and Isolation of Chromatophores—Cells of the wild type Rh. sphaeroides Ga were grown photosynthetically at 30 °C in Sistrom's medium, and chromatophores were prepared by conventional methods (13Bowyer J.R. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 636: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells of the pC2P404.1 strain (native cyt c 2 superproducer) of Rb. sphaeroides Ga (46Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown photosynthetically at 30 °C in Sistrom's medium in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline using red filters to minimize antibiotic photooxidation. The cyt c 2 superproducer strain was used in some experiments to minimize delays in transfer of an oxidizing equivalent from RC to the bc 1 complex because of recycling of cyt c 2. Spectrophotometric Determination of Redox Changes of Cytochromes, Photoactive Pigment, and Electrochromic Shift of Carotenoids—Kinetics of cytochromes and the electrochromic carotenoid bandshift were measured with two similar single beam kinetic spectrophotometers of local design. Light pulses were provided by xenon flash (∼5 μs halfduration), or in rapid kinetic mode, by a frequency tripled (λ, 355 nm), Q-switched (FWHM, 10 ns) Nd YAG laser (Surelite II, Continuum) at a flash energy of 160 mJ fed into an optical parametric oscillator tuned to 800 nm (output flash energy 12 mJ). Fast, flash-induced cytochrome c 2 oxidation kinetics were measured with a cooled large area (5 mm in diameter) avalanche photo diode from Advanced Photonix (Camarillo, CA). The ambient redox potential in the cuvette was adjusted by adding small amounts of K3Fe(CN)6 or Na2S2O4, and the suspension was kept anaerobic by a constant flow of argon gas above the sample. The redox changes of cyt c 1 plus cyt c 2 (=c t) were measured at 551–542 nm (ϵmm ∼20 mm-1 cm-1, Refs. 47Bowyer J.R. Meinhardt S.W. Tierney G.V. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 48Meinhardt S.W. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 223-227Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b H reduction was measured at 561–569 nm (ϵmm ∼ 20 mm-1 cm-1, Ref. 2Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) in the presence of antimycin. The RC concentration was estimated at 542 nm (ϵmm ∼10 mm-1 cm-1, Refs. 47Bowyer J.R. Meinhardt S.W.

Acta. 1975; 387: 536-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To minimize interference from overlapping absorbance changes, we also determined the kinetics of cytochromes from kinetics traces measured at 2–4 nm steps over the wavelength range from 540 to 575 nm, using published spectra for c 2, c 1, P870, b L, and b H resolved by redox titration or kinetic deconvolution (51Meinhardt, S. W. (1984) Electron Transfer Reactions of the Ubiquinol:Cytochrome c 2 Oxidoreductase of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignGoogle Scholar). Reagents—Antimycin A, myxothiazol, stigmatellin, N-methylphenazonium methosulfate, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, and MOPS were obtained from Sigma. Inhibitors were dissolved in ethanol and stored at -20 °C. Physicochemical Parameters Pertinent to the System—The experimental systems used for measurement of the pre-steady-state kinetics in chromatophores and mitochondrial complexes are similar. To bring out this similarity, Fig. 1 shows typical kinetics for the absorbance changes of cytochromes measured in chromatophores. Experiments were performed in the absence (left) or presence (right) of antimycin. The extinction coefficients for cyt c t (551–542 nm) and cyt b H (561–569 nm) are similar (ϵmmM = 20 ± 1 mm-1 cm-1) at these wavelength pairs. At the ambient redox potential of the experiment (E h ∼ 100 mV) the reduction of cyt b H seen after a saturating flash in the presence of antimycin represents ∼90% of the total accessible bc 1 complex. At E h = 100 mV, the quinone pool is ∼30% reduced, and the rate of QH2 oxidation at the Qo-site is close to maximal. A saturating flash of ∼5 μs initiated electron transfer. Because the RC is in 2-fold excess, two oxidizing equivalents are available to the bc 1 complex, and reach the Qo-site through sequential oxidation of the components of the high potential chain, cyt c 2, then cyt c 1 (see Fig. 2 for the resolved kinetics), and then ISP. After oxidation of the high potential chain, the state of the bc 1 complex is formally similar to that in experimental protocols used with mitochondrial systems, where QH2 is added to the oxidized complex by stopped-flow mixing (see, Refs. 15De Vries S. Albracht S.P. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16De Vries S. Albracht S.P. Berden J.A. Marres C.A. Slater E.C. Biochim.

Acta. 2000; 1456: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Fig. 2The kinetics of flash-induced changes of cyt c 1 and c 2 in Rb. sphaeroides chromatophores (pC2P404.1 strain). The kinetics of cyt c 1 and c 2 were obtained by deconvolution of absorbance changes measured over the wavelength range from 540 to 560 nm. Chromatophores were suspended in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, with 50 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 10 μm valinomycin, 10 μm nigericin, and 0.5 mm sodium ascorbate. Traces shown are the average of 32, with 10 s between measurements. Time constant for measurements was 1.7 μs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The traces of Fig. 1 show the kinetic effects that had seemed contrary to earlier Q-cycle models. 1) In the absence of inhibitor, cyt c2 and c 1, measured together as cyt c t, are rapidly oxidized after photoactivation, and then re-reduced, with τ ∼1.5 ms. 2) Under these conditions, cyt b H undergoes a small transient reduction, indicating that the rate of oxidation is more rapid than the rate of reduction. 3) In the presence of antimycin, cyt b H becomes reduced (after a well defined lag of ∼120 μs) with τ ∼0.5 ms, and remains reduced. 4) Under these conditions, about 70% of the extent of re-reduction of cyt c t is inhibited. The remaining 30% is reduced with τ ∼ 0.83 ms, and the inhibited portion much more slowly. 5) In a simple Q-cycle model, cyt b H and c 1 are, in the presence of antimycin, the terminal acceptors in their respective chains. From a naive perspective, it might be expected that electrons from the bifurcated reaction would appear with equal stoichiometry, and equal rate at the two centers. This is clearly not the case. 6) The rate of reduction of heme b H in the presence of antimycin shows the minimal rate of QH2 oxidation. If the site operates at the same rate in the absence of antimycin, electrons must be reaching the high potential chain at that rate. However, the kinetics of reduction of cyt c t are clearly about 3-fold slower than this. Essentially the same characteristics were seen in the pre-steady-state kinetics of the isolated mitochondrial complex reported from several labs using stopped-flow (14King T.E. Yu C.-A. Yu L.

One of the initial approaches to study a novel gene product is the identification of its interacting partners. As increasingly more proteins become functionally characterized it is more and more probable that the identification of interacting partners of a novel protein will suggest a possible function for this protein by associative reasoning and, thus, provide a framework for its characterization. Using this approach, a novel CIN85/CMS adaptor protein family was functionally implicated in a remarkably wide spectrum of different cellular processes such as the down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases and endocytosis (through the association of CIN85 with Cbl/Cbl-b and endophilins) (1Soubeyran P.

However, the mapping of CIN85/CMS SH3 domains binding sites within the characterized CIN85/CMS interactors has remained an elusive goal, giving rise to discordant conclusions in the literature. The absence of information on the recognition properties of CIN85 SH3 domains hampers the further characterization of its interactions and the understanding of the biological role of this protein, which has emerged as a highly connected node linking functionally diverse protein interaction sub-networks. Intriguingly, it has been suggested that CIN85/CMS may have unique function(s) in higher eukaryotes, as CIN85 orthologues of the human and rat proteins were not found in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, or yeast (8Dikic I.

These are three consecutive SH3 domains at the N terminus followed by a central proline-rich region and a coiled-coil domain situated at the C terminus (Fig. 1). CIN85 was shown to homodimerize through its coiled-coil domains, and a number of proteins interacting with the CIN85 proline-rich region were identified including Grb2, p130Cas, endophilins, p85-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and cortactin (1Soubeyran P.

Structural and mutagenesis studies revealed that upon binding, peptide ligands adopt a poly-proline type II helix conformation with the conserved prolines facing the interaction interface.

Bredesen D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2002; 19: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The analysis of the peptides selected by individual SH3 domains of CIN85 revealed a minimal recognition consensus shared by these domains, PX(P/A)XXR. This is an unusual binding motif for SH3 domains that has not been reported before. The critical requirement for proline and arginine residues flanking the consensus was confirmed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the isolated peptide ligands. The newly defined recognition consensus allowed the accurate mapping of CIN85 SH3 binding sites within its reported interacting partners as well as the prediction of novel putative interactors from protein databases. Putative SH3 domain-dependent interactions of CIN85 with synaptojanin 1, PAK2, ZO-2, and TAFII70 were predicted by homology searches with the CIN85 SH3 recognition consensus and confirmed in GST pull-down and Far Western blotting experiments performed with individual CIN85 SH3 domains. The work presented here clarifies the potential confusion in the literature regarding recognition properties of CIN85/SETA/Ruk SH3 domains and places a biochemical foundation for the rapid characterization of the CIN85 protein interaction sub-network.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTAIS—A detailed description of the TAIS method is given in Kurakin and Bredesen (27Kurakin A. Bredesen D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2002; 19: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The TAIS flowchart and protocols can be found on the Internet (www.buckinstitute.org/TAIS). In brief, 30 μg of a GST-SH3 domain fusion immobilized on Sepharose beads were blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with a random peptide library aliquot (∼108–109 plaque-forming units). After 90 min of incubation at room temperature (RT) the beads were thoroughly washed with TBS-T, and bound phages were eluted with 200 μl of 1% SDS for 15 min at RT. After elution, the phages were immediately mixed with a molten 6% top agarose containing host cells and plated onto two pre-warmed 150-mm agar plates. When phage plaques became visible, the plates were cooled down for 30 min at 4 °C and overlaid with 132-mm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for 5 min. After plaque lift, the membranes were blocked in 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at RT and incubated overnight in 25 ml of TBS-T on a rocker at 4 °C with 10 μg of the same SH3 domain that had been cleaved from the GST moiety, biotinylated, and complexed with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase at a ratio of 4:1. After extensive washing with TBS-T, positive plaques were developed on the membranes with insoluble alkaline phosphatase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Individual positive plaques were identified on the plates, and phages from these plaques were propagated separately in the appropriate host for production of phage DNA. T7 phage DNA was prepared for sequencing with the λ DNA Wizard kit from Promega. M13 single-stranded DNA was prepared with QIAprep Spin M13 kit (Qiagen).Libraries—Two random peptide libraries, X12 and X16, were used in the experiments described. The 12-mer peptide library displayed on M13 phage was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Kay, Argonne National Laboratory. The 16-mer random peptide library displayed on T7 phage was prepared using the Novagen library construction kit and the protocols provided by the supplier (NOVAGEN, T7Select System Manual TB178 on-line at http://www.novagen.com/TechResources). In brief, a degenerate oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGTGCGAATTCT[NN(G/T)]16TAGCCCTAAGCTTGCTGCC-3′ was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies), converted into double-stranded oligonucleotide by primer extension with Pfu polymerase and a 5′-GGCAGCAAGCTTAGGGCTA-3′ primer, digested with EcoRI and HindIII endonucleases, gel-purified, and ligated with the T7Select EcoRI/HindIII Vector Arms provided in the T7 library construction kit. The ligation product was packaged into T7 phage particles using the packaging extract provided in the kit according to the supplier's instructions, and the resulting phage library was subjected to a one-time liquid phase amplification in BLT5615 cells (Novagen) to produce phages displaying random peptides on their surface. The complexity of the library was estimated to be 107 primary recombinants.Phage ELISA—Streptavidin-coated microtiter ELISA plates (COSTAR) were prepared by passive immobilization of 1 μg of streptavidin per well in 200 μl of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C. After streptavidin coating, plates were blocked by adding 150 μl of 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at RT. After 5 washes with TBS-T, 0.5 μg of the biotinylated target protein (SH3 domains of CIN85 or WW domain of YAP (Yes-associated protein) as negative control) in 200 μl of TBS-T was added to streptavidin-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at RT. After incubation, the wells with immobilized target protein were washed 5 times with TBS-T. After the last wash 100 μl of TBS-T were left in each well. 100 μl of freshly prepared individual phage lysate was added to the ELISA plate wells and incubated for 1 h at RT. After incubation, unbound phages were washed away with TBS-T, and the amount of retained phages was determined with phage-specific antibodies. Monoclonal anti-M13 antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used for detection of M13 phages. Rabbit polyclonal anti-T7 antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. F. William Studier, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection of anti-T7 antibodies. ELISA readings were taken on a SpectraMAX190 plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. To ensure reproducibility, all phage ELISA experiments presented were repeated at least three times for triplicate samples each time.Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis—The CIN85 SH3-2 domain peptide ligand WSDPRPLPRTILS and the CIN85 SH3-3 peptide ligand TTGPVPAVRSSLS were selected by the respective SH3 domains in a TAIS experiment from the X12 peptide library displayed on M13 phage. The last S of the peptides, shown in italics, denotes a serine residue originating from the cloning site in the M13 display vector. This last residue was included in the alanine mutagenesis studies because it could potentially contribute to the interaction. Each amino acid in the indicated peptide ligands was successively substituted by an alanine residue, and the mutagenized peptides were displayed on the M13 surface. To display a particular alanine-substituted peptide sequence, a couple of complementary oligonucleotides coding for the alanine-substituted peptide were chemically synthesized, annealed, and ligated into the XbaI/XhoI-linearized M13 pIII display vector (29Sparks A.B.

The only peptide ligand of CIN85 SH3-1 domain that was successfully displayed in the M13 format was SRVTVPVPAKRPPFS (see “Results”). Two alanine-substituted mutants of this sequence were generated as described above to test the critical requirements of the invariable proline and arginine residues of the CIN85 SH3 recognition core for binding to CIN85 SH3-1 domain, SRVTVAVPAKRPPFS and SRVTVPVPAKAPPFS. All constructs were verified by sequencing.GST Pull Downs—Mouse brain extracts were prepared by homogenization of one-half of a brain from adult mouse in 2 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, tablets). After homogenization on ice, insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Thirty μg of individual SH3-GST fusions immobilized on Sepharose beads were placed in separate 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, blocked in 1% BSA in TBS buffer for 1 h, washed 5 times with 1 ml of TBS-T, and mixed with 800 μg of protein from mouse brain extract in 1.3 ml of TBS-T in the presence of protease inhibitors. The mixture was tumbled for 2 h at RT. Thirty μg of GST on beads was used as a negative control. After incubation, beads were washed 6 times with 1 ml of TBS-T, and the retained proteins were eluted into loading buffer at 70 °C for 10 min. Precipitated protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE (pre-cast 4–12% Bis-Tris gel/MOPS buffer, Novex), blotted to a PVDF membrane, blocked in 1% BSA, and developed with specific antibodies. Eighty μg of total mouse brain protein was used as input. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences), and BioMax film (Kodak) were used for protein visualization. Goat polyclonal antibodies for PAK2 and ZO-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse anti-TAFII70 and anti-synaptojanin 1 antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences.Far Western Analysis—Nineteen mg of total mouse brain protein in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) complemented with protease inhibitors were incubated with 8 μg of anti-PAK2 antibodies or 19 μg of anti-synaptojanin 1 antibodies for 90 min at 4 °C. After incubation, 30 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were added to the samples for an additional 60 min while tumbling at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed 6 times with lysis buffer and eluted into 160 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Twenty-five μl of the eluate per lane of gel were used to resolve immunoprecipitated protein complexes. After SDS-PAGE (precast 4–12% Bis-Tris gel/MOPS buffer, Novex), proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, blocked with 1% BSA in TBS-T, and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker with 13 μg of each individual biotinylated CIN85 SH3 domain conjugated to streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase at 4:1 ratio in 20 ml of TBS-T. The biotinylated WW domain of Yes-associated protein (YAP) complexed to streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was used as a negative control. After overnight incubation, the PVDF membranes were thoroughly washed with TBS-T and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma).RESULTSTAIS of CIN85 SH3 Domains—We recently described a novel screening method for phage-displayed cDNA and peptide libraries, target-assisted iterative screening (TAIS) (27Kurakin A. Bredesen D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2002; 19: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TAIS sequentially utilizes phage display and expression library screening formats. Briefly, in a first, pre-selection step a protein target is immobilized on a solid support such as Sepharose beads and incubated with a phage-displayed peptide library in solution. This step aims to retain phages displaying on their surfaces interacting partners of the target on the solid support. After washing, the retained phages are eluted and plated on a bacterial lawn. In the second step, the pre-selected peptide library plaques are transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by blotting the bacterial lawn with the membrane. The protein target tagged with a reporter such as alkaline phosphatase is used then as a one-step detection reagent to screen for interacting plaques on the membrane. The identities of the displayed peptides that interact with the target are deduced by sequencing of the corresponding DNA inserts of the phages from individual positive plaques. Omitting a competition between phages altogether, TAIS eliminates a loss of weaker binders and propagation biases inherent to classical phage display panning as a result of competition between individual phages during repetitive selection-amplification cycles.Two random peptide libraries, X12 and X16, displayed respectively on M13 and T7 phages, were screened by TAIS. Each one of the three CIN85 SH3 domains was used as a target in separate screening experiments. DNA inserts of the phages randomly picked up from individual positive plaques were sequenced to infer identities of the displayed peptides that bound each CIN85 SH3 domain. Specific binders were readily identified for SH3-2 and SH3-3 domains from both libraries (Fig. 1). However, the SH3-1 domain failed to select peptides from the M13 library. The application of a classical panning procedure to the same target was equally unsuccessful, suggesting problems other than idiosyncrasies of a particular screening methodology. An incompatibility of the M13 display format, which requires the efficient secretion of displayed peptides, with the amino acid sequences of the peptides preferred by SH3-1 domain might be a possible explanation of the failure. Indeed, attempts to display SH3-1 binders on the M13 phage were unsuccessful for 7 of 8 different peptides that were selected from the T7 library (not shown). This fact is indicative of the limitations of the phage display format that relies on bacterial secretion and may explain failures to select peptides from filamentous phage display libraries for occasional targets.Analysis of Recognition Properties of CIN85 SH3 Domains— Sequences of peptides selected by individual SH3 domains and their deduced recognition consensuses are shown in Fig. 1. The following distinct features characterize these peptide sequences: 1) The XPXXPX motif is present only in 2 of a total of 28 different peptides selected by CIN85 SH3 domains despite a relatively high proline content of the peptides averaged at 17% or 2.6 proline residues per sequence; 2) All of the 28 selected peptides feature a PX(P/A)XXR motif, whose length fits well the core SH3 domain footprint such as PXXPXR of Src or PXXPXK of Crk SH3 domains as examples (27Kurakin A. Bredesen D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2002; 19: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); 3) The amino acid composition of the selected peptides is significantly biased toward positive residues and proline, whereas negatively charged residues are underrepresented.The minimal recognition motif present in all selected peptides can be readily inferred as PX(P/A)XXR and appears to be shared by all three CIN85 SH3 domains (Fig. 1). There are slight but noticeable variations in the amino acids that are tolerated in X positions within and around this core between the three different SH3 domains, suggesting overlapping but not identical specificities of the domains. As an example, the position preceding arginine of the core is occupied exclusively by proline or valine in the peptides selected by the SH3-3 domain but tolerates charged and polar residues in the case of SH3-1 and SH3-2 domains, respectively. The hypothesis of overlapping but distinct specificities of CIN85 SH3 domains is supported by two sets of experimental data. First, the analysis of cross-reactivity of individual SH3 domains toward peptides selected by the other two domains clearly indicates that although CIN85 SH3 domains largely cross-react, there are unique peptide sequences that bind to some of the domains but only weakly or not at all to others (Fig. 2). In cross-reactivity experiments the SH3-2 domain displayed the largest degree of promiscuity, and the SH3-3 was the least cross-reacting. Second, alanine-scanning mutagenesis performed on the two peptide ligands for SH3-2 and SH3-3 domains indicates that alanine substitution of residues other than the conserved proline and arginine of the recognition core can drastically affect the binding of the mutated peptides, indicating the existence of additional specificity determinants that may be potentially unique for individual domains (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Cross-reactivity of CIN85 SH3 domains. Eight peptide ligands selected by individual CIN85 SH3 domains from a random 16-mer peptide library were assayed in phage end point ELISA experiments for binding to their cognate CIN85 SH3 domain as well as to the other two SH3 domains of CIN85 as indicated. White bars correspond to a negative control. The y axis on the histograms indicates A values at 405 nm. The experiments were repeated three times in triplicate. Error bars correspond to the S.D. of the mean for each triplicate and indicate well-to-well variations of the ELISA signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of peptide ligands of SH3-2 and SH3-3 domains of CIN85. Alanine substitution of either proline or arginine flanking CIN85 SH3 recognition consensus P X(P/A)XX R abolished binding of the peptide ligands to their cognate SH3 domains (see peptides 6 and 11 on both panels), confirming the recognition consensus of SETA SH3 domains defined by TAIS. Additional positions of the peptide ligands were sensitive to alanine substitution (positions 10 and 12 for the SH3-2 ligand and positions 13 and 14 for the SH3-3 ligand), indicating the existence of additional specificity determinants outside and/or within the PX(P/A)XXR core. These additional specificity determinants may be responsible for the unique ligand preferences displayed by individual domains (Fig. 2 and “Results”). Alanine substitution of the proline or arginine residues flanking the minimal CIN85 recognition consensus abolished binding of an SH3-1 ligand to its cognate domain as well, indicating the critical role of these residues for binding to all three CIN85 SH3 domains (not shown).

To identify substrates of MAPKAPK2 that mediate these responses, a proteomic approach was used in which in vitro phosphorylation of neutrophil lysates by exogenously added active recombinant MAPKAPK2 was followed by protein separation using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Peptide mass fingerprinting of peptides defined by MALDI-MS was then utilized to identify phosphorylated proteins detected by autoradiography. Six candidate substrates were identified, including the p16 subunit of the seven-member Arp2/3 complex (p16-Arc). In vitro studies confirmed that MAPKAPK2 interacts with and phosphorylates the A isoform, but not the B isoform, of p16-Arc with a stoichiometry of 0.6 to 0.7. MAPKAPK2 also phosphorylated p16-Arc in intact Arp2/3 complexes precipitated from neutrophil lysates. Mutation of serine-77 to alanine on the A isoform prevented phosphorylation by MAPKAPK2. The ability of MAPKAPK2 to phosphorylate one isoform of p16-Arc suggests a possible mechanism by which the p38 MAPK cascade regulates remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPKAPK2 also phosphorylated p16-Arc in intact Arp2/3 complexes precipitated from neutrophil lysates. Mutation of serine-77 to alanine on the A isoform prevented phosphorylation by MAPKAPK2. The ability of MAPKAPK2 to phosphorylate one isoform of p16-Arc suggests a possible mechanism by which the p38 MAPK cascade regulates remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

One of the cascades, p38 MAPK, is activated in human neutrophils by numerous pro-inflammatory stimuli, including chemoattractants, chemokines, bacterial phagocytosis, Fcγ receptor cross-linking, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (3Widmann C.

The molecular pathways leading from p38 MAPK to various functional responses in neutrophils have not been fully defined. Of the possible targets for p38 MAPK phosphorylation, only the serine-threonine kinase, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2), has been identified in neutrophils (26Hannigan M. Zhan L. Ai Y. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Huang C.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3953-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Zu et al. (27Zu Y.L. Gilchrist A. Ai Y. Labadia M.E. Sha'afi R.I. Huang C.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 5287-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that a peptide inhibitor of MAPKAPK2 attenuated neutrophil respiratory burst activity stimulated by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine. Using the same peptide, we showed MAPKAPK2 also participated in exocytosis and chemotaxis (28Coxon, P. Y., Rane, M. J., Uriarte, S., Powell, D. W., Singh, S., Chen, Q., and McLeish, K. R. (2003) Cell. Signal., in pressGoogle Scholar). Hannigan et al. (26Hannigan M. Zhan L. Ai Y. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Huang C.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3953-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) recently reported that neutrophils from MAPKAPK2–/–mice demonstrated impaired directional migration, whereas adherence was normal. Thus, MAPKAPK2 appears to be a critical downstream kinase for a number of p38 MAPK-dependent neutrophil functions. Previously identified targets of MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation in neutrophils include two actin-binding proteins, heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 and leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1), Akt, and 5-lipooxygenase (29Nahas N. Molski T. Fernandez G. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Huang C.K. Zhan L. Ai Y. Jongstra J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3517-3523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The functional significance of MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation of Hsp27 and 5-lipooxygenase has not been determined, whereas LSP1 participates in neutrophil chemotaxis (33Jongstra-Bilen J. Misener V.L. Wang C. Ginzberg H. Auerbach H. Joyner A.L. Downey G.P. Jongstra J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1827-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the signal transduction pathways that control p38 MAPK-mediated functional responses in neutrophils, a more complete list of MAPKAPK2 substrates is required. To identify MAPKAPK2 substrates, we developed a proteomic approach using a combination of in vitro phosphorylation of neutrophil lysate by exogenous active recombinant MAPKAPK2, protein separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and phosphoprotein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDIMS). Approximately 30 proteins were phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2, as determined by autoradiography of two-dimensional gels. Initial studies identified six proteins as potential substrates, including the known substrate LSP1. One of the previously unknown substrates identified was p16-Arc, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex. The Arp2/3 complex regulates actin polymerization and cross-linking, and this complex is necessary for neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis (34Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 35Weiner O.D. Servant G. Welch M.D. Mitchison T.J. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 36May R.C. Caron E. Hall A. Machesky L.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of p16-Arc have recently been described, both of which are expressed in humans neutrophils (37Millard T.M. Beherendt B. Launay S. Futterer K. Machesky L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To confirm that p16-Arc is a true substrate of MAPKAPK2, we characterized the ability of MAPKAPK2 to interact with and phosphorylate each of the two p16-Arc isoforms, p16-A and p16-B. Our results indicate that MAPKAPK2 interacts with and phosphorylates p16-A, whereas p16-B is relatively resistant to MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation. Materials—The constructs for pGEX-5X-2-p16A and B as well as pGEX-5X-2-WA and W (SCAR) were described previously (38Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MAPKAPK2 fusion protein was accomplished by constructing a pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) expression plasmid with the human cDNA for MAPKAPK2 (obtained from Dr. Matthias Gaestel, Martin Luther University, Halle-Wittenberg, Germany) downstream of GST. Recombinant His-p16A and His-p16B were expressed by cloning a BamHI/EcoRI insert from pGEX-5X-2p16A and B into pRSETA (Invitrogen). [S35]Methionine-labeled p16-A and p16-B were expressed with the TNT Quick Master expression kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Ser-77 on pRSET-p16A was mutated to alanine with Clontech transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit using 5′-CCGGGCAGGCGCCATTGTCTTG-3′ as the mutation primer and 5′-GGAATTCGAACCTTGATCCGG-3′ as the selection primer. The appropriate mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. His-tagged p16-A S77A was bacterially expressed and isolated by nickel chromatography. Neutrophil Isolation—Neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors using plasma-Percoll gradients as described by Haslett et al. (39Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B.J. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, neutrophils were suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at the desired concentration. The study was approved by the University of Louisville Human Studies Committee. Neutrophil Lysate Preparation for MAPKAPK2 Substrate Identification—Neutrophils (1 × 108) were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer containing 2 m thiourea, 7 m urea, 65 mm CHAPS, 58 mm dithiothreitol, and 4.5% ampholytes (pI 3–10) (final pH = 6.4). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 15 °C. Before the addition of exogenous MAPKAPK2, urea concentration of lysates was reduced to 1 m by size exclusion chromatography. One ml spin-out columns (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) were equilibrated in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2,2,mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO3, 65 mm CHAPS) containing 4 m or 1 m urea. Neutrophil lysate (400 μl) was loaded on the column equilibrated with the buffer containing 4 m urea and centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min. The procedure was repeated with buffer containing 1 m urea. The lysate was stored at –20 °C. MAPKAPK2 Substrate Identification—Neutrophil lysates (400 μg of total protein) were incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) in the presence and absence of 400 ng of active recombinant MAPKAPK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 30 °C for 3 h. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 2% ampholytes 3–10, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) to give a total volume of 450 μl. Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing with pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips and by size with 10% Duracyl™ (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). IPG strips were rehydrated in buffer containing 400 μg of protein and focused isoelectrically at 5000 V max and 80 mA/gel for 100,000 V-h. After isoelectric focusing, IPG strips were sequentially incubated for 10 min in equilibration buffers I (6 m urea, 2% dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol) and II (6 m urea, 2.5% iodoacetamide, 30% glycerol). IPG strips were then applied to 10% Duracryl gels, and proteins were separated using a Tricine buffer system (upper reservoir buffer: 0.1 m Tricine, 0.1 m Tris, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.5; lower buffer: 0.2 m Tris-acetate, pH 8.9) at 500 V for 4–5 h. Gels were silver-stained, and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Trypsin Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—To obtain peptides for mass spectrometry analysis, protein spots were excised and digested with trypsin by modification of the method of Jensen et al. (40Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). The excised gel pieces were incubated for 15 min in 100 mm NH4HCO3 and 50% acetonitrile and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Proteins were then reduced by incubation with 20 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 45 min followed by alkylation with 65 mm iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Post-alkylation gel pieces were incubated for 15 min in 100 mm NH4HCO3 and 50% acetonitrile and dried by vacuum centrifugation, and then proteins were hydrolyzed by incubation in 20 ng/ml modified trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. Trypsin-generated peptides were applied by a thin film-spotting procedure for MALDI-MS analysis using α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix on stainless steel targets, as described by Jensen et al. (40Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectral data were obtained using a Tof-Spec 2E (Micromass) and a 337-nm N2 laser at 20–35% power in the reflector mode. Spectral data were obtained by averaging 10 spectra, each of which was the composite of 10 laser firings. Mass axis calibrations were accomplished using peaks from tryptic auto-hydrolysis. Peptide masses obtained by MALDI-MS analysis were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base (NCBI, www.matrixscience.com) to identify the intact proteins. A MOWSE score >71 indicated a significant match, ensuring the probability of the match not being a random event. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Phosphorylation of recombinant p16-A and p16-B by MAPKAPK2 was examined by incubation of active recombinant MAPKAPK2 (40 ng) with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 μg of recombinant protein in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm NaVO3, pH 7.2. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After the incubation, reactions were terminated with Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer, proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. To determine the time course of Hsp27 and p16-A phosphorylation, 400 ng of recombinant active MAPKAPK2 were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant Hsp27 or p16-A and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for times ranging from 30 min to 4 h. Optimal phosphorylation of both substrates was seen between 2 and 3 h. To determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation, 400 ng of recombinant active MAPKAPK2 were incubated with 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 μg of Hsp27 or 0.5, 1, and 2 μg of p16-A, 2 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 pmol of ATP in 200 μl of kinase buffer at 30 °C for 3 h. To separate free ATP from radiolabeled proteins, the reaction mixture was applied to a prewashed Spin-out 6000 Micro column (Chemicon International, Inc.) and collected into 200 μl of kinase buffer. Separate reaction mixtures containing 200 pmol of ATP and 2 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in 200 μl of kinase buffer were used to determine the specific activity of ATP in each reaction. Fifty μl of each sample was counted by scintillation spectrometry, and the molar ratio of phosphorylation was calculated. GST Pull Down—Neutrophil lysates were prepared by suspending 5 × 107 cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm NaVO3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. GST, GST-p16A, or GST-p16B glutathione-coupled Sepharose were incubated with neutrophil lysate (400 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with 6× Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for MAPKAPK2 using a polyclonal anti-MAPKAPK2 antibody (Sigma). GST pull downs of recombinant proteins were carried out by incubating GST or GST-MAPKAPK2 glutathione-coupled Sepharose with recombinant 35S-labeled p16-A or 35S-labeled p16-B in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO3, and 10% glycerol for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed 4 times with kinase buffer, proteins were eluted with Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the [S35]methionine-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. In separate experiments, the Arp2/3 complex was precipitated from neutrophil extract as previously described (38Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysate was subjected to pull-down by GST or GST fused to the C-terminal region (WA) of the Scar1 protein that interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. GST fused to a truncated portion of the WA protein, termed GST-W, was utilized as a negative control. One aliquot of each precipitate was eluted with Laemmli buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subsequently immunoblotted for Arp3 using a polyclonal anti-Arp3 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA). A second aliquot was suspended in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm NaVO3) in the presence and absence of 40 ng of active recombinant MAPKAPK2 and [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation, reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample dilution buffer, proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Structural Modeling—The starting models were based on the p16-Arc protein in the Arp2/3 x-ray crystal structure (41Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.-B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The A isoform of p16-Arc was generated by homology modeling with p16-Arc in the crystal structure using Modeler (42Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10635) Google Scholar) and an alignment generated with ClustalW (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar). The S77A-mutated p16-Arc was created by replacing the Ser-77 with Ala in a standard conformation. The simulations to determine the effect of the S77A mutation on p16-Arc core structure included the central core of p16-Arc (residues 35–151) but did not include the first 34 residues that interact with Arp2 and p41-Arc, as this region of p16-Arc is dynamic, and the structure is stabilized by interaction partners that were not included in the calculations. Models were hydrated in a 10+ box of TIP3P waters using standard AMBER (44Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11639) Google Scholar) (amber.scripps.edu) rules; Cl– counterions were placed randomly for charge neutrality. Box sizes were adjusted to include 7060 waters for each model. Simulations were performed in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (300 K, 1 atm) with the AMBER 7.0 program (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) and parameters from parm96.dat using periodic boundary conditions and the PME algorithm. Molecular dynamics simulations used the message passing interface version of the Sander routine (1.5-fs time step) with SHAKE to freeze all bonds involving hydrogen. Initial equilibrium for 155 ps following the general protocol (44Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11639) Google Scholar) were performed with gradual removal of positional restraints on the protein complex. The production runs were 4.0 ns in length, and average structures for each complex (taken from 50 snapshots accumulated in the last 50 ps) were obtained and subsequently minimized. The calculations were run on a 32 processor SGI Origin 2000. Identification of MAPKAPK2 Substrates—MAPKAPK2 substrate screening was performed by incubating human neutrophil lysates with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence and absence of active recombinant MAPKAPK2. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, gels were stained, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were compared with silver-stained gels to identify the proteins that were MAPKAPK2 substrates (Fig. 1). No phosphorylation was observed after incubation of neutrophil lysates with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of active recombinant MAPKAPK2, indicating the absence of endogenous kinase activity under the conditions of neutrophil lysate preparation. In the presence of active recombinant MAPKAPK2 more than 30 proteins demonstrated phosphorylation. Six proteins identified as candidate MAPKAPK2 substrates by this method are marked on the autoradiograph in Fig. 1. LSP1 and myosin regulatory light chain were previously shown to be substrates for MAPKAPK2 (30Huang C.K. Zhan L. Ai Y. Jongstra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Komatsu S. Hosoya H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A phosphorylated protein with a molecular mass below 25 kDa was identified as p16-Arc with 56% protein coverage (Table I). The possibility that p16-Arc was a false positive was considered for several reasons. First, cell lysis may permit access of exogenous kinases to proteins with restricted localization in intact cells. Second, urea denaturation may expose phosphorylation sites that are inaccessible in properly folded proteins. Third, disruption of protein-protein interactions may result in dissociation of signaling modules that direct kinase activity. Finally, protein spots may contain more than one protein, leading to identification of false substrates. Therefore, additional studies were performed to confirm the ability of MAPKAPK2 to interact with and phosphorylate p16-Arc.Table IIdentification of p16-Arc as an MAPKAPK2 substrateMasses submittedMasses matchedStartEndPeptide705.44706.358287VLISFK1069.621070.71132143ALAAGGVGSIVR1315.691316.714860QGNMTAALQAALK1352.611353.641323KVDVDEYDENK2161.972162.99113131GFESPSDNSSAMLLQWHEK2552.042553.052447FVDEEDGGDGQAGPDEGEVDSCLR3758.543759.241447VDVDEYDENKFVDEEDGGDGQAGPDEGEVDSCLR1 MSKNTVSSAR FRKVDVDEYD ENKFVDEEDG GDGQUAGPDEG EVDSCLRQGN51 MTAALQAALK NPPINTKSQA VKDRAGSIVL KVLISFKAND IEKAVQSDLDK121 NGVDLLMKYI YKGFESPSDNSSAMLLQWHE KALAAGGVGS IVRVLTARKT151 V Open table in a new tab MAPKAPK2 Interacts With and Phosphorylates p16-Arc— p16-Arc was recently shown to consist of two different isoforms, p16-A and p16-B, which are differentially expressed in various tissues and may determine which proteins bind to the intact Arp2/3 complex (40Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MAPKAPK2 interacts with p16-A and p16-B, GST-MAPKAPK2 pull-down of recombinant 35S-labeled p16-Arc isoforms was performed by incubating GST or GST-MAPKAPK2 glutathione-coupled Sepharose with recombinant [35S]p16-A or [S35]p16-B. Fig. 2A shows that GST-MAPKAPK2 coupled, but not GST-coupled, glutathione-Sepharose precipitated p16-A. Neither GST-MAPKAPK2 nor GST-glutathione-Sepharose was able to precipitate p16-B (Fig. 2B). To determine whether endogenous MAPKAPK2 in neutrophil lysates interacts with p16-A or p16-B, neutrophil lysates were incubated with recombinant GST, GST-p16-A, or GST-p16-B coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for MAPKAPK2. Figs. 3, A and B, show that endogenous MAPKAPK2 was precipitated by GST-p16-A but not by GST-p16-B or GST-glutathione-Sepharose. These data suggest that MAPKAPK2 physically associates with p16-A but not p16-B.Fig. 3Interaction of p16-Arc isoforms with MAPKAPK2 in neutrophil lysate. To determine whether endogenous MAPKAPK2 interacts with p16-A and p16-B, neutrophil lysates (400 μg of protein) were incubated with GST-p16-A (panel A, first lane) or GST-p16-B (panel B, fourth lane) and subjected to a pull-down assay. GST glutathione-Sepharose (first lane, panels A and B), GST-p16-A coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (third lane, panel A), GST-p16-B coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (third lane, panel B), and neutrophil lysate (fifth lane, panels A and B) were used as controls. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) for MAPKAPK2. Immunoblots show that MAPKAPK2 precipitated with p16-A but not with p16-B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the interactions with MAPKAPK2 result in p16-Arc phosphorylation, active recombinant MAPKAPK2 was incubated with equivalent amounts of recombinant p16-A or p16-B and [γ-32P]ATP in an in vitro kinase assay. The proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Fig. 4A shows that, despite equal loading of p16-A and p16-B, MAPKAPK2-phosphorylated p16-A more extensively than p16-B. A search of the amino acid sequences of p16-A and p16-B determined that p16-A contains a motif similar to the consensus MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation motif (KDRAGS77) that is absent in the B isoform. To determine whether this consensus site was the primary phosphorylation site, serine 77 was mutated to alanine (p16-A S77A).

We found enhanced AngII activation of Akt and extracellular ERK1/2 in vascular smooth muscle cells incubated with high glucose (27.5 mm) compared with low glucose (5.5 mm). Because AngII-mediated transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is important in Akt and ERK1/2 activation, we studied the effects of glucose on EGFR function. The EGFR in cells cultured for 48 h in low glucose was smaller (145 kDa) than the EGFR in cells cultured with high glucose (170 kDa). The shift from the 170-kDa isoform to the 145-kDa isoform was reversible and dependent upon glucose concentration with EC50 ∼ 1 mm. N-Glycosylation was responsible because peptide N-glycosidase F treatment of isolated 170-kDa EGFR yielded a single band at 145 kDa. Cell surface biotinylation showed that the 145-kDa EGFR was present on plasma membrane. AngII and other G-protein-coupled receptor ligands known to transactivate EGFR phosphorylated the 170-kDa EGFR but not the 145-kDa EGFR, whereas EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and transforming growth factor-α phosphorylated both receptors. Subcellular fractionation showed that the 145-kDa receptor localized to a different plasma membrane domain than the 170-kDa receptor. These results establish a novel mechanism by which glucose-dependent EGFR N-glycosylation modulates AngII signal transduction and suggest a potential mechanism for pathogenic effects of AngII in diabetic vasculopathy.

Creager M.A. Libby P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). A pathogenic interaction between high glucose (HG) and angiotensin II (AngII) seems likely because many clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of inhibiting AngII to limit diabetic complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure (2Dahlof B. Devereux R.B. Kjeldsen S.E. Julius S. Beevers G. Faire U. Fyhrquist F. Ibsen H. Kristiansson K. Lederballe-Pedersen O. Lindholm L.H. Nieminen M.S. Omvik P. Oparil S. Wedel H.

The benefits are greater than expected solely from reductions in blood pressure, suggesting a direct AngII mechanism. Indeed, it is reported that HG enhances AngII- or serum-induced VSMC proliferation and prevents VSMC apoptosis (4Amiri F. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32382-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Xu L. Nadler J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

HG also induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and further augments PAI-1 expression induced by AngII in VSMC (7Chen Y.Q. Su M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8225-8231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Ahn J.D. Morishita R. Kaneda Y. Lee K.U. Park J.Y. Jeon Y.J. Song H.S. Lee I.K. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These effects of glucose on VSMC seem to be related to the alterations of intracellular signal transduction because HG enhances mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation induced by AngII (9Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerneni K.K. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that MAPK stimulated by HG is secondary to protein kinase C activation by increasing the endogenous activator diacylglycerol (10Lee T.S. Saltsman K.A. Ohashi H. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5141-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 11Haneda M. Araki S. Togawa M. Sugimoto T. Isono M. Kikkawa R.

Invest. 1999; 103: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism remains uncertain, because the increases in diacylglycerol and protein kinase C activation seem too small to explain MAPK activation. Recently, it has become apparent that AngII signal transduction is mediated in part through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation (13Kalmes A. Daum G. Clowes A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 54-55Google Scholar). Several downstream events of EGFR transactivation including MAPK and Akt activation participate in VSMC proliferation and anti-apoptosis (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). MAPKs also stimulate activator protein-1, a key transcription complex that induces transcription of PAI-1. Indeed, AngII-induced PAI-1 expression is inhibited by AG1478, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific for EGFR, indicating EGFR transactivation is essential for PAI-1 expression by AngII (16Takeda K. Ichiki T. Tokunou T. Iino N. Fujii S. Kitabatake A. Shimokawa H. Takeshita A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Based on the many signaling events common to EGFR transactivation and HG stimulation, we hypothesized that glucose modulates EGFR transactivation by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the AngII receptor. We found that glucose dramatically altered EGFR function by post-translational N-glycosylation modifications. Furthermore, we observed that EGFR transactivation by GPCRs (but not EGFR activation by EGF) correlated with glycosylation state and with activation of Akt and MAPK. We propose a novel paradigm in which glucose modulates GPCR and growth factor signal transduction by means of changes in EGFR N-glycosylation. Materials—Antibodies to phospho-ERK, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and Akt were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to AT1R (polyclonal), EGFR (polyclonal), PDGF-βR (polyclonal), and phosphotyrosine (monoclonal) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody to α-actin was obtained from Roche Applied Science, a monoclonal antibody to EGFR from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), antibody to phospho-EGFR (Tyr-845) from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA), recombinant human EGF, HB-EGF, and TGF-α from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and streptavidin-agarose from Pierce, angiotensin II from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), and all other reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless specifically indicated. Cell Culture—VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of 200- to 250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), as described previously (17Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). VSMC used for the present study were maintained for >3 passages in DMEM containing 5.5 mm glucose. Immunoblot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (18Saito Y. Haendeler J. Hojo Y. Yamamoto K. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6387-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). VSMC were lysed in Triton-based lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), scraped off the dish, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was collected as a total cell lysate. Equal amounts of cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ EDL, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies, and membrane-bound antibodies were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with anti-EGFR antibody (monoclonal) rocking overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h, precipitates were washed with lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After being denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Glycosidase Digestion—300 μg of lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody and digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Specifically, samples were incubated in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min at 100 °C and brought to 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 1% Nonidet P-40. Then, 1 μl (500 units) of PNGase-F was added and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. After glycosidase digestion, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and once in borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm boric acid, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9). The surface plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated by gently shaking the cells for 20 min at 4 °C with borate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin. After the same volume of biotinylation solution was added, cells were further rocked for 20 min. Cells were washed extensively with the quenching buffer (20 mm Tris and 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to scavenge the unreacted biotin, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Detergent-free Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions were prepared according to a method modified from Song et al. (19Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). After rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, VSMC were scraped into 2 ml of buffer A (500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% protease inhibitor mixture) and then homogenized by using a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes) and a sonicator (3 × 10-s bursts; ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 series, Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL). The homogenate was adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of buffer B (90% sucrose, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by layering 2 ml of 35, 30, 25, 10, and 5% sucrose in buffer C (250 mm sodium carbonate, pH 6.5, 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 20 h in a Sorvall Discovery™ 100S ultracentrifuge equipped with Surespin™ 630 rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products, Newtown, CT). 12 × 1-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of each tube. An equal volume of each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis and probed with a specific antibody. Statistical Analysis—The difference between LG and HG was assessed by analysis of variance. Glucose Modulates Akt and ERK1/2 Phosphorylation upon Stimulation with AngII but Not with EGF—To explore the effect of glucose on AngII signal transduction, we studied Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 was time dependently increased by AngII stimulation with a 3.7 ± 0.6-fold increase at 5 min when cultured in HG (Fig. 1A, left). On the other hand, Akt phosphorylation was completely inhibited in LG (0.54 ± 0.05-fold control at 5 min, p < 0.001 between LG and HG). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was also increased by AngII in HG (Fig. 1A, right) but suppressed in LG (2.7 ± 0.5-versus 5.1 ± 1.0-fold increase at 5 min, p < 0.001). These data indicate that glucose significantly modulates phosphorylation of two independent signaling molecules, Akt and ERK1/2, induced by AngII. In contrast, upon stimulation by EGF, both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation did not differ significantly between LG and HG (Fig. 1B, p > 0.05), suggesting that the glucose effect on signal transduction might be specific to AngII. As shown previously (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 15Ushio-Fukai M. Hilenski L. Santanam N. Becker P.L. Ma Y. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon stimulation with AngII mostly depended on EGFR transactivation, because AG1478 (1 μm), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific for EGFR, reduced AngII-induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 111.6% and 78.9%, respectively, in HG-cultured cells (data not shown). Glucose-dependent Change in EGFR Molecular Mass—Next, we explored upstream targets in the EGFR transactivation pathway to explain the glucose-dependent difference in Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by AngII. Western blotting from VSMC grown in LG and HG showed no difference in angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R) expression (Fig. 2A, middle panel). However, there were two molecular mass isoforms of EGFR (145 and 170 kDa) in LG, whereas only a 170-kDa protein was expressed in HG (Fig. 2A, upper panel). EGFR molecular mass changed in a manner dependent upon incubation time and initial glucose concentration (Fig. 2B). Initially (time = 0), EGFR was present as a 170-kDa protein that is usually reported in VSMC (14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). After changing the media to LG (5.5 mm), a 145-kDa EGFR protein became increasingly apparent and finally replaced the 170-kDa form after a 48-h incubation. At an intermediate glucose concentration (11 mm), both receptors were evident, and at HG (27.5 mm), there was no appearance of the 145-kDa form even at 48 h. Because other groups have reported that human VSMC rapidly depletes glucose in culture media (20Renard C.B. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1067-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we studied glucose consumption by rat VSMC. As shown in Fig. 2C, VSMC consumed more than 50% of the initial glucose within 24 h, suggesting that the change in EGFR molecular mass may occur in response to glucose concentrations lower than 5.5 mm. Glucose Refeeding after Starvation Induces Reappearance of the 170-kDa Receptor—To further characterize the mechanism of EGFR isoform switching, we grew VSMC without glucose for 24 h and then refed with various concentrations of glucose. Upon refeeding, there was a rapid reappearance of the 170-kDa EGFR within 6 h (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The reappearance was glucose-dependent, with an EC50 of ∼1 mm (Fig. 3A, lower panel). We also studied PDGFR under the same conditions and found no change in the molecular mass during the course of starving and refeeding at any glucose concentration, indicating that the glucose effect may be unique to EGFR. To gain insight into the role of glucose metabolism as compared with osmotic stress in the EGFR isoform switch, we compared the abilities of different carbohydrates to induce the 170-kDa EGFR after glucose starvation. As shown in Fig. 3B, metabolically active carbohydrates (d-glucose, mannose, fructose, and galactose) induced the 170-kDa EGFR form, whereas metabolically inactive sugars (raffinose, mannitol, and l-glucose) did not. This finding suggests that glycolytic processes are required to induce the 170-kDa EGFR. The Difference between Two Isoforms Is because of Altered N-Glycosylation—The level of N-linked oligosaccharides may change in membrane glycoproteins in response to glucose concentration (21Hwang J.B. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol.

Invest. 1997; 100: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether the difference between the 145-kDa EGFR and the 170-kDa EGFR was related to N-linked glycosylation, we treated isolated EGFR with PNGase-F to remove carbohydrates from glycopeptides at N-glycosylation sites. As shown in Fig. 4, PNGase-F treatment yielded a single 145-kDa EGFR protein from lysates of LG- and HG-treated cells. This result clearly demonstrates that the core protein is the same between the 145- and the 170-kDa receptor and that the difference is attributed solely to N-linked oligosaccharides. Cell Surface Localization of the 145-kDa EGFR—An important function of N-linked oligosaccharides is to facilitate proper protein folding. Chemical agents that inhibit N-glycosylation often induce misfolded proteins that are retained in endoplasmic reticulum and never transported to plasma membrane (24Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the membrane localization of the 145-kDa EGFR, we labeled the surface of plasma membrane with biotin, then lysed the cells and performed a pull-down assay using streptavidin-agarose. As shown in Fig. 5, both the 145- and the 170-kDa EGFR in LG and HG, respectively, were pulled down from biotinylated samples with ratios comparable with those found in total cell lysate (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that the 145-kDa EGFR induced by LG is expressed on the cell surface. Plasma membrane localization of the 145-kDa receptor was further confirmed by EGF-induced phosphorylation and density-dependent fractionation shown below (Figs. 6 and 7).Fig. 6EGFR phosphorylation upon stimulation with various agonists. VSMC were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing either LG (5.5 mm) or HG (27.5 mm) for 48 h. A–C and E, after stimulation, cells were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody (monoclonal) and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (top); cells were then reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody (polyclonal) (bottom). A, VSMC were stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml, upper) or AngII (100 nm, lower) for indicated times. B, VSMC were stimulated with HB-EGF (20 ng/ml), TGF-α (20 ng/ml), or EGF (20 ng/ml) for 2 min. C, cells were stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml, 2 min), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (1 μm, 1 min). D, VSMC were stimulated with AngII (100 nm, 1 min) or EGF (20 ng/ml, 2 min), and cell lysates were blotted with anti-phospho-EGFR (Y845) specific antibody; cells were then reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody (polyclonal). E, VSMC serum-starved in HG were incubated with CRM197 (10 μg/ml), heparin (100 μg/ml), or AG1478 (1 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with AngII (100 nm, 1 min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7EGFR distribution defined by sucrose density centrifugation.

Upon stimulation with EGF, both the 170-kDa form and the 145-kDa form were tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 6A, upper panel). When stimulated with AngII, however, there was no 145-kDa receptor phosphorylation, whereas the 170-kDa receptor was still clearly phosphorylated (Fig. 6A, lower panel). To further assess EGFR responsiveness to other ligands, we studied the ability of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) to stimulate phosphorylation of both isoforms. As shown in Fig. 6B, HB-EGF and TGF-α, like EGF, activated both receptors, suggesting that the 145-kDa EGFR is responsive to ligand-induced activation. To determine whether the inability of the 145-kDa EGFR to be transactivated was a general property, we tested the ability of other GPCR agonists to increase EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6C, thrombin and sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulated phosphorylation of the 170-kDa receptor but not of the 145-kDa receptor. These findings suggest that the 145-kDa EGFR is generally unresponsive to transactivation. To confirm that the difference in AngII-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of the 145-kDa receptor correlated with EGFR activation, we studied phosphorylation of an activation-specific site in EGFR (25Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6D, there was no phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in the 145-kDa receptor upon stimulation with AngII, whereas EGF induced Tyr-845 phosphorylation in both receptors. These results indicate that AngII and other GPCR agonists cannot transactivate the 145-kDa EGFR. In some cell systems, EGFR transactivation depends upon membrane-anchored HB-EGF, which is shed after release by metalloproteases. The HB-EGF then activates EGFR by means of an extracellular pathway (26Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because it is possible that glucose may affect EGFR transactivation through modulating expression and/or shedding of membrane-anchored growth factors, we studied the contribution of the extracellular pathway to EGFR phosphorylation by AngII in our cell system. As shown in Fig. 6E, heparin and CRM197, two molecules that bind and inhibit HB-EGF, could not reduce EGFR phosphorylation at concentrations shown to inhibit HB-EGF function (27Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas AG1478, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific for EGFR, completely inhibited EGFR transactivation by AngII. These results demonstrate that HB-EGF is not a dominant mechanism for EGFR transactivation in our system and thus suggest that the impaired EGFR phosphorylation by AngII in LG is an intrinsic property specific to the 145-kDa EGFR. Localization of EGFR within Plasma Membrane—A previous report demonstrated that disruption of lipid rafts and/or caveolae prevented EGFR transactivation by AngII but not activation by EGF (15Ushio-Fukai M. Hilenski L. Santanam N. Becker P.L. Ma Y. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the second cysteinerich region of EGFR containing two potential N-glycosylation sites was important for targeting EGFR to lipid rafts and/or caveolae (28Yamabhai M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24843-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that a change in membrane location of the 145-kDa EGFR may cause impaired phosphorylation by AngII. To test this possibility, we explored subcellular localization of EGFR by using sucrose density centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 7, there was a significant difference in the distribution of EGFR in LG and HG. Although both receptors were localized within caveolae-enriched fractions collected between 5 and 35% sucrose (29Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), a much greater percentage of EGFR from HG-treated cells was present in heavier fractions (Fig. 7, A and C, fractions 6–10). In contrast to the change in EGFR location, there were no significant differences in caveolin-1 distribution in LG compared with HG (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that the change in N-glycosylation may specifically alter EGFR location, thereby altering responsiveness to transactivation. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of signal transduction by glucose in VSMC. The major findings are that glucose modulates EGFR N-glycosylation; the 170-kDa N-glycosylated EGFR can be phosphorylated in response to both EGF and GPCR ligands (transactivation), whereas the 145-kDa EGFR can only be phosphorylated in response to EGF; glucose-modulated EGFR transactivation is required for activation of downstream signaling events such as Akt and ERK1/2. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that altered N-glycosylation modulates EGFR transactivation. Recent studies show that many GPCRs, including the AT1R, transactivate growth factor receptors, including the EGFR and the PDGF receptor (30Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Transactivation is important for many of the VSMC effects reported for AngII, including proliferation, hypertrophy, and migration (32Bokemeyer D. Schmitz U. Kramer H.J. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Seshiah P.N. Weber D.S. Rocic P. Valppu L. Taniyama Y. Griendling K.K. Circ.

Commun. 2002; 294: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). EGFR transactivation is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent process that involves the endogenous EGFR tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, and reactive oxygen species (30Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Owada K.M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that another requirement in VSMC is the presence of an N-glycosylated 170-kDa EGFR that depends upon glucose concentration. Previous publications have shown that glucose modulates various signaling events in VSMC, including activation of ERK1/2 and p38 (9Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerneni K.K. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HG has also been reported to enhance VSMC proliferation when stimulated with AngII by unknown mechanisms (4Amiri F. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32382-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In fact, other GPCR-coupled ligands, such as sphingosine 1-phosphate, thrombin, and lysophosphatidic acid, share with AngII the following properties: transactivation of EGFR, activation of ERK1/2 and Akt, and promotion of VSMC proliferation and survival (13Kalmes A. Daum G. Clowes A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 54-55Google Scholar, 14Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y.

Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Based on the present study, we propose a critical role for glucose modulation of EGFR transactivation by GPCR agonists in VSMC (Fig. 8). This mechanism is unique to transactivation, because we found that EGFR ligands, such as EGF, HB-EGF, and TGF-α, were able to activate both forms of EGFR. A previous study reported altered glycosylation of EGFR in a human carcinoma cell line after glucose starvation induced by 2-deoxyglucose (35Cai B. Tomida A. Mikami K. Nagata K. Tsuruo T. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 177: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mass (150 kDa) of EGFR in the report by Cai et al. (35Cai B. Tomida A. Mikami K. Nagata K. Tsuruo T. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 177: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was similar to the present paper, the 145-kDa EGFR in VSMC grown in LG is physiologically quite different from the chemically induced receptor for two reasons. First, the 145-kDa EGFR in LG-cultured VSMC is expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 5, 7), whereas the receptor in 2-deoxyglucose-treated cells is not. Second, the LG-induced EGFR is fully functional upon stimulation with classical ligands (Fig. 6, A and B) and able to transduce downstream signals (Fig. 1B), whereas the 2-deoxyglucose-induced receptor has no function. From these results, we conclude that the 145-kDa EGFR that appears in LG is physiologically “allowed” to insert in the plasma membrane. We speculate that it has an alternative function such as impaired response to GPCR-induced transactivation (Fig. 6, A and C). In fact, among several membrane proteins known to be modulated on the N-linked carbohydrates in a glucose-dependent manner, most are not expressed on the cell surface and subsequently are not functional in low glucose conditions (21Hwang J.B. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only other receptor known to locate on the cell surface in the presence of both LG and HG and that shows different functions depending on glucose is CD44 (23Zheng Z. Cummings R.D. Pummill P.E. Kincade P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The glucose level required to change CD44 N-glycosylation in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells is ∼1.4 mm, which is comparable with our results (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that there might be common mechanisms for functional regulation of EGFR and CD44 based on glucose-mediated alterations in N-glycosylation. The mechanism by which altered N-glycosylation modulates EGFR transactivation remains to be clarified. We believe that a likely mechanism is a change in membrane microdomain location that affects signal transduction. There are 10 potential N-glycosylation sites in full-length rodent EGFR, and all N-glycan sites are conserved in the human receptor, emphasizing the importance of glycosylation to EGFR function. Although N-linked oligosaccharides may both positively and negatively regulate EGFR function (based on published data; see Refs. 36Pratt R.M. Pastan I. Nature. 1978; 272: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 37Tsuda T. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21988-21994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the direct link between N-glycosylation and plasma membrane domain localization remains to be elucidated. Some investigators have shown that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol impairs EGFR transactivation, suggesting that transactivation requires targeting EGFR to caveolae and/or lipid rafts (15Ushio-Fukai M. Hilenski L. Santanam N. Becker P.L. Ma Y. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The present result, in which there was a significant difference in EGFR distribution within caveolin-enriched fractions between LG- and HG-cultured cells (Fig. 7), suggests that there might be a requirement of N-linked oligosaccharides for the targeting of EGFR to a specific microdomain in which the receptor can be transactivated. The novel finding that glucose modulates EGFR transactivation through altered N-glycosylation has important implications for our understanding of basic mechanisms of VSMC signal transduction and clinical consequences of hyperglycemia. Because EGFR is involved in many of the intracellular signaling pathways activated by GPCRs, alterations in EGFR N-glycosylation will have significant effects on GPCR function. Clinically, it has become apparent that inhibition of AngII by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AngII receptor blockers has a dramatic benefit in reducing cardiovascular events and renal failure in patients with diabetes, suggesting an important interaction between AngII and hyperglycemia (2Dahlof B. Devereux R.B. Kjeldsen S.E. Julius S. Beevers G. Faire U. Fyhrquist F. Ibsen H. Kristiansson K. Lederballe-Pedersen O. Lindholm L.H. Nieminen M.S. Omvik P. Oparil S. Wedel H.

Based on the present study, we may speculate that inhibitors of EGFR N-glycosylation may have important benefits in cardiovascular disease by limiting GPCR-mediated growth factor receptor transactivation."

The association constant for the dimer-to-tetramer transition is 2.1 × 107m–1, indicating that the protein would consist of both dimers and tetramers at physiological concentrations. The carboxyl terminus of MutS is required for tetramer assembly because a previously described 53-amino acid carboxyl-terminal truncation (MutS800) forms a limiting species of a dimer (Obmolova, G., Ban, C., Hsieh, P., and Yang, W.

MutS800 binds a 20-base pair heteroduplex an order of magnitude more weakly than full-length MutS, and at saturating protein concentrations, the heteroduplex-bound mass observed with MutS800 is only half that observed with the full length protein, indicating that the subunit copy number of heteroduplex-bound MutS is twice that of MutS800. Analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation using a fluorescein-tagged 20-base pair heteroduplex demonstrated that native MutS forms a tetramer on this single site-sized heteroduplex DNA. Equilibrium fluorescence experiments indicated that dimer-to-tetramer assembly promotes mismatch binding by MutS and that the tetramer can bind only a single heteroduplex molecule, implying nonequivalence of the two dimers within the tetramer.

MutS homologs participate in multiple genetic stabilization pathways by virtue of their ability to recognize a spectrum of DNA lesions. Recognition of base pair mismatches by MutS homologs has been implicated in the rectification of DNA biosynthetic errors and in the dissolution of recombination events involving diverged sequences (1Modrich P.

Recognition of damaged base pairs by MutS homologs is also involved in the transcription-coupled repair of DNA damage (2Jiricny J.

Members of the MutS family can thus be viewed as molecular sentinels that respond to subtle variations in DNA structure or dynamics and then communicate presence of that lesion to downstream activities (1Modrich P.

Events downstream of MutS recognition have been delineated for the Escherichia coli pathway responsible for correction of DNA biosynthetic errors, and this reaction has been reconstituted in vitro using near homogeneous components. Although a number of mechanistic details remain to be established, basic roles of the individual activities have been defined. MutS recruits MutL to the heteroduplex in a reaction requiring ATP (10Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Assembly of this ternary complex is sufficient to activate the latent endonuclease activity of MutH, which incises the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) strand signal (13Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this complex activates the unwinding activity of DNA helicase II, which loads at the MutH incision with an orientation bias so that helix unwinding proceeds toward the mismatch (14Yamaguchi M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The unwound portion of the incised strand is hydrolyzed by a single-strand exonuclease. If unwinding proceeds from a strand break located 5′ to the mispair, the displaced single strand is degraded by the 5′-to-3′ hydrolytic activity of ExoVII or RecJ exonuclease (16Cooper D.L.

When helicase unwinding initiates at a nick 3′ to the mismatch, the unwound strand is degraded by the 3′-to-5′ activity of ExoI, ExoVII, or ExoX (16Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Excision terminates at a number of sites centered about 50 base pairs beyond the mismatch, the ensuing gap is repaired by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in the presence of single-strand binding protein, and DNA ligase restores covalent integrity to the repaired strand (18Lahue R.S.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that is stimulated by DNA (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the rate-limiting step for ATP hydrolytic turnover is sensitive to the presence of a mismatch (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the nucleotide and DNA binding sites of MutS are in close communication. Furthermore, the affinities of MutS for heteroduplex and homoduplex DNAs have been shown to be differentially modulated by binding of ADP or nonhydrolyzable analogues of ATP (23Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). E. coli MutS800 crystallizes as a dimer in which the two subunits are nonequivalent with respect to DNA interaction and nucleotide binding. Only one of the homodimeric MutS800 subunits is involved in recognition of the mismatched base, and the nucleotide-binding site of only this subunit is occupied by ADP·Mg (8Sixma T.K. Curr. Opin.

Analysis of the cooperative interactions between the MutS nucleotide hydrolytic cycle and DNA interaction is complicated by the fact that, unlike MutS800, dimers of full-length MutS assemble into higher order structures (22Bjornson K.P.

In this study, we show that the E. coli MutS dimer assembles in an equilibrium fashion to form a tetrameric species, with the equilibrium constant for association indicating that the protein exists as a mixture of dimers and tetramers under physiological conditions. These studies also show that mismatch binding is facilitated by tetramer formation and that this species is capable of binding only one heteroduplex molecule, implying nonequivalence of the two dimers within the tetramer.

Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) consists of the N-terminal 800 residues of the 853 amino acids of the natural protein. An expression plasmid for MutS800 was constructed by PCR amplification of the appropriate sequence of the MutS gene of plasmid pMS1 (25Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 28Schlensog V. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7414-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by subcloning into a pT7–3 expression vector using EcoRI and BamHI endonuclease restriction sites. E. coli MutS and MutS800 proteins were purified as described (23Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and stored as concentrated stocks in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol at –20 °C. MutS and MutS800 concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 69,420 m–1 cm–1 and 62,450 m–1 cm–1 calculated from primary amino acid sequences (29Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). The 5′-terminus of the 20-mer sequence d(TAGCAAGCT T TCGAGTCTAG) was modified with fluorescein or biotin as indicated. 20-mer homoduplexes were prepared by annealing this sequence with its complement in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 90 °C and slow cooling to room temperature. Concentrated stock solutions (100 μm) were stored at 4 °C. 20-mer G-T heteroduplexes were prepared in a similar manner, except that the 20-mer complement contained a centrally located G residue placed opposite the thymine indicated by bold italic in the sequence above. The annealed fluorescein-labeled duplexes were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Waters Gen-Pak column eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.3–1 m) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. A 15-base pair G-T heteroduplex was derived from the internal sequence of this 20-base pair DNA by hybridization of d(GCAAGCT T TCGAGTC) with d(GACTCGA G AGCTTGC) that was labeled at the 5′-terminus with biotin or a CyIII fluorophore as indicated. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed at 4 °C at 5000 or 7000 rpm using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a 60Ti rotor and six-channel centerpieces. MutS samples were dialyzed at 4 °C into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, and dialysis buffer from the last change was used in the reference cell positions. Cells were scanned at 6-h intervals at the indicated wavelengths until consecutive scans (typically three) were unchanged and the system was judged to be at equilibrium (≥24 h). The partial specific volume of MutS was calculated to be 0.73 cm3/g at 4.0 °C from the primary amino acid sequence, and the solution density was measured to be 1.015 g/cm3. Equilibrium sedimentation data were analyzed using the program WinNonlin version 1.060 for Win94/WinNT (David Yphantis, University of Conneticut; Michael Johnson, University of Virginia; Jeff Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifuge Center Storrs, CT). MutS sedimentation equilibrium analysis performed in the presence of the 20-base pair fluorescein-labeled DNA was monitored at 494 nm using an experimentally determined extinction coefficient for the fluorophores-tagged DNA of 58,000 m–1 cm–1. Absorbance by MutS is negligible at this wavelength. The partial specific volume of the DNA was determined to be 0.58 cm3/g by sedimentation equilibrium at 15–20,000 rpm in the absence of protein based on the known molecular mass of the duplex (13.5 kDa). Partial specific volumes of complexes of fluorescein-tagged DNAs with MutS were calculated assuming weight-average contributions of protein and DNA to this parameter. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000. A streptavidin sensor chip was derivatized with biotin-derivatized 15- or 20-base pair hetero- and homoduplexes as indicated. Solutions (100 μl) of MutS or MutS800 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% surfactant P20, 5 mm MgCl2 containing 100 mm KCl were flowed across the SA chip at 20 μl/min. Measurements were performed at 25 °C, and samples were maintained at 4 °C before injection. Chips were regenerated by a 20-μl injection of 0.5% SDS. DNA binding isotherms for MutS and MutS800 were determined by titration of chip-bound DNA with increasing concentrations of MutS or MutS800. Maximum binding values obtained in this manner were plotted as a function of the protein concentration, and data were fit by nonlinear regression (30Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) to the indicated model. Equilibrium Fluorescence Analysis—Equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy performed on a SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer was used to monitor the extent of MutS binding to a 15-base pair CyIII-derivatized G-T heteroduplex in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. CyIII was excited at 549 nm and fluorescence emission intensity was monitored at 563 nm. Binding of MutS to the CyIII end-labeled heteroduplex resulted in a 30% increase in fluorescence intensity and a shift in the wavelength maxima from 561 to 563 nm. A longer 20-base pair CyIII-labeled heteroduplex did not give a signal change upon MutS binding (data not shown), suggesting that the distance from the fluorophore to the mismatch is critical for the observed fluorescence change. Equilibrium binding analysis was performed by titrating CyIII-labeled heteroduplex (50 nm) with increasing concentrations of MutS. The stoichiometry of binding of the 15-base pair CyIII-labeled G-T heteroduplex was determined at a MutS concentration of 5 μm (monomer), conditions under which the protein is predominantly a tetramer and well above the dissociation constant for the complex. The concentration of MutS dimers, S, was calculated from the total MutS concentration, St (in dimer equivalents) using Equation 1. S=-1+1+8L1St4L1(Eq. 1) L 1 is the intrinsic association constant for MutS tetramer formation in the absence of DNA. Analysis of DNA-MutS interaction in this manner was performed by the simultaneous titration of two matched cuvettes with CyIII-labeled DNA, one containing MutS and the other binding buffer only. The stoichiometric binding curve was constructed by plotting the absolute difference of fluorescence intensity for the two samples and the data fit to Equation 2. ΔF=x0026;ΔFmaxx0026;K2Dt+K2St+1-(-K2Dt-K2St-1)2-4K22DtSt2K2St(Eq. 2) ΔF max is the maximum observed fluorescence intensity difference, Dt is the total added DNA concentration, and K 2 is the association constant of MutS tetramer for DNA. St , the total MutS concentration, was varied in the fitting routine to determine the concentration of available DNA binding sites. MutH d(GATC) Endonuclease Assays—Mismatch-, MutS-, and MutL-dependent activation of MutH d(GATC) endonuclease activity was assayed by a modification of the method described previously (13Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 6.4-kilobase, circular f1 G-T heteroduplex containing a single hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence (modification on complementary DNA strand) located about 1000 base pairs from the mismatch (31Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was linearized with BSP106 endonuclease and 32P-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase. Reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm KPO4, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml hemimethylated 32P-heteroduplex, 1 nm MutH, 24 nm MutL, and MutS or MutS800 as indicated. After preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, reactions were initiated by addition of ATP to 2 mm. Reactions were sampled (10 μl) as a function of time and quenched by addition of 1/3 volume of 200 mm NaOH, 10 mm EDTA, 10% Ficoll, and 0.1% bromcresol purple. Substrate and product were separated by electrophoresis through alkaline agarose, and dried gels imaged using a Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager. Initial rates were determined from the linear portion of the time course. Equilibrium Sedimentation of MutS Indicates Assembly of Dimers to Tetramers—Sedimentation equilibrium profiles of MutS and a 53-residue carboxyl-terminal truncation (MutS800) are compared in Fig. 1 (initial concentrations of 20 μm as monomer equivalents). Although the MutS800 polypeptide is 94% of the mass of full-length MutS, the sedimentation equilibrium profiles of the two proteins differ dramatically. For comparison purposes, the data of Fig. 1 were fit to a model assuming a single ideal (non associating) species to yield a weight average Mr of 360,000 ± 20,000 (3.8 monomer equivalents) for full-length MutS and 220,000 ± 12,000 (2.4 monomer equivalents) for MutS800. Analysis by size-exclusion chromatography has previously indicated that MutS undergoes a concentration-dependent, self-assembly reaction (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At high concentrations (30 μm), the protein behaves as a uniform species of high molecular weight, but the oligomeric state of this species has not been established. The data of Fig. 1 suggest that the assembly end state is a tetramer of 95-kDa monomers, and as described below, functional analysis of the protein is consistent with this view. To further evaluate the nature of the MutS assembly reaction, sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed at four different initial concentrations (2.5, 5.0, 10, and 20 μm monomer) at two different speeds (5000 and 7000 rpm). The eight data sets obtained in this manner were globally fit to a dimertetramer self-association model (WinNonlin, “Experimental Proceedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, this model provides an excellent fit to the observed data and yields an association constant for the dimer to tetramer transition of 2.1 ± 0.1 × 107m–1 (parameter L 1 in Equation 1). Although a small fraction of higher order oligomers cannot be ruled out by this analysis, it is clear that MutS is primarily tetrameric at the highest concentrations tested. An assembly model that allows monomer and trimer intermediates also provide an adequate fit to the data of Fig. 2 (not shown). However, we regard such a model as unlikely because we have been unable to detect free monomer at the lowest MutS concentration and highest rotor speed tested (2.5 μm and 10,000 rpm, data not shown). Indeed, gel filtration and equilibrium sedimentation analysis of T. aquaticus MutS has led to the conclusion that this protein also exists in solution as an equilibrium mixture of dimers and tetramers (27Biswas I. Ban C. Fleming K.G. Qin J. Lary J.W. Yphantis D.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23673-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MutS Sediments As a Tetramer When Bound to a Single Site-sized Heteroduplex—The nature of MutS oligomeric states active in heteroduplex binding was examined in sedimentation equilibrium experiments that monitored the apparent molecular mass of a fluorescein-derivatized, 20-base pair G-T heteroduplex (see “Experimental Proceedures”). Because the fluorescein-tagged heteroduplex can be monitored by virtue of its absorbance at 494 nm, a wavelength at which MutS does not absorb, molecular mass values for protein-DNA complexes can be determined. Fig. 3 shows sedimentation equilibrium profiles of 5 μm fluorescein-labeled heteroduplex as a function of MutS concentration, with data fit to a model that assumes the presence of a single ideal species. For initial MutS concentrations of 20 and 40 μm (monomer), this analysis yielded weight average values for the protein·DNA complexes of M r 335,000 ± 12,000 and 465,000 ± 30,000. These values are much larger than that expected for a MutS dimer bound to a single heteroduplex (204, 000), but are similar to those expected for a MutS tetramer bound to one or two molecules of heteroduplex DNA (394 or 408 kDa). It is important to note that a limiting species indicative of MutS tetramer binding was also observed with a fluorescein-labeled, 15-base pair heteroduplex (M r = 362,000 ± 20,000, data not shown). The similar M r values obtained with 15- and 20-base pair heteroduplexes argues against a model in which a tetramer-heteroduplex stoichiometry is simply a result of the contiguous binding of two MutS dimers on the same short piece of DNA. Furthermore, although it is clear that the tetramer is the predominant form of MutS bound to heteroduplex under these conditions, it is possible that a small fraction of the complexes observed at the highest MutS concentration tested (40 μm) may involve higher order assemblies. Experiments described below, which provide an independent evaluation of MutS-heteroduplex stoichiometry at more physiological protein concentrations (32Feng G. Tsui H.C. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confirm activity of the MutS tetramer in heteroduplex recognition. The Heteroduplex-bound Molecular Mass of MutS is Twice That of MutS800 —Because surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy monitors mass change upon ligand binding, we have used this method to compare the relative mass equivalents of MutS and MutS800, which are bound by a 20-base pair G-T heteroduplex at protein concentrations much lower than those used in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, both proteins bind with higher affinities to the small heteroduplex than to an otherwise identical A·T homoduplex, and at saturating protein concentrations, the heteroduplex-bound mass observed with native MutS is twice (2.0 ± 0.5) that observed with MutS800. Because MutS800 is known to recognize a mismatch as a dimer (24Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 33Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), this mass ratio implies that native MutS is binding to the heteroduplex as the tetramer, consistent with the differences in molecular mass observed for the two proteins during equilibrium centrifugation (Fig. 1). It is also noteworthy that although MutS800 retains mismatch specificity, this dimeric protein binds 18-fold more weakly than native MutS (Fig. 4, Kd of 18 ± 1 nm for MutS and 331 ± 8 nm for MutS800). The MutS Tetramer Binds a Single Heteroduplex Molecule—To further clarify the role of MutS assembly in DNA binding and to assess the stoichiometry of this interaction, we have developed an equilibrium fluorescence assay that monitors binding of the protein to a 15-base pair G-T heteroduplex, which contains a CyIII fluorophore on the 5′-terminus of one strand (see “Experimental Proceedures”). As shown in Fig. 5, MutS binds to this small heteroduplex, resulting in a 30% enhancement of CyIII fluorescence intensity. For purposes of comparison, Fig. 5 also shows the MutS binding profile for the 15-base pair heteroduplex, and the corresponding A·T homoduplex, as determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The affinity of MutS for this small DNA is significantly less than that for the 20 base pair G-T heteroduplex from which the 15mer was derived as an internal sequence, although specificity for the mismatch is retained. Fits of this data to a simple hyperbolic mechanism (Fig. 5, dashed lines) yielded apparent Kd values for the 15-mer of 100 ± 15 and 270 ± 57 nm for surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence assays, respectively; these values can be compared with the Kd for the 20-base pair substrate of 18 nm (Fig. 4). However, the data sets of Fig. 5 deviate appreciably from a simple hyperbolic model, with binding profiles for this small heteroduplex displaying apparent positive cooperativity. We attribute this cooperative behavior to facilitation of binding by MutS assembly (i.e. heteroduplex binding drives tetramer formation (see “Discussion”)). Indeed, fits of the data sets of Fig. 5 to a cooperative dimer-to-tetramer assembly model (solid lines) are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. As is evident in Fig. 5, binding scored by equilibrium fluorescence seems to be more tightly coupled to MutS assembly than that observed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This presumably reflects differences in the molecular events scored by the two methods. For example, because surface plasmon resonance scores heteroduplex-bound MutS mass, binding of either the dimer or the tetramer will yield a signal in this assay. This may not be the case for the fluorescence assay; production of a fluorescent signal upon tetramer, but not dimer, binding would result in an apparent enhancement of cooperativity like that observed. It is also possible that biotin- or CyIII-derivatization of the 15-base pair DNA for the two types of assay may differentially affect MutS binding to the small heteroduplex. An advantage of equilibrium fluorescence over surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy is that the concentrations of either binding partner can be varied independently. We have exploited this fact to establish the stoichiometry of binding of the 15-mer heteroduplex to the MutS tetramer. Fig. 6 shows a titration of 5 μm MutS (monomer) with the 15-base pair CyIII-labeled G-T heteroduplex. At this concentration, MutS is predominantly a tetramer (90%, Equation 1; see “Experimental Procedures”), and because this concentration is well above the binding constant for the 15-mer (Fig. 5), heteroduplex-MutS interaction under these conditions will be nearly stoichiometric. Fit of this titration data to Equation 2 (“Experimental Procedures”) yielded an interaction stoichiometry of 1.13 ± 0.09 μm DNA bound per 5 μm MutS monomer equivalents; i.e. one molecule of 15-base pair heteroduplex bound for every 4.4 ± 0.4 MutS monomers. Thus, the process of dimer-to-tetramer assembly renders the two dimers non-equivalent with respect to the ability to bind heteroduplex. Tetramer formation enhances the heteroduplex affinity of one dimer but reduces the heteroduplex affinity of the other. Dimer-forming MutS800 Is Compromised in the MutH Activation Assay—Expression of MutS800 has been reported to suppress the mutator phenotype of mutS mutant cells. However, these results were obtained when the MutS800 gene was present on high copy number plasmid (24Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Because we have been unable to detect MutS800 assembly beyond a dimer, we have compared the biochemical activity of this protein with that of native MutS in the initial step of methyl-directed mismatch repair: the mismatch-, MutS-, MutL-, and ATP-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease (13Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected from the biological observations, MutS800 does support activation of MutH endonuclease (Fig. 7), but its activity is compromised in this respect. The concentration of MutS800 necessary to achieve half maximal MutH activation is about six times that observed for full length MutS. Although this phenomenon may be caused in part by the reduced affinity of MutS800 for a heteroduplex (Fig. 4), it is also evident that maximal rate of MutH activation supported by saturating concentrations of MutS800 is reduced relative to that of the wild-type protein. Previous studies have shown that T. aquaticus and T. thermophilus activities undergo dimer-to-tetramer assembly, although the functional consequences of oligomerization have not been addressed (26Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Biswas I. Ban C. Fleming K.G. Qin J. Lary J.W. Yphantis D.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23673-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence now exists for oligomeric states of E. coli MutS beyond that of the dimer. Early velocity sedimentation experiments showed that MutS exists as 7 S and 10 S forms, and subsequent gel filtration analysis demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in the molecular size of E. coli MutS, with the plateau value consistent with a tetramer or hexamer (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MutS assembly has been shown to be promoted by adenine nucleotides (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18557-18562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Response of the MutS ATPase to heteroduplex activation has also suggested that the functional form of the protein is a higher order oligomer than a dimer. ATPase activation saturates at a ratio of one heteroduplex per four to six MutS monomer equivalents, suggesting that the cooperative unit for ATP hydrolysis by the native protein is at least a tetramer (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The equilibrium sedimentation experiments described here show that E. coli MutS also assembles to a form a tetramer. The in vivo concentration of MutS in exponential E. coli cells has been estimated to be 0.5 μm in monomer equivalents (32Feng G. Tsui H.C. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dimerization constant of 2.1 ± 1 × 107m–1 obtained from sedimentation equilibrium indicates that ∼50% of the MutS would be present as tetramer at this concentration (Equation 1). Insofar as this fraction will be dependent on actual in vivo conditions, we note that this value is almost certainly an underestimate for two reasons. As discussed above, the dimer-to-tetramer transition is promoted by the presence of ATP (22Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18557-18562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that heteroduplex binding also promotes tetramer formation. This finding accounts for the observation in Fig. 4 that full-length MutS binds to the high-affinity, 20-base pair heteroduplex as a tetramer with saturation occurring well below the estimated in vivo concentration of 0.13 μm. If MutS assembly were uncoupled from DNA binding, then the protein would initially bind to DNA as a dimer. However, no discernible MutS dimer-DNA intermediate complex was formed. Although the data in Fig. 4 are not demonstrably cooperative at the lowest MutS concentrations tested, we attribute this to the much higher intrinsic affinity of MutS for the 20-base pair DNA used in the experiments of Fig. 4 compared with the shorter, 15-base pair molecule. The reduced affinity of MutS for the smaller DNA permits visualization of cooperativity at low protein concentrations (Fig. 5). Although the MutS dimer can clearly recognize a mismatch, the findings that ATP and heteroduplex binding promote tetramer formation strongly suggest a functional role for this oligomeric state in mismatch repair. Functionality is also suggested by the observation that the two dimers within the tetramer are not equivalent; i.e. like the MutS dimer, the tetramer is capable of binding only one molecule of heteroduplex (Fig. 6). Indeed, if MutS tetramers were inactive in mismatch repair, then in vivo overexpression of the protein would be expected to result in a mutator phenotype, but this is not the case (35Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate-induced protein assembly has been invoked as a mechanism that renders the cell more responsive to small changes in protein concentration (36Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our calculations suggest that dimer and tetramer concentrations may be finely tuned at physiological concentrations of MutS, such that a decrease in concentration of the protein will lead to a greater-than-first-order decrease in the tetramer concentration. In view of the higher mismatch affinity of the tetramer, this would lead to a reduction in the efficiency of mismatch recognition. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the concentration of MutS (but not that of MutL or MutH) is down-regulated during metabolic stress (32Feng G. Tsui H.C. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous electron microscopic analysis has demonstrated the MutS-, ATP-, and mismatch-dependent formation of DNA loops with 6.4-kilobase heteroduplex (37Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A bi-lobed E. coli MutS complex stabilized DNA loops at the base, and loop size was observed to increase with time in an ATP-dependent manner. Because the mismatch was often present within the DNA loop, these observations led to the suggestion that in the presence of ATP, MutS translocates from the mismatch in a bidirectional fashion. Based on the projected shadow size in electron micro-graphs, the MutS complex observed at the loop base was estimated to be a dimer (37Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, in view of the clamp-like structure of the DNA-bound MutS dimer (24Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 33Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and the results presented here, it seems likely that the bi-lobed complex observed in the electron microscope was actually the tetramer. The MutS tetramer is readily accommodated into a bidirectional translocation, because such a mechanism would be dependent on at least two potential DNA binding sites. In this regard, it is interesting to note that MutS800, which is incapable of assembling into tetramers, displays only half the maximal stimulated rate of MutH activation compared with the native protein (Fig. 7). Alternate functions for the MutS tetramer can also be envisioned. For example, it has been suggested that one dimer within the MutS tetramer may bind to the mispair, whereas the other participates in a search for the strand discrimination signal (8Sixma T.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is ample evidence that MutS functions during several discrete steps during mismatch repair. It is required for the mismatch- and MutL-dependent activation of the MutH endonuclease, which incises the unmethylated strand at the d(GATC) strand signal (13Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the mismatch- and MutL-dependent loading of DNA helicase II at the ensuing strand break (15Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that MutS can also interact with the β-clamp of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (39Lopez de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and therefore may be involved in the polymerase specificity of the reaction. It is thus clear that MutS plays essential roles in multiple steps of the repair reaction that involve several DNA sites and other proteins. It is important to note, however, that there is no mechanistic evidence indicating that the same MutS molecule that is responsible for initial mismatch recognition event is the same molecule responsible for subsequent MutS functions during the repair reaction. Inasmuch as cooperative interactions are evident across the tetramer dimer-dimer interface, coordination of repair events could in principle be mediated through the transient synapses of different MutS dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1982044261,"Bovine antibodies have recently attracted increasing attention, as they have been shown to exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic properties in selected infectious diseases in humans. In the present study, we have isolated bacterial artificial chromosomes and cosmid clones containing the bovine JH, μ, δ, γ1, γ2, γ3, ϵ, and α genes, which allowed us to make a contig of the genes within the bovine IGHC locus. The genes are arranged in a 5′-JH–7 kb–μ–5 kb–δ–33 kb–γ3–20 kb–γ1–34 kb–γ2–20 kb–ϵ– 13 kb–α-3′ order, spanning ∼150 kb DNA. Examination of the bovine germline JH locus revealed six JH segments, two of which, JH1 and JH2, were shown to be functional although there was a strong preference for expression of the former. Sequence alignment of the bovine 5′ Eμ enhancer core region with those of other mammals, demonstrated an absence of the μE3 motif and a shortened spacer between the μA and μB sites within the bovine Eμ enhancer core region. Furthermore, the essential sequence element for class switching, switch μ, spanning ∼3-kb repetitive sequence and abundant in the switch region motifs CTGGG (187 repeats) and CTGAG (127 repeats), was identified immediately upstream of the μ gene. A further sequence comparison revealed that the bovine IGHC genes display an extensive polymorphism leading to expression of multiple antibody allotypes.

The mammalian immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region gene (IGHC) 1The abbreviations used are: IGHC, immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; PFGE, pulsed field gel electrophoresis; EST, expressed sequence tag.1The abbreviations used are: IGHC, immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; PFGE, pulsed field gel electrophoresis; EST, expressed sequence tag. loci have only been well characterized in humans and mice (1Hofker M.H. Walter M.A. Cox D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Shimizu A. Takahashi N. Yaoita Y. Honjo T. Cell. 1982; 28: 499-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Five classes of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region genes, μ, δ, γ, ϵ, and α are present in both species, although the number of subclasses of γ and α vary. The locus in the mouse (JH–μ–δ–γ3–γ1–γ2b–γ2a–ϵ–α) differs from that in the human (JH–μ–δ–γ3–γ1–ψϵ2–α1–ψγ–γ2–γ4–ϵ1–α2) due to a duplication during evolution of the latter. While six functional JH segments and 3 pseudogenes have been identified in the human JH locus (3Ravetch J.V. Siebenlist U. Korsmeyer S. Waldmann T. Leder P. Cell. 1981; 27: 583-591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), the corresponding locus in the mouse only contains four functional genes and two pseudogenes (4Sakano H. Maki R. Kurosawa Y. Roeder W. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1980; 286: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In addition, 27 D segments (5Corbett S.J. Tomlinson I.M. Sonnhammer E.L. Buck D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and 123 VH segments (of which 79 are pseudogenes) (6Matsuda F. Ishii K. Bourvagnet P. Kuma K. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), have been identified by sequencing of the human VH and DH loci. In ruminants such as cow and sheep, genes encoding μ, δ, γ, α, ϵ have all been described (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mousavi M.

Like other mammalian species, multiple γ genes, three in the cow (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar, 11Symons D.B. Clarkson C.A. Beale D. Mol.

Immunol. 1993; 30: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas the α and ϵ genes exist as single copy genes (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar). The functional bovine IGHC genes have been assigned to the Bos taurus chromosome 21q23-q24 (16Tobin-Janzen T.C. Womack J.E. Immunogenetics. 1992; 36: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Chowdhary B.P. Fronicke L. Gustavsson I. Scherthan H. Mamm Genome. 1996; 7: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), whereas the lambda light chain constant region gene maps to chromosome 17 (18Tobin-Janzen T.C. Womack J.E. Anim. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 163-172Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a bovine μ gene-like sequence, IGHML1, was previously detected on chromosome 11q23 (16Tobin-Janzen T.C. Womack J.E. Immunogenetics. 1992; 36: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Hayes H.C. Petit E.J. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although all seven bovine IGHC genes have been shown to be transcriptionally active in vivo or in vitro, the δ and γ3 genes are likely to be expressed at a very low level. The bovine immunoglobulins have been shown to use a restricted set of VH genes (20Sinclair M.C. Gilchrist J. Aitken R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3883-3889PubMed Google Scholar), some of which contain unusually long CDR3 regions (21Berens S.J. Wylie D.E. Lopez O.J. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, an examination of all the available expressed bovine VH sequence in the NCBI GenBank™ suggests that only a single JH gene is employed. Recently, bovine immunoglobulins, have attracted increasing attention, as they have been shown to exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic effects in selected infectious diseases in humans and animals (22Hammarstrom L. Gardulf A. Hammarstrom V. Janson A. Lindberg K. Smith C.I. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 139: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Weiner C. Pan Q. Hurtig M. Boren T. Bostwick E. Hammarstrom L.

Kasinathan P. Choi Y.J. Naeem R. Tomizuka K. Sullivan E.J. Knott J.G. Duteau A. Goldsby R.A. Osborne B.A. Ishida I. Robl J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), although the restricted transport of human immunoglobulins into colostrum/milk may limit their usefulness. In the present study, we have characterized the bovine IGHC gene locus, aiming to promote a better understanding of the evolution and expression of the mammalian IGHC genes. Bovine BAC and Cosmid Libraries—Bovine IGHC gene-positive BAC clones were isolated from a previously constructed BAC library (28Cai L. Taylor J.F. Wing R.A. Gallagher D.S. Woo S.S. Davis S.K. Genomics. 1995; 29: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which was generated using pBeloBAC11, a BAC vector. A bovine pWE15 cosmid library was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All screenings were carried out using a PCR procedure. The BAC and cosmid DNA was amplified in Escherichia coli, DH10B and XL1-Blue MR, respectively. The preparation of both BAC and cosmid DNA was performed using the Qiagen-tip 500 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the protocol from the manufacturer. Bovine high molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction of proteinase K-digested blood samples. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern Blotting— PFGE was used to separate large DNA fragment (CHEF-DR, III system, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The DNA was run in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (6 V/cm). The switch time was adjusted based on the size of DNA, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The separated DNA was transferred to nylon membrane for hybridization. An oligolabeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to label the probes. All hybridizations were performed with ExpressHyb hybridization solution purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Long PCR Amplifications and Sequencing—All the long PCR reactions were performed on GeneAmp PCR system 9700 using an Expand™ Long Template PCR system Kit (Roche Applied Science). Gene-specific primers were designed as following: bIgDS: 5′-AGC CCC ACA CTC GGT CCA TCA CAG A-3′, bIgG3S: 5′-CAG TGT TCC AAA TGC CCA GGT AAG T-3′, bIgG1As: 5′-TGA TGG GGA GAC TGG GTG ACT TAC G-3′, bIgG1S: 5′-CGT AAG TCA CCC AGT CTC CCC ATC A-3′, bIgG2As: 5′-CAG CCA TCC CCC TCC ACC CGC ACA C-3′, bIgG2S: 5′-GAT GGC TGC CTT GGA TGA GTG AGA C-3′, BACR7C7-Fs: 5′-CAC CTG CCT TTG CCC TGC TTT GTC T-3′, BACR7C7-Fas: 5′-AGA CAA AGC AGG GCA AAG GCA GGT G-3′, bIgELas1: 5′-TGG CTG GTG GTA ATG TAG AGA CTG G-3′, bIgELs1: 5′-AAG AGG GGC GAT GAG TTC ACC TGC CAA GTG-3′, bIgALas1: 5′-GCG GGA AGA TGC TGG GGC TGG TTT CAC TCT-3′. The two primers, BACSU (5′-GTC GCT GAT TTG TAT TGT CTG AAG T-3′) and BACSL (5′-CGC CTG GTT GCT ACG CCT GAA TAA G-3′) were derived from the BAC vector, pBeloBAC11. The common parameters for the PCR were 92 °C 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of 92 °C 10 s and 68 °C 14 min, then 20 cycles of 92 °C10 s, 68 °C for 14 min with 20-s increments per cycle were started, finally hold at 68 °C for 10 min. The extension time was adjusted according to the expected size of the PCR products. PCR products were separated on both the normal and PFGE agarose gels to determine their size. For sequencing, the PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, CA) and sequencing reactions were performed by PCR using Bigdye™ Terminator Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer, Foster, CA). Cloning and Sequencing of the Bovine Sμ Region—A genomic fragment covering the JH and Cμ1 was amplified from BAC66R4C11, and subsequently digested with KpnI and XbaI. The resulting 4.2-kb XbaI-KpnI fragment was initially cloned into the pBluescript II KS(+) vector. The recombinant plasmid was cut again, using SacI and KpnI, to generate an 800-bp SacI fragment, and an ∼3.4-kb SacI-KpnI fragment. As the 800-bp SacI fragment was directly cloned into pGEM-7Zf(+) for sequencing using T7 and Sp6 primers, the 3.4-kb SacI-KpnI fragment was inserted into pGEM-3Zf(+), and the insert was sequenced using the Erase-a-Base® System (Promega, Madison, WI). JH Segment-specific PCR—JH segment-specific PCR was conducted to investigate whether the JH genes were functional. While the common forward primer bIgVH-leaders (P1 in Fig. 4, 5′-GCT CCA AGA TGA ACC CAC TGT G-3′) is derived from the leader exon of the VH genes, both bIgJH1as (P2 in Fig. 4, 5′-GAG GAG ACG GTG ACC AGG AGT-3′) and bIgJH2as (P3 in Fig. 4, 5′-GAG GAG ACG GTG ACC TCG ATC-3′) are JH gene-specific primers. Both bovine genomic DNA (derived from blood, spleen, bone marrow) and cDNA (spleen) were employed as templates for PCR under conditions of 94 °C 3 min, then 30 cycles of 94 °C 30 s, 62 °C 30 s, 72 °C 40 s, finally hold at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were separated on an agarose gel and subsequently transferred to nylon membranes for hybridization with a bovine VH gene fragment generated by PCR from a cloned IgD heavy chain cDNA (14Zhao Y. Kacskovics I. Pan Q. Liberles D.A. Geli J. Davis S.K. Rabbani H. Hammarstrom L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using primers bIgVH-hys (5′-GTG CAG CTG CGG GAG TCA-3′) and bIgVH-hyas (5′-CTC AAC ATA AGG ACA AGC-3′). The VH gene fragment does not contain leader and JH sequences. Computational Analysis of DNA Sequences—DNA sequence homology search was carried out using the NCBI BLAST program. Sequence alignment, editing and comparison, was performed using the MegAlign program (DNASTAR, Inc, Madison, WI). The dot plot comparison was performed using the same program. Screening of the Bovine BAC and Cosmid Library—Using a PCR screening strategy, 21 μ, 18 γ3, 15 ϵ, and 1 α positive clones were isolated from the bovine pWE15 cosmid library. Out of these clones, six were shown to be positive for the μ, δ, and γ3 genes, and one clone contained both the ϵ and α genes. Four BAC clones were obtained by screening of a BAC library (28Cai L. Taylor J.F. Wing R.A. Gallagher D.S. Woo S.S. Davis S.K. Genomics. 1995; 29: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), where BAC66R4C11 contained the μ, δ, γ3, γ1 genes, BAC416R4C8 contained the μ, δ, and a part of the Cγ3 gene, BAC389R7C7 contained the γ1 and γ2 genes, while BAC412R7C5 contained only the γ1 gene according to results based on Southern blotting and PCR analysis. The NotI-digested BAC DNAs were run on a PFGE agarose gel, showing the size of the respective inserts (185, 115, 55, and 45 kb in BAC66R4C11, BAC416R4C8, BAC389R7C7, and BAC412R7C5) (Fig. 1A). The Bovine IGHC Gene Locus Is Arranged in an Order of 5′-μ–δ–γ3–γ1–γ2–ϵ–α-3′—Since it was already known that the μ and δ genes are situated most 5′ in the bovine IGHC gene locus (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhao Y. Kacskovics I. Pan Q. Liberles D.A. Geli J. Davis S.K. Rabbani H. Hammarstrom L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4408-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the co-existence of the μ, δ, and γ3 genes in some BAC and cosmid clones suggested that the γ3 gene may be the first constant region gene located downstream of the δ gene. As BAC66R4C11 contained the μ, δ, γ3, γ1 genes and BAC389 R7C7 contained the γ1 and γ2 genes, it could be concluded that the genes were arranged in a μ–δ–γ3–γ1–γ2 order. Consistent with a previous publication (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar), the ϵ and α gene were both detected in a cosmid clone, supporting the notion that the bovine IGHC gene locus is structurally similar to that of the mouse, where the ϵ and α genes are situated in the most 3′-portion of the locus. Although we did not obtain any BAC or cosmid clones containing both the γ2 and ϵ genes, the bovine IGHC gene locus is thus most likely arranged in a 5′-μ–δ–γ3–γ1–γ2–ϵ–α-3′ order on chromosome 21q23-q24. Determination of the Distances between the Bovine IGHC Genes—To determine the size of the bovine IGHC gene locus, the approximate length of the introns between the bovine IGHC genes was analyzed using long PCR amplifications and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Using the primers bIgDS and bIgG3As, bIgG3S and bIgG1as, and BAC66R4C11 as a template, 33 and 22 kb PCR products could be obtained, suggesting that the γ3 gene is located ∼33 kb downstream of the δ gene, followed by the γ1 gene, ∼20 kb further downstream. We failed to PCR amplify the DNA fragment between the γ1 and γ2 genes using BAC389R7C7, possibly reflecting a long distance between the two genes. To circumvent this problem, we amplified the DNA fragments between the BAC vector cloning sites and the two genes, where, as shown in Fig. 2B, the presence of an ∼34-kb intron between the γ1 and γ2 genes could be deduced based on the PCR results. Analysis of the ϵ and α gene positive cosmid clone also using long PCR amplifications, allowed us to determine the size of the ϵ-α intron, which was ∼13 kb. As the cosmid and BAC libraries were constructed using different cow strains, long PCR was performed using genomic DNA isolated from blood of an Angus cow, the strain employed to construct the BAC library (28Cai L. Taylor J.F. Wing R.A. Gallagher D.S. Woo S.S. Davis S.K. Genomics. 1995; 29: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The amplification generated a ∼14-kb (Fig. 1B3) band, which was consistent with the analysis of the cosmid clone. These two results also confirmed previous data from analysis of overlapping phage clones (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar). As we did not obtain any clone that contained both the γ2 and ϵ genes, there was an obvious difficulty to determine the distance between the two genes. However, a comparison with the physical maps of the human and mouse IGHC gene loci, suggested that a less than 25-kb γ2-ϵ intron would be expected. Therefore, we attempted to amplify the intron fragment employing a long PCR kit under stringent conditions, using bovine genomic DNA as a template. A weak 20-kb PCR fragment was seen after separating the PCR reactions on an agarose gel, indicating that the size of the bovine γ2-ϵ intron is probably not largely different from those of humans and mice. To confirm this conclusion, we analyzed the clone BAC389R7C7, which was found to contain ∼8 kb of sequence downstream of the γ2 gene. We thus sequenced BAC389R7C7 from its 3′ end to close to the γ2 gene and designed a new primer BACR7C7-Fas, which was based on the sequence ∼8-kb downstream of the γ2 gene. The primers BACR7C7-Fas and bIgELas1 yielded a 13-kb PCR product when using the bovine genomic DNA (Angus) as a template (Fig. 1B2), suggesting that the size of the γ2-ϵ intron is ∼20 kb. Thus, in summary, the bovine IGHC gene locus is arranged sequentially in the following order: 5′-μ–5 kb–δ–33 kb–γ3–20 kb–γ1–34 kb–γ2–20 kb–ϵ–13 kb–α-3′, spanning roughly 150 kb contiguous DNA on chromosome 21 (Fig. 2A). The Three γ Genes Can All Be Functionally Expressed but at Different Levels—It is well known that the γ1 and γ2 genes are functionally expressed at the protein level, as both the IgG1 and IgG2 can be detected in bovine serum (29Butler J.E. Heyermann H. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The γ3 gene has only shown to be functionally expressed in vitro (7Knight K.L. Suter M. Becker R.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3654-3659PubMed Google Scholar), but the gene can be at least transcribed in vivo, as the γ3 encoding cDNA could be cloned from a bovine spleen cDNA library (12Rabbani H. Brown W.R. Butler J.E. Hammarstrom L. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A large bovine EST data base containing ∼319,775 EST clones (Jun 8, 2003), is available in NCBI GenBank™. Principally, the abundance of genes in the EST data base would roughly reflect their transcriptional levels, as almost all sequences in the EST data base have been obtained by sequencing of randomly picked clones from cDNA libraries. Although the EST sequences are derived from a variety of tissues, we do not expect transcription of immunoglobulin genes in non-lymphoid cells. By searching the NCBI bovine EST data base, more than 55 γ1, 27 γ2, and 11 γ3 EST clones were identified. In addition, 35 clones were found that could not unambiguously be identified as γ1 or γ2. These data indicate that the γ3 gene is transcribed at a lower level than those of the other γ genes. In addition, more than 82 μ, 5 δ, 74 α, and 2 ϵ EST clones could be identified in the data base, suggesting that both the δ and ϵ genes are expressed at very low levels in cows. The Bovine JH Locus Has Two Functional JH Genes—To analyze the bovine JH germline sequence and 5′ Eμ intronic enhancer region, a ∼7-kb DNA fragment, spanning a part of the JH locus and Cμ from the BAC clone 66R4C11 was amplified and sequenced (AY158087). Another 2.6 kb further up-stream sequence was also cloned to ensure that the germline JH locus was identified in its entirety. In the ∼2 kb of sequence (AY158087), only two potentially functional JH genes, termed JH1 and JH2, were identified, 862 bp apart, encoding 15 and 17 amino acids respectively (Fig. 3). The two JH segments share a five amino acid motif, VTVSS, at their 3′-ends. A BLAST search of the NCBI GenBank™ and bovine EST data base suggests that the JH1 is the only JH used in hitherto reported bovine VH sequences. More than 84 clones in the NCBI Genbank™, and 150 clones from the bovine EST data base were found to contain the JH1 segment, suggesting that the JH2 may represent a pseudogene. However, a close examination of the flanking sequences of JH1 and JH2 shows that they exhibit almost the same 5′-recombination signal sequences and 3′-donor splice sites, although a large sequence difference can be observed in the spacer regions between the heptamer and nonamer. To prove whether the JH2 gene is at all functional or not in vivo, bovine genomic DNA and cDNA were both subjected to JH specific PCR as indicated in Fig. 4. Primer P1 (bIgVH-Leaders) is derived from the leader exon of the bovine VH genes and supposed to be conserved within most expressed bovine VH genes based on a comparison of VH sequences (data not shown). The two JH-specific primers, P2 (bIgJH1as) and P3 (bIgJH2as) were designed based on the JH1 and JH2 sequences (Fig. 4B). Theoretically, if VH and DH genes recombine to the JH1 gene, the primer combination P1 and P2 should generate ∼500-bp PCR products (Fig. 4A1). In this case, the primer combination P1 and P3 should also be able to yield ∼1.3-kb PCR products (Fig. 4A1). On the other hand, if the JH2 gene is functional in vivo and a recombination of VH and DH genes to the JH2 occurs, the primers P1 and P3 would also amplify ∼500 bp rearranged genomic VDJ fragments (Fig. 4A2). As shown in Fig. 4C, the PCR results clearly showed that at the genomic level, VH and DH genes recombine to both the JH1 and JH2 genes in bovine B cells. However, the recombination rate to the JH2 is much lower than that of the JH1 according to the intensity of the PCR bands generated using bovine spleen, blood, and bone marrow genomic DNA as templates (Fig. 4C). Both the recombined VDJH1 and VDJH2 genomic fragments can be normally transcribed and spliced, as we could amplify VDJH1 and VDJH2 fragments at the cDNA level. The nature of the PCR products in Fig. 4C was proven by hybridization using a bovine VH gene probe (data not shown). These data thus indicate that the JH2 is expressed but at a low level. Four ovine JH pseudogenes have previously been identified in a ∼2-kb DNA region containing the two functional JH genes (30Dufour V. Nau F. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the bovine JH locus, there are also four JH pseudogenes corresponding to the ovine JH segments (Fig. 3), where the RSS and 3′-donor splice sites for the four pseudo-JH segments have diverged from the canonical sequences (Table I).Table IRSS and splice sites for the bovine JH genesJ segmentsNonamerSpacerHeptamer3′ Splicing siteJH-PS1GGTTTCCGT21 bpCACTGTGnoJH-PS2TGTTTTTGT22 bpAGCCATGnoJH-PS3GGTTCATGT23 bpCCCTCAGyesJH-PS4GAGCTCTTG22 bpCACCGTGnoJH1GGTTTTTGC23 bpCACTGTGyesJH2GGTTTTTGT22 bpCACTGTGyes Open table in a new tab The Bovine 5′ Ig Intronic Enhancer—The putative bovine 5′ Eμ intronic enhancer was identified through a comparison of the bovine JH-Cμ intron sequence with other well studied mammalian Eμ enhancers. As shown in Fig. 5A, the bovine 5′ Eμ enhancer core region shows a conserved organization, where several nuclear binding motifs, μE1–μE5–μE2–μA–μB–μE4–O (octamer motif), are tightly clustered in a very short region. The most striking feature of the bovine 5′ enhancer core region is that the space between the μA and μB motifs is shorter than in other mammalian 5′ Eμ enhancers (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, AT-rich sequences, which are supposed to be matrix attachment region (MAR), could be identified at either side of the bovine Eμ enhancer core region as previously noted both in humans and mice. Characterization of the Bovine Switch mu (Sμ) Region—The Sμ region is located upstream of the Cμ gene in mammals. The region is involved in switching to the production of other antibody classes, downstream of the Cμ, through non-homologous recombination. A dot plot analysis of the bovine JH-Cμ genomic intron revealed a ∼3-kb repetitive region (4380–7380, accession number: AY158087) abundant in switch region motifs (CTGGG and CTGAG) similar to both the human and mouse Sμ regions (Fig. 6, A, D, and E). The 3-kb bovine Sμ, containing ∼187 CTGGG and 127 CTGAG repeats, is slightly shorter than the human Sμ(3.5 kb) but double as long as the mouse Sμ(1.5 kb). The longest repeats that contain the 123-bp DNA fragment (5865–5987, 6053–6175, accession number: AY158087). Another 87-bp long repeat is located from 5918 to 6004 and again from 6012 to 6098. In addition, a 24-bp long sequence (GGCAGAGTGGGTGAGCTGGGCTGA) appears dispersed as 9 repeats within the bovine Sμ. It was previously proposed that immunoglobulin switch regions are rich in palindromic and stem-loop structures, which serve as targets of switch recombination (31Tashiro J. Kinoshita K. Honjo T. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A dot plot comparison of the bovine JH-Cμ intron and its reverse complementary sequence indicates that the bovine Sμ is indeed abundant in palindromic sequences (Fig. 6B). Bovine Immunoglobulin Allotypes—The bovine IGHC gene sequences obtained in this study were found to contain polymorphic sequences as compared with previously published cDNA or genomic DNA, suggesting allotypic variants. Most strikingly, a bovine δ heavy chain cDNA transcript lacking the δCH2 exon, probably resulting from alternative RNA splicing, was identified based on RT-PCR amplification of bovine spleen-derived RNA (32Tucker P.W. Liu C.P. Mushinski J.F. Blattner F.R. Science. 1980; 209: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicating that there could be two different IgD molecules expressed on the surface of the bovine B cells. The CH2 domain, lacking IgD molecule has previously been only found in rodents (where the CH2-encoding exon has been deleted in the rodent germline δ sequences). The biological significance of the co-presence of these two IgD heavy chain molecules in cows remains unclear. We have previously reported the genomic sequences of both the bovine μ and ϵ genes (8Mousavi M. Rabbani H. Pilstrom L. Hammarstrom L. Immunology. 1998; 93: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Mousavi M. Rabbani H. Hammarstrom L. Immunology. 1997; 92: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Extensive DNA polymorphisms, as summarized in Table II, were found in the coding regions of both genes. Furthermore, sequence variants of the γ1 and γ2 hinge regions were also identified based on a BLAST search of the bovine ETS data base at NCBI (Fig. 7).Table IIPolymorphism of the μ and ϵ genesGeneSequence positionDNA varianceAmino acid substitutionCompared to26 (CH1)A → GM → VU6363734 (CH1)C → GNo changeU6363775 (CH1)A → GQ → RU6363783 (CH1)A → GM → VU63637131 (CH1)G → AG → SU63637159 (CH1)C → AA → EU63637299 (CH1)G → AV → IU63637302 (CH1)A → GT → AU63637305 (CH1)C → AP → TU63637μ388 (CH2)A → GNo changeU63637403 (CH2)C → ANo changeU63637404 (CH2)A → GI → VU63637547 (CH2)C → ANo changeU63637622 (CH2)A → GNo changeU63637627 (CH2)A → GK → RU63637710 (CH2)A → GN → DU636371131 (CH3)T → GNo changeU636371139 (CH3)G → AG → EU636371141 (CH3)A → CNo changeU636371264 (CH3)A → GT → AU63637219 (CH1)T → CS → PUF63640249 (CH1)C → GP → AUF63640293 (CH2)T → CNo changeUF63640338 (CH2)A → CNo changeUF63640ϵ441 (CH2)C → AO → KUF63640730 (CH3)T → CNo changeUF63640904 (CH3)A → GNo changeUF636401100-1101 (CH4)ACCΔTΔUF636401213 (CH4)C → TNo changeUF63640 Open table in a new tab The combination of restriction mapping of bovine IGHC genes, positive BAC clones and long PCR amplifications, have allowed us to conclude that the bovine IGHC"

When the proteases could not cut at their sites in the C-terminal regulatory region, the interaction was judged to be tight. This was the case in the absence of Ca2+, when chymotrypsin and caspase cut PMCA only very slowly. Ca2+ accelerated the fragmentation, but the digestion remained incomplete. In the presence of Ca2+ plus calmodulin, the digestion became nearly complete in all cases, indicating a more flexible conformation of the carboxyl terminus in the fully activated state. The acceleration of proteolysis by Ca2+ or Ca2+ plus calmodulin occurred equally at the caspase site upstream of the calmodulin-binding domain and the chymotrypsin and calpain sites downstream of that domain. Replacing Trp1093 (a key residue within the calmodulin-binding domain) with alanine had a much more specific effect, because it exposed only proteolytic sites within the calmodulin-binding domain that had previously been shielded in the native protein. At these sites, both calpain and chymotrypsin cut the Trp1093 → Ala mutant in the absence of calmodulin. These data indicate that, in the auto-inhibited conformation, the calmodulin-binding/auto-inhibitory sequence and the regions both upstream and downstream are in close contact with the catalytic core. Trp1093 plays an essential role not only in stabilizing the Ca2+-calmodulin/calmodulin-binding domain complex but also in the formation or stability of the inhibitory conformation of that domain when it interacts with the catalytic core of PMCA4b.

The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase or pump (ATP2B1-4, referred to here as PMCA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-ethane sulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ct (followed by amino acid sequence position number), C-terminally truncated (mutant). is a P-type ATPase that is an essential element of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Its role is to remove excess Ca2+ from the cell in order to maintain the large Ca2+ concentration gradient existing between the cytosol and the extracellular space. This pump is encoded by four different genes, and further diversity is produced by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts at two different sites (1Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Isoforms PMCA1 and 4 are ubiquitous, whereas the expression of PMCA2 and 3 are more cell- and tissue-specific. The activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is regulated by calmodulin. It has a unique carboxyl terminus that is responsible for the regulation. A high affinity, ∼28-residue calmodulin-binding sequence is located within this region, which is also a built-in inhibitor of the enzyme (2Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Removing the carboxyl terminus either by proteolysis or truncation by mutagenesis causes full activation of the pump similar to that caused by calmodulin (4Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides representing the calmodulin-binding sequence were able to restore the inhibition when added to the fully active forms (2Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12313-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments using synthetic peptides have revealed that the N-terminal half of this sequence interacts with the large cytoplasmic loop (N domain), whereas the C-terminal part interacts with the small cytoplasmic loop (A domain) of the catalytic core (5Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

These interactions must interfere with the movements of the A and N domains during the reaction cycle so that, in the absence of calmodulin, the pump has low affinity for its substrate Ca2+ and a low maximal turnover rate. Binding of Ca2+-calmodulin to the pump removes the inhibitor from this interaction, allowing high affinity substrate binding and the reaction cycle to proceed with full speed. The PMCA isoforms show great diversity in their regulation with calmodulin. They have different basal activities, different affinities for calmodulin, and different rates of activation and inactivation in response to calmodulin binding and dissociation (8Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á.

Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Among the isoforms, PMCA4b has the lowest basal activity and the greatest stimulation by calmodulin. An important feature of this pump is that binding of calmodulin followed by activation is very slow, with a half-time of ∼20–60 s depending on the Ca2+ concentration (11Caride A.J. Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Bajzer Z. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39797-39804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The inactivation by calmodulin removal is even slower, with a half-time of about 20 min. These features of PMCA4b suggest that it is actively involved in the developing, shaping, and duration of the Ca2+ signal; it allows the first Ca2+ spike to develop for several seconds before becoming activated and remains activated for several minutes after the spike is dissipated so that it will respond to the next spike much faster. The low basal activity of the PMCA4b isoform indicates that the interaction between the carboxyl terminus and the catalytic core is very strong. We have shown that Trp1093 within the calmodulin-binding sequence is an essential anchor for the auto-inhibitory interaction as well as for the interaction with calmodulin. Changing this residue to an alanine increased the basal activity in the absence of calmodulin, the rate of calmodulin activation, and, more dramatically, the rate of inactivation by calmodulin removal (12Penheiter A.R. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17728-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to the calmodulin-binding sequence, regions both upstream and downstream provide additional anchor points for the auto-inhibitory interaction. Replacing Asp1080 five residues upstream of the calmodulin-binding sequence (13Pászty K. Penheiter A.R. Verma A.K. Padanyi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) caused substantial activation of the pump. We have to emphasize that any change made within the carboxyl terminus that increased the basal activity also increased the rate of activation by calmodulin. Controlled proteolysis of the purified and membrane-bound erythrocyte Ca2+ pump (which is mainly PMCA4b) has revealed several sites at the carboxyl terminus that are cut by proteases such as trypsin (14Zvaritch E. James P. Vorherr T. Falchetto R. Modyanov N. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8070-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), chymotrypsin (2Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J.

Biophys. 1988; 260: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Morelli A. Castello G. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. DeFlora A. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

J. 1991; 279: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and, more recently, caspase-3 (18Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Among these proteases, chymotrypsin, calpain, and caspase-3 cut the protein preferentially at the carboxyl terminus. The N-terminal fragments were all fully or partially active depending on what portion of the carboxyl terminus was removed. Irreversible activation of the erythrocyte Ca2+ ATPase by calpain has been reported (15Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the absence of calmodulin, the pump was proteolyzed to a group of fragments of 124–125 kDa, whereas in the presence of calmodulin a 127-kDa fragment was identified. A later study using a purified erythrocyte pump or synthetic peptides determined the cleavage sites and found that all were located within the calmodulin-binding domain (16James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Morelli A. Castello G. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. DeFlora A. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8289-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In more recent experiments, we have demonstrated that PMCA4b is also cut by caspase-3 during the early phase of apoptosis (18Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs immediately downstream of Asp1080, removing the whole regulatory region and producing a fully active 120-kDa fragment. In this study three different proteases, i.e. calpain, chymotrypsin, and caspase-3, were used to digest PMCA4b in membrane preparations from COS cells over-expressing PMCA4b. Because all three proteases cut the pump at the carboxyl terminus, conformational changes of this region induced by Ca2+ and Ca2+-calmodulin could be monitored by limited proteolysis. We found that the accessibility of the proteolytic sites depended strongly on the conformational state of this protein. The sites within the calmodulin-binding domain were all shielded either by the autoinhibitory interactions with the catalytic core or the interaction with calmodulin. Sites within this sequence became accessible only when a key residue, Trp1093, was mutated to an alanine. The proteolytic sites upstream and downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain were somewhat more exposed in the auto-inhibited state; however, they became fully accessible only after calmodulin binding. Chemicals—Calmodulin and α-chymotrypsin were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant caspase-3 was from Upstate Biotechnology, and μ-calpain was obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals used for this study were of reagent grade. Construction of Trp1093 → Ala—The construction of the Trp1093 → Ala mutant is described in our previous paper (12Penheiter A.R. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17728-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The expression vector used was pMM2, which was derived from pMT2PC (19Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and uses the SV40 promoter. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. All cells were kept at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. COS cells were transfected as described previously (9Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) based on the protocol as described by the manufacturer. Transfection using 175-cm2 flasks was initiated when the cells were 70–80% confluent. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with a DNA-LipofectAMINE complex (formed by incubating 8 μg DNA and 100 μl LipofectAMINE in 3.6 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium for 30 min) in 14.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium. After 5 h of incubation, the cells were supplemented with serum, and incubation was continued for a total of 24 h. The medium containing the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex was then replaced with fresh tissue culture medium with 10% serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Isolation of Microsomes from COS Cells—Crude microsomal membranes from COS cells were prepared as described previously (4Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and then harvested in the same medium containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in an ice-cold hypotonic solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. After lysis, homogenization, and centrifugation, the final pellet was resuspended in a solution of 0.25 m sucrose, 0.15 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm CaCl2, and the suspension was stored in liquid N2. In Vitro Digestion with Recombinant Caspase-3—10 μg of microsomal membrane vesicles isolated from COS cells transfected with the appropriate construct were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl medium containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm TES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 0.09 mm EGTA, 8.5% sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (10 μm free Ca2+; when added), and 485 nm calmodulin (when added). The proteolysis was started by the addition of 0.25 μg of recombinant caspase-3 and stopped by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (6% final concentration). The precipitate was supplemented with 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, washed once with distilled water, and then dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer. In Vitro Digestion with μ-Calpain or Chymotrypsin—10 μg of microsomal membrane vesicles isolated from COS cells transfected with the appropriate construct were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl medium containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm TES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm CaCl2 (100 μm free Ca2+; when added), 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 485 nm calmodulin (when added). The proteolysis was initiated by the addition of 5 μg/ml μ-calpain or 0.05 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin and stopped by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (6% final concentration). The precipitate was supplemented with 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, washed once with distilled water, and then dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer. Gel Electrophoresis, Electrotransfer, and Immunostaining—The samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% acrylamide gel following Laemmli's procedure except that the sample buffer contained 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 125 mg/ml urea. The samples were subsequently electro-blotted, and the blots were immunostained by the antibody 5F10. The constructs and their fragments were quantified using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager system. Structural Model of PMCA4b—The sequence of PMCA4b was aligned with that of SERCA1a using a combination of computer methods and accumulated knowledge about the properties of different parts of the pump sequences. This alignment was then processed with the program MODELLER 6.2 (20Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), using the SERCA1a structure files 1EUL (SERCA E1) or 1IWO (SERCA E2), taken from the Protein Data Bank (21Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 22Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). PMCA4b was expressed in COS cells, and limited proteolysis was performed in native COS cell membranes at 37 °C. We used caspase-3, chymotrypsin, and calpain digestion of PMCA4b to study conformational changes induced by Ca2+ and Ca2+-calmodulin. These proteases cut the C-terminal regulatory region of PMCA4b within a short segment (about 40–50 residues) downstream of Asp1080. Following proteolysis, the samples were run on SDS-gels and immunoblotted. The immunoblots shown in the figures were stained with the antibody 5F10. 5F10 recognizes a linear epitope from residues 719–738 that is common to all known human PMCA gene products and splicing variants. To verify that the pump was cut C-terminally, Western blot analysis was also performed with two PMCA4-specific antibodies (data not shown). The monoclonal antibody JA9 reacts specifically with PMCA isoform 4 near the N terminus within residues 51–75, whereas monoclonal antibody JA3 binds near the C terminus from residues 1156–1180 (23Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All of the proteolytic fragments detected by 5F10 were also detected by JA9; however, JA3 did not recognize any of the fragments. The antibody results indicate that all three proteases cut PMCA4b at the C terminus upstream of the JA3 recognition sequence. The sizes of the fragments were determined by comparing their electrophoretic mobilities to those of C-terminally truncated mutants ct120, ct92, and ct71 (Fig. 1). These PMCA4b mutants are missing 120, 92, or 71 residues from the C terminus (24Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Fig. 2A shows the fragmentation of PMCA4b by the different proteases, and Fig. 2B shows the relative electrophoretic mobility of the same fragments as compared with that of the truncated mutants. The calpain digest produced two N-terminal fragments. The larger fragment migrated close to the position of ct71, whereas the smaller fragment migrated close to that of ct92. Based on relative mobility, the calculated molecular masses of the fragments were 125 and 124 kDa, respectively. These results indicated that one calpain cut site is ∼20 residues downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain, and a second site is located close to the C-terminal end of the calmodulin-binding domain (Fig. 1). The chymotrypsin digest produced one major N-terminal fragment of 124.5 kDa, which is smaller than ct71 but larger than ct92. Thus, the chymotryptic cut site must also be located downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain between Ser1113 and Pro1134. Based on the estimated molecular weight of the fragment, the most likely position of the chymotryptic cut site is after Tyr1122 as indicated in Fig. 1. A more precise determination of the cut sites by N-terminal sequencing of the small fragments was not possible, because <1% of the total membrane protein is accounted for by the expressed PMCA. We have to emphasize that mild conditions were used to produce these fragments. In the case of chymotrypsin especially, increasing concentrations of the protease or longer digestions induced further fragmentation of the protein. As also shown in Fig. 2, the caspase-3 digest produced a single N-terminal fragment of 120 kDa even after prolonged incubations, because PMCA4b contains only one caspase consensus site, Asp1077-Glu-Ile-Asp1080, which is located five residues upstream of the calmodulin-binding domain (Fig. 1). In a previous paper, we have demonstrated that caspase-3 cuts immediately after Asp1080 (18Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Next, we studied the effects of Ca2+-calmodulin and free Ca2+ on the fragmentation of the pump. In the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin, the pump is in an inhibited (closed) state and has very low activity and low affinity for its substrate, Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin, the pump is in an activated (open) state with high activity and high Ca2+ affinity. In addition to the open and closed states of the pump, an equilibrium exists between the E2 and E1 catalytic conformations. Low concentrations of Ca2+ shift the E2-E1 equilibrium more toward E1 (25Adamo H.P. Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3789-3792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Figs. 3 and 4 show the fragmentation of PMCA4b with caspase-3 and chymotrypsin. These proteases do not require Ca2+ for activity; therefore, we could study the fragmentation of PMCA4b in the absence of Ca2+ (in the presence of EGTA). These figures show that, in the absence of Ca2+, both caspase-3 and chymotryptic cleavage sites are protected from proteolysis because very little fragmentation was seen under these conditions. The addition of Ca2+ to the incubation media substantially increased the fragmentation. However, only ∼30–40% of the protein could be digested even after prolonged incubation, indicating that 60–70% of the protein remained protected from cleavage. Binding of Ca2+-calmodulin, on the other hand, exposed the cleavage sites, and fragmentation became complete with both caspase-3 and chymotrypsin. Fig. 3A shows some intact protein remaining at 3 h of digestion with caspase-3; this intact material disappeared completely after longer exposure to the protease (not shown). Fig. 3B shows the progressive formation of the 120-kDa fragment in the presence of calmodulin by caspase-3. Fig. 4B also shows a more progressive time-dependent accumulation of the chymotryptic 124.5-kDa fragment in the presence of calmodulin; however, only a maximum of 60% of the total protein was converted to this fragment because of further degradation (smaller fragments are not shown).Fig. 4In vitro digestion of PMCA4b by chymotrypsin. 10 μg of the microsomal membrane preparation of PMCA4b-expressing COS cells were digested with chymotrypsin in the absence of Ca2+ (EGTA), the presence of Ca2+ (Ca2 +), and the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin (Ca2 + + CaM) for the times indicated. A, 1 μg of each sample was loaded onto the gel and immunoblotted with the anti-PMCA antibody 5F10. A typical experiment is shown. B, the amount of the 124.5-kDa fragment was quantified using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager system. The time course of the formation of the 124.5-kDa fragment is shown in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin (solid circles), Ca2+ (solid triangles), and EGTA (solid squares). Means ± S.E. of two independent determinations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 shows the degradation of PMCA4b by μ-calpain. Calpain requires Ca2+ for activity; therefore, only the effect of Ca2+-calmodulin on digestion could be tested. In the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin, calpain produced two fragments (125 and 124 kDa); however, the digestion was incomplete. In the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin, the 124-kDa fragment was not seen, although the formation of the125-kDa fragment became more pronounced, resulting in a nearly complete disappearance of the intact protein by the end of the digestion. These data indicate that Ca2+-calmodulin binding protects the calmodulin-binding site from calpain cleavage but exposes the cleavage site downstream. Mutating Trp1093 to an alanine has been shown to increase the basal activity of PMCA4b by 3-fold (12Penheiter A.R. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17728-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6 we show that chymotrypsin and calpain cut the Trp1093 mutant more readily in the absence of calmodulin and that its cleavage pattern is rather different from that of the wild type. With calpain, the 124-kDa fragment became predominant in the absence of calmodulin, indicating that the cleavage site within the calmodulin-binding domain is more exposed in the mutant. With chymotrypsin the change in the pattern was even more dramatic. Presumably, the mutation of Trp1093 exposed a site that was otherwise inaccessible in the wild type pump. The new chymotryptic fragment is slightly smaller than ct92, with an estimated molecular mass of 123 kDa. The most likely cleavage site is after Phe1094 within the calmodulin-binding domain that is protected from proteolysis when Ca2+-calmodulin is bound to the mutant. We also tested whether mutation at Trp1093 affected the accessibility of the cleavage sites upstream (caspase-3) or downstream (calpain and chymotrypsin) of the calmodulin-binding domain. The digestion of the mutant with caspase-3 was very similar to that of the wild type (not shown), as the fragmentation of the mutant was highly dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. This indicated that mutation at Trp1093 did not affect the accessibility of the caspase-3 cleavage site. To test the downstream cut sites, we studied the digestion of the proteins by calpain in the absence of calmodulin. Fig. 7 shows a time course of the formation of the 125- and 124-kDa calpain fragments. Fragmentation of the wild type protein resulted in a small amount of the 124 kDa fragment (∼10% of the total enzyme) and somewhat more of the 125 kDa fragment (∼20%). Mutation of Trp1093 to an alanine increased the formation of the 124-kDa calpain fragment ∼3-fold but did not affect or even decreased the formation of the 125-kDa fragment. Similar results were obtained with chymotrypsin (data not shown). The results with calpain and chymotrypsin indicated that mutation at Trp1093 did not affect the accessibility of the downstream cut sites but increased the accessibility of the sites within the calmodulin-binding sequence. It is widely known that the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is regulated by calmodulin. At its carboxyl terminus it has a high-affinity calmodulin-binding sequence that also serves as an auto-inhibitor. Previous studies have predicted that in the absence of calmodulin, i.e. in the inhibited or closed conformation, the calmodulin-binding inhibitory sequence interacts with the catalytic core. By using site-directed mutagenesis it has been demonstrated that regions both upstream and downstream of this sequence are also involved in the auto-inhibition. The limited proteolysis experiments described above were aimed at identifying the conformational changes accompanying Ca2+-calmodulin binding to PMCA4b in order to further understand the role of the carboxyl terminus in the regulation of the activity of this pump. Conformational changes induced by Ca2+-calmodulin binding to the calmodulin-binding site, predicted on the basis of these experiments, are illustrated in Fig. 8. Three proteases with different substrate specificities were used to digest PMCA4b in its natural membrane environment. It has been demonstrated that all three proteases cut the pump near the carboxyl terminus (2Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that caspase-3, a key protease of apoptosis, cuts the protein five residues upstream of the calmodulin-binding sequence after Asp1080. This cut removes the whole inhibitory region and produces a single 120-kDa N-terminal fragment that is fully active without calmodulin (18Pászty K. Verma A.K. Padányi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6822-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We also showed that Asp1080 is essential in auto-inhibition, because mutation of this residue increased the basal activity substantially (13Pászty K. Penheiter A.R. Verma A.K. Padanyi R. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Enyedi Á. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36146-36151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that digestion of PMCA4b at this site is highly conformation-dependent. In the presence of EGTA, when the E2-E1 equilibrium is shifted more toward the E2 conformation, this site is completely protected. In the presence of Ca2+ in the E1 conformation,this site seems more exposed, and the pump becomes partially degraded by the protease. Binding of Ca2+-calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding sequence induces a larger conformational change that fully exposes Asp1080 to the protease so that the digestion is complete. This suggests that the carboxyl terminus of PMCA4b should be protected from caspase-3 like proteases in non-stimulated cells at low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ followed by calmodulin binding is needed to cleave PMCA4b by caspase-3 during apoptosis. Calpain and chymotrypsin were used to map the region downstream of the calmodulin-binding sequence of PMCA4b. Within this region, between residues Ser1113 and Pro1134 we identified one major cut site for each protease. Digestion of the protein at these sites also depended on the apparent conformational state similar to that seen with caspase-3. In the presence of EGTA, no digestion with chymotrypsin could be seen, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ the cut sites were more exposed, and the pump became partially degraded by either calpain or chymotrypsin. Full digestion, however, was observed only in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin. These data suggest that, in the auto-inhibited or closed conformation, the sequences both upstream and downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain interact with the catalytic core that makes the proteolytic sites fully or partially resistant to proteolysis, depending on the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 configurations. In addition to the major cut site, digestion with calpain has revealed another site closer to the calmodulin-binding sequence. This cut site, however, is only weakly exposed in the absence of calmodulin, whereas it is completely shielded by calmodulin binding. Based on the size of this fragment we concluded that the cut site must be located near the end of the calmodulin-binding sequence. Carboxyl-terminal sequencing of the calpain fragments derived from the erythrocyte Ca2+ pump (mainly PMCA4b) has revealed two additional sites within the calmodulin-binding sequence (16James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Morelli A. Castello G. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. DeFlora A. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8289-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In those experiments, the digestion was carried out in the absence of calmodulin on ice and for long incubation times. When we digested the erythrocyte pump in its natural environment in the membrane under the same conditions used in our experiments, the sizes of the fragments were identical to those of the fragments of the over-expressed protein in COS cells (not shown in detail). Thus, the over-expressed protein showed a similar proteolytic pattern as the pump native to erythrocytes. To determine why we did not see the additional fragments seen by others, we also digested these pumps on ice for 30 min (not shown in detail) and found that more fragments smaller than ct92 but bigger than ct120 were formed when the protease was calpain. When chymotrypsin was used, one fragment migrating faster than ct92 could be identified in addition to that seen at 37 °C. These results indicated that, at low temperatures, the sites within the calmodulin-binding sequence are more exposed to proteolysis than at 37 °C. It has to be emphasized that in the presence of calmodulin, these smaller fragments could not be detected even after digestion at 0 °C, and only the typical fragments that were seen at 37 °C were detected using either calpain or chymotrypsin. In previous experiments the calpain cut site in the presence of calmodulin was identified using synthetic peptides representing the calmodulin-binding sequence (16James P. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Morelli A. Castello G. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. DeFlora A. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8289-8296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that case it is evident that calpain cut the enzyme within this sequence, because the native cut site was missing from the peptides. Our data show that the whole calmodulin-binding sequence is protected against proteolysis in the native enzyme at 37 °C either in the absence or presence of calmodulin. In the absence of calmodulin this sequence must be shielded by intra-molecular interactions with the catalytic core. Binding of calmodulin induces a conformational change, allowing activation of the pump and exposing sites both upstream and downstream of the calmodulin-binding sequence, although it remains protected by the interaction with calmodulin. We reported previously that replacing Trp1093, a key residue within the calmodulin-binding sequence, increased the basal activity of the pump while lowering its affinity for calmodulin (12Penheiter A.R. Caride A.J. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17728-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The higher basal activity observed in the mutant indicates a less effective interaction between the calmodulin-binding sequence and the catalytic core. Here we demonstrated that the calmodulin-binding sequence became more flexible and that sites otherwise inaccessible became more exposed to proteolysis in the mutant. With calpain the smaller fragment became predominant, whereas with chymotrypsin a new fragment was formed when proteolysis was performed in the absence of calmodulin. Based on the relative mobility of these fragments, the most probable chymotryptic cut site is after Phe1094, whereas the calpain cut site is located near the end of the calmodulin-binding sequence. Binding of calmodulin to the mutant protected these sites from the proteases, which is also consistent with the notion that these sites must be located within the calmodulin-binding sequence. Digestion at the sites upstream and downstream of the calmodulin-binding sequence was not affected by the mutation, indicating that the effect of the mutant was very local and specific. Even though it loosened the binding to the catalytic core of the immediate surroundings of the mutant, its effect did not extend to the regions upstream and downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain. This was in contrast to the more global effects of calmodulin and Ca2+. These experiments confirm that Trp1093 has an essential role in the auto-inhibitory interaction of the calmodulin-binding sequence with the catalytic core. Comparing the crystal structure of the SERCA pump in the E1 versus E2 conformation (21Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 22Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), it is evident that the pump undergoes large-scale movements involving both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Based on the structural homology between SERCA and PMCA, we may hypothesize how binding of the inhibitory calmodulin-binding sequence to the catalytic core inhibits the activity of PMCA. Cross-linking experiments using synthetic peptides representing the sequence of the calmodulin-binding region of PMCA have identified two sites for the interaction; one is located within the nucleotide binding or N domain downstream of the phosphoenzyme forming aspartic acid (between residues 537–544), and the other is between residues 206–271 within the actuator or A domain (5Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2930-2936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two binding sites are in regions that are homologous between SERCA and PMCA, so it is possible to draw valid conclusions by consideration of a model of PMCA based on the structure of SERCA. When such a model is constructed, it is evident that the two binding sites move relative to each other during the enzyme cycle. The binding site in the N domain is in a region whose maximum dimension is about 1.8 nm. Because the exact location of the binding site in the A domain was not well defined by the cross-linking study, the binding site could be anywhere within a region defined approximately by a sphere of 3.2 nm diameter. In the E2 state, this large sphere of possible binding locations in the A domain comes within 1.2 nm of the binding site in the N domain. In the E1 state the binding sites move apart, and the minimum distance between them is 2.5 nm. Although our present uncertainty about the location of the binding site in the A domain does not allow us to define more accurately the distances between the sites, it is clear that they move relative to one another during the enzyme cycle. Binding of the inhibitory sequence to the N domain and the A domain would interfere with the movements of these domains and slow down the reaction cycle, thus inhibiting the activity of PMCA. The possible role of the regions upstream and downstream of the calmodulin-binding sequence is to stabilize the auto-inhibited conformation. This model is also supported by previous observations that synthetic peptides similar to those used in the cross-linking experiments were able to inhibit efficiently the activity of the SERCA pump (26Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17120-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic patterns obtained with the three proteases verify the conformational changes associated with E1/E2 conformation. We found that, in the presence of EGTA (which favors the E2 conformation), the carboxyl terminus of PMCA was completely resistant to proteolysis, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ the cut sites were somewhat more exposed. Full digestion was observed only in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin. Our data agree very well with the idea that the A and N domains move relative to one another as the enzyme goes between the E1 and E2 conformation. In the E2 conformation, the inhibitory region is tightly bound to the catalytic core so that it forms a compact structure together with the A and N domains, preventing access of these proteases to their cut sites. In the E1 configuration, where the A and N domains are more separated, this binding could be weaker, allowing some flexibility of the C-terminal region and thus exposing more of the proteolytic sites. Removal of the contact points that anchor the C terminus to the catalytic core by site-directed mutagenesis (changing Asp1080 or Trp1093 to alanine or truncating the downstream inhibitory sequence) may perturb this interaction, resulting in a higher basal activity as has been observed (3Verma A.K.

The effect of these mutations appeared to be very local and specific, because mutation of Asp1080 did not affect the proteolytic sites downstream, and mutation of Trp1093 exposed cut sites only in its immediate surroundings. Binding of Ca2+-calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding sequence has a more global effect on the structure; it displaces the whole inhibitory region, making the carboxyl terminus more flexible. As a result, in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin the proteolytic sites are more sensitive to proteases, and the pump is fully active. We thank Krisztina Lór for skillful technical assistance."

Conformational changes in the C-terminal structure upon coupling to the receptor may play a role in the activation process. Other regions of the α subunit determining coupling selectivity are the extreme N terminus (16Kostenis E. Zeng F. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the region between the α4 and α5 helices, which includes the L9 loop and β6 sheet (17Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). This latter region is involved in the coupling selectivity, probably by interacting directly with either class I receptors (rhodopsin-like family) during activation (8Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P.

On the receptor side, several intracellular portions are involved in the selective coupling to G-proteins. These have been extensively studied in class I GPCRs and include both the i2 and i3 loops, as well as the amphipathic helix, called H8 (and referred to previously as the i4 loop) and the C-terminal tail of the receptor (3Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 22Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). For example, studies using the splice variants of prostanoid receptors pointed to the C terminus to be one region that discriminates between G-proteins (23Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A study that employed chimeras between muscarinic and β-adrenergic receptors pointed to the i2 and i3 loops to control coupling selectivity (24Wong S.K.F. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the class III GPCRs, although most of these regions have been shown to control coupling efficacy (25Gomeza J. Joly C.

Surprisingly, several regions of both the G-protein α subunit and class III receptors have been identified as being involved in coupling selectivity. However, which part of the receptor recognizes a specific part of the G-protein α subunit remains to be elucidated. The present study was aimed at identifying the specific region of the G-protein α subunit that is recognized by the i2 loop of mGluRs. Our data revealed that this i2 loop, and more precisely the central part of it, discriminates between G-protein α subunits that differ at the level of their extreme C terminus, especially at position –4. This is consistent with what has been proposed for class I rhodopsin-like receptors and supports the idea that receptors from these two classes couple to G-proteins in a similar way. Materials—Chemicals including glutamate were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Serum, culture media, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Invitrogen. The plasmids expressing mGlu receptor subunits and their chimeras were described previously (12Blahos J. Mary S. Perroy J. De Colle C. Brabet I. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol.

The Gαq proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Conklin (The Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA). The generation of the plasmids expressing the subunits Gqo, Gqz, GqoCI, and GqzIC was described previously (30Blahos J. Fischer T. Brabet I. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3262-3269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Culture and Transfection of Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) Cells—HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin 100 units/ml final). Electroporation was performed in a total volume of 300 μl with 4 μg of carrier DNA, mGluR subunit plasmid DNA (4 μg for mGlu4, mGlu8, and their chimera and 1.3 μg for mGlu2 and its chimera), Gα-subunit plasmid DNA (2 μg), and 10 million cells in electroporation buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm CH3COOK, 20 mm KOH, pH 7.4). After electroporation (260 V, 1 millifarads, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator), cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and split in 12-well clusters (Falcon, Paris, France) (10 million cells/12 wells) coated previously with poly-l-ornithine (15 μg/ml; molecular weight, 40,000) (Sigma). Determination of Inositol Phosphate (IP) Accumulation—The procedure used for the determination of IP accumulation in transfected cells was adapted from previously published methods (31Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 2–3 h after electroporation and incubated for 14 h in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.4 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol (23.4 Ci/mol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were then washed two times with Hepes-buffered saline (146 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated with 1 ml of Hepes-buffered saline containing 1 unit of GPT/ml and 2 mm pyruvate for 1 h. After washing once with Hepes-buffered saline, LiCl was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The agonist was applied 5 min later and left for 30 min at 37 °C. Replacing the incubation medium with 0.5 ml of perchloric acid (5%) stopped the reaction, and the clusters were kept on ice for 30 min. Supernatants were recovered, and the IPs were purified on Dowex columns (31Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). Total radioactivity remaining in the membrane fraction was counted after treatment with 10% Triton X-100, 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min and used as standard. Results are expressed as the percentage of IP produced over the radioactivity present in the membranes. The dose-response curves were fitted according to the equation y = ((y max – y min)/1 – (x/EC50)n) – y min using the Kaleidagraph program (Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA). Construction of Chimeric mGlu Receptors—To be able to analyze the expression and correct plasma membrane targeting of the wild-type and chimeric receptors studied, mGlu2, mGlu4, and mGlu8 receptors were first epitope-tagged at their N-terminal end. For the insertion of either an HA or c-Myc epitope at the N terminus, a MluI restriction site was introduced just after the signal peptide using the QuikChange™ technology (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The coding sequence after the MluI site was then introduced in place of the equivalent mGlu5 coding sequence in the pRKG5-NHA or pRKG5-Nmyc described previously (32Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.-M. Pin J.-P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, the mGlu4 and mGlu8 receptors were tagged with an HA epitope, whereas both HA and c-Myc mGlu2 receptors were generated. In the case of the mGlu4 receptor, a MRGSHis6 sequence was also introduced just before the stop codon. For these three receptors, as reported previously for either mGlu5 (32Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.-M. Pin J.-P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or mGlu7 (33Perroy J. Prezeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, the presence of the tag did not modify the functional expression and pharmacological properties of the receptors. The sequence encoding the i2 loop (as defined in Fig. 1) within the mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptor cDNA were swapped using a modification of the PCR overlap methodology as described (28Pin J.-P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The resulting subunits were called mGlu2/4i2 and mGlu4/2i2. The central region of the i2 loop (as indicated in Fig. 1 by the horizontal bar) or only part of it (see Figs. 10 and 11) was swapped between mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptor cDNAs using the QuikChange™ technology (Stratagene). The resulting subunits were called mGlu2/8i2 (mGlu2 with the i2-loop sequence of mGlu8) and mGlu8/2i2 (mGlu8 with the i2-loop sequence of mGlu2), mGlu2-1st (mGlu2, with the N-terminal portion of the central zone of mGlu8 i2), mGlu8-1st (mGlu8 with the N-terminal portion of the central zone of mGlu2 i2), and mGlu2-VTA and mGlu8-AQR for the mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors in which the VTA/AQR sequences were swapped. The correct replacement of the loop was checked by double strand DNA sequencing.Fig. 10Differential coupling to Gqo and Gqz of mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors and their i2 mutants. Basal (white bars)and1mm glutamate-induced (black bars) IP formations were determined in HEK 293 cells co-expressing the indicated receptor and G-protein α subunits.

Twenty-four h after transfection (10.106 cells), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked with PBS –5% fetal bovine serum. After 30 min of reaction with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-HA clone 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) at 0.5 μg/ml) in the same buffer, the goat anti-rat antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was applied for 30 min at 1 μg/ml. After intense washes with PBS, secondary antibodies were detected and quantified instantaneously by chemiluminescence using Supersignal® ELISA femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and a Wallac Victor2 luminescence counter. Immunofluorescence Assay on Non-permeabilized Cells—The cells were cultured and transfected with wild-type and chimeric mGlu receptors as described previously. After transfection, cell suspension in DMEM was poured on coverslips placed in 6-well clusters (Falcon). The day after transfection, cells immobilized on coverslips were washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) at 37 °C. Then coverslips were incubated at 37 °C with primary anti-HA (anti-HA-Roche-12CA5, mouse) and anti-cMyc (anti-cMyc-Roche-9E10, mouse) antibodies diluted 1300 in DMEM without serum. After 1.5 h, cells were washed three times 10 min with gelatin in PBS (2 g/liter) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 0.15 m glucose. After washing three times with PBS-glycin (0.1 m), coverslips were incubated with secondary antibody (Cy™3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 11000 in PBS-gelatin. The incubation was performed in the dark for 1.5 h. The preparations were then washed three times 10 min with PBS-gelatin and fixed. Pictures were taken using a fluorescent microscope the next day. Differential Coupling of Gqo and Gqz and Their –4 Point Mutants to mGlu4, mGlu8, and mGlu2 Receptors—Many Gi/o-coupled GPCRs have been shown to activate chimeric G-proteins corresponding to Gαq in which the C-terminal 5 residues are replaced by those of either Gαi2, Gαo, or Gαz. Since these chimeric G-proteins activate phospholipase C-β, the effective coupling between the receptor and the chimeric G-protein can easily be assessed by measuring IP accumulation after receptor activation. Group II (mGlu2 and -3) and group III (mGlu4, -6, -7, and -8) mGlu receptors couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi/o proteins in vivo. However, whereas group III receptors (mGlu4, -7, and -8) couple to both Gqo and Gqz, mGlu2 as well as the group II Drosophila mGluA receptor couple to Gqo only (35Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar, 36Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This differential coupling is not due to a difference in the level of expression of these Gα subunits as shown by our group in previous studies using Western blot analysis (12Blahos J. Mary S. Perroy J. De Colle C. Brabet I. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25765-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as by others (37Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Moreover, this is in agreement with the recent demonstration that group II mGlu receptors do not activate Gz in transfected superior cervical ganglion neurons (38Kammermeier P.J. Davis M.I. Ikeda S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Residue –4, which is an Ile in Gαz and the pertussis toxin-ADP-ribosylated Cys in Gαi and Gαo, is responsible for the selective coupling of Gαz to mGlu2 (12Blahos J. Mary S. Perroy J. De Colle C. Brabet I. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25765-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, replacing this Ile by a Cys in Gαqz is sufficient to allow coupling to mGlu2, whereas the converse mutation (Cys to Ile in Gαqo) suppresses coupling to this receptor (12Blahos J. Mary S.

As a positive control, all these various G-protein α subunits can be efficiently activated by either mGlu4 (12Blahos J. Mary S. Perroy J. De Colle C. Brabet I. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25765-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or mGlu8 receptors (Fig. 1). Sequence Differences of the Intracellular Loops of mGlu2, mGlu4, and mGlu8 Receptors—Analysis of the intracellular portions of these receptors revealed highly conserved and short intracellular loops 1 and 3. Within the i1 loop, a single residue is different between group II and group III mGluRs, and in the i3 loop, only two positions are clearly different (see Ref. 35Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the i2 loop is more variable (Fig. 2A), and the C-terminal tail is the less conserved region. We therefore decided to examine the role of the i2 loop in the specific recognition of the C-terminal tail of the α-subunit, and more specifically, residue –4. To that aim, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors in which the i2 loop or a portion of it has been swapped between mGlu2 and either mGlu4 or mGlu8 receptors (Fig. 2B). These constructs also include a c-Myc or HA epitope at the N-terminal end, just after the signal peptide. We previously reported that the presence of such an epitope at an equivalent position in mGlu5 (32Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.-M. Pin J.-P. Bockaert J. Fagni L.

Sequence within the i2 Loop Recognizes the Extreme C Terminus of Gα Subunit—To examine the role of the i2 loop of mGlu receptors in the selective recognition of the C-terminal tail of the G-protein α subunit, the coupling of mGlu2/4i2 to Gqo and Gqz was first examined. As shown in Fig. 3a, these receptors were expressed at a similar level at the cell surface, as revealed using an ELISA assay performed on intact cells (Fig. 3a). The chimeric mGlu2/4i2 was found to activate both G-proteins, like mGlu4, but unlike mGlu2, which did not activate Gqz efficiently (Fig. 3b). On these three receptors, when glutamate was active, its effect was dose-dependent and always displayed a similar EC50 value (Fig. 4). This mGlu2/4i2 receptor retains the pharmacological properties of the mGlu2 receptor since it is potently activated by the group II-selective agonists LY354740 and 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolydine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid but not by the group III agonist DL-AP4 (Fig. 5). These data highlight the i2 loop of mGlu4 as being the structure that enables coupling to Gqz. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain large enough responses in cells expressing the converse chimera, mGlu4/2i2, with any of the tested G-proteins.Fig. 4Glutamate-induced IP formation in cells co-expressing mGlu2, mGlu4 or mGlu2/4i2 receptors with either Gqz or Gqo proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2094766606,"We have examined the effects of the bacterial toxin microcin B17 (MccB17) on the reactions of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase. MccB17 slows down but does not completely inhibit the DNA supercoiling and relaxation reactions of gyrase. A kinetic analysis of the cleavage-religation equilibrium of gyrase was performed to determine the effect of the toxin on the forward (cleavage) and reverse (religation) reactions. A simple mechanism of two consecutive reversible reactions with a nicked DNA intermediate was used to simulate the kinetics of cleavage and religation. The action of MccB17 on the kinetics of cleavage and religation was compared with that of the quinolones ciprofloxacin and oxolinic acid. With relaxed DNA as substrate, only a small amount of gyrase cleavage complex is observed with MccB17 in the absence of ATP, whereas the presence of the nucleotide significantly enhances the effect of the toxin on both the cleavage and religation reactions. In contrast, ciprofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and Ca2+ show lesser dependence on ATP to stabilize the cleavage complex. MccB17 enhances the overall rate of DNA cleavage by increasing the forward rate constant (k 2) of the second equilibrium. In contrast, ciprofloxacin increases the amount of cleaved DNA by a combined effect on the forward and reverse rate constants of both equilibria. Based on these results and on the observations that MccB17 only slowly inhibits the supercoiling and relaxation reactions, we suggest a model of the interaction of MccB17 with gyrase.

Moreno F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 393-402PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, MccB17 induces, in vitro and in vivo, double-stranded cleavage of DNA mediated by DNA gyrase (8Vizan J.L. Hernandez-Chico C. del Castillo I. Moreno F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A mutation in the B subunit of gyrase (W751R) was found to confer resistance to MccB17, confirming that DNA gyrase is a cellular target of the toxin (8Vizan J.L. Hernandez-Chico C. del Castillo I. Moreno F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). MccB17 blocks gyrase by trapping the enzyme-DNA cleavage complex, a mode of action reminiscent of that of quinolones (8Vizan J.L. Hernandez-Chico C. del Castillo I. Moreno F.

Of the two pairs of tandem, fused 4,2-bisheterocycles in MccB17, the integrity of the second one (B-site tandem; Fig. 1A) was found to be crucial for the potency of MccB17 (10Sinha Roy R.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1995: 165-176Google Scholar). The active enzyme is an A2B2 heterotetramer with the A subunit (GyrA, 97 kDa) largely responsible for DNA wrapping and the breakage and reunion of DNA and the B subunit (GyrB, 90 kDa) responsible for ATP hydrolysis and the interaction with GyrA and DNA. The enzyme introduces supercoils into DNA by wrapping a double-stranded segment around itself, cleaving this DNA (the gate segment) in both strands, passing the wrapped DNA (transported segment) through the break, and then resealing the DNA (12Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 13Wigley D.B. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Vol. 9.

Binding of ATP to GyrB causes the closure of the clamp formed by dimerization of GyrB, which captures the transported segment and directs it through the double-stranded break in the gate segment. ATP is then hydrolyzed, allowing the enzyme to return to its starting conformation (16Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G.

Coumarins competitively inhibit ATP hydrolysis, whereas quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin (CFX) and oxolinic acid (OXO), stabilize the covalent gyrase-DNA cleavage complex. CcdB also stabilizes a cleavage complex but only in the presence of ATP (21Bernard P. Kézdy K.E. Van Melderen L. Steyaert J. Wyns L. Pato M.L. Higgins N.P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The trapping of the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex by MccB17 is also reported to be ATP-dependent (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J.

DNA cleavage complexes can also be observed in the absence of drugs or toxins, if Mg2+ is substituted by Ca2+, with both gyrase (24Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eukaryotic topo II (25Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The elucidation of the mode of action of MccB17 on DNA gyrase is important in at least two respects. First, because of its unusual chemical structure and properties, MccB17 may provide a model of toxin-gyrase interaction, informative for new drug design. Second, key information on the mechanism of gyrase may be discovered from microcin action. In this paper, we study the effects of MccB17 on the kinetic parameters of the cleavage-religation reactions of E. coli DNA gyrase and compare the results with the effects on the supercoiling and relaxation reactions. By dissecting the cleavage and the religation reactions using a simple enzyme kinetic simulation model, we have been able to identify important differences between MccB17 and quinolones. The results of the supercoiling and relaxation assays and those from the cleavage-religation reactions give some insights into the mode of action of the toxin at the molecular level. Finally, the present kinetic analysis provides a framework for analyzing the effect of drugs or enzyme mutations on the cleavage-religation equilibrium of topoisomerases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein, DNA, and Drugs—GyrA and GyrB were purified as previously described (26Maxwell A.

DNA topoisomerase IV was a gift of Dr. M. K. Wall (John Innes Centre). Ciprofloxacin (Bayer) was dissolved in water. Microcin B17 was produced from E. coli DH5α carrying the plasmid pUC19-mccB17 and purified and dissolved in Me2SO, according to the procedure previously described (10Sinha Roy R. Kelleher N.L. Milne J.C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—Supercoiling assays were carried out as previously described (24Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the reactions were incubated at 25 °C for various times up to 6 h and contained 21 nm relaxed pBR322, 10 nm gyrase, 2.5% (v/v) Me2SO, with or without 37.5 μm MccB17. Relaxation assays were performed as for supercoiling, with some modifications: ATP and spermidine were omitted, and the reactions included 7.1 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 and 20 nm gyrase and were stopped at various times up to 10 h. MccB17- and quinolone-induced DNA cleavage assays were carried out using a similar method to that previously described (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that reactions contained 12.5 nm relaxed pBR322 and either 25 μm CFX, 37.5 μm MccB17, or 500 μm OXO. In the Ca2+-induced DNA cleavage reactions, 4 mm CaCl2 replaced MgCl2, and no drug was present. When compared with the effect of MccB17, the reactions with CFX or Ca2+ also included the same amount of Me2SO at 3% (v/v). The stock solution of OXO was prepared in 0.1 m KOH, and each reaction with this drug contained 2.5 mm KOH (final concentration). The reactions were started by the addition of 40 nm gyrase and incubated at 25 °C for various times up to 90 min in the presence or the absence of 2 mm ATP. Religation assays were carried out in two different ways. In each case, an initial Ca2+-induced cleavage assay at 25 °C created a stable cleavage-complex between DNA and gyrase, in the presence or the absence of saturating concentrations of CFX, MccB17, or OXO and with or without 2 mm ATP or ADPNP. Then the samples were transferred to ice and allowed to cool down for 10 min. Religation was induced by a change of the assay conditions that displaces the steady-state equilibrium toward the religation. Each 30-μl religation reaction contained an excess of enzyme over DNA by a factor 4 or 10; 3.6 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 or 12.5 nm relaxed pBR322 was used with 33–50 nm of enzyme. In the first method, following previous reports (25Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Liu L.F. Rowe T.C.L.Y. Tewey K.M.

The second method was a modification of the Mg2+-promoted religation described elsewhere (25Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction, on ice, was brought to 33 mm EGTA to chelate the Ca2+ ions, and the religation was induced by the presence of Mg2+ ions. If the religation assay was carried out with 2 mm ATP (or ADPNP), MgCl2 was added at the time of the cleavage reaction at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. When no nucleotide was present in the religation assay, MgCl2 was introduced at the same time as EGTA at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The samples were collected for up to 40 min.For each enzyme assay mentioned above, the DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose gels as previously described (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol.

All of the cleavage and religation assays were repeated several times, and typical data are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Control experiments showed that the intensities of the DNA bands for the different forms of DNA were a true estimation of their concentration (data not shown).Fig. 2Time courses of DNA cleavage reactions.

Initial rate constant inputs were adjusted, using KINSIM and the mechanism shown in Scheme 1 (see below), until the simulated curves fitted the experimental data.

Miller D.A. Heddle J.G. Maxwell A. Walsh C.T. Hollfelder F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7712-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or not at all (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and that stabilization of the cleavage complex is ATP-dependent (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further investigate these effects, we have examined the gyrase supercoiling and relaxation reactions in the presence of MccB17 under a range of conditions.In standard supercoiling reactions at 37 °C using 10–160 nm gyrase, the relaxed DNA substrate became completely negatively supercoiled, irrespective of the absence or the presence of 43 μm MccB17 (data not shown). The temperature of the reaction was reduced to 25 °C to decrease the rate of supercoiling and reveal the inhibitory effect of MccB17. With 15 nm gyrase, all relaxed DNA was supercoiled within 2 h without inhibitor versus 4 h if the reaction contained 37.5 μm MccB17 (data not shown). With 10 nm gyrase, complete supercoiling occurred within 6 h in the absence of inhibitor, whereas in the presence of MccB17, the reaction was slower and still incomplete after 6 h (Fig. 1B). An estimate of the inhibition of supercoiling by MccB17, from several experiments, suggests that MccB17 slows down the reaction by a factor of ∼3. These data support the idea that MccB17 does not completely inhibit the gyrase supercoiling reaction.The action of MccB17 on the relaxation reaction of gyrase was similar to that found with supercoiling. When relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA was performed at 37 °C with 100 nm gyrase, relaxation was complete within 60 min, and no effect of MccB17 was observed (data not shown). Therefore, the reaction was slowed down by using 20 nm enzyme at 25 °C and observed over an extended period. Under these conditions, MccB17 slowly and partially inhibits the relaxation reaction of gyrase (Fig. 1C). The supercoiled DNA was quantified from Fig. 1C, as a function of time. After fitting data to a single exponential equation, the half-life of disappearance of supercoiled DNA was about three times greater in the presence of MccB17 than in its absence.DNA Cleavage—The double-stranded breakage of DNA catalyzed by gyrase is normally transient (33Mizuuchi K. Fisher M. O'Dea M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) but can be trapped by quinolone drugs, Ca2+ ions, CcdB, or MccB17, resulting in a stable gyrase-DNA cleavage complex (9Heddle J.G.

A. 1977; 74: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The kinetics of Ca2+-, CFX-, OXO-, and MccB17-induced cleavage of relaxed DNA by gyrase were compared by taking samples at different times of reaction in the presence or the absence of ATP (Fig. 2A; OXO data not shown). The linear DNA species was quantified from the agarose gel; the amounts (%) were plotted as a function of time and fitted to rectangular hyperbolae; and the time to reach 50% of maximum cleavage was determined (Fig. 2, B and C). Fig. 2 represents a typical result from one experiment; the standard deviation from three different experiments with CFX, with and without ATP, was less than 15% (data not shown). The maximal amount of CFX-, OXO-, or Ca2+-induced cleavage at equilibrium was about 40% and was not greatly influenced by the presence of ATP in the reaction. The result was very different for MccB17, which induced a maximum of only 8% cleavage in the absence of ATP but up to 30% in the presence of the nucleotide. Similar to a previous study with CFX (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the time taken to reach 50% of the maximal cleavage complex stabilized by CFX, OXO, or MccB17 was 3-fold longer in the absence of the nucleotide than in its presence. When Ca2+ was the cleavage-inducing agent, ATP did not influence the time to reach 50% of the maximal cleavage complex (Fig. 2).In another approach, we varied the CFX or MccB17 concentration and determined the IC50 and maximum level of cleavage, with and without ATP, under the conditions described for Fig. 2 (data not shown). Consistent with previous results (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we found approximately the same level of cleavage of relaxed DNA by gyrase, with and without ATP in the presence of CFX, but with IC50 values that differed by ∼10-fold: 0.2 μm (with ATP) and 1.9 μm (without ATP). For MccB17 the maximum level of cleavage was ∼10-fold greater in the presence of ATP than in its absence, and the approximate IC50 values were 1 μm (with ATP) and 17 μm (without ATP), confirming the strong dependence of MccB17 cleavage on the presence of ATP. As with relaxed circular DNA, the cleavage of linear DNA into smaller DNA fragments by gyrase in the presence of MccB17 was also greatly stimulated by ATP (9Heddle J.G. Blance S.J. Zamble D.B. Hollfelder F. Miller D.A. Wentzell L.M. Walsh C.T. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that, in the absence of ATP, negatively supercoiled circular DNA was more efficiently cleaved by gyrase in the presence of MccB17 than relaxed circular DNA (data not shown). It seems that the ATP requirement for MccB17-induced cleavage depends on the topological state of the DNA.DNA Religation—For religation assays, linear DNA was formed after 30 min of Ca2+-induced gyrase cleavage (30–40% of total DNA), and the amount of cleavage complex was not significantly influenced by the presence or the absence of nucleotide, quinolones or MccB17 in the reaction. In one method, the addition of a high concentration of salt (NaCl-induced religation) allowed cleaved covalent complexes to be religated while preventing the formation of new protein-DNA interactions. For topo II, the salt-induced reversibility of the calcium-induced cleavage is cation-dependent and prevented by prior addition of EDTA (25Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because the present salt-induced reaction was free of Mg2+, the religation occurred probably because of the presence of Ca2+ ions. In a second method (Mg2+-induced religation), chelation of the Ca2+ ions by excess of EGTA was performed, and the rate of religation depended on Mg2+ concentration and was too fast to be observed above 0.2 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). Time courses of religation were performed in the absence or presence of inhibitor (CFX, OXO, or MccB17), with and without ATP. Typical data for the Mg2+-induced religation are shown in Fig. 3.The disappearance of linear DNA with time was quantified from panel A of Fig. 3 and plotted in panels B and C of Fig. 3. Time courses of linear DNA disappearance could be fitted to a double exponential but not to a single exponential, indicating biphasic kinetics (Fig. 3, B and C). A similar experiment was carried out with the NaCl-induced religation (data not shown). CFX greatly inhibited the Mg2+-induced religation (Fig. 3) by reducing the first and the second rate constants of the biphasic reaction by 5- and 10-fold, respectively, regardless of the presence of ATP. CFX showed a similar ATP-independent inhibition in the NaCl-induced religation, except that it reduced primarily the second rate constant by 1 order of magnitude. In contrast with CFX, MccB17 required ATP for its inhibitory effect on religation; little or no inhibition is revealed in the absence of the nucleotide (Fig. 3). The MccB17 inhibitory effect was essentially due to a reduction in the second rate constant. In the presence of ADPNP, MccB17 also showed an inhibition of the NaCl- and the Mg2+-induced religations, although to a lesser extent than the reaction with ATP (data not shown). In contrast with CFX, OXO did not show any visible inhibition of the religation reaction in the absence of nucleotide and only a modest inhibition in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3C). In a control experiment, the amounts of cleavage induced by CFX and OXO were compared at various Mg2+ concentrations; OXO was found to require twice as much Mg2+ than CFX to stabilize 50% of maximum cleavage, and no OXO-induced cleavage was observed at the concentrations of Mg2+ used in the religation assay (data not shown). Therefore, the absence of any effect of OXO on religation reactions can be explained by low binding of the drug to the gyrase-DNA complex at Mg2+ concentrations below 0.5 mm.Kinetic Simulations—The aim of the present work was to explain the effect of MccB17 on the cleavage-religation equilibrium of gyrase and to compare this effect with that of CFX, OXO, and Ca2+. To explain the origin of the biphasic kinetics observed in the religation reactions, we propose a mechanistic scheme for the cleavage-religation reactions of gyrase. Earlier reports on gyrase and topo II suggested that both the cleavage and religation reactions occurred via a two-step process involving a nicked DNA intermediate (29Hockings S.C. Maxwell A. J. Mol.

The refolding of apo-HasA after denaturation with guanidine HCl was followed by stopped-flow measurements of fluorescence of its single tryptophan, both in the absence and presence of SecB. In the absence of SecB, HasA folds very quickly with one main phase (45 s–1) accounting for 92% of the signal. SecB considerably slows down HasA folding. At stoichiometric amounts of SecB and HasA, a single phase (0.014 s–1) of refolding is observed. Two double point mutants of HasA were made, abolishing two hydrogen bonds between N-terminal and C-terminal side chain residues. In both cases, the mutants essentially maintained the same secondary and tertiary structure as wild-type HasA and were fully functional. Refolding of both mutants was much slower than that of wild-type HasA and they were secreted essentially independently of SecB. We conclude that SecB has mainly an antifolding function in the HasA ABC secretion pathway.

We conclude that SecB has mainly an antifolding function in the HasA ABC secretion pathway. SecB is a chaperone of the Sec pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. It was initially identified in Escherichia coli where it interacts with a subset of preproteins to be exported across the cytoplasmic membrane in such a way as to slow down their folding and target them to SecA, the ATPase of the Sec system (1Kumamoto C.A.

Currently, this chaperone is restricted to Gram-negative bacteria, from the proteobacteria class. In the Sec pathway, the basis of the interaction of SecB with its substrates has been studied in great detail either in vivo for its natural substrates or in vitro with its natural or artificial substrates. It appears that in vitro, SecB is able to interact with a large variety of denatured substrates whereas it is highly specific in vivo (6Kumamoto C.A. Francetic O. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Collier D.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 151-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of SecB from Haemophilus influenzae is known at atomic resolution and has highlighted several important features of this chaperone (8Xu Z. Knafels J.D. Yoshino K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is a tetramer composed of a dimer of dimers. Each monomer bears a putative peptide-binding site able to accommodate, in an extended conformation, hydrophobic peptides of 10–15 residues; on both sides the tetramer presents a patch of negatively charged residues that can interact with a SecA dimer. In vitro studies using peptide libraries have indicated that SecB binding site is around 9–10 residues long with a strong preference for aromatic and cationic amino acid residues (9Knoblauch N.T.

Furthermore, SecB is a highly negatively charged molecule; thus, negatively charged peptides bind to SecB only if the peptide contains enough aromatic residues in the peptide to overcome the electrostatic repulsion. Maltose-binding protein (MBP), 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; GdnHCl, guanidine HCl; WT, wild-type.1The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; GdnHCl, guanidine HCl; WT, wild-type. the best characterized SecB substrate in both in vivo and in vitro studies, interacts with SecB in kinetic partitioning: the competition between binding to the chaperone and folding reactions (10Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Khisty V.J. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Diamond D.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19314-19318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At 25 °C MBP refolds by a complex pathway characterized by three phases. SecB slows down folding but does not block it; moreover, increasing amounts of SecB progressively slow down MBP refolding. At 5 °C MBP refolding is slower and SecB totally blocks refolding. This can be visualized by the existence of stable SecB·MBP complexes that can be isolated at 5 °C but not at 25 °C. MBP mutants have been isolated on the basis of their ability to translocate across the inner membrane without the presence of SecB. MBPY283D is a MBP mutant that is perfectly biologically active and folds more slowly than wild-type MBP making its translocation SecB-independent (2Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford Jr., P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Collier D.N. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This variant associates with SecB blocking MBP folding even at 25 °C. A model has been proposed for the interaction of SecB and MBP: an unfolded form of MBP binds to SecB and is in equilibrium with unbound form. MBP does not fold on SecB and this explains the progressive blockade of MBP folding with increasing SecB amounts. Although the signal sequence of pre-LamB or pre-MBP does not interact with SecB by itself, it slows down the folding of the mature part of the protein (15Altman E. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SecB interacts with several parts of precursor molecules, protecting a large central portion of precursors to which it is bound (17Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Khisty V.J. Munske G.R. Randall L.L. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1746-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other substrates have been studied in great detail, like barnase of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (20Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or R-BPTI (21Fekkes P. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Studies with R-BPTI, which is a stable unfolded form of BPTI, have shown that association of a substrate with SecB is limited by diffusion and that the bound R-BPTI is easily exchanged with free R-BPTI. Such findings allowed the researchers to estimate a Kd of a few nm for the SecB·R-BPTI complex. In the case of barnase, which is a small secreted RNase with a standard signal peptide, SecB retards the folding of barnase but never blocks its folding in contrast to what has been observed with MBP. Barnase folds at least partially onto SecB which challenges the kinetics partition model. We have shown that, besides its function in the Sec pathway, SecB is also the chaperone of a sec-independent pathway, namely the secretion of the HasASM hemophore through its ABC pathway in Serratia marcescens (22Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Sapriel G. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HasASM is a monomeric protein of 188 residues secreted by an ABC-type pathway under iron starvation conditions by S. marcescens (24Létoffé S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Yersinia pestis (25Létoffé S. Redeker V. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Rossi M.S. Fetherston J.D. Létoffé S. Carniel E. Perry R.D. Ghigo J.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6707-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HasASM acquires the heme from hemoproteins (e.g. hemoglobin) and delivers it to a specific receptor at the cell surface whereby the heme is internalized and used as an iron source (27Ghigo J.-M. Létoffé S. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3572-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both the secretion pathways and the heme acquisition pathways have been reconstituted in E. coli. We have shown that SecB, the chaperone of the Sec pathway, is required for HasASM secretion both in the original host and in the reconstituted system (22Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Sapriel G. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SecB does not affect the secretion apparatus but likely interacts with HasASM. We have proposed that the N-terminal part of HasASM interacts in a SecB-dependent fashion with the ABC transporter (28Sapriel G. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6726-6732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Folded HasASM is not secretion-competent and inhibits further secretion of newly synthesized HasASM. This strongly supports a model whereby HasASM is targeted in a cotranslational fashion to the ABC transporter before secretion via the C-terminal secretion signal (29Debarbieux L. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data are consistent with a model whereby both the N terminus and the C terminus of HasASM play a role in secretion. Here we studied the in vitro refolding of HasASM both in the presence and absence of SecB. We show that HasA protein folds very quickly. Also, we show that SecB interacts directly and quickly with HasASM to slow down HasASM folding. We had previously established that the N terminus of HasA also plays a role in secretion. Here we provide evidence that hydrogen bonds which exist between N-terminal and C-terminal residues of HasASM are involved in HasASM folding and its SecB dependence for secretion. Plasmids, Strains, and Growth Conditions—Strains were usually grown at 30 °C in LB medium or M9 minimal medium with 0.4% glycerol as the carbon source. MC4100 and MC4100ΔsecB were from the lab collection and PAP105 was used for cloning. The following sets of oligonucleotides were used for in vitro mutagenesis of hasA: ggcattttcagtcaatgcggacagcagcttcggcg (7A+) and cgccgaagctgctgtccgcattgactgaaaatgcc (7A–), cggcggttacagcattgcggactatctgggccagt (17A+) and actggcccagatagtccgcaatgctgtaaccgccg (17A–), cgataccggcgcgctggcgaccgcgctgaacggca (148A+) and tgccgttcagcgcggtcgccagcgcgccggtatcg (148A–), and cgtcaactccaccttcgcgcaggtggcggcggcga (167A+) tcgccgccgccacctgcgcgaaggtggagttgacg (167A–). pSYC134/pUC was used as a template and the quick-change kit from Stratagene used for mutagenesis. Two successive rounds of mutagenesis were carried out to obtain the double mutants. Sequencing was used to verify the mutations. The mutated fragments were then reintroduced into pAM238 and pBGS18+. pSYC150 encodes HasD and HasE, which, together with chromosomally encoded TolC, formed the secretion apparatus. PsecB/trc was used to overproduce SecB. This plasmid contains the secB gene under the control of ptrc and was kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Betton. Materials—GdnHCl ultrapure was from ICN Biomedicals. Cells used for fluorescence and circular dichroïsm were from Hellma. Expression and Purification of the HasASM Proteins—Wild-type HasASM was produced in E. coli MC4100(pSYC134/pAM238 + pSYC150) (24Létoffé S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant hasA genes were constructed by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type (WT), E148A,D167A, and H32A,Y75A mutant samples were produced in M9 minimal medium as reported previously (30Izadi N. Henry Y. Haladjian J. Goldberg M.E. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7050-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) Y7A/H17A mutant was produced in M9 minimal medium with addition of 0.2% bactotryptone. Wild-type and mutant apo-HasASM proteins were purified as described previously (30Izadi N. Henry Y. Haladjian J. Goldberg M.E. Wandersman C. Delepierre M. Lecroisey A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7050-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Their heme content, determined by the absorbance of the Soret band wavelength, was always less than 5%. SecB was purified according to published protocol (9Knoblauch N.T. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Driessen A.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Its purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and the concentration determined from absorbance at 277 nm using an extinction coefficient of 11708 m–1 cm–1 for the monomer. To assess the secretion of wild-type and mutant HasA proteins, cultures of MC4100 or MC4100ΔsecB harboring Has secretion functions from pSYC150 and wild-type or mutant hasA on a compatible plasmid were grown in LB medium at 30 °C with the appropriate antibiotics to late exponential phase. The culture was centrifuged at 4000 × g max for 10 min and the supernatant precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Buffer—All kinetic and equilibrium experiments were carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The protein concentrations were determined by absorbance spectrophotometry before use. Water was deionized and purified on a Millipore system. All solutions were filtered. The equilibrium unfolding as a function of GdnHCl concentration were carried out by dilution of the proper amount of the 8 m denaturant stock solution and leaving the samples at room temperature overnight prior to performing the titration experiments. Equilibrium Unfolding Experiments—The equilibrium unfolding of HasASM and its mutants as a function of GdnHCl concentration was monitored by fluorescence and far-UV CD at 25 °C. Fluoromax (Spex Industries) photon counting spectrophotometer was used carry out the fluorescence studies. The samples were excited at 295 nm, and the resulting emission spectra were acquired between 310 nm and 410 nm. When working at a constant emission wavelength (i.e. the protein was excited at 295 nm and emission was monitored at 360 nm), fluorescence intensity was recorded for 30 s, with a sampling period and an integration time of 1 s, and then averaged. The slit width was 5 nm for the excitation light and 10 nm for the emission light. Measurements were made with a protein concentration of 3 μm and a 1.0-cm path length cuvette. CD measurements were acquired in a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV CD spectra were obtained by averaging five individual scans with a constant 0.5 nm step and with 5-s integration time from 180 to 200 nm and 2 s from 200 to 260 nm. A cell with a path length of 0.2 cm was used with a protein concentration of 3 μm. Near-UV CD spectra were acquired between 350 nm and 450 nm using 30 μm of protein in a 1.0-cm path length cell. For GdnHCl titrations, the absorbances were measured at 222 nm with a sampling period and time constant of 1 s during 60 s. The final ellipticity was calculated by averaging the 60 recorded values. Measurements were made with a protein concentration of 30 μm in a 0.02-cm path length cell. All spectra were corrected by subtracting the appropriate baseline. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal denaturation was followed by monitoring mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm (far-UV) using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 dichrograph interfaced with a Haake water bath. The signal was acquired with a 0.02 cm pathlength cell and a protein concentration of 30 μm with a sampling period of 60 s and an integration time of 1 s. The results were then averaged. The heating rate was 0.8 °C/min with a stabilization delay of 3 min before each recording. Data Analysis—The measured fluorescence intensities and the mean residue ellipticity were analyzed in terms of a two-state transition to obtain the fraction of unfolded protein and free energy of folding as a function of denaturant. Non-linear least square fittings of the equilibrium transitions were achieved using the following equation, S=Sn+nC+(Su-Sn+(u-n)C)K1+K(Eq. 1) where S is the signal (CD or fluorescence) measured, n and u the slopes of the native and unfolded base lines, Su and Sn the specific signals of the native and unfolded protein extrapolated to zero denaturant concentration, and K the apparent equilibrium constant of unfolding at a concentration C of denaturant. The free energy of unfolding ΔG 0 at zero denaturant concentration is given by, K=e(-ΔG+mC)RTe(Eq. 2) where m is a constant characteristic of the protein and of the denaturant. Stopped-flow Measurements—The measurements of HasASM refolding kinetics were carried out at 22 °C with a SFM300 mixing device from Bio-logic (Pont de Claix, France). The mixing device, equipped with a F15 (1.5 × 1.5-mm cross-section) fluorescence cell, was combined with the optical bench and detection module from Bio-logic. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emitted light above 320 or 350 nm was detected through a high pass filter. The kinetics were recorded by means of the Bio-Kine software package from Bio-logic. For refolding experiments, 10 or 20 μl of denatured HasASM (in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, and 5.5 m GdnHCl) were mixed with 390 or 380 μl of buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7). The duration of the injections was 30 ms yielding a 4-ms dead time. Refolding kinetics were performed at various protein concentrations. For SecB-dependent refolding, SecB was added to the refolding buffer (from 7.5 × 10–3 μm to 1.5 μm SecB tetramer) with a final concentration of HasASM of 0.375 and 0.75 μm.At either SecB concentration, kinetic traces were fitted using a multiexponential decay, I=∑iAie-kit+A∞(Eq. 3) where Ai is the amplitude of each phase, ki its rate constant, and A ∞ is the plateau value. Apo-HasASM Unfolding and Refolding in Vitro HasASM Refolds Spontaneously with Fast Kinetics—HasASM is a 188-amino acid monomeric protein with a unique domain of α/β-fold (31Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A.D.M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, A and B, show the chemical (Fig. 1A, left) and thermal (Fig. 1B, right) denaturations of WT HasASM and of two mutants (see below for the description of the mutants), followed by monitoring the disappearance of the secondary structures using far-UV CD. During chemical denaturation of WT HasA, an increase in the fluorescence of the unique tryptophan was observed together with a shift in the maximum fluorescence emission wavelength (from 322 to 353 nm) (data not shown). Both fluorescence and far-UV CD (Fig. 1A) gave superimposable equilibrium denaturation curves using GdnHCl as denaturant. The data could be satisfactorily fitted to a two-state model F ↔ U for unfolding. The GdnHCl concentration of half unfolding is given by Cm = ΔG/m and Cm = 2.7 ± 0.2 m. The value obtained for the free energy of denaturation ΔG is 11.5 ± 4.7 kcal·mol–1. As seen in thermal denaturation curve obtained for HasASM using far-UV CD (Fig. 1B), the midpoint of the thermal transition Tm at 59.5 ± 0.5 °C is similar to the value reported by differential scanning calorimetry microcalorimetry. 2A. Lecroisey, personal communication. Because this thermal transition of HasASM is not reversible regardless of the heating rate chosen between 20 and 60 °C/h, we could not extract the thermodynamic parameters from the thermal denaturation data. The refolding kinetics of WT HasSM were also monitored by the fluorescence changes of its single tryptophan residue detected by a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Fig. 2A, trace a). HasASM is largely unfolded in 5.5 m GdnHCl and reversibly refolded upon dilution of the chaotropic agent leading to a large decrease of fluorescence. Upon dilution of apo-HasASM from 5.5 m GdnHCl to 0.14 and 0.28 m GdnHCl, about 50% of the fluorescence intensity decreased within the dead time; nevertheless, this signal decrease is not due to a burst phase (phase faster than 4 ms) but rather to a dilution effect of GdnHCl. Indeed, extrapolation of fluorescence at 0.14 m GdnHCl from the curve obtained between 3.0 and 5.5 m GdnHCl gives the same intensity as this from the first fluorescence measurement in the denaturation kinetics (not shown). The time course of refolding as followed by Trp fluorescence, was fitted to a double exponential decay. The first phase (45 s–1) corresponds to 92% of the relative amplitude, and the second (1.8 s–1) accounts for the remaining 8% (see Fig. 3). These rate constants and amplitudes are only slightly temperature-dependent between 4 and 22 °C (data not shown).Fig. 3Phases of refolding of WT HasASM in presence of increasing concentrations of SecB tetramer. A, amplitude of the three refolding phases: a1 (•), a2 ▵); a3 (⊡). B, rate constants of the three refolding phases: k1 (•), k2 ▵;k3(⊡). Stopped-flow fluorescence was measured at 22 °C with a final concentration of HasASM at 0.75 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Each data point corresponds to the average of four to five independent kinetic series, each including nine successive individual traces that were averaged. The error bars represent the standard deviations. Each experiment was performed twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SecB Slows Down in Vitro HasASM Refolding—We have previously shown that HasASM secretion is SecB-dependent in the original host and in the reconstituted system in E. coli in vivo (22Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Sapriel G. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This prompted us to study the in vitro interaction of SecB with HasASM. We could first show that no stable complexes exist between SecB and folded apo-HasASM detected either by coimmunoprecipitation or by gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (data not shown). Apo-HasASM refolding was also studied in the presence of various amounts of SecB in the renaturation buffer at 22 °C (Figs. 2B and 3). We used a high pass filter to collect emitted light above 350 nm to minimize the fluorescence contribution of SecB, which displays a maximum fluorescence emission around 320 nm in 0.14 m GdnHCl. Analysis of the refolding kinetics showed that SecB affects HasASM folding (Fig. 2B, traces a–e). It is clear that SecB slows down HasA folding. This is a direct evidence for interaction, despite the very fast HasASM folding kinetics. The folding of HasASM is strongly retarded when more SecB is added to the refolding buffer (Fig. 2B, traces a–e). The HasASM-SecB interaction takes place very early, before or during the fast HasASM folding phase (45 s–1). Analysis of both amplitude and rate constant of the different phases observed in the presence of increasing amounts of SecB (Fig. 3) show the progressive appearance of a slow folding phase not observed in the absence of SecB. The amplitude of the major fast folding phase progressively decreases with higher concentrations of SecB, although the rate constant does not change at around 50 s–1. A slower phase progressively appears with an apparent rate constant of 0.013 s–1, at a 2:1 ratio of SecB tetramer to HasA; there is only a slight decrease of the rate constant with higher SecB concentrations. At the same time, the intermediate phase of 1.8 s–1 stays at the same small amplitude with a substoichiometric amount of SecB. Calculation of the stoichiometry of bound HasASM to SecB, as extrapolated from the fluorescence data, indicated that this might vary from two HasASM molecules bound per SecB tetramer at low SecB concentration to one HasASM molecule bound per SecB tetramer at higher SecB concentration. As found for barnase in the presence of GroEl or SecB, addition of more SecB up to a 4:1 SecB:HasASM ratio never blocked the folding of HasASM. Altogether our experiments indicate that HasASM binds SecB tetramer with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and this considerably slows down the folding of HasASM, ∼3200-fold. The very fast formation of HasASM·SecB complex suggests that the chaperone binds unfolded HasASM or a very early folding intermediate. These experiments suggested that a function of SecB in HasA secretion would be antifolding and that slowly folding variants of HasA might be secreted independently of SecB. N-terminal-C-terminal Interactions in HasASM Affect Folding Rate but Not SecB Binding—We have proposed in previous studies that both the N- and C-terminal parts of HasASM might be involved in the HasASM secretion process (28Sapriel G. Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6726-6732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Debarbieux L. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Examination of HasASM x-ray structure indicates that there are two pairs of residues making side chain/side chain hydrogen bonds between these two extremities: Tyr7/Asp167 and His17/Glu148 (31Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A.D.M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that the N- and C-terminal parts of HasASM are involved in the secretion process and that theses extremities are in close contact in the native conformation, we postulated that mutations of those pairs of residues, by disrupting the hydrogen bonds, might affect folding rate and hence the SecB dependence of secretion. To this end these residues were individually changed for alanine, disrupting one hydrogen bond for each mutant protein. All those single residue mutants display reduced dependence upon SecB for secretion (data not shown). Two double mutants were thus constructed, Y7A,H17A and E148A,D167A, to disrupt both hydrogen bonds by mutating two residues either in the N terminus or the C terminus (see the figure provided in the Supplementary Material). The refolding kinetics of HasASM7–17 and HasASM148–167 were studied using the same procedure as that for wild-type HasASM. Refolding of both mutants showed refolding kinetics much slower than that of wild-type (Fig. 2A, traces b and c as compared with a). Two distinct phases were detected for each mutant with no significant burst amplitude (Fig. 2). Fitting of the data showed that the 7–17 mutant displays one rate constant of 2.1 s–1 with relative amplitude of 68% and one rate constant of 0.9 s–1 and its relative amplitude of 30%. The two phases detected for 148–167 have rate constants of 3.9 and 1 s–1 with respective relative amplitudes of 83 and 17%. These data do not allow us to conclude that mutants and wild-type HasASM follow the same folding pathway or different folding pathways. In the presence of SecB, both mutants displayed essentially similar behavior and, as for WT HasA, their refolding kinetics is slowed down (not shown), indicative of an interaction with SecB. However, fitting of the data required four exponentials, instead of three for the WT. The Fig. 4 shows the analysis of the fluorescence data for the mutants in a similar way as that done for WT HasA. The amplitudes of the two refolding phases of HasA mutants, observed in the absence of SecB decreased, while two (negative) amplitudes appeared and increased with the concentration of SecB (not represented on Fig. 4). The corresponding phases could correspond to isomerizations of the HasA·SecB complex. Additionally, a fast phase,"

Although the genetic and biochemical bases for a massive cerebral accumulation of ganglioside GM2 in TSD have been well established, the mechanism for the neural dysfunction in TSD remains elusive. Upon analysis of GSLs from a variant B TS brain, we have detected a novel GSL that has not been previously revealed. We have isolated this GSL in pure form. Using NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis, the structure of this unusual GSL was established to be a taurine-conjugated GM2 (tauro-GM2) in which the carboxyl group of N-acetylneuraminic acid was amidated by taurine. Using a rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum, we also detected the presence of tauro-GM2 in three other small brain samples from one variant B and two variant O TSD patients. On the other hand, tauro-GM2 was not found in three normal human brain samples. The presence of tauro-GM2 in TS brains, but not in normal brains, indicates the possible association of this unusual GM2 derivative with the pathogenesis of TSD.

McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3827-3876Google Scholar). Based on the premise that GSLs specifically found in TS brain are associated with the pathogenesis of TSD, we carried out studies of GSLs in brain samples from patients with TSD. This report describes the detection and structural elucidation of a novel GM2 derivative in TS brain samples. By using NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical synthesis, the structure of this GM2 derivative isolated from a 75-g variant B TS brain sample was established to be tauro-GM2 in which the carboxyl group of Neu5Ac is amidated by taurine. We have also raised a rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum and immunologically detected the presence of tauro-GM2 in additional small brain samples (1–2 g) from one variant B and two variant O TSD patients. Under the same conditions, we did not detect the presence of tauro-GM2 in three normal human brain samples. Isolation of an Unknown Compound (UC) from a Variant B TS Brain Sample—Crude GSL extract was prepared from the brain sample (75 g) of a variant B TS patient as described (3Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Eng L.F. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The GSL extract was dissolved in 70 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (30/60/8, v/v/v) and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 75 cm) that had been equilibrated with the same solvent. After washing the column with the same solvent, the gangliosides were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium acetate (4Hirabayashi Y. Nakano T. Matsumoto M. Obata K. Ando S. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 445: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and 7-ml fractions were collected. A 20-μl aliquot of each fraction was spotted on a silica gel TLC plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). For the TLC analysis of GSLs, the solvent system was chloroform/methanol/12 mm MgCl2 (50/40/10, v/v/v), and GSLs were revealed by diphenylamine-aniline-phosphoric acid (DPA) reagent (5Anderson K. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The elution profile is shown in Fig. 1A. Fractions 148–180 (containing the fast moving GSLs shown in Fig. 1A) were pooled, evaporated to dryness, exhaustively dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The residue was dissolved in 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (95/5, v/v) and applied onto an Iatrobeads (Iatron Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) column (1.5 × 90 cm) (6Momoi T. Ando S. Magai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) previously equilibrated with chloroform. The column was eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (50/40/10, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 3-ml fractions were collected. A 10-μl aliquot of each fraction was spotted on a silica gel plate and analyzed by TLC as described above. Fractions 50–64 (containing UC as shown in Fig. 1B) were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and further purified by HPAC using a Mono Q HR 5/5 column with an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system (7Månsson J.-E. Rosengren B. Svennerholm L. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 322: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to obtain about 0.8 mg of pure UC. Chemical Conjugation of GM2 with Taurine—GM2 (40 μmol) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide was successively mixed while stirring with taurine (80 μmol), diethyl phosphorocyanidate (50 μmol), and triethylamine (50 μmol), as described (8Yamada S. Ikota N. Shioiri T. Tachibana S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 7714-7715Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Momose T. Tsubaki T. Iida T. Nambara T. Lipids. 1997; 32: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After stirring at room temperature for 5 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of 0.1 m KCl, and the mixture was passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Associates, Marlborough, MA) (10Williams M.A. McCleur R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The cartridge was washed with water to remove unadsorbed materials. Tauro-GM2, together with the unreacted GM2 and other byproducts (see Fig. 2A, lane 2), were eluted from the cartridge by methanol and further purified by HPAC (7Månsson J.-E. Rosengren B. Svennerholm L. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 322: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By this procedure, we obtained ≈6 μmol of pure tauro-GM2 (see Fig. 2B, lane 2).

Standard pulse sequences with echo/antiecho time proportional phase incrementation gradient selection were used. The bipolar pulse pair longitudinal encode-decode pulse sequence was used to measure self-diffusion coefficients (22Wu D. Chen A. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 115: 260-264Crossref Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The spectrometer was equipped with a 5-mm Bruker inverse triple-resonance probe with an xyz-gradient coil and a broad band observe double resonance probe with a z-axis gradient coil. The temperature of measurements was 298 K. Sample concentration ranged from 0.8 to 1.5 mg in 0.6 ml. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry measurements were performed on a 7.0-tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Daltonics Apex II) (Bruker, Billerica, MA) equipped with a nanoflow electrospray source. The nanospray “needles” (GlassTips), made of glass coated with conductive material (tip aperture = 4 μm), were purchased from New Objective (Woburn, MA). GM2 and UC were dissolved separately in methanol to reach a final concentration of 0.5–1 μg/μl. The needle was held at ground potential and positioned ≈1 mm away from the capillary entrance (≈–1000 V) of the mass spectrometer. Sample solutions were sprayed directly into the capillary entrance at a flow rate of 40–100 nl/min. All mass spectra were obtained by using the Xmass V.5.01 program (Bruker) and external calibration. Preparation of Rabbit Antiserum against Tauro-GM2—Production of rabbit antiserum against tauro-GM2 was carried out by the Core Facility of Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA, according to the following protocol. Chemically synthesized tauro-GM2 (0.5 mg) and methylalbumin (0.5 mg) in 0.6 ml of water were emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. One-half of this emulsion was injected into the front pads of an adult male New Zealand White rabbit (2.5 kg), and the remainder was injected into the back of the rabbit at 3 sites. The same procedure was repeated at 10, 25, and 39 days after the initial injection. The antiserum was harvested 2 weeks after the last injection. In parallel, the same protocol was used to immunize a rabbit with GM2. The Ouchterlony double-diffusion method (23Ouchterlony O. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1953; 32: 231-240Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar) was used to detect the production of anti-tauro-GM2 antibody. Under these conditions, tauro-GM2, but not GM2, elicited the antibody production in the rabbit, indicating that tauro-GM2 is more immunogenic to rabbit than GM2. By the Ouchterlony double-diffusion method (23Ouchterlony O. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1953; 32: 231-240Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar), the rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum did not cross-react with GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, and sulfatide (see Fig. 6). TLC Immunostaining—The specific binding of rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 antibody to different gangliosides was carried out by overlaying the thin layer chromatograms with the rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum (1:20 dilution), followed by reacting with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA). The antibody binding was revealed with a substrate solution containing 3 mg of 4-chloro-1-naphthol dissolved in 1 ml of methanol, 4 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, and 2 μlof30%H2O2 as described by Magnani et al. (24Magnani J.L. Nilsson B. Brockhaus M. Zopf D. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14365-14369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the peroxidase-conjugated second antibody was used instead of radioiodinated second antibody and autoradiography. Partial Purification of Gangliosides from Small Pathological Brain Samples—For the detection of the presence of tauro-GM2 in small pathological brain samples by TLC immunostaining, monosialogangliosides from 1 to 2 g of brain samples were prepared separately as described (3Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Eng L.F. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Tauro-GM2 in the ganglioside mixture was subsequently enriched by HPAC (7Månsson J.-E. Rosengren B. Svennerholm L. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 322: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Detection and Isolation of a UC from a Variant B TS Brain Sample— Fig. 1A shows the fractionation of the crude GSL extract prepared from a variant B TS brain sample by Q-Sepharose chromatography (4Hirabayashi Y. Nakano T. Matsumoto M. Obata K. Ando S. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 445: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TLC analysis of the column fractions revealed that GM2, the major ganglioside, had eluted over a wide range of fractions (Fig. 1A, fractions 80–180). Although the front two-thirds of these fractions (Fig. 1A, fractions 80–147) contained mainly GM2, the latter fractions (Fig. 1A, fractions 148–180) contained 1–2 GSLs with TLC mobilities slightly faster than that of GM2. Because the TLC mobilities of these two fast moving GSLs were very close to those of GM3 (see Fig. 1A), and the level of GM3 had been reported to be also elevated in TS brains (25Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Rapin I. Suzuki Y. Ishii N. Neurology. 1970; 20: 190-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Suzuki Y. Jacob J.C. Suzuki K. Kutty K.M. Suzuki K.

Neurochem. 1987; 49: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we initially regarded them as a doublet of GM3. However, clostridial sialidase (Sigma) converted only about 30% of these fast moving bands to lactosylceramide, indicating that these bands contained a UC other than GM3. Furthermore, the fast moving bands gave a greenish-gray color in response to the DPA spray (see Fig. 2, A and B), which was distinct from the purple color typically given by sialoglycoconjugates such as gangliosides (5Anderson K. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fractions 148–180 (containing UC, shown in Fig. 1A) were pooled and subsequently fractionated by high resolution silicic acid (Iatrobeads, Iatron Laboratory) chromatography (6Momoi T. Ando S. Magai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, UC was well separated from GM2 by this procedure. The UC-containing fractions (Fig. 1B, fractions 50–64) were pooled and further purified by HPAC (7Månsson J.-E. Rosengren B. Svennerholm L. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 322: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to obtain the pure UC. Through these purification steps, we obtained about 0.8 mg of pure UC from 75 g of wet brain sample. Using the same procedure, we did not detect the presence of UC in a normal brain sample (100 g) from a 4-year-old boy. The pure UC migrated as a single band by TLC (see Fig. 2B, lane 3). Structural Characterization of UC by NMR Spectroscopy— We have assigned the NMR chemical shifts of 1H, 13C, and 15N for the sugar chain of UC and GM2 isolated from TS brain (Table I). The 1H–1H double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy spectra of UC revealed the proton relay signals corresponding to seven spin systems. The HMBC and ROESY two-dimensional NMR experiments supplied definitive structural information regarding the interconnection of the seven spin systems and provided an overall view of the structure. Analysis of HSQC and HMBC spectra showed that, as in the case of GM2, the ceramide (Cer) of UC contained two spin systems: the sphingenine and the fatty acyl amide. In addition to the four spin systems found in GM2 (Neu5Ac, Gal, GalNAc, and Glc), the sugar chain of UC contained a fifth spin system, 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine). The assignment of the sugar sequence was based on the analysis of ROESY and HMBC. In the ROESY spectrum, the anomeric proton of β-Glc (4.156 ppm; 3JHH = 7.8 Hz; 1JCH = 159 Hz) showed the cross-peak with the more upfield H1′ proton (3.400 ppm) of the sphingenine in Cer moiety, indicating the presence of the Glcβ1→1′-Cer structure in UC. The anomeric proton of β-Gal (4.302 ppm; 3JHH = 7.8 Hz; 1JCH = 160.5 Hz) shows the inter-residual nuclear Overhauser effect with the H4 proton (3.313 ppm) of β-Glc; the anomeric proton of β-GalNAc (4.435 ppm; 3JHH = 8.5 Hz; 1JCH = 160.5 Hz) “talks” to the H4 proton (3.854 ppm) of β-Gal, indicating the presence of the GalNAcβ1→4Galβ1→4Glc1→1′-Cer sequence. The α-(2→3)-ketosidic linkage between the Neu5Ac and the β-Gal was confirmed by the chemical shift of the H3 protons (H3 equatorial, 2.637 ppm; H3 axial, 1.848 ppm) (30Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L.

Several lines of evidence indicate the presence of an amide bond between the carboxyl group of Neu5Ac and a taurine residue in UC. In the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 3), we detected the two-bond correlation between the taurine amide proton (8.459 ppm) and the C1 carbon (168.55 ppm) of Neu5Ac and also the three-bond correlation between the more upfield aliphatic proton on C1 of taurine (3.342 ppm) and the C1 carbon (168.55 ppm) of Neu5Ac. In the ROESY spectrum, we see the following inter-residue interactions: taurine-NH/GalNAc-H1, taurine-NH/GalNAc-NH, taurine-NH/Neu5Ac-OH8, taurine-NH/Neu5Ac-H4, and taurine-H2/Neu5Ac-OH8. Diffusion coefficient measurements (22Wu D. Chen A. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 115: 260-264Crossref Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) provide additional evidence showing that taurine is a part of UC. The value of the translational diffusion coefficient of UC, calculated from the well separated signal (2.700 ppm) of C2 methylene protons of taurine, is identical to the value obtained for any other proton on the sugar chain (D = 1.05e – 10 m2/s). These results show that taurine is an integral part of the molecule and establish the structure of UC as tauro-GM2 (see Fig. 5A for the structure).Fig. 5The chemical structure of tauro-GM2 (A) and an overlay of proton-detected 13C–1H HSQC spectra of the isolated (magenta) and the synthetic (cyan) tauro-GM2 (B). Arabic numerals refer to the protons of the residues designated by the Roman numerals, and the protons of Neu5Ac (N), taurine (T), and the sphingenine backbone in Cer (S).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of UC by Electrospray Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS)—Subsequently, we used mass spectrometry to ascertain the presence of a conjugated taurine in UC. By FT-ICR-MS, the protonated GM2 isolated from the variant B TS brain sample was detected at m/z 1384.801 (Fig. 4A, peak a), which corresponds to the calculated monoisotopic m/z 1384.832 for the GM2 containing octadecasphingenine and stearic acid. In addition, several peaks separated by 26 Da (representing an additional –CH=CH– moiety) or 28 Da (representing an additional –CH2–CH2– moiety) appeared in the mass spectrum, indicating the heterogeneity and the complexity of the ceramide moiety in GM2. The assignments for the major monoisotopic mass peaks shown in Fig. 4A (peaks b–f) are presented in the legend to this figure. On the other hand, the protonated molecule of UC was detected at m/z 1491.855 (Fig. 4B, peak a). This value corresponds to the calculated monoisotopic m/z 1491.836 for the protonated GM2 (containing octadecasphingenine and stearic acid) conjugated with one residue of taurine. The FT-ICR mass spectrum of UC also contained sodium adducts, sodium/proton substitutions, dimers, and peaks corresponding to heterogeneous varieties with different chain lengths of the long chain base and fatty acid (peaks b–h), analogous to the variation found in Fig. 4A for GM2. The assignments of these major monoisotopic mass peaks are presented in the legend to Fig. 4B. Thus, the FT-ICR-MS confirmed the conjugation of taurine to GM2 in UC. Chemical Synthesis of Tauro-GM2—To obtain additional evidence that the structure of UC is tauro-GM2, we chemically conjugated the carboxyl group of Neu5Ac in GM2 with taurine using diethyl phosphorocyanidate as a coupling reagent in the presence of triethylamine as a catalyst (8Yamada S. Ikota N. Shioiri T. Tachibana S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 7714-7715Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Momose T. Tsubaki T. Iida T. Nambara T. Lipids. 1997; 32: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A, lane 2). As shown in Table I and Fig. 5B, the NMR chemical shifts of the sugar residues in the chemically synthesized tauro-GM2 were identical to those found in UC. Fig. 2B shows that the chemically synthesized tauro-GM2 and UC have the same TLC mobility and color response to the DPA reagent (5Anderson K. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The TLC mobility of tauro-GM2 is faster than GM2 but only slightly slower than GM3 (Fig. 2B). Immunological Detection of the Presence of Tauro-GM2 in Small TS Brain Samples—Because other TS brain samples were available to us only in small quantities (1–2 g), we used a sensitive TLC immunostaining method for the detection of the presence of tauro-GM2 in these samples. As shown in Fig. 6B, the monosialoganglioside fraction obtained from one more variant B and two variant O TS patients also contained a GSL that interacted with the rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum. This GSL and the chemically synthesized tauro-GM2 shared the same TLC mobility and color response to the DPA spray (5Anderson K. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under the same condition, we did not detect any GSL that interacted with the rabbit anti-tauro-GM2 serum in the corresponding fraction prepared from three normal human brain samples. From Fig. 6, one can also see that the anti-tauro-GM2 serum did not cross-react with GM1, GM2, GM3, or other gangliosides. Taken together, we have used NMR spectroscopy, FT-ICR-MS, chemical synthesis, and TLC immunostaining to conclusively show the presence of tauro-GM2 in TS brain samples. Our results indicate that previous reports of the elevation of GM3 in TS brain samples (25Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Rapin I. Suzuki Y. Ishii N.

Neurochem. 1987; 49: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), based primarily on TLC analysis, may instead be due to the presence of tauro-GM2, because the TLC mobility of tauro-GM2 is very close to that of GM3 (see Fig. 2B). Taurine, one of the most abundant free amino acids found in the human central nervous system (31Perry T.L. Hansen S. Berry K. Mok C. Lesk D. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Sturman J.A. Gaull G.E. J. Neurochem. 1975; 25: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Lefauconnier J.-M. Portemer C. Chatagner F. Brain Res. 1976; 117: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), has been shown to serve a wide variety of biological functions, including bile acid and xenobiotic conjugation, osmoregulation, and calcium modulation (34Huxtable R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 101-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Taurine conjugation is a well known mechanism in biological systems that facilitates the clearance of xenobiotics from the body by increasing their polarity and aqueous solubility (34Huxtable R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 101-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). GM2 is very insoluble in water (35Mraz W. Schwarzman G. Sattler J. Momoi T. Seemann B. Wiegandt H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1980; 361: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The pKa of the carboxylic acid of Neu5Ac is 2.6 (36Svennerholm L. Acta Soc. Med. Uppsaliensis. 1956; 61: 75-85Google Scholar), whereas that of the sulfonic acid of taurine has been reported to be between 1 and 1.5 (37Albert A. Biochem. J. 1950; 47: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 38King E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2204-2209Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, tauro-GM2 would be more polar and more water-soluble than GM2. The level of GM2 in a normal infant brain has been found to be around 19 nmol/g of wet tissue, whereas that in a TS brain could exceed 1000 nmol/g of wet tissue (39Sandhoff K. Conzelmann E Neufeld E.F. Kaback M.M. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1807-1839Google Scholar). Neural tissues may regard this massively elevated GM2 as a quasi-xenobiotic and employ taurine conjugation as a vehicle for its removal. However, the low pKa of taurine makes tauro-GM2 a potential surfactant that may exert an adverse effect on neural tissues. It is well known that the toxicity of a xenobiotic can be activated upon conjugation (40Kauffman F.C. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 2434-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Although enzymes for detoxication in the central nervous system have been studied extensively (41Minn A. Ghersi-Egea J.-F. Perrin R. Leininger B. Siest G. Brain Res. Rev. 1991; 16: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the enzyme responsible for the taurine conjugation of GM2 has not yet been identified, and the possible pathophysiological effects of tauro-GM2 on the central nervous system remain to be elucidated. It should be pointed out that the taurine-conjugated Neu5Ac is a novel sialic acid derivative that has not been previously revealed. Tauro-GM2 represents an additional pathological product of TSD and should be taken into consideration in the future development of therapies for this dreadful disease.

This study examined whether a specific regulatory mechanism that exists in neuronal development also plays a role in the pancreas. In non-neuronal cells, neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NSRF) actively represses gene transcription via a sequence-specific DNA motif known as the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE). This DNA motif has been identified in many genes that are specific markers for cells of neuronal and neuroendocrine lineage. We identified several genes involved in pancreas development that also harbor NRSE-like motifs, including pdx-1, Beta2/NeuroD, and pax4. The paired homeodomain transcription factor Pax4 is implicated in the differentiation of the insulin-producing β-cell lineage because disruption of the pax4 gene results in a severe deficiency of β-cells and the manifestation of diabetes mellitus in mice. The NRSE-like motif identified in the upstream pax4 promoter is highly conserved throughout evolution, forms a DNA-protein complex with NRSF, and confers NRSF-dependent transcriptional repression in the context of a surrogate gene promoter. This cis-activating NRSE element also confers NRSF-dependent modulation in the context of the native pax4 gene promoter. Together with earlier reports, these new findings suggest an important functional role for NRSF in the expression of the pax4 gene and infer a role for NRSF in pancreatic islet development.

Pancreas development appears to follow a precise pattern of gene expression events characterized by temporal and spatial specificity. As such, a hierarchical model of transcription factor gene expression has evolved based on phenotypic observations from specific knock-out and transgenic animal studies. An interpretation of these data is illustrated in Fig. 1 (see “Results”) (1Kemp D.M. Thomas M.K. Habener J.F. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disorders. 2003; 4: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors that are essential for β-cell differentiation are also involved in the neuronal development program. For example, the expression of Beta2/NeuroD is necessary for terminal differentiation of all endocrine cell types similar to its requirement for the differentiation of neurons in the brain (1Kemp D.M. Thomas M.K. Habener J.F. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disorders. 2003; 4: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarities between islet and neuronal cells also exist at the level of physiology, such as in their electrical excitability and secretory vesicle functions. In addition to these similarities in differentiation and phenotypic profiles, the likelihood of the existence of additional molecular parallels is strong. Here we investigated whether the NRSE/NRSF 1The abbreviations used are: NRSE, neuron-restrictive silencer element; NRSF, neuron-restrictive silencer factor; MODY, maturity onset diabetes of the young. transcriptional repressor mechanism is involved in islet cell gene expression coincident with its role in neuron-specific gene regulation. The cis-regulatory NRSE is a 21-bp motif that confers transcriptional repression of genes in many non-neuronal cell types (2Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C.

Inhibition of NRSF binding to the NRSE in differentiating neurons permits transcriptional expression of these genes and facilitates terminal differentiation of neuronal lineages through neuron-specific gene regulation (4Nishimura E.

Expression of a dominant-negative form of NRSF in the developing chick spinal cord resulted in precocious expression of neuronal target genes in neural progenitors (5Chen Z.-F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In contrast, constitutive expression of NRSF in differentiating neuroblasts led both to a down-regulation of endogenous NRSF target genes and the defective development of neuronal axon pathfinding (6Paquette A.J.

The earlier discovery that pancreatic β-cells are devoid of NRSF-binding activity (7Atouf F. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. J. Biol.

Here we report the identification of a functional NRSE regulatory DNA element in the promoter of the pax4 gene and describe the potential importance of this element in the regulation of the expression of pax4 in the pancreas. Cell Lines—All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen except fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 2 mml-glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, and 50 μmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol (9Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured in FK12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2. Cell cultures were passaged by trypsinization and subcultured every 5 days. Gel-shift Assays—Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing two tandem copies of the pax4 NRSE (2 × 5′-CCCGT GCTGT CCTGC CCATG GTGCT GAAAC TATCT G-3′) or the mutated pax4-NRSE (2 × 5′-CCCGT GCTGT CAGGC CCATT AAGAC GAAAC TATCT G-3′) were synthesized, and end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. Free nucleotides were separated by centrifugation through a G-50 column. DNA-protein-binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl final volume of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 250 μg of poly(dI-dC)/ml. The nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) was added to the reaction buffer in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor DNA (SCG10–36, 5′-GCAAA GCCAT TTCAG CACCA CGGAG AGTGC CTCTG C-3′, and SCG10-m36, 5′-GCAAA GCCAT TTCAG CACCA CTTAG AGTGC CTCTG C-3′) or antibody and pre-incubated for 10 min on ice. Radiolabeled probe (20,000 cpm) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 20 min on ice. Electrophoresis to resolve DNA-protein complexes was performed in 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 150 V for 2–3 h. Antibodies for NRSF were a kind gift from Gail Mandel, Stony Brook, NY (P73 and F3). Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—The cloned reporter gene construct containing the 5′-flanking region of the pax4 gene (–2153pFox-luc) was generously provided by Dr. Michael German, UCSF, CA. Rat NRSF cDNA, cloned into pcDNA3, was a kind gift from Dr. Tonis Timmusk, University of Helsinki, Finland. Cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown overnight or until 75–80% confluent and then transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's procedure (Invitrogen). 400 ng (pFox-luc) or 20 ng (pGL3control) of reporter gene construct was co-transfected into the cells along with 1 ng of pRL-CMV containing the cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega) to normalize the luciferase activity. When indicated, rat NRSF expression vector was co-transfected, with pcDNA3 used as control. After transfection, cells were incubated for5hin serum- and antibiotic-free medium and then incubated for a further 48 h in normal growth medium. Cells were lysed and measurements of luciferase activity were performed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) in conjunction with the AutolumatPlus dual-injection port luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase values were normalized with the Renilla luciferase activity of co-transfected pRL-CMV. Values are expressed as -fold induction relative to the control empty vector reporter genes. To determine whether NRSF participates in islet-cell differentiation we screened data bases for NRSE-like elements in regulatory regions of the transcription factor genes indicated in Fig. 1 (see Table I). Our focus on pax4 in this study was based on several criteria: (a) the NRSE-like motif is present in the 5′-regulatory region where most functionally characterized NRSEs are located, (b) the similarity to the consensus NRSE is strong such that all nucleotides known to be required for functional integrity are conserved, (c) the core sequence is conserved 100% throughout evolution in a region of the promoter that otherwise displays relatively low nucleotide identity (Fig. 2A), and (d) Pax4 is an important component of terminal cell fate directing the formation of β-cells in the developing islet such that Pax4-null mice display a failure of β-cell development (10Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Torres M. Oliver G. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 386: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). We aligned the sequence with the corresponding regions of several species (Fig. 2A). A high degree of conservation was maintained in all species examined, although the flanking sequences were poorly conserved. Moreover, the core NRSE motif is entirely conserved in the pax4 promoter throughout evolution. Three of the four mismatches from the consensus NRSE were located at positions most frequently altered in phylogeny and believed not to be essential for NRSF binding (11Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).Table IPutative NRSE motifs in pancreas-specific transcription-factor genesFig. 2The pax4 NRSE sequence and binding activity. A, alignment of the consensus sequence derived from 29 functional NRSEs with the putative NRSE in the pax4 gene promoter. Nucleotides shown in bold type are conserved in most functional NRSEs and are conserved in the pax4 promoter in all species analyzed. Asterisks mark nucleotides that are most commonly altered in functional NRSEs. Shaded regions illustrate nucleotide positions that are conserved throughout the evolutionary gap represented by the selected species. B and C, gel shifts demonstrating sequence-specific binding activity of NRSF to the pax4 NRSE. A 32P-labeled probe consisting of two tandem repeats of the pax4 NRSE was incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functional analysis of the putative pax4 NRSE was initially demonstrated by showing that the Pax4 promoter NRSE binds to NRSF. We performed electromobility shift assays using nuclear cell extracts from HeLa cells, known to express elevated levels of NRSF. An oligonucleotide comprising a pair of tandem 36-bp repeats from the pax4 gene promoter was used as probe (Fig. 2B). In the presence of an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”) a prominent complex formed in the binding reaction was abolished. When a mutated SCG10 oligonucleotide bearing no binding affinity for NRSF was used as a competitor, the protein-DNA complex was unaffected. Furthermore, in the presence of either of two NRSF-specific antisera, the same complex was substantially diminished, an effect that was not observed in the presence of a control antiserum (Fig. 2B). To further confirm NRSF binding to the Pax4 NRSE, we compared the electromobility shift assay profile of the pax4 probe with a mutant pax4 probe containing mismatched nucleotides in positions known to be essential to NRSE function (Fig. 2C). In all lanes, the complexes with the fastest mobility remained clearly visible suggesting that these interactions represent nonspecific binding under our experimental conditions. In contrast, the low mobility complex identified as the NRSF-NRSE complex in Fig. 2B was not observed in the presence of the mutated pax4 NRSE probe. The loss of this complex suggested that the protein component of this complex is NRSF. Next we asked whether the pax4 NRSE confers transcriptional regulation. After inserting the tandem NRSE sequence into the multiple cloning site of a luciferase reporter plasmid we performed assays to determine whether cis-regulatory functions are encoded in the pax4 NRSE (Fig. 3A). Forty-eight h after transfection into 3T3 cells reporter gene activity was determined. Relative to the control vector, expression of the pax4 NRSE construct was attenuated by ∼60% (Fig. 3B). Because 3T3 cells express NRSF, these findings supported the predicted model that the pax4 NRSE mediates NRSF-dependent transcriptional repression. Consistent with this model, the mutant-NRSE plasmid construct displayed no attenuation in activity suggesting that the intact NRSE motif is necessary for the observed transcriptional repression in 3T3 cells. To further determine whether NRSF is the mediating factor in repression of the pax4 NRSE construct, we transfected the same reporter genes into endocrine cell lines devoid of NRSF-binding activity. We then tested whether exogenous expression of NRSF in these cells, by transfection with an expression plasmid, reproduces the attenuation of reporter gene activity. In both PC12 and INS-1 cells, the NRSE reporter constructs were co-expressed with either the pcDNA3.1 control vector or an NRSF expression vector (Fig. 3C). In both PC12 and INS-1 cells, reporter gene expression was attenuated by ∼50% in the presence of NRSF. In contrast, no significant difference in gene expression level was observed with the mutant-NRSE construct in the presence or absence of NRSF. These findings indicate that these two endocrine cell types provide a permissive environment for the transcription of the NRSE-containing gene promoter. Furthermore, these data demonstrated that the pax4 NRSE confers NRSF-specific transcriptional repression in the context of this reporter gene system. Finally, we determined whether the pax4 NRSE confers transcriptional regulation in the context of the native pax4 promoter. We took a reporter gene construct in which 2153 bases of the pax4 gene promoter were placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and transfected 3T3, PC12, and INS-1 cells. Compared with the control empty vector, gene expression levels were elevated 1–2-fold in PC12 and 3T3 cells, whereas an ∼8-fold increase was observed in INS-1 cells (Fig. 4A). Several reports of studies of the pax4 promoter describe a pancreatic β-cell-specific enhancer positioned ∼2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4B) (12Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Brink C. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Mech.

This 250-bp enhancer region confers β-cell specificity via its putative-binding sites for the transcription factors Beta2/NeuroD, Isl1, HNF1α, HNF4α, HNF3β, and PDX-1 (12Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Brink C. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Mech.

The pax4 NRSE sequence is located ∼1300 bp upstream from the transcription start site and is thereby ∼450 bp downstream of the enhancer region. This explains the mere 1–2-fold enhancement of gene expression in the PC12 cells, independent of the lack of NRSF activity. In contrast, INS-1 cells, which express these β-cell definitive transcription factors, correspondingly display an elevated level of expression in the absence of NRSF-mediated repression. To determine whether NRSF represses pax4 promoter activity in INS-1 cells, we introduced increasing concentrations of NRSF by transfection of the NRSF expression plasmid. This experiment produced a biphasic functional response in pax4 gene promoter activity. Transfection of 1 μg of NRSF induced a small but statistically significant decrease in reporter gene activity. However, increasing concentrations of NRSF caused a dose-dependent increase in reporter gene activity resulting in an ∼60% increase in expression above control levels (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data provide compelling evidence that pax4 gene expression is regulated in part by NRSF through its binding to, and regulating the activity of, the NRSE located in the 5′ upstream promoter region. We show that NRSF binds to the NRSE-like motif in the 5′-regulatory region of the pax4 gene and that it confers significant NRSF-mediated repression of gene transcription in the context of a constitutively active promoter. Furthermore, the NRSE displays cis-regulatory control of transcription in the context of the native pax4 gene promoter region in a clonal pancreatic β-cell line. These findings suggest that NRSF may be a relevant regulatory factor in pax4 gene expression and may, in turn, be important in β-cell differentiation. Several reports provide support for a role of NRSF in both pax4 gene expression and β-cell differentiation. For example, two of the genes up-regulated during activin A-induced differentiation of AR42J cells to neuron-like cells include the intermediate neurofilament gene and the synaptophysin gene (15Ohnishi H. Ohgushi N. Tanaka S. Mogami H. Nobusawa R. Mashima H. Furukawa M. Mine T. Shimada O. Ishikawa H. Kojima I. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both genes are known targets of NRSF (11Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Notably, the synaptophysin gene is devoid of any neuron-specific genetic elements other than the NRSE such that in a recent report Lietz et al. (16Lietz M. Hohl M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the absence of NRSF, the promoter of the synaptophysin gene is constitutively active (16Lietz M. Hohl M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, up-regulation of synaptophysin gene expression in the activin A-treated AR42J cells is likely to result from decreased NRSF activity, an event that is known to occur during neuronal differentiation (17Roopra A. Huang Y. Dingledine R. Mol. Interven. 2001; 1: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of hepatocyte growth factor, activin A treatment causes AR42J cells to differentiate into insulin-producing cells (18Zhang Y.-Q. Mashima H. Kojima I. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S10-S14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mashima H. Shibata H. Mine T. Kojima I. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, pax4 gene expression is substantially enhanced (18Zhang Y.-Q. Mashima H. Kojima I. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S10-S14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, activin A has been shown to increase pax4 gene expression in pancreatic β-cell lines, independent of changes in the expression of other transcription factors (20Ueda Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We speculate that if activin A indeed increased synaptophysin gene expression via suppression of NRSF activity (16Lietz M. Hohl M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it seems feasible that the activin A-dependent increase in pax4 gene expression in both β-cell lines and AR42J cells is also mediated through the down-regulation of the transcriptional NRSF repressor. Unlike the promoter of the synaptophysin gene, the pax4 gene promoter appears to be regulated by multiple factors. We found that PC12 cells lacking NRSF were not capable of sustaining pax4 promoter activity. Indeed, several groups have shown that a specific region of the pax4 promoter harbors the binding sites for several different transcription factors (12Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Brink C. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Mech.

This region of the Pax4 promoter represents a sequence of DNA in which most if not all of the regulatory information for tissue-specific pax4 gene expression is contained. Notably, of the six transcription factor genes that distinguish susceptibility to MODY, four of the factors interact with the pax4 regulatory region (i.e. HNF4α-MODY1, HNF1α-MODY3, PDX-1-MODY4, and Beta2/NeuroD-MODY6). Thus, the simultaneous expression of these transcription factors required for efficient pax4 transcription may play a role in regulating the tissue-specific expression of Pax4. Our observation that elevated levels of NRSF result in a stimulation of pax4 promoter activity suggests a biphasic regulatory mechanism of NRSF. Notably, elevated levels of NRSF enhance expression of the genes encoding dynamin I (21Yoo J. Jeong M.-J. Lee S.S. Lee K.I. Kwon B.-M. Kim D.S. Park Y.-M. Han M.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 928-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), atrial natriuretic peptide (22Kuwahara K. Saito Y. Ogawa E. Takahashi N. Nakagawa Y. Naruse Y. Harada M. Hamanaka I. Izumi T.

Majzoub J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13917-13923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in contrast to its role in gene repression at lower levels of expression. However, an implied role for NRSF in regard to biphasic expression patterns requires further investigation. The functional data presented in our study are derived from transient transfection experiments. Although this methodology is justified in analyses of NRSF function, it is noteworthy that NRSF-mediated gene repression may be dependent on rearrangement of the chromatin environment of the target gene (17Roopra A. Huang Y. Dingledine R. Mol. Interven. 2001; 1: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lunyak V.V. Burgess R. Prefontaine G.G. Nelson C. Sze S.-H. Chenoweth J. Schwartz P. Pevzner P.A. Glass C. Mandel G. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2002; 298: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Studies employing chromatin immunoprecipitation assays may yield more functionally relevant data. In this regard, studies of the regulation of the genome-integrated pax4 gene should prove to be more suited to the chromatin-responsive effects of NRSF and yield more predictive functional data. We speculate that a possible role of NRSF in pax4 gene regulation may be to confer a temporary stop mechanism in an otherwise expression-permissive environment. This concept of developmental regulation is attractive, given that developmental processes are critically dependent on both spatial and temporal patterns of regulation of gene expression (1Kemp D.M. Thomas M.K. Habener J.F. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disorders. 2003; 4: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The recent report suggesting that constitutive expression of pax4 in mouse embryonic stem cells significantly promotes the development of insulin-producing cells (25Blyszczuk P. Czyz J. Kania G. Wagner M. Roll U. St-Onge L. Wobus A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) favors this notion and supports the notion of a direct involvement of pax4 in pancreas development. In conclusion, demonstration that a functionally responsive NRSE resides in the promoter region of the pax4 gene introduces the possibility that NRSF may play a direct functional role in the differentiation of pancreatic islet cell types. We thank Dr. Michael German for kindly providing the pax4 promoter reporter gene construct and Dr. Tonnis Timmusk for the rat NRSF clone. We also thank Gail Mandel for providing NRSF antibodies, and Dr. Claus Wollheim for providing the INS-1 cells."

DIP1 is found in nuclear subdomains resembling speckles known to accumulate transcription and splicing factors. In early embryos, nuclear localization of DIP1 protein coincides with the onset of zygotic gene expression. Later in development DIP1 expression is decreased in dividing cells in different tissues.

A role for DIP1 in epigenetic mechanisms that lead to the establishment and/or maintenance of cell fate specification is discussed. The fate and function of a large number of different RNA molecules are dependent upon their interactions with specific RNA-binding proteins. RNA-binding proteins compose a diverse group of proteins that participate in a wide range of biochemical functions (1Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A subset of these proteins preferentially recognizes and binds dsRNA. 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; DIP1, Disco interacting protein 1; dsRBD, double-stranded RNA binding domain; DSRBP, dsRNA-binding proteins; disco, disconnected; Ubx, Ultrabithorax; ey, eyeless; hth, homothorax; salm, spalt major; dll, distalless; NLS, nuclear localization signal; UTR, untranslated region; RED1, glutamate receptor RNA editase; ADAR1, human RNA-editing enzyme; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside. These dsRNA-binding proteins (DSRBP) feature the presence of one or more double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD). These structural motifs of 65–68 amino acids in length can be divided into two groups according to their similarity to the consensus sequence and their ability to bind dsRNA. Type A dsRBDs generally bind dsRNA with high affinity and show a high degree of sequence similarity with the entire consensus sequence. Type B dsRBDs bind dsRNA less efficiently and are similar at their C termini to the consensus sequence but not at their N termini (2St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). DSRBPs are involved in a variety of cellular functions that range from RNA localization to RNA editing and more recently post-transcriptional gene silencing (3Rotondo G. Frendewey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Piron M. Vende P.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6361-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila genome there are 12 dsRBD-containing proteins, and of these only 5 have been genetically characterized (7Lasko P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8St. Johnston D. Beuchle D. Nusslein-Volhard C.

The Staufen gene, first identified as mutations that disrupt early embryonic pattern formation, is required for RNA localization and translational control. Mutations in the maleless (mle) gene cause disruption in X chromosome dosage compensation and thus male-specific lethality. The Mle protein is part of the male-specific lethal complex that associates with the X chromosome in males and leads to a 2-fold increase in the expression of X-linked genes presumably through an increase in the level of histone acetylation (reviewed in Ref. 12Birchler J.A. Bhadra U. Bhadra M.P. Auger D.L. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Three of the Drosophila DSRBPs have been reported to function in RNA interference and editing (9Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar, 10Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1004-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The remaining six dsRBD-containing proteins include one protein highly similar to TAR-binding protein and five others of unknown function (7Lasko P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore Drosophila DSRBPs compose a finite gene family whose function is likely to represent the range of biochemical functions fulfilled by this class of proteins for the development and homeostasis of an organism. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel dsRBD-containing gene. This gene, called DIP1, for Disco Interacting Protein 1, was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential regulators of disconnected (disco) gene function. The disco gene encodes a nuclear protein with two Kruppel-like zinc fingers expressed in a developmentally regulated fashion and displays a tissue-specific autoregulatory feedback loop (13Steller H. Fischbach K.F. Rubin G. Cell. 1987; 50: 1139-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Lee K.J. Mukhopadhyay M. Pelka P. Campos A.R. Steller H.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mutations in the disco gene cause a variety of phenotypes that range from disruption in the connectivity of the larval visual system to failure in the differentiation of the circadian pacemakers in the central nervous system (13Steller H. Fischbach K.F. Rubin G. Cell. 1987; 50: 1139-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Campos A.R. Lee K.J. Steller H. J.

The DIP1 gene is widely expressed in all stages of development. In early embryos, nuclear localization of DIP1 coincides with the onset of zygotic gene expression. Additionally, the level of DIP1 protein appears reduced in dividing cells in different tissues during embryonic and postembryonic development. Interestingly, DIP1 is found mostly in nuclear subdomains resembling speckles shown to accumulate transcription and splicing factors. DIP1 overexpression in the eye-antennal imaginal disc causes cell fate transformations and the formation of supernumerary structures in the head capsule. Taken together our results suggest that DIP1 may mediate epigenetic mechanisms required for the establishment and/or maintenance of cell fate specification. Fly Strains—Transgenic fly stocks used in these studies include eyeless (ey)-GAL4 (Bloomington 5535), GMR-GAL4 (Bloomington 1104), armadillo-GAL4 (Bloomington 1561), tubulin-GAL4 (Bloomington 5138), and hsp70-GAL4 (Bloomington 2077). The UAS-DIP1-b and -c lines used for the overexpression studies were created after subcloning the respective cDNAs into the NotI-BglII and NotI-XhoI sites of the pUASt transformation vector (18Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The UAS-GAL4 crosses were performed at 25 and/or 28 °C. The homothorax (hth), spalt major (salm), and distalless (dll)-lacZ reporter lines used in this study were kindly provided by E. Larsen. Adult heads were scanned using the environmental scanning electron microscope Electroscan 2020. Yeast Interaction Trap Screening and Cloning of DIP1—A Drosophila 0–12-h embryonic cDNA library, constructed in the galactose-inducible yeast expression vector pJG4-5, was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Brent. The library was screened according to Ref. 19Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar. The baits used for the interaction trap assay were constructed by cloning 5′ (corresponding to 186 N-terminal amino acids) or 3′ (corresponding to 153 C-terminal amino acids) portions of the disco cDNA in-frame with the LexA coding sequence contained in the pEG202 plasmid. EGY48 was used as the host yeast cell. Yeast cell transformations were done according to Ref. 20Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar. A total of 2 × 106 transformants were screened by plating on Ura-, His-, Trp-, and Leu- plates containing galactose each time. The Disco N-terminal bait yielded 150 colonies after 3 days at 30 °C, 18 of which showed galactose-dependent blue color in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside medium (X-gal, Sigma). Sixteen of these clones contained a 1.1-kb 3′-end fragment of DIP1 cDNA. Additional full-length DIP1 cDNAs were isolated by conventional screening of a 0–12-h cDNA library (DIP1-a) (21Zinn K. McAllister L. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and from an ovarian cDNA library (DIP1-c) (22Stroumbakis N.D. Li Z. Tolias P.P. Gene. 1994; 143: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP, EST LD14381) kindly provided the DIP1-b cDNA. The DIP1 genomic sequence was obtained from cosmids isolated from a genomic library kindly provided by J. Tamkun (University of California, Santa Cruz). Disco Binding Studies—DIP1 protein was synthesized in vitro using the expression system from MBI Fermentas. Briefly, the DIP1-a cDNA was inserted in the vector pSPUTK and transcribed in vitro from the SP6 promoter following the manufacturer's protocol (MBI Fermentas). DIP1 protein was labeled by [35S]methionine incorporation during disco translation. Both wild type and mutated N-terminal Disco-GST fusion constructs as well as GST alone were expressed from the pGEX vector in the protease-negative Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3 (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Binding protocol is essentially as described in Ref. 23Gekakis N. Saez L. Delahye-Brown A.-M. Myers M.P. Sehgal A. Young M.W. Weitz C.J. Science. 1995; 270: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar. DIP1 Protein Purification—The DIP1-a cDNA was cloned at NdeI and XhoI sites of pET29b(+) expression vector (Novagen). The ATG in the NdeI site was used as the translation initiation site, and the termination codon of pET29b(+) was used to tag the protein with a His6. This construct was then transformed into E. coli BL21-(DE3) cells. Bacterial cultures (24Brent R. Finley Jr., R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) grown for large scale protein production were processed for protein purification under denaturing conditions (8 m urea) according to the Qiagen protocol with 15 mm imidazole present in the lysis and wash buffers. The DIP1 His-tagged protein was purified from the bacterial lysate by elution from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow slurry (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol for batch purification. For injection purposes the eluted protein was precipitated in 8 volumes of 80% acetone and lyophilized. For antibody purification, the protein was stored in the elution buffer at 4 °C until needed. Generation of DIP1-c and -b Deletion Constructs and dsRBD Constructs—Constructs expressing His-tagged DIP1-b and DIP1-c were obtained by ligating the BamHI-HindIII digest of the pET21b(+) vector (Novagen) with the BamHI-HindIII-restricted amplification products of the corresponding cDNAs. The following PCR primers were used: 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGAAGCGAAATCGTCGTGC and 3′-CCCAAGCTTGGGAGTGGTGTCGCTGTAGGTG. The double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD) were cloned by PCR amplification using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) of the corresponding dsRBD regions from DIP1-c using primers containing NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, to allow for in-frame cloning with histidine tag (His6 tag). The dsRBDs were cloned into pET29b(+) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The primers for dsRBD1 are 5′-TGCGCAAGCATATGCTCCCCAAGAAC and 3′-CTTGGGGGTCTCGAGTGCAATAATAAAATC, and the primers for dsRBD2 are 5′-GCTGGGAGCATATGCACCCGGCGA and 3′-GTAGGTGAACTCGAGGCCGAACAGAGA. A construct expressing DIP1-c with an N-terminal T7 tag was made by PCR amplification of DIP1-c from pET21b(+)-DIP1-c with 5′-ATGAAGAAGCTTCGTCGTGCATTTGCTGGA containing HindIII restriction site in-frame with the T7 tag (T7 viral epitope tag) and 3′-GTGGTGCTCGAGTTAAGTGGTGTCGCTGTAGGTGAA having XhoI restriction site and a stop codon. DIP1-c deletion constructs were made by PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) of pET21b(+)-DIP1-c using primers going in opposite directions flanking dsRBDs. The primers contained NcoI restriction sites, and the PCR product was ligated and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Primers for dsRBD1 deletion are 5′-TTGGGGAGCCATGGCTTGCGCAGCTGGCGGTT and 3′-ATTTTATTCCATGGAAAATGACCCCCAAGCCG. Primers for dsRBD2 deletion are 5′-GGGTGCATCCATGGCCAGCCAGAGGGTAGCTC and 3′-GCAACTCTCCATGGGGCACAACTTCACCTAC. Northwestern Blots—Proteins used in Northwestern blots were purified in the same manner as the one used for immunization. The Northwestern protocol is essentially as described previously (2St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). dsRNA probes were prepared by phosphorylating poly(I)-poly(C) dsRNA (Amersham Biosciences). Structured RNA probes were prepared by transcribing from pT7VA1 (kindly provided by M. B. Mathews) with T7 polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP 5 × 105 cpm/ml was used for the binding assay. Generation of DIP1 Antibody—Purified DIP1 protein was sent to Pocono Rabbit Farm (Canadensis, PA) for injection into two rabbits following the facility's protocol for popliteal immunization. The antibody was affinity-purified using DIP1 protein (isoform a or c) immobilized on nitrocellulose filters essentially as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged DIP1 protein expressed in Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells was purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics). The immunoprecipitated protein was recognized by DIP1 antibody in Western blots (data not shown). Likewise the DIP1 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged DIP1 protein expressed in S2 cells (data not shown). The specificity of the DIP1 antibody was confirmed by the following experiments. DIP1 antibody labeling was abolished when the antibody was preincubated with recombinant DIP1 protein in all specimens reported here (data not shown). Ectopic expression of the DIP1 gene via the GAL4 system was recognized by this antibody as an ectopic nuclear signal (data not shown). DIP1 gene expression as detected by this antibody was entirely consistent with that detected by RNA in situ (data not shown). Finally, antibody affinity-purified using two different DIP1 isoforms from two different rabbits detected an indistinguishable pattern of expression not detected by the preimmune sera. Immunohistochemistry of Ovaries—Ovaries from 2- to 3-day-old mated Oregon-R females were prepared essentially as described previously (26Suter B. Steward R. Cell. 1991; 67: 917-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Dissected ovaries were incubated with rabbit anti-DIP1 antibody (1:15 dilution) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to the fluorochrome Alexa 488 (dilution 1:200; Molecular Probes, catalogue number A11008) for 2 h at room temperature. The whole mount ovaries were mounted in 70% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline containing trace amounts of p-phenylenediamine (Sigma P-6001). For propidium iodide staining, ovaries were fixed and permeabilized similarly except that the specimens were treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 2 h prior to incubation in propidium iodide (ICN number 195458) at 100 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Ovaries were subsequently treated for immunolabeling as described previously (26Suter B. Steward R. Cell. 1991; 67: 917-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The preparation of ovaries for phalloidin labeling was carried out according to a previously published procedure (26Suter B. Steward R. Cell. 1991; 67: 917-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). DIP1 immunolabeling was completed prior to incubation in phalloidin-conjugated rhodamine (Molecular Probes R-415) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunohistochemistry of Embryos—Oregon-R embryos were collected at 22 °C on apple juice agar plates and staged as defined previously (27Campos-Ortega J.A. Hartenstein V. The Embryonic Development of Drosophila melanogaster. 1st ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1985Crossref Google Scholar). Specimen preparation was carried out as described previously (28Patel N.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 445-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The anti-DIP1 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:15. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:200) or goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch 111-035-003). For fluorescent secondary antibodies, embryos were treated and mounted as specified for ovaries in Ref. 26Suter B. Steward R. Cell. 1991; 67: 917-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, whereas horseradish peroxidase-stained embryos were processed for diaminobenzidine and mounted as described in Ref. 28Patel N.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 445-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar. Phalloidin labeling of embryos was performed as outlined previously (28Patel N.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 445-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) except that 80% cold ethanol replaced methanol. Following fixation, embryos were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:20) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed several times in 1× PBT (0.5% Triton X-10), and processed for antibody labeling (26Suter B. Steward R. Cell. 1991; 67: 917-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Patel N.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 445-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). For detection of mitotic spindles, embryos were prepared as specified previously (29Karr T.L. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1494-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and labeled with anti-tubulin antibody (E6 Iowa Hybridoma Bank, dilution 1:50). Bound antibody was detected using a goat anti-mouse conjugated to Texas Red secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch 115-075-147) at a dilution of 1:150. Specimens were viewed under Normarski optics in a Zeiss Axioscope. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 krypton/argon laser confocal microscope. Photomicrographs were taken on Fujichrome 64 film and panels constructed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Immunohistology of Eye-Antennal Discs—Larval brains and eye-antenna imaginal discs were dissected and stained with X-gal (Sigma) for homothorax-, spalt-, and distalless-lacZ reporter lines as described previously (30Quiring R. Walldorf U. Kloter U. Gehring W.J. Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Samples were visualized as using Nomarski optics. Identification and Cloning of the Disco Interacting Protein 1 Gene (DIP1)—In order to begin addressing the mechanisms underlying disco tissue-specific autoregulatory function, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate putative partners of the disco gene product. We used an interaction trap assay developed as a modification of the yeast two-hybrid system. This approach employs baits fused to the LexA DNA binding domain, the LEU2 and lacZ reporters under the control of the LexA operator, and a cDNA library fused to the E. coli B42 activation domain (19Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 24Brent R. Finley Jr., R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The library screened was a Drosophila 0–12-h embryonic cDNA library constructed and kindly provided by Dr. R. Brent (Harvard Medical School). Two portions of the disco gene were used as bait: a C-terminal fragment of 154 amino acids (residues 415–568 (32Heilig J.S. Freeman M. Laverty T. Lee K.J. Campos A.R. Rubin G.M. Steller H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) and a 186-amino acid N-terminal fragment containing the two zinc fingers (residues 1–186). Due to the ability of the N-terminal fragment to activate LexA reporter gene expression in the absence of a heterologous activation domain, a mutated version of this fragment was used in which Cys-127 was substituted by a Ser. This mutation, which is the same found in the disco 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; DIP1, Disco interacting protein 1; dsRBD, double-stranded RNA binding domain; DSRBP, dsRNA-binding proteins; disco, disconnected; Ubx, Ultrabithorax; ey, eyeless; hth, homothorax; salm, spalt major; dll, distalless; NLS, nuclear localization signal; UTR, untranslated region; RED1, glutamate receptor RNA editase; ADAR1, human RNA-editing enzyme; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside. mutation, greatly reduces the N-terminal fragment transactivating capability allowing it to be used as bait in the interaction trap screen (data not shown and see Ref. 14Lee K.J. Mukhopadhyay M. Pelka P. Campos A.R. Steller H.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Disco C-terminal bait did not yield any positive clones in two rounds of the yeast two-hybrid screen (106 clones each). The screen using the Disco N-terminal bait yielded 18 positive interactors by galactose-dependent activation of two reporter genes, lacZ and LEU2 (Fig. 1A). Sixteen of these colonies contained the same cDNA as determined by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified DNA. Plasmid DNA from 4 of these 16 positive colonies was sequenced alongside additional full-length clones isolated through conventional methods from other cDNA libraries. Physical interaction between the Disco and DIP1 proteins was verified in a disco GST pull-down experiment. Purified N-terminal GST-Disco fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads was allowed to bind to in vitro translated DIP1 protein labeled with [35S]methionine. The GST-bound protein was eluted and analyzed on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. DIP1 protein bound only to GST-Disco fusion and not to GST alone (Fig. 1B). The DIP1 Gene Encodes a dsRNA-binding Protein That Contains Two dsRBDs—The DIP1 gene corresponds to the transcription unit that distally flanks the not-yet-sequenced repeatrich region in polytene band 20A at the base of the X chromosome (33Robert V. Prud'homme N. Kim A. Bucheton A. Pélisson A. Genetics. 2001; 158: 701-713PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic organization of the DIP1 gene and the features of three independently isolated DIP1 cDNAs are shown in Fig. 2 (33Robert V. Prud'homme N. Kim A. Bucheton A. Pélisson A. Genetics. 2001; 158: 701-713PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in the sequence of these clones exist at the 5′- and 3′-ends. Sequence heterogeneity at the 5′-end of the DIP1 cDNA clones can be accounted for by the inclusion of different segments of exons 1 and 2. The boundaries of these segments include consensus donor and acceptor splicing sites suggesting that alternative use of these sites is responsible for the sequence heterogeneity at the 5′-end. The existence of a putative start site (ATG) in DIP1-b and DIP1-c but not in DIP1-a indicates that proteins with a different N terminus may be synthesized by the corresponding mRNAs. The absence of this ATG in clone DIP1-a would lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein from a second initiator site located in exon 2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, assuming that the first start site is used preferentially, the predicted size of the DIP1-a, -b, and -c proteins is 34, 44, and 46 kDa, respectively. The DIP1 gene contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS) that spans exons 2 and 3 (31Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) includes variable number of repeats of ∼120 bp represented 8 times in DIP1-a, 7 times in DIP1-b, and 5 times in DIP1-c (Fig. 2). The number of repeats present has been shown to be strain-specific (33Robert V. Prud'homme N. Kim A. Bucheton A. Pélisson A. Genetics. 2001; 158: 701-713PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis using BLAST tool (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71449) Google Scholar) revealed that the predicted DIP1 protein contains two regions with similarity to double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD) (Figs. 2 and 3). A consensus for dsRBDs has been derived from in vitro binding experiments, mutational analysis and sequence comparison of several dsRNA-binding proteins (8St. Johnston D. Beuchle D. Nusslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1991; 66: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 35Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The defined dsRBD consensus sequence is 65–68 amino acids long (2St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Two types of dsRBD, a long (type A) and short (type B), have been recognized according to the degree and region of similarity to the full-length consensus sequence (2St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The first dsRBD (dsRBD1) is of the type A dsRBD, which shows strong similarity to the entire length of the consensus sequence (Fig. 3, DIP1-1). The second dsRBD (dsRBD2) is of the type B dsRBD and matches well the C-terminal portion (or core motif) but shows poor similarity to the N-terminal portion (Fig. 3, DIP1-2). The amino acid sequence of DIP1 dsRBDs shares the highest degree of amino acid similarity (50%) with those present in rat and human glutamate receptor RNA editase (rRED1 and hRED1) (Fig. 3). This similarity extends beyond the dsRBDs to include all of the DIP1 protein sequence. The alignment of the predicted DIP1 protein sequence with the N-terminal 301 amino acids of rRED1 and hRED1, which includes the two dsRBDs but not the catalytic domain, shows 43% amino acid similarity. The ability of DIP1-c, the longest isoform, to bind RNA was investigated in Northwestern blots probed with double-stranded (poly(I)-poly(C)) and single-stranded (poly(C)) homopolymers. The VA1 RNA of adenovirus, known to form extensive secondary structure, was also used to probe DIP1-c Northwestern blots. DIP1-c did not bind single-stranded homopolymers although it showed strong binding to either double-stranded RNA homopolymer or adenovirus VA1 RNA (Fig. 4), demonstrating that in vitro it behaves as a dsRNA-binding protein. The functional significance of the dsRBDs for dsRNA binding in Northwestern assays was further investigated. His-tagged constructs of DIP1-c were created in which either the dsRBD1 (DIP1-cΔdsRBD1) or the dsRBD2 (DIP1-cΔdsRBD2) was deleted (Fig. 5A). Additionally, similar constructs were made for the expression of dsRBD1 or dsRBD2 (Fig. 5A). Northwestern analysis was carried out as described above to evaluate the dsRNA binding ability of these recombinant proteins (Fig. 5B). Our results indicate that the dsRBD2 by itself was sufficient to bind dsRNA homopolymers (Fig. 5B, 1st lane). In contrast, dsRBD1 did not show any significant binding in these conditions (Fig. 5B, 2nd lane). Consistent with these results is the observation that a deletion of dsRBD2 (DIP1-cΔdsRBD2) causes a significant decrea"

The studies support the concept that surfactant protein B homeostasis is influenced by neutral lipid metabolites in the lung. During the respiratory cycles, the pulmonary surfactant protects the lung from collapse by lowering the air-liquid interface tension. Pulmonary surfactant is composed of 90-95% lipids and 5-10% surfactant proteins that are synthesized, stored, and secreted by alveolar type II (AT II) 1The abbreviations used are: AT II, alveolar type II; HODE, hydroxyoctadecanoic acid; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; ACTR, activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptor; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; PPRE, PPAR response element; RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; SP-B, surfactant protein B; hSP-B, human SP-B; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator-1; TIF2, transcriptional intermediary factor 2; TTF1, thyroid transcription factor 1; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PC, phosphatidylcholine; RXRα, retinoid X receptor; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. epithelial cells and nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (Clara cells). Similar to the liver, the lung is an organ with a high lipid turnover rate to fulfill the need for surfactant synthesis. The majority of surfactant lipids are phospholipids (∼80%). Disaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC), principally dipalmitoyl-PC, is the major phospholipid component in surfactant. In addition, there are about ∼10% neutral lipids in pulmonary surfactant. Although extensive characterization of phospholipids has been performed in maintaining surfactant function and homeostasis, the functional roles of neutral lipids in the lung are less clear. It has been documented that many neutral lipid metabolites are the ligands for nuclear receptors that are potent transcription factors controlling gene regulation. In neutral lipids, cholesteryl ester and triglycerides can be hydrolyzed by lysosomal acid lipase in the lysosome of cells to generate free cholesterol and free fatty acids (1Du H. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 937-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free cholesterol and free fatty acid derivative compounds, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, hydroxyoctadecanoic acids (HODEs), and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). PPARγ belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPAPγ is involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including macrophage inflammatory responses (2Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B.

Upon binding to ligands, PPARγ interacts with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form the PPARγ·RXR dimer that subsequently binds to specific PPAR-responsive elements (PPRE) on target genes and recruits nuclear receptor coactivators. Nuclear receptor coactivators possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activities to activate gene expression. PPARγ functions as both a positive and a negative regulator for target genes. Since AT II epithelial cells are responsible for synthesizing surfactant and highly lipogenic, it is important to know how gene expression of surfactant proteins in these cells is regulated by neutral lipid metabolic pathways. Among the surfactant proteins, SP-B is a 79-amino acid amphipathic peptide that is synthesized and produced in Clara cells and AT II epithelial cells. SP-B is secreted from AT II epithelial cells along with phospholipids into the alveolar lumen to form the surfactant. SP-B facilitates lamellar body formation in AT II epithelial cells and phospholipid spreading during the respiratory cycles (9Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M. Weaver T.E. Horowitz A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Null mutations in the SP-B gene cause lethal respiratory distress in newborn infants and in SP-B-deficient mice produced by gene targeting (10Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T.

Murphy A.M. deMello D.E. Colten H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Therefore, SP-B is essential for alveolar maturation and postnatal respiratory adaptation in newborns. Regulation of SP-B homeostasis is important to maintain the surfactant membrane structure and normal lung functions. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is an important aspect of SP-B homeostasis. Elucidation of mechanisms by which SP-B gene transcription is controlled by positive and negative transcription factors and signaling molecules is critical to understand SP-B synthesis and physiological functions in the lung. In this report, we assessed the effect of fatty acid metabolite 15d-PGJ2 on SP-B gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells and whole lung explants. The role of the downstream mediator of this metabolite, PPARγ·RXRα, in regulating SP-B gene transcription was also studied. The studies support the concept that PPARγ·RXRα and its ligands serve as negative regulators for SP-B gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells. These studies add a new insight into the mechanism whereby SP-B gene expression and homeostasis are regulated by neutral lipid metabolites and nuclear receptors in the lung. Plasmids and Transgenic Mice—The mammalian expression vectors for wild type PPARγ and ACTR were kind gifts from Dr. Ron Evans (the Salk Institute). The mammalian expression vector for dominant negative PPARγ was a kind gift from Dr. Krishna K Chatterjee (Cambridge, UK). The SRC-1 vector was kindly provided by Dr. B. O'Malley. The RXRγ and TIF2 expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. P. Chambon. The hSP-B 500 and hSP-B 218 luciferase reporter constructs were made previously (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The hSP-B 150 luciferase report construct was made by following a procedure previously described (12Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol.

Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). H441 Cell Maintenance—Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma H441 cells were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained and passaged weekly at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air. RT-PCR—H441 cells were seeded and treated with 15d-PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) at a final concentration of 10 μm overnight. Total RNAs were isolated from cells using the RNA purification kit (Qiagen Co.), and RNA concentrations were determined. One μg of total RNAs from each sample was subject to RT-PCR assay using a pair of primers corresponding to the SP-B coding region and the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) as described previously (14Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pair of primers corresponding to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coding region was used as a control. PCR signal intensities were determined by gel electrophoresis. H441 Cell Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—H441 cells were seeded at densities of 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates. For ligand study, various hSP-B luciferase reporter gene constructs (0.25 μg) and pCMV-βgal plasmid (0.5 μg) were cotransfected into H441 cells by FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science). H441 cells were treated with 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical Co.) on the following day. After 2 days of incubation to allow reporter protein expression, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega). For PPARγ·RXRα transfection study, various concentrations of PPARγ·RXRα expression vectors were co-transfected with the hSP-B 150-bp luciferase reporter gene construct (0.5 μg) and 0.5 μg of pCMV-βgal construct into H441 cells. On the next day, cells were treated with 10 μm 15d-PGJ2. After a 48-h incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined. For the nuclear receptor coactivator transfection study, various concentrations of SRC-1, ACTR, and TIF2 expression vectors were co-transfected with the hSP-B 150-bp luciferase reporter gene construct (0.5 μg) and 0.5 μg of pCMV-βgal construct into H441 cells. On the next day, cells were treated with 10 μm 15d-PGJ2. After a 48-h incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined. In each transfection study above, β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization of transfection efficiency. AT II Epithelial Cell Culturing and β-Galactosidase Activity Measurement—As previously described (15Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), AT II epithelial cells were isolated from 6-week-old hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ transgenic FVB/N mice (13Yang L. Naltner A. Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and cultured on a Matrigel matrix/rat tail collagen (70:30, v/v) in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium minus hydrocortisone plus 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor. Cells were treated with or without 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 or (+)-9-HODE (Cayman Chemical Co.) for 2 days to allow reporter protein expression. Cells were lysed, and ∼1 ng of protein was used for the β-galactosidase assay. Lung Explant Culture and β-Galactosidase Staining—Lung buds were dissected out from embryonic day 11 embryos of nontransgenic or hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene transgenic mice following a procedure described previously (13Yang L. Naltner A. Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lung buds were cultured on top of 1% low melting point agarose gel in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with supplementation of 10% fetal calf serum in a 30-mm dish. The next day, a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml X-gal with or without 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 was added to the culture medium and incubated for an additional 2 days. The medium containing X-gal and 15d-PGJ2 for cultured lung explants was changed each day. Immunohistochemistry—The lungs from wild type FVB/N adult mice were infused with a fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, or PBS), removed from the chest, and stored in fixative at 4 °C for ∼24 h. After fixation, dehydration, and embedding in paraffin, lung tissue sections were cut to 5 μm thick. The adult lung slides were baked at 60 °C for 2 h and immersed in xylene and ethanol to remove paraffin from the tissues. After rehydration, an antigen retrieval procedure was performed, and endogenous peroxidase activity was removed from the adult mouse lung tissues by incubating the tissue slides in methanol and hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Tissue slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary PPARγ antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), TTF1 antibody (1:10,000; from Dr. R. Di Lauro, Naples, Italy), and FLAG antibody (1:4,000; Sigma). The tissues were washed and treated with biotinylated secondary antibodies. The interactions were detected with a Vectastain Elite ABC kit to visualize the signals following a procedure recommended by the manufacturer. EMSA—The fragment of the hSP-B -150 to +41 bp promoter region was amplified by PCR using the hSP-B 218 luciferase reporter gene construct as a template. The PPRE response element (GTCGACAGGGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGAGTCGAC) from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene (16Schlezinger J.J. Jensen B.A. Mann K.K. Ryu H.Y. Sherr D.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6831-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was synthesized, annealed, and purified as a positive control. To make the PPARγ-GST fusion protein, the full-length PPARγ was subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 GST vector (Amersham Biosciences) at the SalI and NotI restriction enzyme sites by PCR. The plasmids were transformed into BL21 bacterial strains for protein expression. After 3 h of induction at 37 °C by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 1× PBS, followed by sonication and treatment with 1% Triton X-100. The proteins were purified by incubation with 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature and then eluted from beads using glutathione (GS) elution buffer followed by dialysis. Protein expression was confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and Western blot using PPARγ antibody (Amersham Biosciences) after gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). The RXRα protein was made by the TNT in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by [γ-32P]ATP and kinase and incubated with 1 μg of the purified PPARγ-GST fusion protein and 1 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated RXRα. EMSA was performed by following the procedure described previously (17Yan C. Tamm I. The J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20188-20194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of SP-B mRNA Expression by 15d-PGJ 2 in H441 Cells—To assess how endogenous SP-B gene expression is affected by neutral lipid metabolites, monolayers of H441 cells were treated with or without 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 overnight. Total RNAs were isolated from these cells. A pair of hSP-B cDNA-specific primers was used for RT-PCR assessment of hSP-B mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 1, hSP-B mRNA expression was reduced by 15d-PGJ2 treatment in H441 cells. As a control, a pair of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA-specific primers was also used for RT-PCR. No significant change was observed in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression. Since the SP-B mRNA expression level can be affected at the transcriptional level or at the posttranscriptional level (mRNA stability and nuclear transportation), further studies are necessary to determine whether this inhibitory effect is a result of hSP-B transcriptional repression. Inhibition of the hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ Gene by 15d-PGJ 2 and 9-HODE in Primary AT II Epithelial Cells—Previously, a transgenic mouse system carrying an hSP-B 1.5-kb 5′-flanking regulatory region and the lacZ gene was created. In this in vivo system, the hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene recapitulates the endogenous SP-B gene expression pattern in the lung in a highly tissue- and cell type-specific manner (13Yang L. Naltner A. Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since the hSP-B 1.5-kb 5′-flanking regulatory sequence resides in AT II cells and Clara cells in this transgenic mouse line, it is an ideal system to study the hSP-B transcriptional activity in vivo. To assess whether neutral lipid metabolites affect the hSP-B 1.5-kb transcriptional activity in primary AT II epithelial cells, adult AT II epithelial cells were isolated from hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene transgenic mice and cultured in vitro. The next day, primary AT II epithelial cell monolayers were treated with or without a 10 μm concentration of either 15d-PGJ2 or 9-HODE. The nontransgenic AT II epithelial cells were also isolated and cultured in vitro as a control. After 4 days of incubation with 9-HODE, AT II epithelial cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activities. There was no significant difference between 15d-PGJ2- or 9-HODE-treated and nontreated AT II epithelial cells from nontransgenic mice. In contrast, a significant decrease in β-galactosidase activity was observed in 15d-PGJ2- or 9-HODE-treated AT II epithelial cells that were isolated from hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene transgenic mice (Fig. 2, A and B). This result indicates that PPARγ ligands inhibit hSP-B gene expression at the promoter transcriptional level in AT II epithelial cells. Inhibition of the hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ Gene during Lung Branching Morphogenesis by 15d-PGJ 2 —Since expression of the hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene is developmentally controlled as previously reported (13Yang L. Naltner A. Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the effect of neutral lipid metabolite 15d-PGJ2 on hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene transcription was assessed in lung branching morphogenesis. Intact fetal lungs were isolated from hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ transgenic mice at 11 days of gestation and cultured in vitro in the presence of X-gal. Nontransgenic fetal lungs were also isolated and cultured as a control. On the next day, lung explants were treated with or without 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 for 2 days. In nontransgenic control, no lacZ gene expression was detected in lung explants (Fig. 3). In hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene transgenic mice, the in vitro cultured lung explant showed robust expression of the hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene in newly formed epithelial tubules (Fig. 3). In contrast, hSP-B gene expression in branching epithelial tubules was significantly inhibited in the presence of 15d-PGJ2. This study indicates that 15d-PGJ2 can inhibit the hSP-B transcriptional activity during the developmental branching process. Suppression of SP-B gene expression seems not to affect the whole lung branching structure in this study. This is in agreement with the previous finding that ablation of the SP-B gene in mice does not affect embryonic lung development (10Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the hSP-B Gene by 15d-PGJ 2 Is Mediated within the -218 to +41 Region—To define the cis-acting region that mediates 15d-PGJ2 inhibition on the hSP-B promoter, shorter hSP-B 500 and hSP-B 218 luciferase reporter constructs were tested in H441 cells by transient transfection and luciferase assay. The H441 cell line retains many characteristics of Clara cells. After 48 h of cell incubation with various concentrations of 15d-PGJ2, a significant decrease of both hSP-B 500 and hSP-B 218 luciferase activities was observed in H441 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4). In addition, a chimeric construct that contains the hSP-B-(-500/-331) enhancer region and the SV40 basic promoter was also studied. No 15d-PGJ2 inhibitory effect was observed on this construct. Instead, a moderate increase of luciferase activity was observed at lower 15d-PGJ2 concentrations. This hSP-B-(-500/-331) enhancer region mediates RAR and nuclear receptor coactivator stimulation on hSP-B gene expression (18Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, the SV40 basic promoter construct (PGL2P) showed no change in response to 15d-PGJ2. It is unlikely that the hSP-B-(-500/-331) enhancer region mediates 15d-PGJ2 inhibition of the hSP-B gene. Previously, the hSP-B-(-500/-331) enhancer region has been identified to mediate RA/RAR signaling stimulation of the hSP-B gene (18Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together, 15d-PGJ2 inhibition of the hSP-B gene is mediated through the -218 to +41 region. PPARγ·RXRα Inhibits the hSP-B Gene Transcription—The compound 15d-PGJ2 exhibits both PPARγ-dependent and independent mechanisms. To test whether PPARγ mediates the 15d-PGJ2 inhibitory effect on the hSP-B gene expression, a PPARγ and hSP-B luciferase reporter gene cotransfection study was performed in H441 cells. Monolayers of H441 cells were transiently transfected with the hSP-B 218 or hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter gene constructs. After subsequent 48-h cell incubation with 5 μm 15d-PGJ2, a significant decrease of both hSP-B 218 and hSP-B 150 luciferase activities was observed in H441 cells (Fig 5A). When hSP-B 218 or hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter gene constructs were co-transfected with various concentrations of PPARγ·RXRα, further inhibition was observed. This is a strong indication that PPARγ·RXRα mediates 15d-PGJ2 inhibition. To confirm this observation, a mutant PPARγ was chosen for the cotransfection assay. In the mutant, Leu468 and Glu471 in helix 12 of the ligand binding domain of PPARγ are mutated to alanine. The mutant retains ligand and DNA binding activities but exhibits no co-activator recruitment activity (20Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). When the hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter construct was cotransfected with increasing amounts of mutant PPARγ into H441 cells, no inhibitory effect was observed, Fig. 5B. Instead, a modest increase of the hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter gene activity was observed. This reversal of repression is probably due to the interference of endogenous PPARγ inhibitory effects by the mutant PPARγ protein. PPARγ Expression in Mouse AT II Epithelial Cells and Clara Cells—Since PPARγ can functionally inhibit SP-B gene expression, immunohistochemical staining was performed to test whether PPARγ is localized in AT II epithelial cells and Clara cells where SP-B is expressed and processed. Sections from adult mouse lungs were prepared and stained using an antibody against PPARγ. Sections were also stained with an antibody against thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) as a positive control. TTF1 is a tissue- and cell type-specific marker whose expression is specifically restricted to AT II and Clara cells in the lung. Staining for TTF1 and PPARγ antibodies in mouse lungs was detected in bronchiolar and AT II epithelial cells where SP-B is synthesized (Fig. 6) (13Yang L. Naltner A. Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In a negative control, no specific staining was detected by a FLAG antibody. Previously, RXRα expression was detected in AT II epithelial cells and Clara cells by immunohistochemistry (19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PPARγ·RXRα not only functionally influences SP-B gene expression but also is colocalized physically with SP-B in the lung. PPARγ·RXRα Does Not Directly Bind to the hSP-B -150 to +41 Region—One mechanism for nuclear receptors to exert negative effect on gene transcription is to bind to cis-acting sites within the promoter region of the target genes and recruit corepressor complexes (21Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the PPARγ·RXRα inhibitory effect is mediated by direct DNA binding to the hSP-B-(-150 to +41) promoter region, the PPARγ-GST fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified by chromatography. The RXRα protein was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation. Two proteins were incubated with the 32P-radiolabled hSP-B -150 to +41 bp fragment for EMSA in the presence of 15d-PGJ2. As shown in Fig. 7, the PPARγ-GST·RXRα complex did not form a protein-DNA complex with the hSP-B -150 to +41 promoter region. A homology search did not reveal the consensus sequence for PPRE in this region. In a positive control study, PPARγ-GST·RXRα formed a complex with a PPRE from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene, known to bind to PPARγ·RXRα. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of PPARγ and its ligands on the hSP-B gene is not mediated through direct DNA binding to the promoter region. Reversal of the 15d-PGJ 2 Inhibition by Nuclear Receptor Coactivator TIF2—It has also been reported that PPARγ inhibits gene transcription through the trans-repression mechanism by competing with a limited amount of the nuclear receptor coactivator pool in the cell (22Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). If PPARγ and its ligands inhibit the hSP-B transcription through the trans-repression mechanism, increasing the amount of nuclear receptor co-activators should reverse the inhibitory effect. To test this possibility, p160 family nuclear receptor co-activators, including SRC-1, ACTR, and TIF2, were co-transfected with the hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter construct into H441 cells to increase nuclear receptor co-activator concentrations. Without nuclear receptor co-activator cotransfection, 5 μm 15d-PGJ2 significantly decreased the hSP-B 150 luciferase activity in H441 cells (Fig. 8). When increasing amounts of TIF2 were cotransfected into H441 cells, the inhibitory effect of the hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter activity was reversed. The reversal effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 8). On the other hand, SRC-1 and ACTR did not show the reversal of inhibitory effect on the hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter gene. This indicates that among p160 nuclear receptor co-activators, only TIF2 plays a role in the hSP-B -150 to +41 promoter region to activate gene transcription, which can be competed off by overexpression of PPARγ. Although there are only about 10% neutral lipids in pulmonary surfactant, their metabolites can serve as ligands to bind to various nuclear receptors to regulate surfactant protein gene expression. Prostaglandins are derived from fatty acids (primarily from arachidonate) through a series of biochemical conversions in vivo. In this report, we investigated the functional role of 15d-PGJ2 that serves as a ligand for PPARγ in SP-B gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells. Ligand 15d-PGJ2 inhibited endogenous SP-B mRNA synthesis in H441 cells (Fig. 1), indicating that the inhibitory effect can happen as early as 18 h. This apparently occurs at the gene transcriptional level, because expression of the lacZ reporter gene under the control of the hSP-B 1.5-kb 5′-flanking regulatory region was also inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 in primary AT II epithelial cells (Fig. 2). Using hSP-B promoter deletion constructs, the inhibitory effect was narrowed down to the hSP-B -150 to +41 bp promoter region (Fig. 5A). This region is highly conserved in both human and murine species (23Bruno M.A. Bohinski R.J. Carter J.E. Foss K.A. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L381-L390PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ·RXRα that mediates the 15d-PGJ2 action also inhibited hSP-B promoter transcription (Fig. 5, A and B). Endogenous expression of PPARγ was detected in both AT II and Clara cells in the mouse by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 6). These results collectively suggest that PPARγ is colocalized with SP-B in AT II epithelial cells and Clara cells and functionally influences SP-B gene expression. Nuclear receptors exert negative regulation on gene regulation through various mechanisms. Some nuclear receptors repress transcription by binding to cis-acting sites within the promoter region of the target genes by recruiting corepressor complexes (21Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an EMSA study, the PPARγ·RXRα complex failed to bind to the hSP-B -150 to +41 promoter region that mediates the 15d-PGJ2/PPARγ inhibitory effect. Therefore, it is unlikely that this is the mechanism for PPARγ·RXRα and its ligands to inhibit hSP-B promoter transcription. A second mechanism involves nuclear receptor (e.g. PPARγ) transrepression through coactivator competition (22Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Since there are limiting amounts of coactivators (CREB-binding protein/p300 and p160 coactivators including SRC-1, ACTR, and TIF2) in a given cell, nuclear receptors mutually antagonize each other by competing with these coactivators. In this mechanism, inhibition usually can be reversed by increasing concentrations of nuclear receptor coactivators in the cell. Indeed, cotransfection of nuclear receptor coactivator TIF2 caused the reversal of hSP-B gene inhibition by 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 8). This was confirmed by the observation that a PPARγ mutant lacking the nuclear receptor coactivator recruiting ability reversed PPARγ inhibitory activity in H441 cells (Fig. 5B). The study suggests that there may be another unidentified transcription factor (e.g. nuclear receptor) in hSP-B -150 to +41 promoter region, which can recruit TIF2. In a similar situation, the sequestering of CREB-binding protein and SRC-1 by activated PPARγ accounts for transrepression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter in response to ligand binding (22Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In this system, transrepression requires PPARγ interactions with LXXLL-containing coactivators through functional domains. It has been shown that a deletion of the ligand-dependent activation domain AF2 of PPARγ and point mutations of the critical charge clamp residues (PPARγ EA469 and KG301) weakened interaction with SRC-1 and CREB-binding protein. This deletion and point mutations led to complete loss of transrepression function (22Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PPARγ transrepression has also been reported in cyclooxygenase-2 gene regulation (24Subbaramaiah K. Lin D.T. Hart J.C. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12440-12448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). SP-B gene expression is also subject to positive regulation by certain members of nuclear receptors. Previously, we have shown that RA and RAR transactivate SP-B gene transcription by recruiting nuclear receptor coactivators through an enhancer located in the hSP-B -500 to -331 region upon retinoic binding (18Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the transcriptional complex is dependent on RAR·RXR, TTF1, and nuclear receptor coactivators (18Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Deletion of this highly conserved enhancer region abolished hSP-B gene expression in Clara cells and reduced its expression in AT II epithelial cells in transgenic mice (13Yang L. Naltner A. Kreiner A. Yan D. Cowen A. Du H. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L481-L488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When a dominant negative RARα was overexpressed in H441 cells, it strongly suppressed hSP-B transcription (25Yang L. Naltner A. Yan C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3004-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse system, overexpression of dominant negative RARα in respiratory epithelial cells caused abnormal alveolar formation in neonatal lungs, probably due to suppression of SP-B and other functional genes (25Yang L. Naltner A. Yan C. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3004-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPARγ interferes with RA/RAR transactivation in the hSP-B -500 to -331 enhancer region by coactivator sequestration, a chimeric hSP-B-(-500/-331)/SV40 promoter was treated with 15d-PGJ2 in H441 cells. Interestingly, there was no transrepression observed (Fig. 4). Although the detailed mechanism is not clear at this moment, it seems that PPARγ and its ligands selectively compete with the nuclear receptor coactivator recruiting process in the hSP-B -150 to +41 promoter region but not with that in the hSP-B -500 to -331 enhancer region (Fig. 9). This selectivity must be determined by surrounding transcription factors and DNA cis-acting elements in the hSP-B 5′-flanking regulatory region. Whereas all p160 nuclear receptor coactivators stimulate hSP-B (-500 to -331)/SV40 luciferase reporter gene transcription (18Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), only TIF2 stimulated hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter gene transcription (data not shown). In agreement with this observation, only an increase of TIF2 concentration in H441 cells reversed the 15d-PGJ2 inhibitory effect of the hSP-B 150 luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 8). PPARγ ligands also affect hSP-B temporal/spatial expression during lung branching morphogenesis. In lung explant in vitro culturing study (Fig. 3), hSP-B 1.5-kb lacZ gene expression was dramatically inhibited by PPARγ ligand treatment, implicating that the unidentified TIF2 recruiting factor in the hSP-B -150 to +41 promoter region is required for SP-B gene expression during lung development in newly formed epithelial tubules. This suggests that during lung development, both positive and negative regulation by nuclear receptors and coactivators are essential for proper SP-B gene expression. Previously, the glucocorticoid receptor has also been reported to inhibit hSP-B transcription (14Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanism is unknown. PPARγ has pleiotrophic effects in various systems. There are studies suggesting that PPARγ plays a role in antagonizing proinflammatory response (3Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar, 26Wang A.C. Dai X. Luu B. Conrad D.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Su C.G. Wen X. Bailey S.T. Jiang W. Rangwala S.M. Keilbaugh S.A. Flanigan A. Murthy S. Lazar M.A. Wu G.D. J. Clin.

Invest. 2000; 106: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). SP-B gene expression is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines. We previously reported that SP-B gene expression is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 family members in the lung. Interleukin-6 family cytokines stimulate downstream target genes by activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 through tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr705. How PPARγ and its ligands affect this process of proinflammatory stimulation to keep the balance of SP-B gene expression during pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the respiratory system is an important issue for future investigation and has potential clinical application. In summary, neutral lipid metabolites in lipogenic AT II epithelial cells influence surfactant protein B gene expression and homeostasis in the lung. The inhibitory effect of PPARγ and ligands on SP-B gene expression represents a novel mechanism whereby SP-B homeostasis is regulated in respiratory epithelial cells. In pulmonary surfactant, phospholipids are the major structural component, whereas neutral lipid metabolites can serve as sensor signals to balance pulmonary surfactant homeostasis in responding to changes of various physiologic conditions and inflammatory responses in host defenses.

Hence, this modification allows the study of locked previtamin and vitamin forms. The locked 19-nor-1,25(OH)2-previtamin D3 analog (19-nor-previtamin D) had a low biological activity and was a rather weak activator of the genomic signal transduction pathway. 19-Nor-trans-decalin-1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (19-nor-TD-vitamin D), characterized by the presence of a trans-fused decalin CD-ring system, was 10-fold more potent than the parent compound and was a potent activator of the genomic signal transduction pathway. Surprisingly, the previtamin, 19-nor-trans-decalin-1,25(OH)2-previtamin D3 (19-nor-TD-previtamin D), was as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell differentiation and represents the first previtamin structure with pronounced vitamin D-like activity. Furthermore, this compound interacted as efficiently as 1,25(OH)2D3 with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), coactivators, and DNA, which illustrated its potent ability to activate the genomic signal transduction pathway. Analysis of the transactivation potency of 12 VDR point mutants after stimulation with 19-nor-TD-previtamin D revealed that this analog used the same contact points within the receptor as did 1,25(OH)2D3. This could be confirmed by modeling analysis of this compound in the ligand binding pocket of VDR. In conclusion, a previtamin D3 analog is presented with genomic activities equivalent to 1,25(OH)2D3.

This could be confirmed by modeling analysis of this compound in the ligand binding pocket of VDR. In conclusion, a previtamin D3 analog is presented with genomic activities equivalent to 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3, the active metabolite of vitamin D3, is an important regulator not only of calcium and phosphate metabolism but also cell proliferation and differentiation (1Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). It exerts its genomic effects through the vitamin D receptor, a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Conformational changes of VDR, 1The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; VDRE, vitamin D-responsive element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; 19-nor-vitamin D, 19-nor-1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3; 19-nor-TD-vitamin D, 19-nor-trans-decalin-1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3; 19-nor-previtamin D, 19-nor-1,25(OH)2-previtamin D3; 19-nor-TD-previtamin D, 19-nor-trans-decalin-1,25(OH)2-previtamin D3; DBP, vitamin D-binding protein. induced by the binding of 1,25(OH)2D3, allow the receptor to dimerize with the retinoic X receptor and bind vitamin D-responsive elements (VDREs) in the promoter region of target genes. Interaction of the VDR-RXR-VDRE complex with coregulator molecules and the basal transcription machinery leads to alterations in gene transcription. 1,25(OH)2D3 has a central rigid CD-bicyclic ring portion to which two flexible entities, the side chain and the seco-B,A-ring, are connected. The characteristic seco structure of vitamin D3 originates from the photolytic cleavage of the provitamin 7-dehydrocholesterol. The resulting previtamin triene (previtamin D3) then reversibly thermo-isomerizes to the vitamin form in its less stable 6-s-cis conformation. Rapid rotation about the C6-C7 single bond eventually yields vitamin D3 in its more stable extended 6-s-trans conformation (2Curtin M.L. Okamura W.H. J. Am. Chem.

Vitamin D3 but also its hydroxylated metabolites are in constant equilibrium with their previtamin D3 isomers.

The aim of this study is to investigate the biological profile and the genomic signaling pathway of four different locked 19-nor-1,25(OH)2-(pre)-vitamin D3 analogs, with or without a modified CD-ring. Indeed, the sigmatropic shift required for the previtamin-vitamin D conversion cannot occur in these analogs because of the deletion of C19 (4Bouillon R. Sarandeses L.A. Allewaert K. Zhao J.

First, the affinity to VDR was determined as well as the stability of VDR conformation after interaction with the ligand. Second, the potency of the analogs to induce interaction of the VDR-RXR heterodimer with DNA (vitamin D-responsive elements) and TIF2 (as a representative of the p160 family of coactivators; Ref. 8McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) was investigated. Third, the ability of 19-nor-1,25(OH)2-(pre)-vitamin D3 analogs to induce VDR-dependent transcriptional activation was studied in transient transfection experiments and by determining the induction of vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP 24) gene expression. Finally, docking of the analogs in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of VDR was studied by evaluation of the transactivating capacity of 12 different point mutants of human VDR, and a docking model for 19-nor-TD-previtamin D was proposed that is concordant with the results of the mutational analysis. 1,25(OH)2D3 and Analogs—1,25(OH)2D3 was a gift of J. P. van de Velde (Duphar, Weesp, The Netherlands). The analog 19-nor-1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3, originally synthesized by DeLuca and co-workers (9Perlman K.L. Sicinski R.R. Schnoes H.K. DeLuca H.F.

The pRSETA vector in which TIF2.5 (the nuclear interaction domain of TIF2; Ref. 17Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Commun. 2001; 283: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolytic Digestion of VDR— 35S-labeled human VDR was synthesized in vitro, preincubated with vehicle (ethanol), 1,25(OH)2D3, or analogs and subsequently digested at room temperature with a limited amount of trypsin (0–150 μg/ml) for 15 min (Roche Applied Science) (19Verlinden L. Verstuyf A. Quack M. Van Camp M. van Etten E. De Clercq P. Vandewalle M. Carlberg C. Bouillon R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent Gel Shift Assay— 32P-labeled DR3-type VDREs were added to equal amounts of in vitro translated VDR and RXR proteins, which were preincubated with vehicle (ethanol), 1,25(OH)2D3, or analogs (19Verlinden L. Verstuyf A. Quack M. Van Camp M. van Etten E. De Clercq P. Vandewalle M. Carlberg C. Bouillon R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The potency of the analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 to induce interaction of the VDR-RXR heterodimer with TIF2.5 was investigated with supershifts. Therefore, BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the pRSETA-TIF2.5 vector, and the recombinant TIF 2.5 protein was isolated with TALON (BD Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Transactivation Potency—COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained as described previously (19Verlinden L. Verstuyf A. Quack M. Van Camp M. van Etten E. De Clercq P. Vandewalle M. Carlberg C. Bouillon R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells (30, 000) were seeded in 24-well dishes. The next day, cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with 400 ng of reporter plasmid, 200 ng of pCMX-based expression vectors for wild type or mutant VDR, and 200 ng of pSG5-RXR. The day after transfection, cells were stimulated with vehicle or dilutions of 1,25(OH)2D3 or analogs. The next day, cells were lysed with the reporter lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science), and luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity in each well was normalized for its protein content and expressed relative to transfected vehicle-stimulated cells. Quantitative Real Time PCR—MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutaMAX™-I (Invitrogen). MC3T3-E1 cells (80,000) were seeded in 6-well dishes. The next day, cells were stimulated with vehicle (ethanol), 10–9m 1,25(OH)2D3, or analogs. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Gilden, Germany). Quantitative real time PCR and calculation of the amount of target cDNA in the sample was done as described previously (20Overbergh L. Valckx D. Waer M. Mathieu C. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). β-Actin-normalized CYP24 expression after treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 or analogs was expressed relative to normalized CYP24-levels in vehicle-stimulated cells. Primers (forward, 5′-GCG GAA GAT GTG AGG AAT ATG C-3′; reverse, 5′-AAG ACT GTT CCT TTG GGT AGC GT-3′); and probe (5′-FAM-AAG GCC TGT CTA AAG GAG TCC ATG AGG CTT A-TAMRA-3)' for CYP24 were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Docking of 19-Nor-TD-previtamin D—Low energy conformations of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D were obtained by systematic variation of the torsion around the C5-C6 and the C7-C8 bonds. The lowest energy conformations were manually docked in the ligand binding pocket of the VDR (protein data bank entry 1DB1, crystal structure of the VDR-LBD-(Δ165–215)) (21Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) so that the compound made similar interactions with VDR as did 1,25(OH)2D3. The complex of VDR and 19-nor-TD-previtamin D conformation that could be best fitted in the pocket was subjected to a molecular dynamics run followed by a minimization allowing the relaxation of the ligand and its surrounding amino acids. The molecular dynamics run was performed at 900 K for 100 ps. At 1-ps intervals the structures were minimized for 10 steps with the steepest descent method and for a subsequent 500 steps with the conjugate gradient procedure. The Insight II/Discover packages (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) together with the CFF91 force field were used for all the calculations. Statistics—Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used to determine significant differences. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. EC50 values for the various dose-response curves were calculated with three different sigmoid regression equations (three- and four-parameter sigmoid regression equations and three-parameter Gompertz regression equation, Sigmaplot). The EC50 values presented in the text and the figures represent the mean and S.E. of the EC50 values obtained in those equations. The curves drawn in Fig. 2 represent the curve fitted by the four-parameter sigmoid regression equation. In Vitro and in Vivo Biological Activity—The in vitro biological potency of 19-nor-vitamin D was comparable with that of 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas its calcemic effects were 50-fold lower (Table I) (4Bouillon R. Sarandeses L.A. Allewaert K. Zhao J. Mascarenas J.L. Mourino A. Vrielynck S. de Clercq P. Vandewalle M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Perlman K.L. Sicinski R.R. Schnoes H.K. DeLuca H.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 1823-1829Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Perlman K.L. Swenson R.E. Paaren H.E. Schnoes H.K. DeLuca H.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 7663-7666Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 19-Nor-previtamin D was 10-fold less potent than 1,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting proliferation and inducing differentiation and had low calcemic effects (4Bouillon R. Sarandeses L.A. Allewaert K. Zhao J. Mascarenas J.L. Mourino A. Vrielynck S. de Clercq P. Vandewalle M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 19-Nor-TD-vitamin D, characterized by a trans-fused decalin CD-ring, was 10 to 50 times more potent in vitro than 1,25(OH)2D3 and, surprisingly, its previtamin form was as potent as the parent compound. The in vivo calcemic activity was comparable with that of 1,25(OH)2D3 for 19-nor-TD-vitamin D and 50-fold lower for 19-nor-TD-previtamin D. Affinity for VDR and DBP—The 19-nor-vitamin D analogs had slightly decreased VDR binding affinities, whereas both previtamin analogs bound very poorly to VDR with dissociation constants (KD) of only 1–3% when compared with 1,25(OH)2D3. The KD of 19-nor-vitamin D for DBP was 10% of that of 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas the KD values of the other analogs were <5% of that of the parent compound (Table I). Limited Proteolytic Digestion of VDR—Incubation of radioactively labeled VDR with a limited amount of trypsin led to partial digestion of the receptor into two fragments (∼34 and 32 kDa) (Fig. 1A). A 15-min incubation period in the presence of a final concentration of 17 μg/ml trypsin was sufficient to completely degrade the unliganded receptor. VDR, preincubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10–7m), was more resistant to proteolytic breakdown, and a digestion profile of three fragments was observed (∼34, 32, and 28 kDa). Expectedly, similar digestion profiles were observed for 19-nor-vitamin D and 19-nor-TD-vitamin D, whereas 19-nor-previtamin D could only marginally stabilize VDR even when applied at higher concentrations (Fig. 1B). On the contrary, 19-nor-TD-previtamin D induced a VDR conformation that was as resistant to proteolytic breakdown as that induced by the parent compound (Fig. 1A). Ligand-dependent Gel Shift Assay—19-Nor-vitamin D and 19-nor-TD-vitamin D were equipotent to 1,25(OH)2D3 in inducing VDR-RXR binding to DNA and inducing interaction with TIF2.5, whereas 19-nor-previtamin D required 60-fold higher concentrations to obtain half-maximal DNA-binding (Figs. 2 and 3). However, introduction of a trans-decalin CD-ring made 19-nor-TD-previtamin D almost as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in inducing interaction of the VDR-RXR heterodimer with VDREs and TIF2.5. Transactivation Potency—The ability of 19-nor-vitamin D to transactivate a VDRE-containing reporter construct was slightly enhanced compared with 1,25(OH)2D3, and, again, introduction of a trans-fused decalin CD-ring further increased the transactivating capacity (Fig. 4). The transactivating capacity of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D was almost similar to that of 1,25(OH)2D3 and increased substantially when compared with 19-nor-previtamin D. 19-Nor-vitamin D was as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in inducing transcription of the vitamin D target gene CYP24 in mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, whereas 19-nor-TD-vitamin D was significantly more potent than the parent molecule (Fig. 5). When applied at 10–9m, 19-nor-TD-previtamin D substantially increased expression of CYP24 (Fig. 5), whereas 19-nor-previtamin D required higher concentrations to induce CYP24 gene transcription (data not shown). Mutational Analysis of Transcriptional Activity of 1,25(OH) 2 D3 and Analogs—12 different point mutants of VDR were used to further investigate the interactions between the analogs and the amino acid residues lining the ligand binding pocket of VDR. The expression level and stability of these VDR mutants were evaluated by Western blot analysis and confirmed to be similar to those of wild type VDR (16Choi M. Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yamada S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Choi M. Nakashima K. Taga T. Ooizumi H. Umesono K. Sicinska W. VanHooke J. DeLuca H.F. Yamada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To compare the transactivating ability of the various analogs, the EC50 concentration for transcriptional activation was used (concentrations as indicated in Fig. 4). 1,25(OH)2D3 was unable to transactivate when cells were transfected with mutated VDRs carrying either the L233A, I271A, R274A, W286A, H397A, or Y401A mutation (Fig. 6). The mutants V234A, I268A, V300A, and H305A moderately reduced the transactivation potency of 1,25(OH)2D3 (50% of the activity of wild type VDR). The mutants S275A (70%) and S278A (80%) had little effect on the transactivation capacity of 1,25(OH)2D3. The transactivation profile for the different point mutants in cells incubated with 19-nor-vitamin D was almost identical to the profile for 1,25(OH)2D3. 19-Nor-TD-vitamin D had a partially different transactivation profile. Much like 1,25(OH)2D3, 19-nor-TD-vitamin D could not transactivate in cells transfected with the VDR mutants L233A, I271A, R274A, W286A, H397A, or Y401A. On the contrary, some other mutants became more potent in inducing transcription of the reporter gene when cells were incubated with 19-nor-TD-vitamin D instead of 1,25(OH)2D3 (e.g. V234A, I268A, S275A, and H305A). The mutant receptor H305A was even as potent as wild type VDR. The capacity of 19-nor-previtamin D to induce transcriptional activation of the mutant VDRs was completely abolished, except for the S278A mutant (110% compared with wild type VDR). On the contrary, the profile observed for 19-nor-TD-previtamin D was comparable with the profile for 1,25(OH)2D3 and completely different from the one of 19-nor-previtamin D. Docking of 19-Nor-TD-previtamin D—To investigate whether a compound in the previtamin conformation fitted in the ligand binding pocket of the VDR and made similar interactions with the VDR as 1,25(OH)2D3, some docking experiments were performed using 19-nor-TD-previtamin D and the crystal structure of the VDR-LBD (Δ165–215) (21Rochel N.

Based on the manual docking of different conformations of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D followed by molecular dynamics calculations, a possible conformation for 19-nor-TD-previtamin D in the VDR pocket was proposed (Fig. 7). In this conformation, 19-nor-TD-previtamin D made similar interactions with the VDR as 1,25(OH)2D3, i.e. the side chain of the analog had the same extended geometry, the 25-hydroxyl group made the same hydrogen bonds with H305 and H397, and even the 1α-hydroxyl and 3β-hydroxyl groups made the same hydrogen bonds with S237 and Y143, respectively. This paper describes the biological and underlying genomic activity of two different 19-nor-vitamin D analogs and their previtamin forms. 19-Nor-vitamin D was synthesized previously by DeLuca and co-workers (9Perlman K.L. Sicinski R.R. Schnoes H.K. DeLuca H.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 1823-1829Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Perlman K.L. Swenson R.E. Paaren H.E. Schnoes H.K. DeLuca H.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 7663-7666Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and they and others (4Bouillon R. Sarandeses L.A. Allewaert K. Zhao J. Mascarenas J.L. Mourino A. Vrielynck S. de Clercq P. Vandewalle M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) illustrated that the biological potency of this analog is comparable with that of 1,25(OH)2D3 itself. In agreement with this, the interaction of 19-nor-vitamin D with VDR and its capacity to interact with VDREs and transactivate VDRE-containing reporter genes were similar to those of the parent compound. 19-Nor-previtamin D, on the contrary, had low biological potency, which confirms a previous study (4Bouillon R. Sarandeses L.A. Allewaert K. Zhao J. Mascarenas J.L. Mourino A. Vrielynck S. de Clercq P. Vandewalle M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Weak interactions with VDR, VDREs, and coactivators were probably the cause of its low genomic activity. Mutation of each of the different amino acids lining the ligand binding pocket of VDR, except for Ser-278, led to a reduction of the transactivating capacity of 19-nor-previtamin D to the level of vehicle-treated cells, which suggested that each of the various interactions were important for this compound to exhibit genomic activity. Introduction of a trans-fused decalin CD-ring in 19-nor-vitamin D clearly enhanced the antiproliferative and prodifferentiating activity of 19-nor-TD-vitamin D. However, the interactions observed at the different steps in the pretranscriptional process were similar for this compound and 1,25(OH)2D3, which illustrated the importance of coregulatory molecules in determining the eventual biological activity in different cell types (8McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 23Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 24Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Naar A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis suggested that the orientation of this compound in the ligand binding pocket of VDR is different from the orientation of the parent compound. Indeed, the transactivating ability of several mutant VDRs (V234A, I268A, S275A, and H305A) was enhanced after incubation with 19-nor-TD-vitamin D when compared with 1,25(OH)2D3. A transactivating profile similar to that for 19-nor-TD-vitamin D was obtained for the analogs 20-epi-1,25(OH)2D3 and KH 1060 (16Choi M. Yamamoto K. Masuno H. Nakashima K. Taga T. Yamada S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cocrystallization studies of VDR, together with 20-epi-1,25(OH)2D3 or KH 1060, revealed that the VDR protein conformation is identical whether it is complexed to 1,25(OH)2D3 or its analogs, indicating that the ligands adapt to the binding pocket and not vice versa (25Tocchini-Valentini G. Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Moras D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5491-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The A- to D-ring moieties of 20-epi-1,25(OH)2D3 or KH 1060 adopt the same conformation as in 1,25(OH)2D3, and it is only the side chain that can adapt its conformation in order to anchor the 25-hydroxyl group. A different transactivating potency obtained with the mutants V234A, I268A, and H305A can therefore probably be explained by a different position of the side chain of 19-nor-TD-vitamin D or the disappearance of some steric hindrance from, for example, His-305. Most surprisingly, introduction of the trans-fused decalin CD-ring in 19-nor-previtamin D resulted in a previtamin compound that was as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell differentiation. To our knowledge, 19-nor-TD-previtamin D is the first previtamin structure with pronounced antiproliferative and prodifferentiating effects. Previously studied previtamin D3 analogs, which were either locked in the 6-s-cis conformation or modified so that they only slowly isomerize to the vitamin conformation, have little effects on cell proliferation and differentiation (and underlying genomic effects) but are as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in evoking rapid, non-genomic effects (5Norman A.W.

Sci. 1995; 761: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lithocholic acid, a secondary bile acid with an intact steroid skeleton such as is present in provitamin D3 binds to VDR and regulates gene transcription, but only at much higher (1000×) concentrations (26Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Despite its low binding affinity to VDR, 19-nor-TD-previtamin D was able to induce a VDR conformation that was as resistant to proteolysis as the conformation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. The discrepancy between the low binding affinity of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D (determined at 4 °C) and its ability to induce a stable VDR conformation (determined at room temperature) is not well understood. Dissociation constants determined at room temperature were similar to those obtained at 4 °C, which excludes the suggestion that this discrepancy is due to the reaction temperature (data not shown). A possible explanation could be that 19-nor-TD-previtamin D dissociates less quickly from the receptor compared with 1,25(OH)2D3. However, this possibility cannot be investigated, as radioactively labeled 19-nor-TD-previtamin D is not available. 19-Nor-TD-previtamin D proved to be equipotent to 1,25(OH)2D3 in inducing interaction with VDREs and the co-activator TIF2. Also, its transactivating capacity was similar to that of the parent compound. The genomic activity was confirmed in MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts in which, after treatment with 10–9m 19-nor-TD-previtamin D, a substantial increase of CYP24-mRNA levels was observed. The transactivating as well as the antiproliferative capacity of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D were determined in cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Because of its lower DBP affinity, the free concentration of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D in this medium might be higher when compared with 1,25(OH)2D3 and could partially underlie its relatively potent genomic activity. However, despite its equally low affinity for DBP, the relative potency of 19-nor-TD-vitamin D as measured on primary human keratinocytes cultured in serum-free medium remained similar (10-fold more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3; data not shown). Mutational analysis revealed that the overall transactivating profile obtained with 19-nor-TD-previtamin D did not differ significantly from the one obtained with 1,25(OH)2D3. These findings suggested that the general architecture of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D in the ligand binding pocket of VDR was similar to that of the parent compound. A docking model for this previtamin was proposed in which 19-nor-TD-previtamin D made similar interactions with VDR as did 1,25(OH)2D3. According to this model, the general position of the different hydroxyl groups of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D was maintained when compared with the parent secosteroid. Based on the crystal structure, these hydroxyl groups represent anchoring points that must be maintained to obtain an active conformation (21Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Although this conformation of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D can explain the transactivation profile obtained from mutational analysis, only a crystallographic study can render the exact structure of the VDR-19-nor-TD-previtamin D complex. In conclusion, introduction of a trans-fused decalin CD-ring in 19-nor-1,25(OH)2D3 clearly enhanced the biological profile of both the vitamin and previtamin forms. 19-Nor-TD-previtamin D was as potent as 1,25(OH)2D3 in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell differentiation and represents the first previtamin structure with pronounced vitamin D-like activity. The potency of 19-nor-TD-previtamin D to induce functional interactions with VDR, RXR, and VDREs was very similar to the parent hormone. Mutational analysis and manual docking suggested that this previtamin analog can make similar contacts with the ligand binding domain of the receptor as does 1,25(OH)2D3.

https://openalex.org/W2012065091,"Atp11p is a molecular chaperone of the mitochondrial matrix that participates in the biogenesis pathway to form F1, the catalytic unit of the ATP synthase. Affinity tag pull-down assays and yeast two-hybrid screens have shown that Atp11p binds to free β subunits of F1 (Wang, Z. G., and Ackerman, S. H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5767–5772). This binding action prevents the β subunit from associating with itself in non-productive complexes and fosters the formation of a (αβ)3 hexamer. Following the premise that Atp11p action is mediated primarily through a surface (as opposed to specific amino acids, as in an enzyme active site), solving its three-dimensional structure so that we may learn how the shape of the protein influences its function is a high priority. Recombinant yeast Atp11p has proven refractory for such analysis because of the presence of a disordered region in the protein. In this article, we show that removal of 67 residues from the amino terminus of recombinant Atp11p yields a subfragment of the protein (called Atp11pTRNC) that retains molecular chaperone function as determined in vitro with both a surrogate substrate (reduced insulin) and the natural substrate (F1 β). Moreover, preliminary 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra obtained with Atp11pTRNC indicate that the truncated protein is well ordered and amenable to structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance.

Moreover, preliminary 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra obtained with Atp11pTRNC indicate that the truncated protein is well ordered and amenable to structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance. Atp11p was first identified in studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that are respiratory deficient because of a defect in mitochondrial F1 assembly (1Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In normal cells, F1 is formed of five different types of subunits that assemble an α3β3γδϵ oligomer (2Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this structure, the α subunits and β subunits are arranged, in alternate position, in a hexamer that accounts for ∼90% the mass of F1 (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar, 4Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The α3β3 structure is not observed to any significant degree in mitochondria from atp11 mutants, instead, such yeast accumulate F1 α and β subunits as large, insoluble aggregates in the matrix of the organelle (1Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This particular phenotype is observed also in yeast cells deficient for Atp12p, another protein of the F1 biogenesis pathway (1Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other instances of F1 protein aggregation occur in yeast null mutants that are missing either the α or β subunit, because such strains accumulate the lone β or α subunit as aggregated proteins inside mitochondria (1Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, absence of the γ subunit does not correlate with aggregation of α and β subunits (5Paul M.F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these observations are consistent with the idea that γ assembles with some sort of a soluble α β structure that is formed at an earlier step in the pathway in a manner that is dependent on the actions of Atp11p and Atp12p molecular chaperones. Atp11p interacts with the nucleotide-binding domain of unassembled β subunits of F1 (6Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Information about the steric and chemical nature of surfaces in the protein that mediate this binding interaction will be forthcoming once the three-dimensional structure of Atp11p is solved. Progress in this area has been hampered by our inability to crystallize Atp11p from preparations of the recombinant protein. In this article, we report the purification and characterization of an Atp11p subfragment that exhibits molecular chaperone activities with model and natural substrates that are comparable with those of the full-length protein. Atp11pTRNC prevents the aggregation of insulin B-chains that are liberated when the disulfide bonds of the hormone are reduced. In other work, the interaction of Atp11pTRNC with the F1 β subunit is revealed in protein affinity blotting studies. Finally, we report that Atp11pTRNC shows great promise for structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance as indicated by 15N-1H HSQC 1The abbreviations used are: HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TBST, Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20; NTD, N-terminal do-main; NC, nitrocellulose. spectral data that have been obtained with isotopically labeled protein. Plasmid Construction—The Escherichia coli expression plasmid constructed for this work, pATP11/Xa, produces yeast Atp11p with a His6-tag at the amino terminus and a Factor Xa cleavage site inserted between Lys-106 and Ser-107 in the protein sequence (sequence numbering as reported in ref. 7Ackerman S.H. Martin J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7386-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP11 DNA was subcloned from plasmid pTRC/ATP11 (8White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); pTRC/ATP11 carries codons 41–318 of Atp11p, corresponding to the mature protein without its mitochondrial leader sequence, ligated in-frame to an initiator ATG provided by the plasmid. In the first step, pTRC/ATP11 was digested partially with NcoI, and the pool of 5-kb linearized plasmid DNA was gel purified. The partially cut DNA was next digested to completion with BamHI, and the 860-bp NcoI-BamHI product of this digestion was cloned in NcoI, BamHI-cut pPROEX Hta to yield plasmid pPROEX/ATP11. PCR was used to insert a Factor Xa recognition site inside the ATP11 coding sequence of pPROEX/ATP11. Two complementary oligonucleotides were constructed and used as primers for PCR mutagenesis following the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The sense and antisense primers, 5′-CATTTGATGACGAAAATCGAAGGTCGTTCTAGAAGTCCTCTCGATCCA-3′ and 5′-TGGATCGAGAGGACTTCTAGAACGACCTTCGATTTTCGTCATCAAATG-3′, respectively, included ATP11 nucleotides 304–318, followed by 12 nucleotides (bold) coding for the Factor Xa recognition sequence IEGR, followed by ATP11 nucleotides 319–339. The primers also encoded a silent (A→ T) bp change (under-lined) in the codon for Ser107, which introduced an XbaI restriction site unique to the mutant plasmid. The PCR reaction (50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4(SO4)2, 2mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 ng pPROEX/ATP11 plasmid (DNA template), and 125 ng of each primer. After the reaction was incubated at 95 °C for 2 min and then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature, 3 μl of QuikSolution (Stratagene), 6 μl of 2 mm dTNP mixture, and 1 μl of Pfu Turbo (2.5 units) were added to the tube, and the tube was incubated at 68 °C for 5 min. Next, PCR was performed for 18 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, 68 °C for 12 min). The resultant mixture was digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h to destroy the original plasmid DNA template, after which 10 μl was used to transform competent E. coli cells. Bacterial colonies harboring the mutant plasmid (called pATP11/Xa) were identified by restriction analysis with XbaI and tested in small-scale experiments for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced production of recombinant protein. One such expressing clone was selected and used for large-scale production/purification of the modified Atp11p protein (His6Atp11pXa). DNA sequencing confirmed the correct position of the inserted Factor Xa cleavage site and showed there were no codon changes elsewhere in the gene for His6Atp11pXa. Purification of Recombinant Atp11p and Preparation of a Factor Xa Cleavage Product, Atp11pTRNC—E. coli strain RRI served as host for the production of unlabeled recombinant proteins. Unmodified Atp11p was produced from the expression vector pTRC/ATP11 (8White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and His6Atp11pXa was produced from plasmid pATP11/Xa (described above). Growth of bacterial cultures in 2× yeast tryptone medium, induction of plasmid expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cell breakage by sonic irradiation, and purification of Atp11p proteins from clarified cell extracts following sequential chromatographic steps through DEAE and CM Fast Flow-Sepharose were as described by White and Ackerman (8White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the concentration of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside used for induction was 0.6 mm; the buffer employed up to and including the DEAE column was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA; lysozyme was omitted from the cell-breaking step; the CM column was run with a continuous gradient of phosphate buffer (50 to 500 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Highly purified Atp11p or His6Atp11pXa eluted from CM in ∼300 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Unmodified Atp11p was dialyzed versus 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, before being concentrated (see below). Atp11pTRNC was prepared from His6Atp11pXa in the following manner. Factor Xa was added directly to the CM column eluate at a protein/protein ratio of 1:2500 Factor Xa/His6Atp11pXa and the solution was dialyzed against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, overnight at 4 °C. The dialysate was adjusted to pH 8.0 (if necessary) and applied to a cobalt column (1.5 × 5 cm; ∼9-ml bed volume) (TALON resin; Clontech) that had been pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 60 ml of the equilibration buffer, and the flow-through was collected and passed through a p-amino-benzamidine column (1 × 2.5 cm; ∼2-ml bed volume) (Sigma) to remove Factor Xa from the protein preparation. Purified preparations of unmodified Atp11p and Atp11pTRNC were concentrated to 10 to 15 mg/ml using a Centricon-10, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of 15N-Atp11p and 15N-Atp11TRNC—Bacterial strain BL21 was used to propagate expression plasmids for preparation of recombinant Atp11p proteins labeled with 15N. Transformed bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB + ampicillin (40 μg/ml) and harvested the next morning by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended with 2 ml of M9 media, inoculated into 500 ml of M9 + ampicillin (40 μg/ml) medium, and the culture was grown at 37 °Ctoan A 600 = 0.8. The cells were collected by centrifugation and inoculated into 2 liters of M9 + ampicillin media that was prepared with 15NH4Cl (Cambridge isotopes) in place of unlabeled ammonium chloride. The labeled cultures were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase, at which point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce production of 15N-labeled recombinant protein. Purification of full-length 15N-Atp11p and the subfragment, 15N-Atp11pTRNC, from E. coli lysates followed the methods described except that the final step involved dialysis of the recombinant protein solutions against 10 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.0, before concentration to 15 mg/ml in a Centricon-10. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—Two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC spectra and one-dimensional 15NT2 and 15NT1 experiments were collected on a Varian 800 MHz INOVA spectrometer at a sample temperature of 25 °C. Protein Affinity Blots—The subunits of purified yeast F1 were resolved in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described previously (9Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was washed three times for 10 min each with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then blocked for 30 min with a solution of TBST plus 1.5% milk. After removal of the blocking solution, the blot was overlaid with 10 ml of fresh TBST/milk that was supplemented with purified Atp11p protein (20 μg) and agitated on a rotary shaker at room temperature for 2 h. The protein solution was collected and the blot was washed with TBST three times for 10 min each. Next, polyclonal antibody against yeast Atp11p was added to the blot at 1:2000 dilution in 10 ml TBST/milk and allowed to react for 1 h. After this step, the blot was washed with TBST and then challenged with horseradish-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody in TBST/milk for 30 min. After this reaction, the blot was washed with TBST, and immunologically reactive protein was detected with chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Miscellaneous Procedures—The light scattering assay for insulin B-chain aggregation was performed as described previously (10Sheluho D. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39945-39949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated using the procedure of Lowry (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of a Recombinant Atp11p Subdomain (Atp11pTRNC)—In previous work (12Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we assigned the boundaries of four domains in the polypeptide chain of Atp11p, which include the mitochondrial leader sequence (residues 1–39), the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 40–111), the functional domain (residues 112–183), and the C-terminal domain (residues 184–318) (Fig. 1). Our standard preparation of recombinant yeast Atp11p purified from bacteria lacks the targeting sequence and encompasses codons 41–318 of the primary gene product (8White M. Ackerman S.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such preparations are highly pure and active in biochemical assays of Atp11p activity (see ref. 10Sheluho D. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39945-39949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and below). However, the recombinant yeast protein does not crystallize and this has hampered our efforts to pursue the determination of its three-dimensional structure by x-ray diffraction methods. In preliminary work to determine whether nuclear magnetic resonance might be an avenue to study Atp11p structure, 15N-1H HSQC spectra obtained with 15N-Atp11p (279 amino acids) showed that only 110 of 264 observable resonances are resolved outside an overlapped region of the spectrum (data not shown). This result is consistent with the failed crystallization experiments because the high degree of overlapped resonances suggests that the Atp11p preparations are not uniformly well ordered. A strategy based on known features of Atp11p was developed to allow the preparation of a stable subfragment that might be more amenable to structure analysis. The decision was made to remove the protease-hypersensitive NTD (Fig. 1) from the protein (see ref. 12Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Complementation studies have shown that the NTD is not required for the chaperone action of Atp11p in yeast cells (12Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the extreme hydrophilic character of this region was considered to be the principle factor causing disorder of the protein structure. Efforts to produce a truncated protein directly from an expression vector did not yield detectable levels of the protein in bacterial cell lysates. This finding is consistent with the observation that although N-terminally truncated forms of Atp11p retain function, they are much less physically stable in vivo relative to the full-length protein (12Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, recombinant Atp11p was engineered with a Factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR ▾) near the end of the NTD, in-between Lys106 and Ser107 (Fig. 2A). The protein was also modified with a His6-tag at the amino terminus. In the purification scheme (see “Experimental Procedures”), His6Atp11pXa is prepared from bacteria, and after digestion with Factor Xa, truncated Atp11p (Atp11pTRNC, Ser-107 through Asn-318) is purified from the His6NTD and from any undigested protein after passage of the digested mixture through a cobalt column, which binds the His6 sequence (Figs. 2, A and B). Subsequent chromatography of Atp11pTRNC through p-amino benzamidine agarose removes Factor Xa from the preparation and yields the highly purified subfragment Atp11pTRNC (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Atp11pTRNC Prevents Aggregation of Reduced Insulin B-chains—The molecular chaperone activity of Atp11p can be assessed in vitro using reduced insulin as a surrogate substrate (10Sheluho D. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39945-39949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this method, light scattering is used to follow the progression of insulin B-chain aggregation that occurs when the disulfide bonds in the hormone are reduced with dithiothreitol (13Sanger F. Biochem J. 1949; 44: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Atp11pTRNC provides >60% protection against aggregation to reduced insulin B-chains in this assay (Fig. 3). This result can be compared with the value of 70% protection that is obtained with full-length recombinant Atp11p in similar studies (10Sheluho D. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39945-39949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Atp11pTRNC is just five residues shorter at the amino terminus than Atp11(Δ40–111)p (12Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4887-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a plasmid-borne variant of Atp11p that has been shown to confer respiratory competence to a Δ atp11 yeast mutant in previous work. Hence, there is excellent correlation of results obtained in vivo and in vitro to support the argument that removal of the Atp11p NTD does not interfere significantly with the molecular chaperone activity of the protein. Interactions between Atp11p and F1 β Proteins Studied by Affinity Blotting—Atp11p binds to the β subunit of F1 in yeast cells (6Wang Z.G. Ackerman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5767-5772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but not to a preparation of recombinant mitochondrial β subunit that is solubilized from bacteria with alkaline buffer after export to the periplasmic face of the plasma membrane. 2D. Sheluho and S. H. Ackerman, unpublished observations. A likely reason for this observation is that the alkaline-extracted protein poorly reflects the character of the β subunit that is presented to Atp11p during F1 assembly. Protein affinity blotting has provided an alternative method to study Atp11p interaction with its natural substrate in vitro. In this work, purified yeast F1 was run in an SDS gel under conditions that maximize resolution between α and β subunits (9Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after which the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membrane (Fig. 4). The NC was first incubated in TBST (see “Experimental Procedures”) and then treated with TBST/milk to reduce nonspecific protein binding. Next, the blocked NC was incubated with purified Atp11p (full-length or truncated subdomain) in TBST/milk, and after the protein overlay solution was removed, it was immunoblotted with antiserum against Atp11p. Atp11p (31 kDa) and Atp11pTRNC (24 kDa) were detected with the antibody at the position of F1 β protein (55 kDa) in the blot (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). The Atp11p protein signals were not detected if immunoblotting was done using pre-immune rabbit serum instead of anti-Atp11p serum (Fig. 4, lane 3). Moreover, under conditions in which the incubation step with purified Atp11p was omitted from the experiment and the NC was instead exposed directly to Atp11p antiserum, there was no immunoreactive signal (Fig. 4, lane 4). Such findings illustrate that anti-Atp11p does not recognize epitopes in the F1 β subunit; rather, the antibody lights up Atp11p bound to the F1 β subunit immobilized on the NC blot. The fact that the β subunit, which binds Atp11p in this assay, has been resolved from other F1 subunits in an SDS gel is not inconsistent with our model for Atp11p action, which suggests the chaperone recognizes a structural element in its target protein (14Ackerman S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There are examples in the literature of protein, transferred from an SDS gel to NC paper, that retains or regains sufficient higher order structure to support an interaction with nucleic acid (15Kochan G. Gonzalez D. Rodriguez J.F. Arch. Virol. 2003; 148: 723-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or protein (16Gupta M. Kogut P. Davis F.J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10413-10422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Zhu K. Gonzalez-Pedrajo B. Macnab R.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9516-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) applied as an overlay solution to the blot. It is possible that either the F1 β subunit is not completely denatured in the SDS gel or it renatures partially after electrophoretic transfer from the denaturing gel and subsequent washing of the NC membrane. A corollary finding of this analysis is that the Atp11p:F1 β binding interaction occurs in the absence of other proteins or cofactors. The dependence of chaperone release on other factors remains to be determined. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies with Atp11pTRNC— 15N-labeled Atp11pTRNC (212 amino acids) yields a very well resolved 15N-1H HSQC spectrum at 25 °C, from which 200 strong main-chain cross peaks can be easily counted (Fig. 5). Their peak intensity and line-width is rather uniform. Lower level plots reveal another 10 resolved low intensity peaks. Together, the data are indicative of a structured protein, without mobile tails, and with few exchange broadened peaks. Using one-dimensional variants of standard 15N relaxation experiments, 15NT2 = 0.043 ± 0.005 s, and 15NT1 = 1.4 ± 0.2 s at 25 °C were found for resonances with a 1H chemical shift at 9 ppm (i.e. resonances belonging to the structured core of the protein). This yields a value of 14 ± 2 ns for the protein's rotational correlation time, corresponding to a molecular mass of 28 ± 4 kDa, which is near the value of 24 kDa calculated from the sequence of Atp11pTRNC. It may be inferred from the spectral data that the protein is mono-disperse at the concentrations (24 mg/ml) used in the experiment. The prospects for NMR assignment and solution structure determination of Atp11pTRNC, once uniformly triple-labeled with 15N, 2H, and 13C, are excellent. Having demonstrated here that the purified subfragment of Atp11p shows functional activities comparable with the full-length protein, there is every reason to believe that solving the solution structure of Atp11pTRNC will provide relevant information about the mechanism of this molecular chaperone."
