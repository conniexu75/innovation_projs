https://openalex.org/W2133918133,Homopyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotides with EDTA-Fe attached at a single position bind the corresponding homopyrimidine-homopurine tracts within large double-stranded DNA by triple helix formation and cleave at that site. Oligonucleotides with EDTA.Fe at the 5' end cause a sequence specific double strand break. The location and asymmetry of the cleavage pattern reveal that the homopyrimidine-EDTA probes bind in the major groove parallel to the homopurine strand of Watson-Crick double helical DNA. The sequence-specific recognition of double helical DNA by homopyrimidine probes is sensitive to single base mismatches. Homopyrimidine probes equipped with DNA cleaving moieties could be useful tools for mapping chromosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2076854746,"The Drosophila gene, dorsal, is a maternal effect locus that is essential for the establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the developing embryo. The dorsal protein was predicted from the complementary DNA sequence; it is almost 50 percent identical, over an extensive region, to the protein encoded by the avian oncogene v-rel, its cellular homolog, c-rel, and a human c-rel fragment. The oncogene v-rel is highly oncogenic in avian lymphoid, spleen, and bone marrow cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554631282,"This report describes the primary structure of a rat liver beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1), a Golgi apparatus enzyme involved in the terminal sialylation of N-linked carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins. The complete amino acid sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones of the enzyme. The primary structure suggests that the topology of the enzyme in the Golgi apparatus consists of a short NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a 17-residue hydrophobic sequence which serves as the membrane anchor and signal sequence, and a large lumenal, catalytic domain. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of a truncated form of the enzyme, obtained by purification from tissue homogenates, reveals that it is missing a 63-residue NH2-terminal peptide which includes the membrane binding domain. These and supporting results show that soluble forms of the sialyltransferase can be generated by proteolytic cleavage between the NH2-terminal signal-anchor and the catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2095017263,"The octamer sequence 5′-ATGCAAAT, in either orientation, serves as an upstream element in a variety of promoters and also occurs as a modular enhancer element. It is of particular interest in immunoglobulin genes since it is found in the upstream regions of all heavy and light chain promoters and in the heavy chain enhancer, both of which are known to be necessary for cell-specific expression. We report here the chromatographic separation of ubiquitous and B cell-specific octamer-binding proteins. The B cell factor was purified to homogenelty using affinity chromatography and consists of three peptides of 62, 61, and 58.5 +/− 1.5 kd. Each of the polypeptides was renatured after SDS-PAGE and shown to bind to the octamer sequence. The specific DNA binding activity of the pure B cell-specific factor was indistinguishable from that of the affinity-purified ubiquitous factor. This B cell-specific octamer-binding factor, in pure form, activated transcription from a κ light chain promoter in vitro, thus demonstrating that it is indeed a B cell-specific transcription factor for this gene. In addition to the ubiquitous and B cell-specific octamer-binding factors, we identified several additional proteins, one of which is B cell-specific, that interact with the κ promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2000404687,"Complementary DNA and genomic clones were isolated and sequenced corresponding to rat and human synaptophysin (p38), a major integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. The deduced amino acid sequences indicate an evolutionarily highly conserved protein that spans the membrane four times. Both amino and carboxyl termini face the cytoplasm, with the latter containing ten copies of a tyrosine-rich pentapeptide repeat. The structure of synaptophysin suggests that the protein may function as a channel in the synaptic vesicle membrane, with the carboxyl terminus serving as a binding site for cellular factors."
https://openalex.org/W1497695953,"The human tumor cell line HT-1080 was used as a model system to study the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) on polypeptide synthesis and proteolytic activity of malignant cells. Confluent cultures were exposed to TGF beta under serum-free conditions, and alterations in the production of proteins were examined by metabolic labeling and polypeptide analysis. TGF beta induced the synthesis and secretion of the Mr 47,000 endothelial type plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) as shown by reverse zymography, immunblotting, and immunoprecipitation analyses. TGF beta-induced PAI-1 was rapidly deposited in the growth substratum of the cells as shown by metabolic labeling and extraction of the cultures with sodium deoxycholate. Using pulse-chase experiments, we found a relatively fast turnover of substratum-associated PAI-1. Exogenously added urokinase released PAI-1 from the substratum even in the presence of the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin, suggesting a direct effect of urokinase. Immunoreactive complexes of higher molecular weight were subsequently detected in the medium. Epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin did not elicit similar effects on the amount of PAI-1. TGF beta also inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of HT-1080 cells at the same concentrations at which it induced PAI-1. These results indicate that TGF beta can modulate the extracellular proteolytic activity of cultured cells by enhancing the secretion and deposition of PAI-1 into their microenvironment. It remains to be established whether TGF beta inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of these cells is associated with the induction of PAI-1."
https://openalex.org/W1587655337,"Calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinases isolated from bovine and rat brains phosphorylate the microtubule-associated tau protein in the mode that shifts the mobility of tau in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (mode I). This mode of tau phosphorylation is the one that occurs abnormally in Alzheimer's lesions. Purified tau protein in solution can be phosphorylated by the Ca2+/CaM kinases maximally to about 50% of the total tau protein. Incorporation of one phosphate group per mol of tau is sufficient to shift the protein to a slower migrating electrophoretic band. Additional phosphate incorporation into the shifted tau proteins can occur depending on protein kinase concentration. In the presence of phosphatidylserine, tau proteins were phosphorylated to an extent of 100% at a tau: phosphatidylserine ratio of 20. Phosphatidylethanolamine also stimulated tau phosphorylation by Ca2+/CaM kinase and phosphatidylinositol was found to be a potent inhibitor of tau protein phosphorylation. The direct observation that tau proteins interact with phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, resulting in a smearing of the protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, supports the possibility that tau protein may interact with phospholipid membranes in vivo and that tau protein phosphorylation could be modulated by the phospholipid composition of the membranes with which tau interacts."
https://openalex.org/W1487192768,"We have investigated the sub-second kinetics of changes in cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+]i, in fura-2-loaded human platelets by stopped-flow fluorimetry. Thrombin, vasopressin, platelet-activating factor, and the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 all evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i which was delayed in onset by 200-400 ms in the presence of 1 mM external Ca2+. The responses to these agonists in media containing 1 mM EGTA or 1 mM Ni2+, to prevent Ca2+ influx, were delayed by an additional 60-100 ms. These results indicate that agonist-evoked Ca2+ influx precedes the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. The delays in onset of both responses are sufficient for one or more biochemical steps to lie between ligand-receptor binding and Ca2+ flux generation. ADP responses in media containing EGTA or Ni2+ were similar to those evoked by other agonists, but the response in the presence of external Ca2+ was markedly shorter, occurring without measurable delay at optimal ligand concentration. Analysis of this response showed some delay in ADP-evoked influx at lower concentrations, but this delay was markedly less than that observed with thrombin at doses giving the same elevation in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that ADP evokes influx using a different transduction system, more closely coupled to the Ca2+ entry system than that used by other agonists. Differences between thrombin- and ADP-evoked influx were further demonstrated by the inhibitory actions of cAMP, which reduced and substantially increased the delay in onset of thrombin-evoked influx but did not measurably delay the influx evoked by an optimal concentration of ADP."
https://openalex.org/W2085477248,"Recombinant vaccinia viruses have been proposed as live vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases, including AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Objections have been concerned primarily with side effects of the vaccinia virus vector itself. Recently it has been shown that inactivation of the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase gene or deletion of certain other non-essential genes is associated with a marked reduction in pathogenicity. Nevertheless, the ability of vaccinia virus to produce a progressive infection in immunodeficient individuals remains a most serious problem. Indeed, an incident of this type in a vaccinated man seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus was recently reported. We have used immunodeficient athymic nude mice to establish a model of disseminated vaccinia virus infection, and to demonstrate a novel approach to virus attenuation which involves insertion of a gene encoding human interleukin-2 into the genome of vaccinia virus vectors."
https://openalex.org/W1566734962,"Erythrocytes bearing the Rh(D) antigen have an Mr 30,000 integral membrane protein which can be surface-labeled with 125I and can be quantitatively immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized spectrin-depleted membrane vesicles. The 125I-labeled Rh(D)-associated protein was purified to radiochemical homogeneity from membrane skeletons solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea by hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel filtration, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Rh(D)-associated protein was purified nearly 200-fold from 2 units of erythrocytes from DD individuals by employing similar methods on a large scale using the purified 125I-labeled Rh(D)-associated protein as a tracer. The product appeared to be greater than 95% pure and migrated as a diffuse band of Mr approximately 30,000-32,000 on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis gels poured from 12% acrylamide. It is estimated that the Rh(D)-associated protein makes up approximately 0.5% of the original membrane protein. When concentrated, partially purified Rh(D)-associated protein forms dimers and larger oligomers which are stable in sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The Rh(D)-associated protein was protected from degradation when intact erythrocytes or inside out membrane vesicles were enzymatically digested. These studies indicate that the Mr 30,000 protein associated with the Rh(D) antigen is linked to the membrane skeleton, resides within the lipid bilayer with minimal extra- or intracellular protrusions, exists normally as an oligomer, and can be purified in denatured form."
https://openalex.org/W1484101282,"To evaluate the state of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) in malaria pigment, mouse erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei NYU-2 parasites were lysed by hypotonic shock, and hemoglobin and other soluble material were removed by extensive washing. The amount of FP recovered in the insoluble pellet was 2.1 mumol/ml of packed infected erythrocytes, of which approximately 1% was attributable to hemoglobin contamination. This crude preparation then was digested with a nonspecific protease from Streptomyces griseus and extracted with chloroform/methanol. The residue of insoluble dark brown material had the spectral and solubility properties characteristic of the FP of malaria pigment, and various different preparations contained from 82 to 99% of FP by weight. By elemental analysis, highly purified preparations contained no chlorine and had an oxygen content consistent with 1 mol of hydroxyl/mol of FP (oxygen content: calculated, 12.6%; found, 12.5%). In comparison to hematin purchased from Sigma, which had a measured oxygen content of 14.7%, the low oxygen form of hematin purified from malaria pigment was remarkably less soluble in ethanol, 3% sodium bicarbonate, and chloroform."
https://openalex.org/W1603828670,"We have previously identified three types of protein kinase C (a Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent kinase) isozymes, designated types I, II, and III, from rat brain (Huang, K.-P., Nakabayashi, H., and Huang, F. L. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 8535-8539). These enzymes are different in their elution profile from hydroxylapatite column, sites of autophosphorylation, and immunoreactivity toward two types of monoclonal antibodies. Now we describe the purification of similar protein kinase C isozymes from monkey brain and their regional distribution in the brain. These primate enzymes all have the same molecular weight of 82,000, and each type of isozyme cross-reacts with the purified monospecific antibodies against its corresponding rat brain counterpart isozyme. These purified antibodies were used to quantify the relative contents of three types of protein kinase C isozymes in various regions of rat and monkey brains. In rat brain, cerebellum contained a high level of the type I isozyme; cerebral cortex, thalamus, and corpus callosum were high in the type II enzyme; and olfactory bulb was highest in the type III enzyme. In monkey brain, the type I isozyme was found to be enriched in cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala; the type II enzyme was at very high level in caudate, frontal and motor cerebral cortices, substantia nigra, and thalamus; and the type III enzyme was at the highest level in olfactory bulb. These results indicate that protein kinase C isozymes are differentially distributed in various regions of rat and monkey brains and suggest a unique role for each isozyme in controlling the different neuronal functions in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2016349058,"A synthetic 52-residue peptide based on the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of Hin recombinase (139-190) has been equipped with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at the amino terminus. In the presence of Fe(II), this synthetic EDTA-peptide cleaves DNA at Hin recombination sites. The cleavage data reveal that the amino terminus of Hin(139-190) is bound in the minor groove of DNA near the symmetry axis of Hin recombination sites. This work demonstrates the construction of a hybrid peptide combining two functional domains: sequence-specific DNA binding and DNA cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2128131515,"We examined the protein domain of the gap gene Krüppel (Kr) in mutants that affect the establishment of different regions of the segment pattern along the longitudinal axis of the Drosophila embryo. Our data suggest that Kr provides cues for establishing the ""central"" pattern elements at the blastoderm stage, and that Kr activity is controlled by maternal effect genes acting at the poles. The formation of the Kr protein domain may involve ubiquitous activation of Kr gene expression which, however, is limited by region-specific repression through the action of the maternal anterior and posterior pattern organizer genes. In addition, the formation of the Kr protein domain depends on the activity of gap genes acting adjacent to the Kr domain, but it is independent of subordinate pair-rule gene activities."
https://openalex.org/W26356504,"The chicken oocyte receptor for low and very low density lipoproteins has been identified and characterized. Receptor activity present in octyl-beta-D-glucoside extracts of oocyte membranes was measured by a solid phase filtration assay, and the receptor was visualized by ligand blotting. The protein had an apparent Mr of 95,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and exhibited high affinity for apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, but not for high density lipoproteins or lipoproteins in which lysine residues had been reductively methylated. Binding of lipoproteins was sensitive to EDTA, suramin, and treatment with Pronase. In these aspects, the avian oocyte system was analogous to the mammalian low density lipoprotein receptor in somatic cells. Furthermore, a structural relationship between the mammalian and avian receptors was revealed by immunoblotting: polyclonal antibodies directed against the purified bovine low density lipoprotein receptor reacted selectively with the 95-kDa chicken receptor present in crude oocyte membrane extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2007766285,"The Abelson gene in Drosophila (abl) consists of ten exons extending over 26 kb of genomic DNA. The DNA sequence encodes a protein of 1520 amino acids with sequence homology to the human c-abl proto-oncogene product, beginning at the amino terminus and extending 656 amino acids through the region essential for tyrosine kinase activity. Mutant lesions in the abl gene were identified first by their failure to complement chromosomal deletions that overlap the abl DNA sequence and then by rescue of the mutant phenotypes with an abl minigene in transgenic flies. Elimination of abl zygotic function by mutations produces some recessive lethality at the pharate adult pupal stage, and mutant adults with reduced longevity, reduced fecundity, and an irregular pattern of retinal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579151760,"The endothelial cell-type plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) may exist in an inactive, latent form that can be converted into an active form upon treatment of the protein with denaturants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, guanidine HCl, or urea. The present paper demonstrates that latent PAI-1 can be activated by lipid vesicles containing the negatively charged phospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol. The presence of a net negative charge on the phospholipid headgroup is essential for activation, since lipid vesicles consisting exclusively of zwitterionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, do not activate PAI-1. In the presence of PS vesicles, PAI-1 inhibited tissue-type plasminogen activator 50-fold more effectively than in the absence of phospholipids, whereas sodium dodecyl sulfate enhanced PAI-1 activity by 25-fold. In mixed phospholipid vesicles containing PS and phosphatidylcholine in various molar ratios, the extent of PAI-1 activation was directly related to the PS content of the phospholipid membrane. Ca2+ ions interfered with the inhibitory activity of PS-activated PAI-1, suggesting that Ca2+ ions may regulate PAI-1 activity in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. An important consequence of these findings is that, as in blood coagulation, negatively charged phospholipids may play an important regulatory role in controlling the fibrinolytic system by activating an inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator."
https://openalex.org/W1540571608,"The nuclear spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times of the C epsilon 1-proton of His-35 and the C delta 2-proton of His-46 of reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin have been determined at 298 and 320 K and at pH 4.5 and 9.0 at various concentrations of total azurin and in the presence of varying amounts of oxidized azurin. The relaxation times appear strongly influenced by the electron self-exchange reaction between oxidized and reduced protein. The T1 data of the His-35 proton have been analyzed according to the fast-exchange limit, while the slow-exchange limit appears to obtain for the T2 data of the His-46 proton. Analysis of the proton relaxation data yields values of the electron self-exchange rate constants of (9.6 +/- 0.7) X 10(5) M-1 S-1 (pH 4.5) and (7.0 +/- 1.3) X 10(5) M-1 S-1 (pH 9.0) at 298 K. The dipolar correlation time amounts to 1-2.5 ns in the temperature range of 298-320 K. A Fermi-contact interaction of about 100 mG for the C delta 2-proton of His-46 is compatible with the experimental observations. The pH-induced conformational changes lead to variations on the order of about 1 A in the distance from the copper to the His-35 protons. The data implicate the hydrophobic patch around His-117 as the site of electron transfer in the self-exchange reaction of the azurin."
https://openalex.org/W1606922327,"When mammalian cells are grown in medium containing [3H]spermidine, a single major tritiated protein identical to eukaryotic initiation factor 4D becomes labeled. This protein contains 1 residue/molecule of tritiated hypusine (N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine), a rare amino acid which has been found in no other protein. In order to investigate the conservation of this protein, we examined two nonmammalian eukaryotes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the insect Drosophila melanogaster, and the eubacterial prokaryote Escherichia coli for the presence of the hypusine-containing protein. When the eukaryotic cells were grown in the presence of [3H]spermidine, electrophoretic analysis revealed a single labeled protein. In each case, the apparent molecular weight was near 18,000 and the relative pI was approximately 5.2, similar to the hypusine-containing protein of mammals. Amino acid analysis confirmed the presence of tritiated hypusine in each case, and silver staining of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that, in yeast and fruit flies as in mammals, the protein is relatively abundant. In the eubacterium E. coli, one tritiated protein was predominant, but its molecular weight was 24,000 and we found no evidence that it contained tritiated hypusine. We found no evidence for the existence of the hypusine-containing protein in the archaebacterium Methanococcus voltae. These data suggest that the hypusine-containing protein is conserved among eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1516061160,"Bovine brain tau protein (tau) consists of four closely related phosphoproteins named tau 1, tau 2, tau 3 and tau 4, that range in size from 55 to 68 kDa (as determined by gel electrophoresis). Here we report an improved large-scale purification method for tau protein and the separation of the four individual tau protein species. The separation of the individual tau protein was accomplished by two chromatographic techniques: hydroxyapatite chromatography allowed the separation of two pairs of tau protein (tau 1 and tau 3) and (tau 2 and tau 4); fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column at basic pH achieved the resolution of the individual tau protein species in each pair derived from hydroxyapatite columns. Chromatography on the Mono Q column revealed that tau protein possesses previously unrecognized, highly reactive sulfhydryl groups that may oxidize to form intermolecular disulfide bridges. The isolation of individual species of tau in substantial quantities permitted an improved amino acid analysis that demonstrated the occurrence of cysteine and tryptophan in the protein. The availability of individual tau protein species greatly simplified the analysis for mode II phosphorylation of tau, which was found to be catalyzed by the calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. The mode II phosphorylation of tau by protein kinase C was not associated with a mobility shift for tau protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in contrast to mode I phosphorylation of tau by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, which produces a substantial shift in mobility."
https://openalex.org/W1530807068,"Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum is a homodimer of 50.5-kDa subunits with two substrate binding sites per molecule of dimer. To determine whether each subunit contains an independent active site or whether the active sites are created by intersubunit interactions, we have used a novel in vivo approach for producing heterodimers from catalytically inactive, site-directed mutants of the carboxylase. When the alleles encoding these mutant proteins are placed separately into compatible plasmids and coexpressed in the same Escherichia coli host, activity is observed at about 20% of the wild-type level. Analysis of the carboxylase purified from these cells reveals the presence of heterodimers of the two mutant proteins. This interallelic complementation demonstrates that domains from each of the subunits interact to form a shared active site."

https://openalex.org/W7386683,"The biosynthesis of rat intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase was studied by pulse-labeling of jejunal explants from 5-day-old suckling rats in organ culture. Explants were either continuously labeled with [35S] methionine for 15, 30, and 60 min or pulse-labeled for 30 min and chased for various periods of time up to 6 h in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors (PI), leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lactase-phlorizin hydrolase was immunoprecipitated from microvillus membrane (MVM) and ER-Golgi fractions with monoclonal antibodies. After pulse-labeling, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase from the ER-Golgi fraction appeared on SDS-PAGE as one band of approximately 220 kDa, regardless of the presence or absence of PI in the culture media. The 220-kDa protein band could also be labeled after incubation with [2-3H]mannose. In the absence of PI, the 220-kDa band appeared in the MVM by 30 min chase, simultaneously with a 180-kDa band, and by 60 min of chase an additional band of 130 kDa was seen. With increasing time of chase, the relative intensity of the 130-kDa band increased, whereas that of the 220-kDa band decreased, suggesting a precursor-product relationship. When PI were added to the medium, the formation of the 180-kDa band was not affected, but the conversion of the 180-kDa protein to the 130-kDa protein was virtually blocked. These findings suggest that lactase-phlorizin hydrolase is initially synthesized as a glycosylated precursor of 220 kDa, which is transported to the MVM. There it undergoes the following two cleavages: first, to the 180-kDa form, which is not prevented by PI used in these experiments, and second, to the 130-kDa form inhibited by PI."
https://openalex.org/W1533042261,"Treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with tumor-promoting phorbol diester or with platelet-derived growth factor caused the phosphorylation of the transferrin receptor by protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) at serine 24 and increased the cell surface expression of the transferrin receptor. The hypothesis that the regulation of transferrin receptor cycling by protein kinase C is causally related to the phosphorylation of the receptor at serine 24 was critically tested. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human transferrin receptor cDNA was used to substitute serine 24 with threonine or alanine residues in order to create phosphorylation defective receptors. Wild-type and mutated transferrin receptors were expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using the retrovirus vector pZipNeoSV (X). These receptors were functionally active and caused the receptor-mediated endocytosis of diferric transferrin. Incubation of the fibroblasts with phorbol diester caused the phosphorylation of the wild-type (Ser-24) human transferrin receptor, but this treatment did not result in the phosphorylation of the mutated (Ala-24 and Thr-24) receptors. The cycling of the phosphorylation defective receptors was regulated by phorbol diester and platelet-derived growth factor in a manner similar to that observed for the wild-type receptor. We conclude that the regulation of transferrin receptor cycling by protein kinase C is independent of receptor phosphorylation at serine 24 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1561957470,"We have isolated the major GTP-binding proteins from myeloid HL-60 cell plasma membranes. Two pertussis toxin substrates with similar apparent molecular masses of 40 and 41 kDa, respectively, are contained in these preparations, with both proteins being ADP-ribosylated to a similar extent. Partial chymotryptic proteolysis of fractions containing the [32P]ADP-ribosylated 40-kDa GTP-binding protein alpha subunit demonstrated production of 32P-labeled peptides of 28 and 16 kDa which were not observed after partial proteolysis of fractions containing solely the 41-kDa protein. Similarly, mild acid hydrolysis produced an additional 28-kDa fragment only from fractions containing the 40-kDa protein. The results presented here indicate the presence of two distinct pertussis toxin substrates in myeloid cells. The 41-kDa pertussis toxin substrate is likely to represent the alpha subunit of the inhibitory GTP-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase, whereas the 40-kDa substrate may represent the alpha subunit of the GTP-binding protein which is coupled to chemoattractant receptors. In addition to the pertussis toxin substrates, an additional major peak of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-binding activity closely corresponded to the appearance of a 23-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1499356405,"Treatment of prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase (70 kDa) with trypsin generates fragments of 33 and 38 kDa. Each of the fragments was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid gradients. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that the 33-kDa protein contains the NH2 terminus of PGH synthase. Neither the 33- nor 38-kDa fragment isolated by HPLC exhibits any PGH synthase activity; however, cleavage of intact enzyme to 33- and 38-kDa fragments to the extent of 90% only reduces cyclooxygenase activity by 40%. This implies that the cleaved proteins or a complex formed between them retains the conformation necessary for enzyme activity. Extensive attempts to resolve active fragments from each other or from intact enzyme were unsuccessful; intact enzyme and digestion fragments cochromatograph under all conditions employed. Treatment of PGH synthase with [3H]acetylsalicylic acid followed by trypsin digestion introduces [3H]acetyl moieties into the intact protein and the 38-kDa fragment (0.8-0.9 acetyl group/subunit). Nearly complete conversion of PGH synthase to 33- and 38-kDa fragments by exposure to high concentrations of trypsin prior to [3H]acetylsalicylic acid treatment results in labeling of the 38-kDa fragment, but not the 33-kDa fragment. The present findings are consistent with the presence of a membrane-binding domain (33 kDa) and an active site domain (38 kDa) in the 70-kDa subunit of PGH synthase. They also suggest that, following cleavage, the 38-kDa fragment retains the structural features responsible for the cyclooxygenase activity and selective aspirin labeling of PGH synthase. PGH synthase undergoes self-catalyzed inactivation by oxidants generated during its catalytic turnover. When PGH synthase, inactivated by treatment with arachidonic acid or hydrogen peroxide, was treated with trypsin it was cleaved two to three times faster than unoxidized enzyme. Addition of heme to oxidized PGH synthase did not reconstitute cyclooxygenase activity or resistance to trypsin cleavage. Spectrophotometric studies demonstrated that oxidatively inactivated enzyme did not bind heme. This implies that oxidation of protein residues as well as the heme prosthetic group is an important determinant of proteolytic sensitivity. Oxidative modification may mark PGH synthase for proteolytic cleavage and turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1607328788,"Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF) are glycoproteins that form a tightly bound complex in plasma. The interaction of porcine factor VIII with porcine vWF was studied by analytical velocity sedimentation. A single approximately 240-kDa species of factor VIII was isolated for use in the analysis. In contrast, when analyzed by agarose/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, vWF consisted of a population of greater than 10 multimers derived from a 270-kDa monomer. A single boundary (So20,w = 7.2 S) was observed during velocity sedimentation of factor VIII at 260,000 x g. A single boundary also was observed for vWF (weight-average So20,w = 21 S) at 42,000 x g. Under condition of excess factor VIII, the weight-average So20,w of the factor VIII-vWF complex was 40 S at 42,000 x g. At 260,000 x g, the factor VIII-vWF complex had sedimented completely, leaving only free factor VIII. The height of the plateau region of the factor VIII sedimentation velocity curve at 260,000 x g was studied as a function of several starting concentrations of vWF. The experiments were done under conditions in which the effect of radial dilution was negligible so that the plateau height was a measure of the concentration of free factor VIII. The plateau height decreased linearly as the concentration of vWF was increased, indicating that the association was essentially irreversible under the conditions used. A stoichiometry of 1.2 vWF monomers/factor VIII molecule was calculated from the slope of the line. Assuming one factor VIII-binding site/vWF monomer, these results indicate that all factor VIII-binding sites are accessible in the vWF multimer."
https://openalex.org/W1516827029,"When platelets are activated by agonists, calcium (Ca2+) is released from an intracellular storage site. Recent studies using fura-2 show that, after thrombin stimulation, the rise in free calcium is transient and returns to base-line levels in 2-3 min, while the transient following ADP stimulation lasts only 15-20 s. We reported previously that the phorbol ester 12,13-phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), added at nanomolar levels after thrombin, immediately accelerated the rate of return of calcium to the base line severalfold (Yoshida, K., Dubyak, G., and Nachmias, V.T. (1986) FEBS Lett. 206, 273-278). In the present study, we used both intact and saponized platelets to determine whether this is due to stimulation of calcium sequestration. Using fura-2 and intact platelets, we found 1) that PMA stimulated the restoration of free Ca2+ levels after ADP as well as after thrombin, and 2) that H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), slowed the return of Ca2+ to baseline levels. Using saponized platelets, we also found 3) that pretreatment of platelets with PMA before saponin treatment increased the ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake 2-fold, with a half-maximal effect at 5 nm; 4) that most of the Ca2+ released by ionomycin or by myoinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; and 5) that a GTP-binding protein inhibitor, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), decreased basal or PMA-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake in saponin-treated platelets. Our data suggest that activation of protein kinase C stimulates the sequestration of Ca2+ independently of cAMP or myoinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1577930773,"Heparin binds to human antithrombin III and accelerates its inhibitory activity in the blood coagulation system. Previous reports (Rosenberg, R. D., and Damus, P. S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6490-6505; Pecon, J. M., and Blackburn, M. N. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 935-938) have shown that selective chemical modification of a limited number of lysine residues in antithrombin III causes drastic loss of its heparin cofactor activity. We have performed chemical modification of antithrombin III with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in order to determine the location of these lysine residues. When antithrombin III was treated with 100 M excess of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid for 10 min, about 3.2 mol of amino group per mol of antithrombin III were modified. The heparin cofactor activity dropped to about 25%, whereas the progressive inhibitory activity (in the absence of heparin) remained essentially intact (about 95%). The modified amino groups were identified to be Lys114 (75%), Lys125 (94%), and Lys287 (96%). These results were obtained by comparing and analyzing the cyanogen bromide fragments derived from native antithrombin III and the 10-min modified antithrombin III. When antithrombin III was pretreated with heparin, followed by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid modification, the extent of modification at Lys114 and Lys125 decreased from 75% and 94% to 20% and 40%, respectively, whereas the modification at Lys287 remained nearly quantitative (greater than 95%). Based on these results, we conclude that Lys114 and Lys125 are essential for the heparin cofactor activity of human antithrombin III."
https://openalex.org/W1619407925,Antisera were generated against synthetic peptides that correspond to amino acid sequences deduced from a cDNA (designated beta 2) that encodes a second form of the beta subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). The specificity of interactions of these antisera with purified G protein beta subunits indicates that the beta 2 cDNA encodes the beta 35 form of this polypeptide. This hypothesis is confirmed by the use of these antisera to detect expression of the beta 2 cDNA in COS-m6 cells.

These fragments represent less than 0.5% of the pepsin-extractable collagen. We purified 10- and 16-kDa reduced fragments derived, respectively, from 32- and 46-kDa disulfide-bonded fragments. Unique tryptic peptide maps were obtained for each fragment. Although these collagenous fragments differ from all the known collagens in their electrophoretic behaviors, tryptic peptides and amino acid compositions, they present some striking similarities with the pepsin-derived fragments from cartilage type IX collagen. Unique sequences from the amino terminus and from a tryptic peptide were obtained for the 10-kDa reduced fragment, demonstrating that this fragment is derived from type XII collagen, whose existence had only been inferred so far from a cDNA encoding it."

However, it does show turnover when dissociated from the intact polymerase-primase. Both forms of the enzyme can catalyze the synthesis of primers that are not complementary to the DNA template. Like the intact enzyme, the isolated primase synthesizes primers of a unique chain length; however, they are twice as long as those synthesized by the polymerase-primase. The activity of the primase separated from the polymerase-primase is similar in all other respects to the intact polymerase-primase."
https://openalex.org/W1598554407,"The binding of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) on human T-cells is a key regulatory event which is absolutely required for T-cell-mediated immune responses. To understand further this binding event, we modified the human IL-2R gene to encode a secreted form of IL-2R. Secreted IL-2R was then expressed at very high levels (approximately 11 micrograms/10(6) cells/48 h) in rodent cells using gene-linked co-amplification. The soluble forms of IL-2R were shown to retain IL-2 affinity shown by cell-surface IL-2R (Kd approximately 18 nM) and were purified to homogeneity using IL-2 affinity chromatography. Purified, recombinant IL-2R and biotinylated IL-2 were used to establish a solid-phase receptor binding assay. Binding of IL-2-biotin was demonstrated to be dose-dependent at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 ng/ml, and the specificity of receptor-ligand binding was demonstrated by competition with non-biotinylated IL-2 and with anti-receptor antibodies known to block IL-2 binding in vivo. This immunosorbent receptor assay offers a simple and rapid method for studying the binding of IL-2 to human IL-2R."
https://openalex.org/W2007737375,"We have isolated a number of mutations in D. melanogaster that result in the constitutive expression of the heat shock response in a tissue-specific manner. These mutations induce alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) when the ADH structural gene is fused to the promoter for the 70 kd heat shock protein (hsp70) gene. Flies carrying these mutations, the hsp70-Adh fusion, and a deletion in their endogenous Adh genes are ethanol tolerant and exhibit elevated ADH levels. Several of the tissue-specific mutations have also been shown to induce an hsp26-Adh fusion gene in trans. The mutation Act88FKM75, a G----A transition in the indirect flight muscle-specific actin gene, also exhibits this phenotype. Comparisons with the Act88FKM75 mutation suggest that the tissue-specific mutations induce the heat shock response by disrupting the physiology of the cells in which the variant gene product is expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2411238386,"Phospholipases A1 and A2 catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl groups of phospholipids at C-1 and C-2, respectively. These phospholipases are important in phospholipid catabolism and the remodeling of the acyl groups of phospholipids. Phospholipase A from hamster heart cytosol was purified by a combination of ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purity of the enzyme was assessed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimension polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunological studies. The purified enzyme exhibited both phospholipase A1 and A2 activities toward phosphatidylcholine and had the ability to hydrolyze the acyl groups of phosphatidylethanolamine. However, the enzyme was not active toward lysophosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerol, or triacylglycerol. By Sepharose 6B chromatography, the molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 140,000. Analysis of the purified enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was composed of identical Mr 14,000 subunits. At least six subunits in the native enzyme could be cross-linked by dimethyl suberimidate. Both phospholipase A1 and A2 activities showed similar pH profiles, exhibited no absolute requirements for divalent metallic cations, but displayed a high degree of specificity for the acyl groups of phosphatidylcholine at both C-1 and C-2. The Km of phospholipases A1 and A2 for 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidon-ylglycerophosphocholine was found to be identical (0.5 mM)."

Both activities have been obtained in good yield. The properties of the 182-kDa polymerase subunit are similar to those of the intact four-subunit enzyme. However, there are three significant differences. (i) The polymerase activity of the 182-kDa subunit shows an increased thermolability; (ii) the pause sites during replication of singly primed, single-stranded circular DNA by the 182-kDa subunit are altered; and (iii) unlike the intact enzyme, the 182-kDa subunit is highly processive in the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1593919163,"Cytochrome P-450 LM2 reduction was measured at a series of NADPH concentrations in the absence of substrate and in the presence of 1 mM benzphetamine. In the absence of substrate reduction could be described as a biphasic process with 55% of the reaction occurring in the first phase (at 20 microM NADPH). When benzphetamine was present, the fraction of the reaction occurring in the first phase was increased to 91%. When examined either in the absence or presence of benzphetamine, the rate constant and fraction of LM2 reduced in the fast phase were decreased as the NADPH concentration was decreased. In each case the fraction of LM2 reduced in the second phase was not substantially altered over the NADPH concentrations examined. To explain the effect of NADPH concentration on the initial rate of LM2 reduction, the effect of NADPH on the reduction of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was examined. Due to the presence of two flavins within each reductase molecule, there would be nine possible oxidation-reduction states of the reductase which may be present at a given NADPH concentration. Based on the redox potentials for the flavin half-reactions and for NADPH oxidation, the relative concentrations of each of the reductase subspecies could be determined. Rate constants were assigned for the reduction of LM2 by the various reductase subspecies, and the theoretical initial rates of LM2 reduction at various NADPH concentrations were compared with values obtained experimentally. The experimental data are consistent with a model where, under the conditions of this assay, the fully reduced reductase is the form primarily responsible for the reduction of LM2."
https://openalex.org/W1581081242,"Treatment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii thylakoids with cross-linking reagents including glutaraldehyde causes polymerization of all thylakoid polypeptides, but not of the reaction center II polypeptide D1 unless the thylakoids are presolubilized by octyl beta-D-glucoside (Adir, N., and Ohad, I. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 850, 264-274). The results presented here show that this is a general property of D1 as it can be demonstrated in thylakoids of cyanophytes, Dasicladaceae, green algae, and C3 and C4 plants. Solubilization of the membranes by ionic detergents, deoxycholate, lauryl sucrose, or dodecyl beta-D-maltoside is not effective in inducing cross-linking of the D1 polypeptides by glutaraldehyde. The most effective alkyl glucosides were those with 7-9 carbon alkyl chains. The same behavior toward glutaraldehyde was exhibited by the unprocessed D1 precursor and by the palmitoylated D1 protein. Based on the refractility of the D1 protein to cross-linking reagents, a procedure was developed for its isolation from cross-linked thylakoids by lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isolated D1 retained its behavior toward cross-linking by glutaraldehyde and generated tryptic fragments similar to those obtained following trypsin treatment of intact thylakoids. Denaturation of isolated D1 protein by acetone facilitates cross-linking by glutaraldehyde and extensive degradation by trypsin. The photosystem II polypeptides are differentially cross-linked with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde, the most susceptible being the 28- and 23-kDa components of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a-b protein complex and the core complex 44- and 51-kDa polypeptides, and the least affected being the cytochrome b559, the D2 protein, and a 24-kDa component of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a-b protein complex. These results reflect the relative position and interaction of the photosystem II polypeptides within the complex and suggest that strong and specific hydrophobic interactions may be responsible for the tight and stable conformation of D1. This may be based mostly on the conserved amino acid sequences of D1 and possibly plays a role in the process of D1 integration and removal from the reaction center during its light-dependent turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1660189225,"The subcellular distribution of asparagine:oxo-acid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.14) in rat liver was examined by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. About 30% of the homogenate activity after the removal of the nuclear fraction was recovered in the peroxisomes, about 56% in the mitochondria, and the remainder in the soluble fraction from broken peroxisomes. The mitochondrial asparagine aminotransferase had identical immunological properties with the peroxisomal one. Glucagon injection to rats resulted in the increase of its activity in the mitochondria but not in the peroxisomes. Immunological evidence was obtained that the enzyme was identical with alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (EC 2.6.1.44) which had been reported to be identical with serine:pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51) (Noguchi, T. (1987) in Peroxisomes in Biology and Medicine (Fahimi, H. D., and Sies, H., eds) pp. 234-243, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg). The same results as described above were obtained with mouse liver. All of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 in livers of mammals other than rodents, which cross-react with the antibody against rat liver alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1, had no asparagine aminotransferase activity."

Leucine carrier proteins can be activated with phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas activation does not occur in PC-reconstituted vesicles (Uratani, Y., and Aiyama, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5450-5454). Na+-dependent counterflow was measured at 30 degrees C as reconstituted transport activity. Proteoliposomes containing di(12:0)PE exhibited high counterflow activity at the PC acyl carbon number (n) of 18 and 20 but no or low activity at n = 14, 16, and 22. On the other hand, proteoliposomes containing di(18:1)PE exhibited higher transport activity than those vesicles with di(12:0)PE and corresponding di(n:1)PC. A lipid mixture of di(18:1)PE and di(16:1)PC supported maximal activity. These results show that the leucine transport system of P. aeruginosa is dependent on the lipid acyl chain length and suggest that there exists optimal bilayer thickness for maximal carrier activity."
https://openalex.org/W1499983652,"In mammalian cells, a single major cellular protein (eukaryotic initiation factor 4D) is post-translationally modified by the conversion of a lysine residue into the unusual amino acid hypusine. This modification was reported to occur during mitogen-stimulated growth of lymphocytes but not during quiescence, suggesting that alternative forms of eukaryotic initiation factor 4D might play a role in the regulation of cell growth perhaps through the control of protein synthesis itself (Cooper, H. L., Park, M. H., and Folk, J. E. (1982) Cell 29, 791-797). We took advantage of the drastic changes in translational specificity which occur in heat-shocked cells of Drosophila melanogaster, and of the wide variations in translation rates which occur in response to alterations of growth media in the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to investigate the relationship between the intracellular level and state of modification of the hypusine-containing protein and the rate and specificity of translation. We also studied whether the hypusine residue in this protein might be subject to further modification or reversion to lysine. Under all conditions examined, the protein was remarkably long-lived. Furthermore, the hypusine persists in this protein as hypusine, without further modification or reversion to lysine. Thus, we observe no correlation between the state of cellular translation and the persistence or reversal of this protein's modification. In addition, the data imply that neither are the state of such key cellular processes as DNA replication, RNA transcription, or carbohydrate metabolism so correlated."
https://openalex.org/W1653075023,"A polypeptide of 54-kDa molecular mass (p54) induced by molecularly cloned human interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) in human amnion U cells was characterized biochemically and immunologically. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to p54 was prepared using p54 purified from human amnion U cells as the immunogen. As measured by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine pulse-labeled extracts or by immunoblot analysis of unlabeled extracts, the synthesis of p54 was greatly elevated in three human cell lines treated with IFN-gamma, amnion U, fibroblast GM2767, and fibroblast F153. Moreover, the rabbit anti-p54 polyclonal antibody preparation cross-reacted with cytoskeleton-associated polypeptides prepared from human cells and from sea urchin embryos. By use of a monoclonal antibody probe directed against the common domain of intermediate filaments (anti-intermediate filament antibody), it was established that intermediate filament components are also induced by rIFN-gamma. Anti-p54 polyclonal antibody cross-reacted with anti-intermediate filament antibody-recognized, rIFN-gamma-induced polypeptides. Thus, it appears that p54 may be an IFN-induced cytoskeleton-associated polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1604144810,"In a recent communication (Thompson, J., Curtis, M. A., and Miller, S.P.F. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 522-529) we described the purification and characterization of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine from cells of Streptococcus lactis 133. This unusual amino acid has not previously been found in nature. Radiotracer experiments presented here reveal that exogenous [14C]ornithine serves as the precursor for biosynthesis of [14C]arginine, [14C]N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine, and [14C]N5-acetylornithine by cells of S. lactis K1 during growth in a defined medium lacking arginine. In the absence of both arginine and ornithine, cells of S. lactis K1 can also generate intracellular [14C]N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine from exogenous [14C]glutamic acid. Previously we showed that the properties of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine prepared from S. lactis were identical to one of the two diastereomers [2S, 7S) or (2S, 7R] present in a synthetic preparation of (2S, 7RS)-N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine. The two diastereomers have now been unambiguously synthesized by an Abderhalden-Haase condensation between (2S)-N2-t-butoxycarbonyl-ornithine and the chiral (2S)-, and (2R)-bromopropionates. By 13C-NMR spectroscopy it has been established that the preparation from S. lactis is exclusively (2S, 7S)-N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine. has been demonstrated in a cell-free extract of S. lactis 133. The requirements for ornithine, pyruvic acid, and NAD(P)H suggest that biosynthesis of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine occurs via a reductive condensation mechanism. A general survey revealed that N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine was produced only by certain strains of Group N streptococci. These findings may indicate a plasmid locus for the gene(s) encoding the enzyme(s) for N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1536936216,"Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) is a good substrate for cholera toxin in comparison with the angiotensin peptides. Because kemptide contains two potential ADP-ribosylation sites and, is also a good substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, it was possible to gain some insight into factors influencing the specificity of cholera toxin and to study the relationship between phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation. The ADP-ribosylated products of kemptide were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by peptide sequence analysis, trypsin digestion, and fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The major product is mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated preferentially on the first arginyl residue and some mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation was observed to occur on the second arginine. The minor product is di(ADP-ribosyl)ated. The Km and Vmax for mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of kemptide are approximately 4.3 +/- 1.2 mM and 38.1 +/- 5.5 nmol min-1 mg-1, respectively. Phosphorylated seryl residue of kemptide suppresses ADP-ribosylation of the arginyl residues by cholera toxin. Mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated kemptide is a poor substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in comparison with kemptide. Di(ADP-ribosyl)ated kemptide is not phosphorylated at all. These results suggest that a mere exposure of an arginyl residue in peptides is not a sufficient condition for effective ADP-ribosylation and that a relationship exists between ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation."

In 10 mM Tris, pH 8, the middle molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-M) has a sedimentation coefficient, S20,w, of 2.6 S. Sedimentation equilibrium data shows considerable nonideality; extrapolation to infinite dilution and correction for the primary charge effect yield a molecular weight of 1.09 X 10(5), indicative of a monomeric structure. When the ionic strength was increased, the sedimentation coefficient increased slightly, and the protein began to form larger aggregates. Reconstitution of short intermediate filaments was observed upon dialysis of denatured NF-M versus a reconstitution buffer. A circular dichroism spectrum of NF-M in 10 mM Tris was typical of alpha + beta proteins. High molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H) showed a considerable tendency to aggregate in 10 mM Tris, but a principal species with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.2 S was observed, and sedimentation equilibrium data also suggest a monomeric structure."

DFMO is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the initial enzyme in the production of polyamines. A 7 x 7 cm rat abdominal skin flap was surgically raised based on two inferior epigastric nerve, artery, and vein pedicles. One of the pedicles was then ligated and the skin was sutured back in place. Necrosis of skin was assessed 2 and 7 days after surgery. The rats were divided into four groups: control, DFMO, DFMO + polyamines, and polyamines alone. DFMO was administered in drinking water at 0.2%. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) were each administered by daily i.p. injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The percentage of necrosis of the area of skin at risk in controls was 65 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM). Necrosis was significantly reduced with DFMO (19 +/- 1%), with DFMO plus polyamines (37 +/- 3%), or with polyamines alone (41 +/- 2%). Protein synthesis and ornithine decarboxylase activity in the skin were both significantly decreased by DFMO. These studies demonstrate that DFMO protects skin from ischemic damage at least in part through actions on polyamine metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1568043076,"beta-Lactamases of all three classes, A, B, and C, are inactivated by phenylpropynal and p-nitrophenylpropynal. The inactivation of RTEM-2 beta-lactamase and of Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I is accelerated in the presence of A type substrates such as dicloxacillin, quinacillin, and cefoxitin, which are thought to expand or loosen the conformation of these enzymes. In the presence and absence of cefoxitin the inactivation of the RTEM-2 beta-lactamase is first and second order, respectively, in phenylpropynal concentration. The additional phenylpropynal molecule in the latter case may serve the same function as cefoxitin, viz. catalyze access to sensitive functional groups. Correlation of the loss of activity of the RTEM-2 enzyme with the extent of modification suggests that the modification of any one of about four kinetically equivalent groups leads to inactivation. Modification of all of the above mentioned enzymes leads to formation of a characteristic chromophore of unusual stability to nucleophiles, which absorbs maximally between 315 and 320 nm. A consideration of the properties of model compounds demonstrated that the protein-bound chromophore is that of a 1-phenyl-3-imino-1-propen-1-ammonium ion (Formula: see text), formed by reaction of phenylpropynal with two enzymic amine groups, and thus cross-linking the enzyme intramolecularly. Phenylpropynal may be a convenient general reagent for rapid and stable intramolecular cross-linking of proteins through lysine."
