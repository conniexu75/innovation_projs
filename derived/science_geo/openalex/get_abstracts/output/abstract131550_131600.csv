https://openalex.org/W1988212011,"Platelets represent an important linkage between inflammation, thrombosis, and atherogenesis. Inflammation is characterized by interactions among platelets, leukocytes, and ECs. These interactions trigger autocrine and paracrine activation processes that lead to leukocyte recruitment into the vascular wall. Platelet-induced chronic inflammatory processes at the vascular wall result in development of atherosclerotic lesions and atherothrombosis. This Review highlights the molecular machinery and inflammatory pathways used by platelets to initiate and accelerate atherothrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2091179088,"Signal transduction across cell membranes often involves the activation of both phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a substrate for both enzymes, is converted to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) by the action of PI 3-kinase. Here, we show that PI(3,4,5)P3 activates purified PLC-γ isozymes by interacting with their Src homology 2 domains. Furthermore, the expression of an activated catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase in COS-7 cells resulted in an increase in inositol phosphate formation, whereas platelet-derived growth factor-induced PLC activation in NIH 3T3 cells was markedly inhibited by the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. These results suggest that receptors coupled to PI 3-kinase may activate PLC-γ isozymes indirectly, in the absence of PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation, through the generation of PI(3,4,5)P3."
https://openalex.org/W2037669016,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) utilizes a G-protein-coupled receptor to activate the small GTP-binding protein Rho and to induce rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We studied the signal transduction from LPA receptors to Rho activation. Analysis of the G-protein-coupling pattern of LPA receptors by labeling activated G-proteins with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide revealed interaction with proteins of the Gq, Gi, and G12 subfamilies. We could show that in COS-7 cells, expression of GTPase-deficient mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 triggered Rho activation as measured by increased Rho-GTP levels. In Swiss 3T3 cells, incubation with LPA or microinjection of constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 induced formation of actin stress fibers and assembly of focal adhesions in a Rho-dependent manner. Interestingly, the LPA-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization was suppressed by microinjected antibodies directed against Gα13, whereas Gα12-specific antibodies showed no inhibition. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A 25 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-specific tyrphostin AG 1478 completely blocked actin stress fiber formation caused by LPA or activated Gα13 but not the effects of activated Gα12. Also, expression of the dominant negative EGF receptor mutant EGFR-CD533 markedly prevented the LPA- and Gα13-induced actin polymerization. Coexpression of EGFR-CD533 and activated Gα13 in COS-7 cells resulted in decreased Rho-GTP levels compared with expression of activated Gα13 alone. These data indicate that in Swiss 3T3 cells, G13 but not G12 is involved in the LPA-induced activation of Rho. Moreover, our results suggest an involvement of the EGF receptor in this pathway.

Upon stimulation, a number of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors initiate cellular responses involving small GTP-binding proteins. For instance, the water-soluble phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; G-protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein; PTX, pertussis toxin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; G-protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein; PTX, pertussis toxin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. binds to a G-protein-coupled heptahelical receptor (1Guo Z.

In fibroblasts, LPA lowers cAMP levels in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner, suggesting the coupling of the LPA receptor to G-proteins of the Gi subfamily (5Van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). LPA-induced activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade also occurs in a PTX-sensitive fashion (3Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In contrast, in a large variety of cells, the stimulation of phospholipase C induced by LPA was shown to be PTX-insensitive (9Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), suggesting a coupling of the LPA receptor to members of the Gq subfamily. In addition to these pathways, LPA induces the Rho-dependent formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (4Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar, 10Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A tyrosine kinase has been implicated in the LPA-induced Rho stimulation, since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A 25 blocks the effects of LPA but not of microinjected Rho on actin polymerization (11Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the G-proteins coupling the LPA receptor to Rho activation have not been specified. LPA-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations are PTX-insensitive and therefore presumably not transmitted via Gi subfamily members (12Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Gq proteins are apparently not involved in this pathway, because neither the activation of protein kinase C nor mobilization of intracellular calcium or expression of a GTPase-deficient mutant of Gαq induces the formation of actin stress fibers or focal adhesions (12Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Interestingly, microinjection of constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 into Swiss 3T3 cells triggers actin polymerization in a Rho-dependent manner (13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N.

In the present study, we determined the G-protein coupling pattern of the LPA receptor in membrane preparations and characterized the pathway leading from LPA receptor activation to stress fiber formation in intact cells. We report direct coupling of the LPA receptor to proteins of the G12, Gq, and Gi subfamilies. Furthermore, our data suggest that in intact cells G13 but not G12 mediates LPA-induced Rho activation involving the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Swiss 3T3 cells, kindly provided by Dr. Alan Hall (London), and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To obtain quiescent and serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells, cultures were rinsed three times in serum-free DMEM and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 25% Ham's F-12, 0.2% NaHCO3, 10 mm Na-Hepes, and 0.1% fetal bovine serum (modified DMEM) for 24 h followed by an incubation in modified DMEM without fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Membranes were prepared from subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells. Cells were rinsed and scraped in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. The pelleted cells were resuspended in the buffer described above devoid of NaCl but containing 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were disrupted by forcing the suspension 10 times through a 26-gauge needle. Undisrupted cells were pelleted (750 × g, 2 min), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended and stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunological detection of G-proteins, SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide separating gels was employed. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described (16Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Spicher K. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The subtype specific antisera AS 232 and AS 233 (anti-α12); AS 343, AS 342, and AS 272 (anti-α13); AS 369 (anti-αq/11), and AS 266 (anti-αi) were characterized previously (17Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Söling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Antisera against Gα12 were incubated with the peptides (10 μg/ml) used for their generation, as published elsewhere (17Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Söling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Harteneck C. Leopoldt D. Exner T. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Detection of filter-bound proteins was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system purchased from Amersham (19Harhammer R. Gohla A. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Synthesis of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide from [α-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products) was performed according to published protocols (20Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 286-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For photolabeling of Gα subunits, sedimented Swiss 3T3 membranes (200 μg of protein/tube) were preincubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm LPA at 30 °C, followed by the addition of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide (3 μCi/tube; specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C for different times: 3 min for Gαi, 10 min for Gαq/11, and 30 min for Gα12 and Gα13 (18Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Harteneck C. Leopoldt D. Exner T. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Samples were irradiated for 15 s at 4 °C with a 254-nm UV lamp. Photolabeled membranes were pelleted and solubilized in 40 μl of 4% SDS (w/v) at room temperature, followed by the addition of precipitating buffer (280 μl) containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate (w/v), 1% Nonidet P-40 (w/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The antisera (20 μl) AS 369 for Gαq/11, AS 233 for Gα12, AS 343 for Gα13, and AS 266 for Gαi were added to the supernatants followed by constant rotation of the samples for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (7 μg) were added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times, boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were subsequently dried and analyzed using autoradiography. For transfection experiments, 1.2 × 105COS-7 cells were plated in 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes, grown overnight, and subsequently serum-starved for 18 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 12 μg of DNA mixed with 60 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 6 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added. In cotransfection experiments with two different plasmids, 6 μg of each plasmid were added. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementing with DNA from a vector encoding β-galactosidase. Twelve h after transfection, COS-7 cell transfectants were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.4 mCi/ml for 4 h) in phosphate-free Eagle's minimum essential medium. Cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm benzamidine, leupeptin-aprotinin-soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Nuclei and cellular debris were sedimented, and NaCl was added to lysates at a final concentration of 500 mm. After preclearing for 30 min with 8 μg of protein A-Sepharose, samples were incubated with 4 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-Rho A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with 15 μg of protein A-Sepharose for 90 min. The beads were washed eight times in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.005% SDS. Nucleotides were eluted in 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm GTP, and 0.5 mm GDP for 20 min at 68 °C and separated by thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneiminecellulose plates (Merck) run in 1 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4. The positions of unlabeled GDP and GTP standards on the plates were visualized under 254-nm UV light. Quantitations of radiolabeled nucleotides were performed with phosphoimaging (Fuji BAS 1500). For microinjection studies, quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells (approximately 103cells/mm2) plated on glass coverslips marked with squares to facilitate the localization of injected cells were used. The cDNAs of Gα12 (Q229L; Gα12QL), Gα13 (Q226L; Gα13QL), and Gαq(R183C; GαqRC), carried by the cytomegalovirus promotor-containing vector pCis, Gα11 (Q209L; Gα11QL) cloned in pZeo, and empty vector controls, were applied for microinjection. Plasmids were microinjected into the nucleus alone or with Texas red-coupled dextran (5 mg/ml, Molecular Probes) to visualize injected cells. Clostridium botulinumC3 toxin was co-microinjected with the cDNAs described above at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. After microinjection, the cells were returned to the incubator for a further 90 min until fixation. As indicated, cells were treated with tyrphostin A 25 (150 μm), tyrphostin A 1 (150 μm), or genistein (30 μg/ml) for 60 min. Tyrphostin AG 1478 (1 μm) or tyrphostin AG 1296 (10 μm) were added 120 min before fixation. To study cytoskeletal effects of extracellular factors, cells were incubated with LPA (0.3 μm), thrombin (40 ng/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), or bombesin (10 nm) for 10 min. The phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (100 μm) was added to serum-starved cells 25 min before fixation. Antibodies against Gα subunits were diluted and microinjected into the cytosol of cells followed by an incubation period of 60 min. The dominant negative EGF receptor mutant EGFR-CD533 carried by the pRK5 vector was expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells by nuclear microinjection. About 100 cells/field were injected in each case using a manual injection system (Eppendorf). Needles were pulled from capillaries with a horizontal micropipette puller (Sutter). Microinjected or growth factor-treated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. For localization of actin filaments, cells were stained with 0.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin (Sigma) for 40 min. Vinculin was detected after blocking with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 30 min, followed by incubation with a monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (VIN-11–5; Sigma) for 60 min. Subsequently, cells were labeled with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) for 45 min. Antibody incubations were performed at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and examined on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100). To characterize the G-protein coupling pattern of the LPA receptor in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we first determined the expression of different PTX-insensitive Gα subunits in these cells by performing immunoblot experiments with subtype-specific antibodies. Immunoblotting of membrane proteins with an antibody specific for Gαq/11(AS 369) identified the expression of the corresponding 42-kDa proteins (Fig. 1, lane 1). Antisera raised against a C-terminal peptide of Gα12 (AS 232, AS 233) recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, these antisera cross-reacted with several unknown proteins of higher and lower molecular masses that had not been detected in rodent and nonrodent brain membranes (17Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Söling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To assure the specificity of AS 232 and AS 233, which have been extensively characterized (17Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Söling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Harteneck C. Leopoldt D. Exner T. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we performed peptide competition experiments. Upon preincubation with the peptide used for their generation, the detection of Gα12was abolished (data not shown). Immunoblotting of membranes with an antiserum specific for Gα13 (AS 343) recognized a protein of approximately 43 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4). These experiments indicate the expression of both Gα12 and Gα13 in Swiss 3T3 cell membranes. In previous studies, interactions of the LPA receptor with G-proteins of the Gi and Gq subfamilies were postulated mainly from experiments showing the existence of PTX-sensitive as well as PTX-insensitive cellular effects of LPA (9Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). To directly show the LPA-mediated activation of G-proteins, membranes of subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells were photolabeled with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide in the presence or absence of LPA. G-protein Gα subunits were subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-αq/11 (AS 369), anti-α12 (AS 233), anti-α13 (AS 343), or anti-αi (AS 266) antisera and visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 2 shows that stimulation of membranes with 10 μm LPA induced an incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide into Gα subunits of Gq/11, G12, G13, and Gi proteins. For studying [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation into Gα12 and Gα13, the experiments were performed with prolonged incubation times of 30 min, whereas an agonist-induced activation of Gαi was only observed with short incubation times, reflecting the substantial basal guanine nucleotide turnover of Gi proteins. No increased incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide into Gα12 or Gα13 was found using lower concentrations of LPA (e.g. 1 μm). Expression of constitutively active mutants of G12subfamily members has been reported to induce a Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells (13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To further characterize the functional role of G12 and G13 in LPA-induced and Rho-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, we first expressed constitutively active mutants of Gα12 (Gα12 Q229L; Gα12QL) and Gα13 (Gα13 Q226L; Gα13QL) in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts by microinjecting expression plasmids into quiescent cells. Both Gα subunits stimulated the formation of actin stress fibers, whereas GTPase-deficient forms of Gαq (Gαq R183C; Gαq RC) and Gα11 (Gα11 Q209L; Gα11 QL) were unable to induce stress fiber formation (Fig. 3). The expression of Gα12QL and Gα13QL was also accompanied by the formation of vinculin-containing spots with a characteristically elongated, arrowhead shape typical of Rho-induced assembly of focal adhesions (22Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were not observed upon microinjection of plasmids encoding GαqRC and Gα11QL (Fig. 3). The dependence of Gα12QL- and Gα13QL-mediated cytoskeletal effects on stimulation of Rho activity could be demonstrated employing purified recombinant C3 exoenzyme from C. botulinum (13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). C3 exoenzyme has been shown to inhibit the isoforms of Rho but no other members of the Rho family (21Aktories K. Braun U. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-microinjection of C3 exoenzyme (100 μg/ml) abolished the actin stress fiber formation induced by Gα12QL and Gα13QL (Fig. 4). Likewise, focal adhesion assembly caused by both activated Gα subunits was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme (data not shown). These results confirm that G12 and G13 are able to trigger Rho-dependent effects in Swiss 3T3 cells, whereas cytoskeletal remodeling typical of an activation of Cdc42 or Rac,i.e. formation of filopodia or membrane ruffles (23Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar,24Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar), was not observed. Interestingly, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (100 μm), which has previously been shown to stimulate Rho in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (11Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also induced a selective formation of actin stress fibers without membrane ruffling or formation of filopodia (not shown). To test G12subfamily-induced Rho activation biochemically, we transiently overexpressed Gα12QL and Gα13QL in COS-7 cells and analyzed the incorporation of radioactive nucleotides in Rho A. Expression of activated Gα12 and Gα13, but not of the β-galactosidase control, caused an accumulation of Rho-bound radioactive GTP. The ratio of bound GTP to total nucleotides bound to Rho [(GTP/GTP + GDP) × 100] was 22 ± 0.57% for the lacZ control, 28.75 ± 0.92% for Gα12QL, and 35.7 ± 4.1% for Gα13QL (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that expression of Gα12QL and Gα13QL leads to an activation of Rho.Figure 4Botulinum C3 exoenzyme abolishes the cytoskeletal effects induced by constitutively active Gα12, Gα13, and LPA. Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with LPA (200 ng/ml) or microinjected with expression plasmids (100 ng/μl) encoding Gα12(Q229L) or Gα13 (Q226L). Cells in the right panel were co-microinjected with botulinum C3 exoenzyme (100 μg/ml).

Actin stress fiber formation caused by LPA at a concentration of 0.3 μm was suppressed by application of Gα13-specific antiserum AS 343 (dilution of 1:50), whereas microinjection of the corresponding preimmune serum failed to influence LPA-induced cytoskeletal effects. Inhibition of LPA-induced stress fiber formation was also obtained using other Gα13-specific antisera, i.e. AS 342 and AS 272 (not shown). Surprisingly, the Gα12-specific antisera (AS 232, AS 233) did not inhibit the LPA-induced actin polymerization using dilutions of 1:1 to 1:50 (Fig. 6). The application of antibodies against Gαq/11 (AS 369) showed no effects on cytoskeletal reorganisation caused by LPA. These results suggest that in intact Swiss 3T3 cells, LPA-induced Rho stimulation may be mediated by G13 but not by G12. Since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A 25 has been shown to block stress fiber formation evoked by LPA, but not by microinjected Rho protein, an involvement of a tyrosine kinase acting upstream of Rho in the pathway of LPA-induced Rho activation appears to be likely (11Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further study the mechanism whereby G13 mediates the LPA-induced activation of Rho, we investigated effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on cytoskeletal changes induced by different stimuli. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 A, tyrphostin A 25 (150 μm) completely inhibited stress fiber formation induced by LPA and Gα13QL (100 ng/μl of cDNA) but not the cytoskeletal effects of Gα12QL (100 ng/μl of cDNA), further confirming the notion that LPA signals via G13 to Rho. Focal adhesion assembly caused by LPA or Gα13QL was also blocked by incubation with tyrphostin A 25, whereas focal adhesions induced by Gα12QL were not influenced by this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig. 7 B). To exclude that these differences in tyrphostin sensitivity were results of different expression levels of Gα12QL and Gα13QL, we studied cytoskeletal effects caused by various concentrations of expression plasmids. Cytoskeletal effects of Gα13QL induced by injection of up to 1 μg/μl of cDNA were abolished by tyrphostin A 25. However, Gα12QL-induced submaximal stress fiber formation after microinjection of 10 ng/μl of cDNA was tyrphostin A 25-insensitive. Unlike tyrphostin A 25, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (30 μg/ml), which has previously been shown to act downstream of Rho (12Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), blocked the formation of actin stress fibers induced by LPA, Gα13QL, and Gα12QL (Fig. 7 A). The biologically inactive tyrphostin A 1 (150 μm) showed no effects on cytoskeletal changes caused by LPA or the activated Gα subunits (data not shown). Using more specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, we found that 1 μm EGF receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 1478 (25Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) completely blocked both the LPA- and Gα13QL-induced formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 8). Lower concentrations of tyrphostin AG 1478 (e.g. 250 or 500 nm) partially suppressed actin polymerization caused by Gα13QL. Cytoskeletal effects caused by Gα12QL were not influenced by this tyrphostin at concentrations of up to 20 μm. Tyrphostin AG 1296 (10 μm), a selective platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, failed to affect stress fiber formation induced by LPA and Gα13QL or by Gα12QL (Fig. 8). Actin stress fiber formation caused by orthovanadate was also inhibited by tyrphostin A 25 and tyrphostin AG 1478 but not by tyrphostin AG 1296 (data not shown).Figure 8Inhibition of G13-mediated Rho activation by tyrphostin AG 1478. Actin stress fiber formation is shown in Swiss 3T3 cells treated with LPA (0.3 μm) or injected with plasmids encoding constitutively active Gα12 or Gα13. As indicated, cells were incubated with tyrphostin AG 1478 (1 μm), tyrphostin AG 1296 (10 μm), or buffer (control). Actin cytoskeleton was visualized by staining of fixed cells with FITC-phalloidin. Cells from one of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibitory effects observed with tyrphostins suggested a participation of the EGF receptor in Gα13QL-induced Rho activation. Therefore, we expressed an EGF receptor mutant lacking 533 C-terminal amino acids (EGFR-CD533) in Swiss 3T3 cells by microinjection. It has been shown that this mutant exerts a dominant negative function on EGF receptor signaling by formation of signaling-incompetent heterodimers with the wild type receptor (26Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 shows that expression of the truncated receptor markedly suppressed actin stress fiber formation caused by LPA or by Gα13QL. In agreement with the tyrphostin data shown above, Gα12QL-induced actin polymerization was not inhibited by expression of EGFR-CD533. Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative EGF receptor mutant also abolished the cytoskeletal effects caused by orthovanadate (Fig. 9). To assess a role for the EGF receptor in Gα13-mediated Rho activation, we transiently coexpressed Gα13QL and EGFR-CD533 in COS-7 cells and determined the activation state of Rho by analyzing Rho-bound nucleotides. Fig. 10 demonstrates that the Gα13QL-induced Rho-GTP accumulation was attenuated by co-expression of the mutated EGF receptor. The ratio of bound GTP to total nucleotides bound to Rho [(GTP/GTP + GDP) × 100] was 17.8 ± 1.9% for the lacZ control, 25.8 ± 0.2% for the coexpression of Gα13QL with lacZ, and 22.5 ± 0.1% for the coexpression of Gα13QL with EGFR-CD533. This demonstrates that the dominant negative EGF receptor (EGFR-CD533) was able to inhibit Gα13-induced activation of Rho. The expression of EGFR-CD533 with lacZ did not affect basal Rho-GTP levels compared with lacZ (not shown). These data clearly suggest the EGF receptor as a critical component in the pathway leading from Gα13 to Rho activation.Figure 10Reduction of Gα13-induced Rho activation after expression of the dominant negative EGF receptor mutant EGFR-CD533. COS-7 cells were transfected with either lacZ alone or Gα13QL/lacZ or Gα13QL/EGFR-CD533. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h, and RhoA was immunoprecipitated from the lysates.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated the existence of high affinity, guanine nucleotide-sensitive binding sites for LPA in membranes prepared from Swiss 3T3 cells and rat brains (27Thomson F.J. Perkins L. Ahern D. Clark M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 718-723PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the cloning of LPA receptors from neuronal cells and Xenopus oocytes has been described (1Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). It has been suggested from experiments using PTX that some cellular effects of LPA are mediated by G-proteins belonging to Gi or Gq subfamilies (9Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The signaling cascade coupling the LPA receptor to an activation of Rho and subsequent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton leading to stress fiber formation has, however, remained unclear. Results from previous studies indicated that LPA-induced Rho signaling is PTX-insensitive and that constitutively activated Gαq subunits are not able to stimulate Rho, excluding Gi and Gq proteins from this pathway (9Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 has been shown to trigger Rho-mediated stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells (13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the involvement of G12 subfamily proteins in the pathway from LPA receptor to stimulation of Rho/stress fiber formation. Activated G12 and G13 induced Rho-mediated stress fiber formation (see Fig. 3; Ref. 13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate activation of Rho by constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 (see Fig. 5). In photolabeling experiments, both members of the G12subfamily appeared to interact with the LPA receptor; however, in intact cells, only G13, but not G12, mediated signaling from LPA receptor to Rho. This was suggested by discriminating effects of microinjected subtype-specific antibodies, by differences in tyrphostin sensitivity, and by the different requirement of EGF receptor function in LPA and Gα13QL-versus Gα12QL-induced Rho activation (see below). These data led us to identify G13 as a mediator from LPA receptors to Rho. A likely explanation for the observed discrepancy between the photoaffinity assay and microinjection/Rho activation studies is that photolabeling studies had to be performed employing a high concentration of LPA (10 μm), whereas a significantly lower concentration of 0.3 μm LPA was sufficient to induce maximum Rho activation in live Swiss 3T3 cells. Moreover, our data suggest that selectivity in receptor signaling is often found to be higher in intact complex systems than in in vitro assays. Similar conclusions may be deducible from the specificity of Gβγ dimers in signaling pathways, since studies with antisense oligonucleotides performed in intact cells revealed a higher selectivity than biochemical assays using purified components (28Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Kalkbrenner F. Degtiar V. Schenker M. Brendel S. Zobel A.

Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The identification of G13 as signal transducer from LPA receptor to Rho may suggest that other agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors that induce effects on the actin cytoskeleton may also act via G13 and/or G12. Previously, Nobes et al. (11Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated the existence of a protein-tyrosine kinase acting in the LPA pathway upstream of Rho. One major finding of the present study is that LPA- as well as Gα13QL-induced effects on the actin cytoskeleton can be blocked with tyrphostins, suggesting that a tyrosine kinase activity is required for the signaling from G13 to Rho. Although an inhibition of GTPase activity of transducin by tyrphostin A 25 has been reported (32Wolbring G. Hollenberg M.D. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22470-22472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it appears unlikely that the suppression of Gα13QL-induced Rho activation by this inhibitor might be a result of nonspecific interactions between tyrphostin A 25 and the G-protein, since GTPase-deficient mutants of Gα subunits were used. Furthermore, also the specific EGF receptor inhibitor tyrphostin AG 1478 blocked the effects. The implication of EGF receptor kinase activity in the LPA/Gα13QL-induced, Rho-dependent stress fiber formation was substantiated by the expression of a dominant negative EGF receptor mutant in Swiss 3T3 cells. In addition, Gα13-induced Rho-GTP accumulation was at least partially reversed after overexpression of the truncated EGF receptor mutant. Recently, several G-protein-coupled receptors have been reported to induce a ligand-independent activation of the EGF or platelet-derived growth factor receptor with subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, and an involvement of Gi-type G-proteins in this transactivation pathway has been suggested (33Linseman D.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, neither active Gαi nor Gβγ dimers lead to a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (13Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Our data suggest an involvement of the receptor tyrosine kinase EGF receptor in the pathway of G13-mediated actin stress fiber formation. The presumably complex mechanism whereby the EGF receptor influences signaling mediated by activated Gα13 has yet to be resolved. Using serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with LPA, we found neither a coimmunoprecipitation of Gα13with the EGF receptor or with a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family nor a tyrosine phosphorylation of Gα13, arguing against the possibility of a direct interaction between Gα13 and a tyrosine kinase. 2A. Gohla and R. Harhammer, unpublished results. On the other hand, strong similarities were observed between cytoskeletal events induced by LPA or Gα13QL and those caused by orthovanadate, pointing to the possibility that activated Gα13 may cause a ligand-independent stimulation of the EGF receptor by interacting with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. The identification of a putative receptor tyrosine kinase/phosphatase cycle controlling the communication between activated G13 and Rho is under current investigation. Taken together, our data indicate that G13 couples the LPA receptor to Rho activation in Swiss 3T3 cells. In addition, we provide evidence for an involvement of the EGF receptor in the pathway leading from G13 to Rho activation/stress fiber formation.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2631-2640PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that one role of this complex is to effect the conversion of pol IIA to pol II0 thereby releasing pol II from the initiation complex. Finally, CTD phosphatase is required to dephosphorylate pol II0 thus completing the CTD phosphorylation cycle (46Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Transcription of some promoters in vitro and in vivo does not require the CTD (30Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, CTD phosphorylation can be inhibited without blocking activated transcription in vitro (49Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 51Jiang Y. Gralla J.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4654-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that deleting the CTD or blocking CTD phosphorylation by Kin28p does not alter the synthesis of promoter proximal transcripts. Thus, at least for some promoters, transcription initiation can occur in the absence of a CTD or a CTD phosphorylation cycle. Finally, hyperphosphorylation of the CTD does not correlate with pol II's transcriptional activity in vivo (54Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Another complication in understanding the role of CTD phosphorylation is the multiplicity of CTD kinases and the diversity of possible phosphate acceptors in the CTD (8Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although in vivo CTD phosphorylation sites have not been mapped, the in vitrotargets of several serine/threonine-specific CTD kinases have been determined. Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates both serine 2 and serine 5 (22Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the TFIIH-associated CTD kinase (Cdk7/cyclin H) phosphorylates serine 5 (25Gebara M. Sayre M.H. Corden J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CTD kinases induced by heat shock or arsenite also preferentially phosphorylate serine 5 (55Trigon S. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13091-13098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence indicates that the roles of serines in positions 2 and 5 are different. First, partial substitutions of serines in either position 2 or 5 have different effects on viability (26West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, mutations inSRB genes suppress position 2 substitutions but not position 5 substitutions (56Yuryev A. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the differences in CTD kinase specificity, these results suggest that pol II0 may be a collection of different phosphoisomers. In this paper we describe the results of experiments testing the interaction specificity of different anti-pol II mAbs for a set of phosphorylated CTD binding sites. These mAbs were isolated in screens for antibodies directed against proteins involved in a range of different cell functions (17Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X.Y. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L.

We show here that each of these antibodies is capable of recognizing wild-type heptapeptide repeats phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase. The specificities of the different antibodies for mutant CTDs are different, however, indicating that they recognize different phosphoepitopes. Nutritional stress and heat shock result in higher levels of serine 2 phosphorylation suggesting that the serine 2 and serine 5 phosphoepitopes are functionally different. In an earlier study we described the construction and characterization of a set of CTD phosphorylation site substitution mutations (26West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations focus on serines in positions 2 and 5 of the consensus heptapeptide YSPTSPS which were shown to be phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase (22Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each reconstructed CTD consists of multiple wild-type or mutant heptapeptide repeats and a 9-amino acid epitope derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene that is recognized by mAb 12CA5 (62Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The mutant yeast CTD sequences were excised and cloned into the pGEX2 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) allowing the expression of glutathioneS-transferase-CTD fusions in Escherichia coli(Fig. 1 A). We have also expressed the mammalian CTD as a GST fusion protein. The plasmid expressing this protein was a gift of Dr. David Bentley (Amgen Institute, Toronto). E. coli (DH5α) strains expressing GST-CTD fusion proteins were grown overnight to saturation. Cultures were diluted 10-fold in fresh L broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 1 h before addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm. After 4 h of induced expression cells were collected by centrifugation and sonicated, and the fusion protein was purified by glutathione-agarose (Pharmacia) affinity chromatography as described (64Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M.E.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 16.7.1-16.7.7Google Scholar). Purified GST fusions containing 16 copies of the wild-type heptapeptide YSPTSPS, 18 copies of YSPTEPS, 15 copies of YESPTSP, 15 copies of YSPTAPS, or 12 copies of YAPTSPS were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and stained with Coomassie Blue dye (Fig. 1 B). CTD fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro with baculovirus-expressed epitope-tagged Cdc2 kinase (65Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as described previously for RNA pol II (25Gebara M. Sayre M.H. Corden J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but with minor modifications. For each phosphorylation reaction, 10 μl of Cdc2 kinase-bound 12CA5 Affi-Gel beads (∼5 μg of Cdc2 kinase) were incubated with 2.5 μg of fusion protein in 60 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. For labeling, the reaction was pulsed with 20 μCi of [γ-32P-]ATP for 5 min and then chased with 1 mm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated GST-CTD fusion protein was removed from the beads by spinning the supernatant through a bovine serum albumin-treated filter (UFC3 OHV 00; Millipore). The level of phosphorylation was assessed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel followed by direct autoradiography. Phosphorylation of the mouse CTD fusion protein with c-ABL kinase was essentially as described (23Baskaran R. Dahmus M.E. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). mAb 8WG16 is an anti-CTD IgG described by Thompson et al. (66Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol.

Schulte and B. M. Sefton, submitted for publication. mAb CC-3 is an IgG isolated in a screen for chicken proteins with developmentally regulated expression (60Thibodeau A. Vincent M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). mAb B3 is an IgM directed against nuclear matrix components (17Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X.Y. Nakayasu H. Du L.

An overnight culture ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae YPH499 (ATCC 76625) was used to inoculate YEPD (2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract) to anA600 of 0.2. Aliquots (50 ml) were withdrawn at intervals of 2 h and cells harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min. The yeast cell pellet was washed in ice-cold water and stored at −80 °C. Cells were suspended in 200 μl of buffer A (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 320 mmammonium sulfate, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmEGTA, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm pepstatin, 0.6 mm leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine HCl). Acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) were added to the meniscus and vortexed 10 times for 10 s with 30-s intervals on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE analysis. The high ionic strength of the grinding buffer allows extraction of almost all of the pol II in the cell. We see no difference when cells are extracted in denaturing buffer (not shown). Yeast cells (YPH499) were grown at 30 °C for 7 h after inoculation (starting A600 = 0.2). The culture was diluted 1:1 with fresh medium pre-warmed to 55 °C and then maintained at 39 °C for the indicated times. Control cells were diluted 1:1 using fresh medium at room temperature and then incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. The heat shock response was terminated by further diluting the culture (1:1) with ice-cold water. The cells were harvested and the extract prepared as described above. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated CTD fusion proteins (250 ng) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose paper (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were probed with mAb tissue culture supernatants at a dilution of 1:10 (12CA5, 8WG16, H5, and H14) or ascites fluid at a dilution of 1:1000 (CC3 and B3). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using either anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Corp.) or anti-mouse IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:4000. Supersignal substrate (Pierce) was used to illuminate the reactive bands. To ensure that all proteins transferred efficiently, blots probed with anti-phospho-CTD antibodies were stripped and reprobed with mAb 12CA5 which recognizes an epitope present in each fusion protein. In each case all lanes contained 12CA5 immunoreactive bands. Fig. 1 shows the purified GST-CTD fusion proteins used in this study. From examination of the relative mobility of these proteins (Fig. 1 B), it is obvious that the sequence of the unphosphorylated heptapeptide repeat confers aberrant mobility. In particular, glutamate substitution at position 5 seems to increase mobility, whereas glutamate at position 2 results in a marked retardation. The physical basis of this difference is likely due to differences in the ability of SDS to bind to these mutant proteins (22Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these fusion proteins with Cdc2 kinase results in similar levels of phosphorylation of all proteins with the exception of the E5 mutant (Fig. 1 C). The top panel of Fig. 2 shows that phosphorylation causes additional shifts in electrophoretic mobility of these proteins in SDS-PAGE. mAb 12CA5 was used to detect the fusion proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). The lower intensity of some phosphorylated species indicates that phosphorylation may alter the binding of mAb 12CA5. For the wild-type and alanine-substituted proteins phosphorylation causes a marked retardation in mobility, much as seen with pol II0 in vivo. Phosphorylation of the CTD with glutamate in position 2 causes an increase in mobility. This result suggests that little if any SDS is bound to the unphosphorylated mutant CTD, and phosphorylation thus causes an increase in the charge to mass ratio of the fusion protein in SDS. Phosphorylation of the E5 mutant causes no change in mobility, a result which may be due to the fact that E5 is a poor substrate for Cdc2 phosphorylation as seen in experiments using [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1 C). From the >10-fold molar excess of kinase to substrate used in the phosphorylation reaction and the resulting mobility shift on substrates other than E5, we conclude that the CTD is maximally phosphorylated on serines 2 and 5, the known Cdc2 kinase target sites (22Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mAb 8WG16 was raised against wheat germ RNA polymerase II and found to recognize epitopes conserved among the CTDs of pol IIs derived from a variety of different eucaryotes (66Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2nd panel in Fig. 2 shows that mAb 8WG16 recognizes primarily unphosphorylated CTD. Unphosphorylated WT, A5, and E5 interact more strongly than unphosphorylated E2, A2, and phosphorylated A5 and E5. The failure to bind unphosphorylated E2 and weak interaction with unphosphorylated A2 suggests that serine 2 (S2) is an important feature of the 8WG16 epitope. Weak binding to phosphorylated A5 and E5 could mean that position 5 partially overlaps the 8WG16 recognition site. Alternatively, mutation of S5 could interfere with phosphorylation of S2 yielding more unphosphorylated S2 sites and thus partial reactivity with 8WG16. The remainder of the mAbs tested bind only to phosphorylated CTD (Fig. 2). With the exception of B3, the strongest binding is to the phosphorylated WT sequence. From previous studies we know that Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates the consensus heptapeptide repeat on both S2 and S5 (22Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to phosphorylated mutant CTD targets reveals interesting differences in the specificities of the different mAbs. mAb H14 recognizes both phosphorylated A2 and E2 but not A5 or E5. This result indicates that H14 recognizes phosphorylated S5. In contrast, mAb H5 recognizes phosphorylated A5 suggesting that phosphoserine in position 2 is a critical feature recognized by mAb H5. Consistent with this interpretation mAb H5 does not recognize phosphorylated A2. Weak interaction between H5 and phosphorylated E2 indicates that substitution of the charged side chain at this position mimics the effect of phosphorylation. Note also that the mobility of unphosphorylated E2 is greatly retarded. Glutamate substitution at position 2 is insufficient for H5 recognition, however, indicating that position 5 phosphorylation may induce a conformational change that enables a weak interaction at position 2. CC3 shows a weak recognition of phosphorylated A5 in addition to recognizing the phosphorylated WT. Thus, like mAb H5, phosphoserine in position 2 appears to be part of the CC3 epitope. None of the other phosphorylated CTDs are recognized by CC3, although in the case of E5 this may be due to the low level of phosphorylation. MARA 3 recognizes phosphorylated A2, A5, and E2. This could mean that both phosphoserines S2 and S5 are recognized or, alternatively, that the epitope is distinct from either site but requires at least one of the serines to be phosphorylated to achieve the proper conformation. The strong interaction of MARA 3 with phosphorylated E2 suggests that the charged residue in position 2 mimics phosphoserine. The fact that phosphorylated A2 and E2 interact better than A5 suggests that MARA 3 is related to H14. MARA 3 recognizes phosphorylated A5, however, whereas H14 does not recognize it at all. Furthermore, MARA 3 recognizes WT better than A2, whereas H14 interacts with both phosphorylated substrates to the same extent. mAb B3 is unique in interacting with phosphorylated A2 more strongly than with WT and the other mutants. This could indicate that the epitope recognized by B3 is phosphorylated at position 5. In this respect B3 is like H14. B3's weak interaction with A5, however, suggests a more complicated situation. For example, B3 may prefer a phosphoepitope in the distal nonconsensus repeats of the CTD which are only approximated by the A2 mutation. To verify that the mAbs used in this study also recognize the mammalian CTD, we generated several phosphorylated mouse CTD fusion proteins. Fig. 3 shows the interaction with unphosphorylated, Cdc2, and c-ABL phosphorylated mouse CTD fusion proteins. All of the anti-phosphorylated CTD mAbs tested interact solely with the Cdc2 phosphorylated molecules and not with unphosphorylated or tyrosine-phosphorylated CTD. mAb 8WG16 shows a very weak recognition of the CTD phosphorylated by c-ABLsuggesting that not all repeats have been phosphorylated. Our earlier studies showed that different CTD kinases can recognize different serine phosphoacceptors in the CTD (25Gebara M. Sayre M.H. Corden J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vivo, the plethora of CTD kinases could give rise to a family of pol II phosphoisomers whose populations may change under different growth conditions. To test this hypothesis we examined CTD phosphorylation in cells in different stages of growth. Fig. 4 A shows a typical yeast growth curve, and Fig. 4 B shows the results of Western blot analysis using different anti-CTD"
https://openalex.org/W2005668158,"Tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor (TFPI) regulates factor X activation through the sequential inhibition of factor Xa and the VIIa·TF complex. Factor Xa formation was studied in a purified, reconstituted system, at plasma concentrations of factor X and TFPI, saturating concentrations of factor VIIa, and increasing concentrations of TF reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine membranes (TF/PCPS) or PC membranes (TF/PC). The initial rate of factor Xa formation was equivalent in the presence or absence of 2.4 nm TFPI. However, reaction extent was small (<20%) relative to that observed in the absence of TFPI, implying the rapid inhibition of VIIa·TF during factor X activation. Initiation of factor Xa formation using increasing concentrations of TF/PCPS or TF/PC in the presence of TFPI yielded families of progress curves where both initial rate and reaction extent were linearly proportional to the concentration of VIIa·TF. These observations were consistent with a kinetic model in which the rate-limiting step represents the initial inhibition of newly formed factor Xa. Numerical analyses of progress curves yielded a rate constant for inhibition of VIIa·TF by Xa·TFPI (>108m−1·s−1) that was substantially greater than the value (7.34 ± 0.8 × 106m−1·s−1) directly measured. Thus, VIIa·TF is inhibited at near diffusion-limited rates by Xa·TFPI formed during catalysis which cannot be explained by studies of the isolated reaction. We propose that the predominant inhibitory pathway during factor X activation may involve the initial inhibition of factor Xa either bound to or in the near vicinity of VIIa·TF on the membrane surface. As a result, VIIa·TF inhibition is unexpectedly rapid, and the concentration of active factor Xa that escapes regulation is linearly dependent on the availability of TF.

Hematol. 1992; 29: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIIa is the serine protease component of the extrinsic Xase which in itself exhibits very poor activity toward its protein substrates (5Nemerson Y. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). Reversible interactions between factor VIIa and the integral membrane protein cofactor, tissue factor (TF), lead to a profound increase in the catalytic efficiency for factor X activation (5Nemerson Y. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). TF does not require proteolytic activation before it can function as a cofactor in the extrinsic Xase complex. Thus, exposure of cells bearing TF to flowing blood following vascular damage is sufficient to recruit circulating factor VII or VIIa to these sites through the tight and reversible interaction between VII or VIIa and TF (6Waxman E.

A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These interactions lead to the proteolytic activation of the zymogen, factor VII (12Neuenschwander P.F. Fiore M.M. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21489-21492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and yield the catalyst responsible for the initiation of coagulation by the extrinsic pathway. Once expressed, the activity of VIIa·TF is down-regulated by plasma proteinase inhibitors including tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (3Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). TFPI, a multivalent Kunitz-type inhibitor present at nanomolar concentrations in plasma, is a potent, slow, and tight-binding inhibitor of factor Xa and can also inhibit the VIIa·TF complex (3Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Of the three Kunitz-type domains in TFPI, the second domain functions in the inhibition of factor Xa, whereas the first is involved in the inhibition of VIIa·TF (13Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The significance and function of the third Kunitz-type domain is unknown (13Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of TFPI has largely been inferred from kinetic studies of the individual reactions. Inhibition of factor Xa by TFPI is rapid and/or highly favored relative to the inhibition of VIIa or the VIIa·TF complex (14Broze Jr., G.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Higuchi D.A. Girard J.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1988; 71: 335-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Callander N.S. Rao L.V. Nordfang O. Sandset P.M. Warn Cramer B. Rapaport S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 876-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pedersen A.H. Nordfang O. Norris F. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Moeller K.B. Meidahl Pedersen J. Beck T.C. Norris K. Hedner U. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16786-16793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reaction between TFPI and VIIa·TF is greatly enhanced by the presence of factor Xa (13Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 15Callander N.S. Rao L.V. Nordfang O. Sandset P.M. Warn Cramer B. Rapaport S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 876-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, efficient inhibition of VIIa·TF appears to require the prior reaction of TFPI with factor Xa, implying a stepwise inhibition of the individual enzymes (3Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The ultimate formation of a quaternary Xa·TFPI·VIIa·TF complex is suggested by these data and the fact that free TF is not available following the action of TFPI on VIIa·TF in the presence of factor Xa (17Rao L.V. Nordfang O. Hoang A.D. Pendurthi U.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 121-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations form the basis for the presumed mechanism of action of TFPI (Scheme FSI), indicating that inhibition of VIIa·TF function by TFPI is achieved by the product “activated” feedback inhibition of the catalyst (3Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The inferred kinetic mechanism of action of TFPI (Scheme FSI) implies an important physiological role in gating the initiation of coagulation through the extrinsic pathway (3Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This concept is further supported by several of the following facts: the exposure of small amounts of TF to blood likely represents the controlling element of this pathway as the plasma concentration of factors VII/VIIa (∼10 nm) is saturating relative to the equilibrium dissociation constant for TF binding (6Waxman E. Ross J.B. Laue T.M. Guha A. Thiruvikraman S.V. Lin T.C. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3998-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Broze Jr., G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Krishnaswamy S. J.

Invest. 1985; 76: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the concentration of the zymogen, factor X (∼170 nm), indicates a much higher achievable concentration of factor Xa relative to the maximum concentration of TFPI in plasma (∼2.4 nm) (19Novotny W.F. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Rader D.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the circulating concentration of TFPI is influenced by partitioning of the inhibitor to cell surfaces or other circulating proteins (20Novotny W.F. Palmier M. Wun T.C. Broze Jr., G.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1991; 78: 394-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These considerations imply that TFPI may function as a threshold regulator of the initiation of the coagulation cascade. Regulation might be expected to be most pronounced at low concentrations of TF which could be overcome by the exposure of TF at concentrations exceeding available TFPI. However, since inhibition of both factor Xa and VIIa·TF by physiological (nanomolar) concentrations of TFPI is not instantaneous, the regulation of this pathway is likely to be heavily influenced by the kinetics determining the individual steps. Although the individual reactions of TFPI have been studied by a number of groups, there is uncertainty as to which inhibition reaction corresponds to the rate-limiting step (21Jesty J. Wun T.C. Lorenz A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12686-12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Lindhout T. Franssen J. Willems G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the effects of TFPI on active factor Xa formation by the extrinsic pathway have not been experimentally documented. We have empirically assessed the ability of TFPI to regulate active factor Xa formation by VIIa·TF and the adequacy of the surmised model for TFPI action to describe this process. Kinetics have been examined at reactant (factor X, TFPI, and VIIa·TF) concentrations that may be relevant to the initiation of coagulation. These conditions are specifically chosen to assess the ability of the existing model to describe TFPI function and to provide an increased understanding of the reaction steps that are kinetically significant for the regulation of the extrinsic pathway. Hen egg l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and bovine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) were from Sigma. The synthetic substrates methoxycarbonyl cyclohexyl-Gly-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Spectrozyme Xa, SpXa) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Val-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin (Z-VVR-AMC) were obtained from American Diagnostica and Bachem, respectively. Stock solutions of SpXa were prepared in water, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using E342M = 8270m−1 (23Lottenberg R. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Coleman P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 341-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Working solutions of SpXa were prepared in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.5. Stock solutions of Z-VVR-AMC (∼300 mm) were prepared in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. A working solution of Z-VVR-AMC was prepared daily in water, and the concentration was determined using E326M = 17,200m−1 (24Jordan S.P. Mao S. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5374-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Patient plasma obtained by plasmapheresis was donated by the plasmapheresis laboratory of Emory University Hospital. Recombinant human factor VIIa was purchased from Novo-Nordisk (Gentofte, Denmark). Recombinant human tissue factor apoprotein (TF) was a kind gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Recombinant full-length TFPI was expressed and purified as described (25Huang Z. Wun T. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide was expressed inPichia pastoris and purified as described previously (26Laroche Y. Storme V. De Meutter J. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All kinetic studies were performed in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.5 (referred to as Assay Buffer), at ambient temperature (estimated at 23 ± 2 °C). Human factor X was isolated from plasmapheresis plasma, and bovine factor X was purified from bovine plasma as described previously (27Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Trace amounts of factor Xa in human factor X preparations were removed by chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor Sepharose (Sigma), followed by gel filtration (Sephacryl S-300) to remove traces of inhibitor. These preparations were routinely assessed for residual Xa activity (<0.005%) as well as unforeseen trace contamination by protease inhibitors. Factor Xa was prepared using factor X from either source by proteolytic activation using purified factor X activator (RVVx-cp) from Russell's viper venom followed by purification as described (28Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic titration of Xa using p-nitrophenol p′-guanidinobenzoate (ICN Pharmaceuticals) (29Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar) yielded 0.95 and 1.15 active sites/mol of protein for human and bovine Xa, respectively. The purity of all protein preparations was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients ( E2800.1%): human X, 56,500 and 1.16 (31Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); bovine Xa, 45,300 and 1.24 (32Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5290-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); human Xa, 45,300 and 1.16 (31Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); human recombinant factor VIIa, 50,000 and 1.39 (33Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Brown S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 253-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); TAP, 6,980 and 2.56 (34Krishnaswamy S. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7897-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The concentration of TFPI was determined usingMr = 32,000 and E2800.1% = 0.67 calculated from the primary structure by the method of Gill and von Hippel (35Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar) and confirmed by quantitative amino acid analysis. Tissue factor was reconstituted into membranes containing 75% (w/w) PC and 25% (w/w) PS (PCPS) or 100% PC usingn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem) and exhaustive dialysis at a controlled rate as described previously (36Lawson J.H. Krishnaswamy S. Butenas S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 177-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The recovery of TF in the reconstituted mixture was assessed using known amounts of 125I-labeled TF added as tracer to the initial reaction mixture. The final effective concentration of TF following dialysis was considered to be one-half the total concentration due to the two possible orientations of the protein (8Bach R. Gentry R. Nemerson Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations were determined following oxidation by a colorimetric assay for inorganic phosphate using Malachite Green (37Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Quasi-elastic light scattering measurements (Nicomp 370, NICOMP Instruments) of the resultant TF/PCPS and TF/PC vesicles yielded gaussian distributions centered at d = 122 ± 63 nm for TF/PCPS and d = 137 ± 67 nm for TF/PC. These dimensions, the total phospholipid concentration, and the published dimensions for head group surface area (38Mason J.T. Huang C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 308: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were used to determine the vesicle concentration and the number of correctly oriented tissue factors per vesicle. Henceforth, TF/PCPS and TF/PC refer to tissue factor reconstituted into PCPS or PC membranes with approximately one (mean = 1.02, range 0.77–1.53) productively oriented TF molecule per vesicle. Stock solutions of TFPI (∼350 μm, ∼11 mg/ml) stored in 2 m urea were diluted into distilled water to a final concentration not exceeding 1 μm. Following brief centrifugation and absorbance measurements to determine concentration, the TFPI was further diluted in Assay Buffer to a useful working concentration of 20–100 nm. The active concentration of TFPI was determined by titration with bovine factor Xa before every experiment (39Girard T.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The active concentration of TFPI interpolated from these titrations ranged between 55 and 65% of the total protein present. The stated concentrations of TFPI correspond to the active concentration determined in these titration experiments. The inhibitory activity of TFPI was found to decrease with storage at −20 °C with no obvious deterioration detected by SDS-PAGE. Preparations with reduced inhibitory activity yielded exactly the same rate constants when corrected for the active concentration of TFPI. Factor X was labeled with 125I using solid phase lactoperoxidase by modifications to procedures described previously (40David G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 41Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lactoperoxidase-Sepharose (2 IU/ml) (Worthington) was washed with 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) PEG, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5 (Labeling Buffer) by repeated centrifugation prior to use. The iodination mixture (50 μl) contained 0.8 units/ml lactoperoxidase beads, 180 nm factor X, 8.6 μm KI, and 1 mCi of Na125I. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 28 μmH2O2, gently agitated at room temperature for 6 min, and quenched by the addition of 14 mmNaN3. Factor X was separated from the reactants by the use of a centrifuge column (4 ml, Sephadex G-25) precoated with 10% (w/v) BSA and extensively washed with Labeling Buffer. Typical yields were 5 × 106 dpm/μg of protein. Reaction mixtures containing factor X and125I-labeled factor X added as a tracer in Assay Buffer were initiated with the preassembled extrinsic Xase complex (TF/PCPS; 1 nm TF, 130 μm PCPS, 2 nm VIIa) or 5 nm RVVx-cp. Progress curves for factor Xa formation were determined in EDTA-quenched samples from discontinuous measurements of the initial velocity of SpXa hydrolysis as described previously (27Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE both with and without disulfide bond reduction using dithiothreitol. Dried gels were exposed to an imaging plate, and radioactivity was detected and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) following detection of luminescence by laser scanning. Quantitation was performed by integrating the volumes (density/area) of each band to yield the extent of factor X activation calculated as a ratio of the intensity of the factor X or Xa bands relative to the total integrated volume in each lane. Control experiments established a linear relationship between the radioactivity loaded on the gel and the integrated volume. Results obtained from discontinuous measurements of SpXa hydrolysis were indistinguishable from progress curves of factor X activation inferred from the radioactive bands. It was concluded that under steady state conditions, the kinetics of cleavage of 125I-labeled factor X was equivalent to that of unlabeled factor X. The final concentration of reactants was 170 nmfactor X, 2.4 nm TFPI, 2 nm VIIa, and varying concentrations of TF/PCPS or TF/PC. Factor Xa formation was initiated in wells of a 96-well plate (Corning Assay Plate) by mixing equal volumes (50 μl each) of preassembled VIIa·TF with a mixture of factor X and TFPI in Assay Buffer. To minimize adsorption artifacts, the plates were pretreated with Assay Buffer lacking Ca2+but containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h, centrifuged to remove solvent, and air-dried before use. Following incubation for varying periods (0.25–15 min) at room temperature, further factor X activation was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 0.4 mm SpXa in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.5, and the initial velocity of SpXa hydrolysis was measured by continuously monitoring the change in absorbance at 405 nm in a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of factor Xa was inferred from the linear dependence of the rate on known concentrations of factor Xa assayed under the same conditions. Initial rates for factor X activation in the absence of TFPI were determined using reaction mixtures containing identical concentrations of enzyme components and substrate from serially quenched samples as described previously (27Baugh R.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16126-16134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, 125I-labeled factor X was present as a tracer in the substrate solution to permit analysis by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots were quenched at various times following initiation by mixing with an equal volume of 62.5 mm Tris, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 16 mm EDTA, pH 6.8. Samples were then heated (5 min, 80 °C) in the absence or presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to electrophoresis. Approximately 30,000 dpm was applied per lane, and quantitation of factor Xa produced was performed as described above. Reaction mixtures (150 μl) in wells of a 96-well plate contained 0.1 or 0.2 nm Xa and increasing concentrations of TFPI in Assay Buffer. Following incubation for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h, the concentration of free (uninhibited) factor Xa was determined from the initial steady state rate of SpXa hydrolysis initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 0.4 mmSpXa prepared in the same buffer. The half-time for the dissociation of TFPI from Xa is established to be substantially greater than the 5 min required for the initial rate measurement (25Huang Z. Wun T. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, corrections for the perturbation of the initial equilibrium by dilution or due to competitive effects of SpXa are not necessary. The final concentrations of Xa and TFPI used in the analysis were therefore those present in the initial 150-μl incubation mixture. The rate constant for the inhibition of factor Xa was inferred from exponential decays in the rate of SpXa hydrolysis in the presence of TFPI. Reaction mixtures (150 μl) containing SpXa and increasing concentrations of TFPI in Assay Buffer were initiated with 50 μl of factor Xa in the same buffer. The final concentrations of reactants were 200 μm SpXa, the indicated concentrations of TFPI, and 0.05 nm factor Xa. Following mixing by brief vibration, SpXa hydrolysis was monitored by continuously measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Data acquired over 2 h were corrected for the measured 30-s interval between the initiation and the onset of absorbance measurements. VIIa·TF activity was measured by the hydrolysis of the fluorescent substrate Z-VVR-AMC. Fluorescence measurements were performed using an SLM 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer with adapted hardware and software (OLIS, Bogart, GA) as described (41Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ratiometric fluorescence was measured in 1-cm2 stirred quartz cuvettes maintained at 25 °C using λex = 380 nm and measuring broad band emission intensity (λem ≥400 nm) with a long pass filter (Schott KV 399) in the emission beam. The overall dissociation constant, Ki*, for the inhibition of VIIa·TF by the Xa·TFPI binary complex was assessed at 0.25 nm VIIa, 1 nm TF/PCPS, 0.6 nmTFPI, and increasing concentrations of Xa after incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Uninhibited VIIa·TF activity was assessed by the addition of 1 μm TAP to rapidly inhibit traces of free factor Xa followed by 60 μm Z-VVR-AMC. The initial velocity for peptide hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the linear, steady state increase in fluorescence over 5 min. Since the concentration of TFPI was in excess and well above theKi* for the inhibition of factor Xa, the concentration of the Xa·TFPI binary complex was considered approximately equal to the limiting concentration of factor Xa. To accommodate the uncertainty with this assumption, the overall dissociation constant was also determined using increasing concentrations of TFPI at a single saturating concentration of factor Xa (1 nm) or by simultaneously varying both Xa and TFPI maintained at a constant ratio (1:0.9) to each other. Reaction mixtures (2 ml) contained the indicated concentrations of the preformed Xa·TFPI complex (a fixed, saturating concentration of TFPI and increasing concentrations of factor Xa preincubated for 2–5 h) and 1 nm TF/PCPS in Assay Buffer. Following the initial incubation, 60 μmZ-VVR-AMC was added, and substrate hydrolysis was initiated with varying concentrations of factor VIIa (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 nm). The inhibition of VIIa·TF was inferred from exponential decays in the rate of Z-VVR-AMC hydrolysis in the presence of Xa·TFPI complex over a 20-min period. In these experiments, (Xa·TFPI) ≥ 3·(VIIa·TF) to maintain pseudo first-order conditions. Data were analyzed according to th"
https://openalex.org/W2127541083,"Endothelial cell surface expression of VCAM-1 is one of the initial steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The inflammatory response transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB plays an important role in the regulation of VCAM-1 expression by various stimuli including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Other transcription factors may modulate this response through interaction with NF-kappaB factors. Since c-Fos/c-Jun (activating protein-1 (AP-1)) are expressed in vascular endothelium during proinflammatory conditions, we investigated the role of AP-1 proteins in the expression of VCAM-1 by TNF-alpha in SV40 immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). TNF-alpha induced expression of both early protooncogenes, c-fos and c-jun. The ability of TNF-alpha to activate the kappaB-motif (kappaL-kappaR)-dependent VCAM-1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene lacking a consensus AP-1 element was markedly inhibited by co-transfection of the expression vector encoding c-fos ribozyme, which decreases the level of c-fos by degrading c-fos mRNA, or c-fos or c-jun oligonucleotides. Conversely, co-transfection of c-Fos and c-Jun encoding expression vectors potentiated the p65/NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the VCAM-1 promoter-CAT reporter gene. Furthermore the c-Fos encoding expression vector potentiated by 2-fold the transactivation activity of a chimeric transcriptional factor Gal/p65 (containing the transactivation domain of p65 and the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal-4). Consistent with the promoter studies, curcumin and NDGA, inhibitors of AP-1 activation, markedly inhibited the ability of TNF-alpha to activate the expression of VCAM-1 mRNA levels at concentrations that did not inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB. In gel mobility supershift assays, the antibodies to c-Fos or c-Jun inhibited the binding of TNF-alpha-activated nuclear NF-kappaB to the kappaL-kappaR, suggesting that both c-Fos and c-Jun interacted with NF-kappaB. These results suggest that AP-1 proteins may mediate the effect of TNF-alpha in the regulation of VCAM-1 expression through interaction with NF-kappaB factors in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034991523,"The induction of several forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the mammalian hippocampus is dependent onN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and the subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC), but the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of PKC in this context are largely unknown. It is known that reactive oxygen species, including superoxide, are produced byN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation in neurons, and recent studies have suggested that some reactive oxygen species can modulate PKC in vitro. Thus, we have investigated the role of superoxide in both the induction of LTP and the activation of PKC during LTP. We found that incubation of hippocampal slices with superoxide scavengers inhibited the induction of LTP. The effects of superoxide on LTP induction may involve PKC, as we observed that superoxide was required for appropriate modulation of PKC activation during the induction of LTP. In this respect, superoxide appears to work in conjunction with nitric oxide, which was required for a portion of the LTP-associated changes in PKC activity as well. Our observations indicate that superoxide and nitric oxide together regulate PKC in a physiologic context and that this type of regulation occurs during the induction of LTP in the hippocampus.

Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) 1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long-term potentiation; HFS, high frequency stimulation; NMDA,N-methyl-d-aspartate; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMPO, 5,5-dimethylpyrroline 1-oxide; EPSP, excitatory postsynaptic potential; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; NOArg,N-nitro-arginine. is a long-lasting synaptic enhancement that may be involved in certain types of mammalian learning and memory (1Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9607) Google Scholar). It generally is agreed that in area CA1 of the hippocampus the induction of most forms of LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) is dependent on Ca2+ entry into the postsynaptic neuron triggered byN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation (2Collingridge G.L.

The exact biochemical sequence of events following Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic cell is unknown, but it is clear that Ca2+-dependent protein kinases are involved in the induction of LTP (5Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 6Malenka R.C. Kauer J.A. Perkel D.J. Mauk M.D. Kelly P.T. Nicoll R.A. Waxham M.N. Nature. 1989; 340: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is one of the requisite biochemical steps necessary for the induction of LTP, as selective PKC inhibitors can block induction of LTP (5Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.-H. Feng D.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, both the second messenger-independent activity of PKC (autonomous activity; see Ref. 9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and total, cofactor-stimulated PKC activity (cofactor-dependent activity; see Refs. 9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl.

Brain Res. 1993; 613: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) are increased shortly after LTP-inducing HFS. Mechanisms that have been proposed for the activation of PKC immediately following the induction of LTP (15 s to 2 min after the final HFS) include translocation of PKC to the membrane (11Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Ogura A. Tanaka R. Nakamura K. Kudo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1515-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), conformational changes in PKC that result in the unmasking of activator sites (10Otani S. Ben-Ari Y. Roisin-Lallemand M.-P. Brain Res. 1993; 613: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and decreases in protein phosphatase activity that might result in increased phosphorylation and activity of PKC (10Otani S. Ben-Ari Y. Roisin-Lallemand M.-P. Brain Res. 1993; 613: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An additional mechanism that might be involved in the activation of PKC during the induction of LTP is an oxidative mechanism involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly the superoxide anion (O·̄2). A variety of evidence suggest this possibility. First, levels of superoxide may increase during the induction of LTP, as it has recently been demonstrated that NMDA receptor activation in area CA1 of hippocampal slices results in the production of superoxide (13Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, if superoxide levels increase, PKC is a possible target, given that treatment of several different types of cells and of hippocampal homogenates with superoxide or other ROS has been shown to increase both autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC activity (14Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Larsson R. Cerutti P.

Coupled with recent studies implicating superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes removal of superoxide, in neuronal function and the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (17Benzi G. Moretti A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (18Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D.

Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5568) Google Scholar), these findings prompted us to determine whether superoxide was involved in the induction of LTP, and if so, to determine whether superoxide was involved in the regulation of PKC activity during LTP. Hippocampi from male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) were removed and 400-μm slices were prepared with a McIlwain tissue chopper. The slices were perfused for 1 h with a standard saline solution (124 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mmd-glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2, pH 7.4) in an interface tissue slice chamber at 32 °C. After 1 h, baseline responses to Schaffer collateral stimulation in the CA1 region were monitored for at least 20 min before LTP-inducing HFS to assure a stable baseline. Test stimuli were given at a current that produced 50% of the maximum population EPSP (usually between 30 and 40 μA). Responses were measured every 2.5 min as an average of four individual traces. In our previous study (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), LTP-inducing HFS consisted of three sets of stimuli, each set was delivered 5 min apart. Each set included two 1-s trains of stimuli (100 Hz), given 20 s apart at the current needed to elicit a maximum population EPSP. Using this stimulus paradigm, cofactor-dependent PKC activity increased 2 min after the final HFS train. However, because this paradigm spanned a period of 10 min, the LTP-associated increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity was actually measured 12 min after the first HFS train. To determine changes in PKC activity that more accurately reflect changes during the induction of LTP, we modified our LTP-inducing HFS in this study to consist of three 1-s trains of stimuli (100 Hz), given 20 s apart at the current needed to elicit a maximal population EPSP (usually between 60 and 80 μA). In experiments in which PKC activity was assayed, slices were frozen 2 min after the final HFS train, dissected, and homogenized. In experiments in which LTP was examined, responses were measured every 2.5 min as an average of four individual traces for 1 h after the final HFS. Post-HFS responses were generated with the same test stimuli used prior to HFS. LTP was defined as an increase of 20% or greater in the initial EPSP slope. Slices were prepared as described above. After a 1-h incubation in standard saline solution, hippocampal slices were perfused with standard saline solution containing SOD (Calbiochem), SOD/catalase (Calbiochem), DMPO (OMRF Spin Trap Source), or NOArg (Sigma) for at least 30 min prior to LTP-inducing HFS. In more than 90% of the experiments, slices given HFS in the presence of SOD, SOD/catalase, DMPO, or NOArg were compared with slices from the same animal given HFS in the absence of the agents in an adjacent recording chamber (LTP controls). Autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC activity in control and potentiated tissue from hippocampal area CA1 was determined using the selective PKC substrate NG(28–43), as described previously (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We defined autonomous PKC activity as activity assayed in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. Cofactor-dependent PKC activity was defined as activity assayed in the presence of 100 μmCaCl2, 320 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 30 μg/ml dioctonoylglycerol with the autonomous PKC activity subtracted (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expressed in terms of absolute specific activities, autonomous NG(28–43) phosphorylation was 0.65 ± 0.10 pmol/min/μg in control slices and 1.10 ± 0.33 pmol/min/μg in slices given LTP-inducing HFS; cofactor-dependent NG(28–43) phosphorylation was 7.07 ± 0.63 pmol/min/μg protein in control slices and 11.27 ± 1.30 pmol/min/μg protein in slices given LTP-inducing HFS. The hypothesis that superoxide plays a role in the induction of LTP was investigated in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices. LTP was induced with HFS consisting of three 1-s trains of 100-Hz stimulation delivered 20 s apart at a stimulus intensity that produced a maximum initial slope of the extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). This stimulus paradigm resulted in LTP in 96% (25 out of 26) of the control slices for the experiments shown in Fig. 1. The slope of the EPSPs was increased to 155.7 ± 4.0% (n = 26) of pre-HFS control levels (within-slice comparison) 60 min after the final HFS train (Fig. 1, A-C). To determine whether superoxide was involved in LTP induction, we gave slices HFS in the presence of the superoxide scavenger SOD. SOD is highly specific for superoxide and is not known to react enzymatically with other ROS (21Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar). LTP was blocked in eight out of nine slices 60 min after the final HFS train (average slope of EPSPs = 101.0 ± 7.5% of control, n = 9) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, slices from the same animal in an adjacent recording chamber given HFS without SOD exhibited LTP in all nine experiments (average slope of EPSPs = 158.7 ± 7.6% of control, n = 9) (Fig. 1 A). These data suggest that superoxide plays a role in the induction of LTP. An alternative explanation of the results in Fig. 1 A is that one of the products of the reaction between SOD and superoxide inhibits the induction of LTP. Specifically, SOD converts superoxide to H2O2 and O2 (22Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar), and H2O2 has been shown to inhibit LTP (23Pellmar T.C. Hollinden G.E. Sarvey J.M. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, slices were given HFS in the presence of bath-applied SOD along with catalase, an enzyme which scavenges H2O2 and catalyzes its conversion to O2 and water (22Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar). In these experiments, LTP was inhibited in 10 out of 15 slices (average slope of EPSPs = 113.3 ± 4.7% of control for all 15 slices and 102.8 ± 2.4% of control for the 10 slices that did not meet our criteria for LTP) (Fig. 1 B). In control experiments, LTP was produced in 12 out of 13 slices (average slope of EPSPs = 150.4 ± 4.7% of control, n = 13) (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the five slices incubated with SOD and catalase that did exhibit LTP after HFS were potentiated to a lesser extent when compared with LTP control slices (average slope of EPSPs = 134.6 ± 7.6% of control, n = 5). Slices incubated with catalase alone exhibited LTP (average slope of EPSPs = 168.5 ± 12.5% of control, n = 3) similar to that observed in LTP control slices (average slope of EPSPs = 166.6 ± 7.4% of control,n = 3). Our interpretation of these data is that the effects of SOD on LTP induction are not solely a result of increased levels of H2O2. However, our findings do not exclude the possibility that H2O2 not removed by catalase may contribute to the observed effects of SOD on LTP. As mentioned, SOD is a specific enzyme not known to catalyze the removal of any ROS besides superoxide. However, SOD, like most other proteins, contains histidine, tryptophan, and methionine, each of which can react nonenzymatically with other ROS (21Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the effects of SOD are not due to these nonenzymatic reactions with other ROS, we incubated slices with boiled SOD and catalase and then examined their effect on the induction of LTP. In slices incubated with the heat-inactivated enzymes, LTP was indistinguishable (average slope of EPSPs = 162.3 ± 11.3% of control, n = 4) (Fig. 1 C) from LTP in control slices (average slope of EPSPs = 154.4 ± 9.4% of control, n = 4) (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the effects of SOD and catalase on LTP are not attributable to nonenzymatic removal of ROS other than superoxide. Although the concentrations of SOD (121 units/ml) and catalase (260 units/ml) we used have been shown in previous studies to have no effect on baseline electrophysiological responses in area CA1 of guinea pig hippocampal slices (24Pellmar T.C. Lipinski D.L. Brain Res. 1992; 569: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we performed a series of experiments to verify that the superoxide scavengers used in our studies did not have nonspecific effects on synaptic transmission. We observed no alteration of electrophysiological responses to test stimuli in area CA1 in rat hippocampal slices exposed to SOD and catalase (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, SOD and catalase had no effect on the NMDA component of the EPSP measured in the presence of 20 μm6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (Fig. 2 B). Finally, SOD and catalase had no effect on high-frequency synaptic transmission, as measured by either the total depolarization or the steady-state depolarization produced during HFS (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that inhibition of LTP induction by superoxide scavengers is not due to effects on baseline synaptic transmission or NMDA receptor function. Overall, these data suggest that superoxide has a role in modulating the induction of LTP in area CA1. To demonstrate that a structurally and functionally distinct superoxide scavenger would also inhibit LTP induction, we incubated slices with 10 mm 5,5-dimethylpyrroline 1-oxide (DMPO), a superoxide and hydroxyl radical electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trap that previously has been shown to block NMDA-induced, superoxide-dependent neurotoxicity in cerebellar granule neurons (25Lafon-Cazal M. Pietri S. Culcasi M. Boeckart J. Nature. 1993; 364: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). DMPO inhibited LTP in three out of five experiments and attenuated LTP in the other two experiments (average slope of EPSPs = 120.6 ± 4.8% of control, n = 5) (Fig. 3). In contrast, all five control slices exhibited LTP (average slope of EPSPs = 160.4 ± 7.8% of control, n = 5). In addition, DMPO had no effect on electrophysiological responses to test stimuli (data not shown). These results are consistent with results observed with SOD and catalase and provide further evidence of a role for superoxide in the induction of LTP. We conclude from this series of experiments that removing superoxide reduces the probability of LTP induction and the magnitude of LTP when potentiation occurs. Because neither SOD, catalase, nor DMPO can cross cell membranes, these data also suggest that superoxide may act as a transcellular messenger in LTP. The results of the experiments in Figs. 1 and 3 indicate that superoxide modulates the induction of LTP, but they do not address the possibility of a role for superoxide in the maintenance of LTP. To test this possibility, we induced LTP and added SOD and catalase 20 min after the final LTP-inducing HFS. Pre-established LTP was unaffected by addition of SOD and catalase when monitored up to 1 h after the addition of the enzymes (Fig. 4). These results indicate that superoxide modulates the induction, but not the maintenance, of LTP. We next sought to begin to elucidate the biochemical targets of superoxide in LTP. We began by testing the hypothesis that superoxide regulates PKC during the induction of LTP. We previously have shown that the induction of LTP is associated with increases in both autonomous (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and cofactor-dependent PKC activity (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To investigate a role for superoxide in regulating PKC activity during the induction of LTP, we first measured PKC activity after LTP-inducing HFS (see “Experimental Procedures”). Slices were frozen 2 min after the final train of HFS, dissected, and homogenized. Homogenates from control slices and slices given HFS were assayed for autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC activity using the selective PKC substrate peptide NG(28–43) (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Chen S.-J. Klann E. Gower M.C. Powell C.M. Sessoms J.S. Sweatt J.D.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In comparisons of slices given LTP-inducing HFS and control slices that received only test stimuli, we observed an increase in both autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC activity 2 min after the HFS (183.4 ± 18.6 and 144.8 ± 11.6% of control, respectively,n = 12, p < 0.05) (Figs.5, A and B). These results agree with previous work demonstrating that HFS results in an increase in both autonomous (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and cofactor-dependent PKC activity (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Otani S. Ben-Ari Y. Roisin-Lallemand M.-P. Brain Res. 1993; 613: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and are consistent with physiological studies showing that blockade of PKC inhibits induction of LTP (5Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.-H. Feng D.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that superoxide mediates the increases in autonomous and cofactor-dependent PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP, we assayed PKC activity after incubating slices with SOD/catalase and delivering LTP-inducing HFS to area CA1. We observed an attenuated but significant increase in autonomous PKC activity in slices given HFS in the presence of SOD/catalase (146.8 ± 20.1% of control, n = 8,p < 0.05) (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP was blocked completely (91.4 ± 9.6% of control, n = 8) (Fig. 5 B). In control experiments, addition of SOD/catalase to both the slices after LTP-inducing HFS and to the homogenization buffer had no significant effect on the LTP-associated increases in either autonomous PKC activity (177.5 ± 23.4% of control, n = 3) or cofactor-dependent PKC activity (160.3 ± 15.7% of control, n = 3). These results suggest that the increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP is mediated either directly or indirectly by superoxide. Furthermore, these data suggest that superoxide contributes to the generation of autonomously active PKC, consistent with the hypothesis that multiple mechanisms of PKC activation are associated with the induction of LTP (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl.

The results described above indicate that superoxide can modulate induction of LTP, possibly through interactions with PKC. In many systems, superoxide exerts its effects in conjunction with nitric oxide (NO) (see Ref. 22Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is known that inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) modulate the induction of LTP induced by many stimulus paradigms (29Böhme G.A. Bon C. Stutzman J.-M. Doble A. Blanchard J.-C.

In this study, slices given HFS in the presence of the NOS inhibitor N-nitro-arginine (NOArg, 100 μm) exhibited LTP (average slope of EPSPs = 135 ± 5% of control, n = 4). However, the slices were potentiated to a lesser extent (p < 0.05, paired Student's t test) when compared with LTP control slices from the same animal in an adjacent recording chamber (average slope of EPSPs = 166 ± 10% of control, n = 4). Therefore, we next sought to determine whether NO might be involved in the regulation of PKC activity during the induction of LTP. To examine interactions between NO and PKC during the induction of LTP, hippocampal slices were incubated with NOArg (100 μm), given LTP-inducing HFS, and assayed for changes in PKC activity. As with superoxide scavengers, in the presence of NOArg we observed an attenuated but significant increase in autonomous PKC activity (141.4 ± 20.5% of control, n = 10,p < 0.05) (Fig. 6 A), and complete inhibition of the increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity (98.7 ± 14.6% of control, n = 10) (Fig. 6 B) associated with the induction of LTP. These results suggest that activation of NOS and production of NO play an important role in the activation of PKC during LTP induction. There is an alternative interpretation of these results, as NOS is known to produce superoxide as a by-product (35Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If NOS were in fact the source of superoxide production during LTP induction, the requirement for NOS activity could reflect the need for superoxide, rather than a direct role for NO in activating PKC. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested whether hemoglobin, which binds NO avidly (36Gibson Q.H. Roughton F.J.W. J. Physiol. 1957; 136: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), but does not block effects of superoxide alone on PKC activity 2L. T. Knapp and E. Klann, unpublished observations. could block the changes in PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP. We delivered LTP-inducing HFS to hippocampal slices incubated with 20 μm hemoglobin and then assayed PKC activity. The increase in autonomous PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP was attenuated (146.7 ± 10.6% of control, n = 8,p < 0.05), as was the increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity (120.4 ± 19.6% of control, n = 8, p > 0.05) in slices incubated with hemoglobin. We interpret these results to suggest that NO, like superoxide, plays an important role in PKC activation during the induction of LTP. However, it should be noted that hemoglobin can also bind other ROS, including superoxide, albeit with a lower affinity than NO. Therefore, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that hemoglobin is blocking effects of superoxide or another ROS on PKC activity. It is interesting to note that hemoglobin, like SOD/catalase and DMPO, is confined to the extracellular space; the results therefore are consistent with the hypothesis that transcellular signaling plays a role in PKC activation by superoxide and NO during LTP. The results in this report provide evidence of a role for superoxide in the induction of LTP. Our experiments with superoxide scavengers indicate that superoxide increases the probability of LTP induction and the magnitude of LTP when it occurs. Moreover, the demonstration of a superoxide-dependent change in PKC activity during the induction of LTP provides evidence that superoxide levels increase during the induction of LTP. Thus, we have shown that superoxide is likely to be produced during the induction of LTP, and that it has both biochemical and physiologic effects. The idea of a role for superoxide in synaptic plasticity is consistent with a number of findings from previous studies. First, NMDA receptor activation, a key step in most forms of LTP, results in the production of superoxide in area CA1 of hippocampal slices (13Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in other types of neurons (25Lafon-Cazal M. Pietri S. Culcasi M. Boeckart J. Nature. 1993; 364: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Second, activation of other glutamate receptors can produce superoxide through a number of biochemical pathways (37Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). In addition, superoxide increases the release of glutamate in hippocampal slices (38Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Cherici G. Alesiani M. Carla V. Moroni F. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1960-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which suggests a means by which it might modulate synaptic efficacy. Finally, it is interesting to note that although the intracellular form of Cu/Zn-SOD, SOD1, is abundantly expressed in the dentate gyrus and area CA3 of the hippocampus, it is expressed to a much lesser degree in area CA1, the hippocampal subregion studied herein (39Pardo C.A. Xu Z. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); thus, area CA1 is likely to have less capacity for removal of superoxide, consistent with a physiologic role for superoxide in this region. There are a variety of possible sources for superoxide production during LTP induction. First, NOS, which is known to be activated during the induction of LTP (33Chetkovich D.M. Klann E. Sweatt J.D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), is a source of superoxide (35Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that NOS inhibitors and superoxide scavengers have similar effects is consistent with a role for NOS in producing superoxide, although it is difficult to dissect this role of NOS from its required role in producing NO. Another possible source of superoxide in LTP is arachidonic acid metabolism. Superoxide is produced by lipoxygenase, which initiates leukotriene synthesis from arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, which initiates prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid (40Kukreja R.C. Kontos H.A. Hess M.L. Ellis E.F. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Interestingly, arachidonic acid metabolism increases during LTP (41Lynch M.A. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 42Lynch M.A. Clements M.P. Voss K.L. Bramham C.R. Bliss T.V.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and a lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, inhibits LTP induction (31O'Dell T.J. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Arancio O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11285-11289Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 41Lynch M.A. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V.

Lett. 1989; 107: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), consistent with a possible role of arachidonic acid metabolism in superoxide production during the induction of LTP. Other possible sources of superoxide include the mitochondrial electron transport chain (13Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dionsi D. Galeotti T. Terrehove T. Azzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 403: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and xanthine oxidase, which could be produced by protease activation during LTP induction (45McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). In addition to demonstrating a role for superoxide in modulating LTP induction, we have shown that activation of PKC may be a biochemical effect of superoxide production during the induction of LTP. Superoxide is required for increases in cofactor-dependent PKC activity and contributes to increases in autonomous PKC activity during LTP induction. In addition, because superoxide appears to work in conjunction with NO to mediate PKC activity during the induction of LTP, our studies provide evidence that PKC could be a biochemical effector of NO in LTP induction. Previous observations and our present studies suggest that superoxide and NO, and the subsequent increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity (Figs. 5 B and 6 B), are likely to be modulatory rather than obligatory for the induction of LTP. First, although SOD/catalase blocked LTP in 10 out of 15 experiments, in five experiments an attenuated potentiation was observed (Fig. 1 B). Second, although SOD/catalase, NOArg, and hemoglobin blocked the HFS-induced increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity, none completely blocked the LTP-associated increase in autonomous PKC activity (Figs. 5 A and 6 A). This last observation would suggest that there are multiple mechanisms of PKC activation after LTP-inducing stimulation (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Sacktor T.C. Osten P. Valsamis H. Jiang X. Naik M.U. Sublette E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Atkins, J. D. English, E. D. Roberson, and E. Klann, unpublished observations. which include activation of autonomous PKC that is obligatory (5Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.-H. Feng D.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2576-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Hvalby O. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Paulsen O. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Godfraind J.-M. Jensen V. Raastad M. Storm J.F. Andersen P. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and activation of cofactor-dependent PKC that is modulatory. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the increase in cofactor-dependent PKC activity generated by superoxide and NO together, although transient, is involved in the generation of additional autonomously active PKC necessary for the maximum expression of LTP. For example, oxidation of PKC may modify the enzyme so that there is enhanced autophosphorylation, a mechanism that has been proposed to contribute to LTP (9Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). How superoxide and NO might interact to regulate PKC activity is an interesting but unresolved question. Our data suggest that both superoxide and NO are necessary for the increase in PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP (Figs. 5 and 6). Superoxide and NO are known to react rapidly to form the highly reactive peroxynitrite intermediate, a potent oxidant that mediates oxidation of protein sulfhydryls (46Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, peroxynitrite decomposes to form hydroxyl radical (22Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar), which is likely able to activate PKC (16Palumbo E.J. Sweatt J.D. Chen S.-J. Klann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The extent to which peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical are involved in PKC activation by superoxide and NO during LTP is an area of active research. The cellular location of the superoxide- and NO-mediated changes in PKC activity is another interesting question. LTP is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of both pre- and postsynaptic PKC substrates (47Gianotti C. Nunzi M.G. Gispen W.H. Corradetti R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 843-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 48Klann E. Chen S.-J. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49Ramakers G.M. de Graan P.N. Urban I.J. Kraay D. Tang T. Pasinelli P. Oestreicher A.B. Gispen W.H. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1997; 749: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this regard, our results with SOD/catalase, DMPO, and hemoglobin are interesting, as all are confined to the extracellular space. The ability of these compounds to block the effects of superoxide and NO on PKC activity suggests that these species may serve as transcellular signals. It is well known that NO is a membrane-permeable molecule. In contrast, it is not clear how the negatively charged superoxide molecule would be able to cross membranes, although it has been proposed that superoxide can traverse cell membranes through anion channels. Consistent with this notion, it has been reported that NMDA receptor activation in cerebellar granule neurons results in the generation of superoxide that can be trapped extracellularly (25Lafon-Cazal M. Pietri S. Culcasi M. Boeckart J. Nature. 1993; 364: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for our results is that the scavenging compounds could be acting as extracellular sinks to pull ROS out of the postsynaptic neurons, preventing activation of PKC postsynaptically. Although ROS traditionally have been thought of as toxic agents involved in cell injury, they recently have been speculated to act as cellular messengers. This is evidenced by reports showing that ROS increase: 1) the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein (51Larsson R. Cerutti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17452-17458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2) PKC activity in mouse epidermal JB6 cells (15Larsson R. Cerutti P. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5627-5632PubMed Google Scholar); 3) tyrosine phosphorylation in human neutrophils (52Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17131-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) p21ras GTPase activity in PC12 cells (53Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that generation of hydrogen peroxide is necessary for platelet-derived growth factor signal transduction (54Sunderesan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar) and may be involved in lysophosphatidic acid signal transduction (55Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the results in this report are the first to demonstrate ROS regulation of protein kinase activity in the brain and are consistent with the idea that ROS act as normal cellular messengers under certain physiological conditions. Finally, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that ROS modulate the early expression of LTP via interactions with PKC. However, ROS also have been shown to inactivate protein phosphatases, including calcineurin (56Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nautre. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase that has been shown to be necessary for NMDA receptor-dependent hippocampal long-term depression (57Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), a use-dependentdecrease in synaptic strength. Thus, the production of ROS after induction of LTP, in addition to increasing PKC activity, might also serve to inactivate protein phosphatases such as calcineurin, thereby preventing long-term depression and favoring the expression of LTP. In closing, the data in this report indicate that superoxide modulates the induction of LTP, and that superoxide, in conjunction with NO, mediates increases in PKC activity associated with the induction of LTP. These findings present an interesting physiologic and biochemical context for the effects of ROS in the nervous system. We thank C. Wyatt and Dr. C. M. Powell for help with electrophysiological experiments and Drs. E. Aizenman and E. Thiels for critically reading previous versions of this manuscript."

During neural development, one particular HS proteoglycan is able to rapidly switch its potentiating activity from FGF-2, as neural precursor cell proliferation occurs, to FGF-1, as neuronal differentiation occurs. Using various analytical techniques, including chemical and enzymatic cleavage, low pressure chromatography, and strong anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, we have analyzed the different HSs expressed during these crucial developmental stages. There are distinct alterations in patterns of 6-O-sulfation, total chain length, and the number of sulfated domains of the HS from the more mature embryonic brain. These changes correlate with a switch in the ability of the HS to potentiate the actions of FGF-1 in triggering cell differentiation. It thus appears that each HS pool is designed to function in the modulation of an intricate interaction with a specific growth factor and its cognate receptor, and suggests tightly regulated expression of specific, bioactive disaccharide sequences. The data can be used to construct a simple model of controlled variations in HS chain structure which have functional consequences at a crucial stage of neuronal maturation.

Heparin-binding fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPGs, heparan sulfate proteoglycans; E10, embryonic day 10; SAX-HPLC, strong anion exchange-high pressure liquid chromatography; GlcA, glucuronic acid; AManR, reduced anhydromannose; IdoA, iduronic acid; GlcNAc, N-acetylated glucosamine; GlcNSO3,N-sulfated glucosamine; HexA, hexuronic acid. are essential regulators of mitogenesis and differentiation for the precursor cells of the mammalian central nervous system (1Murphy M. Drago J. Bartlett P.F. Neuroscience. 1990; 25: 463-475Google Scholar). As in many tissues, the bioactivity of the FGFs is partially regulated by the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). These carbohydrate chains are normally found attached to core proteins and cells lacking these heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are unable to transduce an FGF signal (2Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 3Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). One current hypothesis is that HSs serve to couple FGFs to specific HS-binding regions on competent FGF receptors (FGFRs) to form activating ternary complexes (4Brickman Y. Ford M.D. Small D.H. Bartlett P.F. Nurcombe V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24941-24948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). We have previously purified two different species of HSPG from embryonic murine neuroepithelia: from embryonic day 10 (E10) cells, when an HSPG with an affinity for FGF-2 was found and whose sugar chains are herein designated as HS2, and from E12 neuroepithelial cells, when an HSPG with an affinity for FGF-1 is expressed, and whose sugar chains are called HS1 (6Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Ford M.D. Bartlett P.F. Nurcombe V. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This switch in HSPG activating activity was coincident with a similar switch in FGF expression. As the HSPG core protein carrying the two HS species appeared to be the same (6Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) then presumably differences in HS structure between E10 and E12 must account for the change in FGF specificity. As specific HS species are essential to FGF activation, knowledge of the structures is clearly crucial to understanding their potentiating functions. Variation in HS species arises from the synthesis of non-random, highly sulfated sequences of sugar residues which are separated by unsulfated regions of disaccharides containingN-acetylated glucosamine. The initial conversion ofN-acetylglucosamine to N-sulfoglucosamine creates a focus for other modifications, including epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid and a complex pattern of O-sulfations on glucosamine or iduronic acids (8Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Steward W.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Lindahl U. Kjellen L. Wight T.N. Mecham R.P. The Biology of the Extracellular Matrix: Biology of Proteoglycans. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Orlando, FL1987: 59-104Google Scholar). In addition, within the non-modified, low sulfated, N-acetylated sequences, the hexuronate residues remain as glucuronate, whereas in the highly sulfated N-sulfated regions, the C-5 epimer iduronate predominates (10Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12989-12996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

This limits the number of potential disaccharide variants possible in any given chain but not the abundance of each. Most modifications occur in the N-sulfated domains, or directly adjacent to them, so that in the mature chain there are regions of high sulfation separated by domains of low sulfation (12Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

Gallagher J.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This pattern distinguishes HS from heparin, which is essentially highly sulfated along its entire length. Some of these modifications have been shown to be essential in creating unique binding sites for molecules such as antithrombin III, FGF-2, hepatocyte growth factor, and interferon-γ (16Saksela O.

The possibility therefore exists that such modifications may create specific binding sites for different members of the FGF family and many other extracellular matrix molecules.

The main aim of this study was to elucidate the structures of the two HS species which mediate either mitogenesis or differentiation in vivo, and to determine the structural properties that may account for the selectivity for the two FGFs. Although direct sequencing of whole HS chains is not yet feasible, methods for identifying specific structural elements within a pool of similar chains are available. The conjoint use of heparin lyases and nitrous acid digestion, low pressure chromatography, HPLC, and a unique tetrasaccharide analysis have allowed us to elucidate subtle structural and compositional differences between mixtures. The results of the structural analysis have led to the construction of a model for the changing HS pools. Trypsin was supplied by Calbiochem and DNase from Boehringer Mannheim. d-[6-3H]Glucosamine (specific activity 21 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Life Science. Heparitinases I (EC 4.2.2.8), II (no EC number assigned), and III (EC4.2.2.7) and chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan. Heparitinase IV was from Sigma (Sydney, Australia). Cell culture media was supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. Bio-Gel P-2 and P-10 were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. CL-6B gel, DEAE-Sephacel, columns, peristaltic pumps, fraction collectors, and tubing were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Sydney, Australia). ProPac PA1 analytical columns for the HPLC were from Dionex (Surrey, United Kingdom). Centriflo CF25 Membrane Cones were supplied by Amicon (Sydney, Australia). Scintillant (Ultima Gold) was from Packard (Melbourne, Australia) as were the scintillation vials. All chromatographic procedures were carried out a minimum of 3 times, and the standard errors on all peaks reported in this study were never more than 8%. Primary neuroepithelial cells were grown in 10% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2 ng/ml FGF-2 in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well for E10, and 200,000 cells/well for E12. Post-plating (30–60 min), 20 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine was added. Cultures were further incubated for 3–4 days, with the E12 cells being at confluence. HS from these preparations was designated HS2 and HS1 for E10- and E12-derived HS, respectively. The conditioned medium was removed and centrifuged (1000 rpm for 5 min) to remove any cell debris and stored at −20 °C until required. The conditioned media was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (3 ml) equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The media was manually loaded onto the column and eluted under gravity. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 250 mm NaCl in 50 mmphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The bound material was eluted with 1m NaCl in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline and 2-ml fractions collected. Fractions containing the [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycosaminoglycans were pooled, concentrated, and desalted on Centriflo Cones (as per manufacturer's instructions), freeze dried, and resuspended in a minimal volume (100–500 μl) of neuraminidase buffer (25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0). Samples were treated with neuraminidase (0.25 unit/sample) for 4 h. Five volumes of 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, were then added to the sample which was then digested with chondroitin ABC lyase (0.25 unit/sample) for 4 h at 37 °C and further digested overnight with an equal amount of fresh enzyme. Finally, the core protein and the lyases were digested away with Pronase (1/5 total volume of 10 mg/ml Pronase in 500 mmTris acetate, 50 mm calcium acetate, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 24 h. The entire mixture was then diluted 1:10 with deionized water, passed through a 2-ml DEAE-Sephacel column, eluted as described previously, and 1-ml fractions collected. The sample was finally desalted on a 1 × 35-cm Bio-Gel P-2 column, theVo fraction collected and freeze dried. To remove HS chains from trace amounts of core protein, samples were incubated in 500 mm NaOH, 1 m NaBH4 for 16 h at 4 °C and neutralized to pH 7 with glacial acetic acid. Concentrated ammonium bicarbonate was added and after the bubbling stopped, samples were run on a CL-6B column (1 × 120 cm) for sizing of the released HS chains (30Wasteson A. J. Chromatography. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed on these HS preparations as described under “Results.” HS was chemically depolymerized by low pH HNO2 (pH <1.5) as described by Shively and Conrad (31Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochem. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and modified by Bienkowski and Conrad (32Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Linkages susceptible to low pH HNO2 are those containingN-sulfates of the type GlcNSO3(±6S)α1–4UA(±2S) (11Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the resistant linkages are UA α1–4 (GlcNAc(±6S)α1–4GlcA)n-GlcNSO3. A small portion of the mixture was run on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1 × 200 cm) to obtain a profile of the fragments released by this treatment and the rest of the mixture was separated on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1 × 120 cm) to isolate disaccharides and tetrasaccharides for strong anion exchange-high pressure liquid chromatography (SAX-HPLC). Heparitinase (heparitinase I), heparitinase II, and heparitinase IV were used at a concentration of 25 milliunits/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.2 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0. Heparinase was used at a concentration of 50 milliunits/ml in the same buffer. Heparitinase I (also known as heparinase III) cleaves mainly at GlcNR(±6S)α1–4 GlcA linkages (R = N-acetyl orN-sulfate moiety) (11Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Linhardt R. Turnbull J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.

Heparitinase II (also known as heparinase II) has a wide spectrum of activity cleaving linkages of the type GlcNSO3(±6S)α1–4IdoA/Glc leading primarily to the generation of disaccharides from HS (33Linhardt R. Turnbull J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Gallagher J. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 2611-2617Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Heparinase (also known as heparitinase III) cleaves at linkages of the type GlcNSO3(±6)α1–4IdoA(2S) (11Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

For single enzyme digests, samples were separately incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then a second aliquot of enzyme added and incubated for a further 4 h. Sequential digests for recovery of disaccharides for SAX-HPLC analysis were performed in the presence of 100 μg of nonlabeled HS at 37 °C as follows: heparinase for 2 h, heparitinase for 1 h, heparitinase II for 18 h, and finally an aliquot of each lyase and heparitinase IV for 6 h. Sample volumes were decreased to less than 100 μl by desiccation and run on a Bio-Gel P-2 column to isolate disaccharides. Gel chromatography of intact chains or scission products was performed on Sepharose CL-6B (1 × 120 cm) or Bio-Gel P-2 (1 × 120 cm) or Bio-Gel P-10 (1 × 200 cm) columns. The running buffer for the CL-6B and Bio-Gel P-10 columns was 0.5 m NH4HCO3 and for the Bio-Gel P-2 column was 0.25 m NH4HCO3. Samples were routinely eluted at 4 ml/h with 1-ml fractions collected. For preparative runs, the radioactivity of a small aliquot of each fraction (1–10 μl) was monitored by liquid scintillation counting to ensure good separation and accurate isolation of fragments for further analysis. Estimates of the size of fragments resolved on Sepharose CL-6B were based on published calibrations (30Wasteson A. J. Chromatography. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Disaccharide composition of the HS was analyzed on SAX-HPLC after either complete depolymerization with a mixture of lyases as described above or HNO2 treatment. Disaccharides and/or tetrasaccharides were recovered by Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography and fractions corresponding to disaccharides or tetrasaccharides were pooled, freeze dried, and stored at −20 °C. The lyase-derived disaccharides were subjected to SAX-HPLC on a ProPac PA1 analytical column (4 × 250-mm Dionex Ltd.) as follows. After equilibration in the mobile phase (double-distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl) at 1 ml/min, samples were injected and disaccharides eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m over 45 min in the same mobile phase. The eluant was collected in 0.5-ml fractions and monitored for tritium-labeled disaccharide content for comparison with lyase-derived disaccharides standards. Nitrous acid-derived tetrasaccharides were subjected to the same conditions (with 0.25- or 0.5-ml fractions collected) and compared with double labeled standard results which were supplied by Dr. Gordon Jayson (Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK). Alternatively, HNO2-derived disaccharides were separated using two ProPac PA1 columns in series in the same mobile phase. A shallow, non-continuous gradient was used over the course of 97 min. After a 1-min injection phase, a 50-min gradient from 0 to 150 mm NaCl was employed, followed by a 70-min gradient of 150–500 mm NaCl. The eluant was collected as described above and compared with standards. Major peaks are labeled in Fig. 3 A and three minor disaccharide peaks eluted as follows: GlcA(2S)-AManR between 43.75 and 44 min, GlcA-AManR(3S) between 45.75 and 46.5 min, and GlcA-AManR(3,6S) between 104 and 106 min. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed as described previously (34Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 3H-labeled HS samples were incubated with 5 μg of the appropriate FGF for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and the complex immobilized by vacuum filtration onto a 25-mm diameter nitrocellulose filter. The HS was then step eluted by consecutively vacuum filtering a series of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, solutions (5 ml each) containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and 2000 mm) through the nitrocellulose membrane. Radioactivity in the filtrate at each NaCl concentration was measured by scintillation counting. The structural features of the HS chains were investigated using established protocols (12Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Turnbull J.E. Graham J. Higgins J. Methods in Molecular Biology.

HS chains (derived by Pronase and mild alkali treatment) were chromatographed on Sepharose CL-6B columns either intact, or after heparinase treatment (Fig. 1 and Table I). Both pools of HSPGs showed a partial resistance to proteolysis by Pronase, characteristic of proteoglycans, which are densely substituted with polysaccharide chains. This data indicates that there are at least two HS chains per core protein in each preparation, and that their attachment sites are located close together. HS2 and HS1 eluted at Kav of 0.46 and 0.36, respectively, which corresponds to average molecular masses of 25 and 40 kDa when compared with published calibrations (30Wasteson A. J. Chromatography. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Assuming an average molecular mass of 400 Da per disaccharide, HS2 and HS1 are 60 and 100 disaccharides in length, respectively. The HS expressed early in development is thus smaller than the more mature chains, indicating significant structural changes underlying the functional differences exhibited in previous studies.Table IA summary of the estimated Mr of extracellular-HS from the two samples examined in this studyConditionHS2HS1Pronase (Da)40,00070,000Mild alkaline (Da)25,00040,000Heparinase (Da)7,0005,000No. heparinase-resist domains27–8 Open table in a new tab To determine the number and general organization of N-sulfated disaccharides the HS samples were subjected to low pH HNO2 treatment. Low pH scission releases the N-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate with subsequent cleavage of the adjacent hexosaminidic bond. This gave elution profiles (Fig. 2 A) with a typical distribution ofN-sulfated disaccharides characteristic of HS (38Gallagher J.T. Walker A. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). From these profiles it is possible to calculate the percentage of linkages susceptible to this treatment and thus the percentage ofN-sulfated glucosamine residues in the HS chains. HS2 was significantly more susceptible to nitrous acid cleavage than HS1 (Table II). As the similarities between the profiles confirm, the results also show the strong tendency of theN-sulfated disaccharides to occur in contiguous or mixed sequences. There is a small decrease in the proportion of repeatingN-acetylated disaccharide sequences in HS1 that might be due to a reduction in the spacing between the sulfated domains.Table IIProportion of the linkages susceptible to low pH HNO2, heparitinase and heparinase in HS2 and HS1TreatmentHS2HS1%Heparitinase61.565Heparinase15.316.7HNO249.053.0 Open table in a new tab Heparinase-treated oligosaccharides were separated on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (Fig. 2 B). The molecular mass of the heparinase-resistant domains in HS corresponds to the average distance between the centers of highly sulfated regions which contain heparinase-susceptible linkages. Analysis of the percentage of small oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization 2–6) (inset Fig. 2 B) released by this treatment revealed that HS2 released approximately 50% fewer small oligosaccharides then HS1. Estimation of the molecular size of the material excluded from the P-10 column by CL-6B chromatography (Fig. 1 B) showed that the major peaks correspond to molecular weights of 7,000 and 5,000 (Table I), respectively, for HS2 and HS1, although there is considerable overlap of the two peaks, indicating a broad similarity in size distribution. The results do suggest a tendency for closer average positioning of the sulfated domains in the more mature E12 chains, although more work will have to be done to confirm this point. Heparinase therefore cuts the HS2 chains into 3–4 segments but in contrast cuts the HS1 chains into 7–8 segments. HS2 is therefore less complex in domain structure than HS1. Heparitinase treatment of the samples yielded elution profiles (Fig. 2 C) which were also characteristic of HS (12Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The heparitinase cleavage also tends to confirm that the sulfated domains are broadly similar in size from E10 to E12, the only significant difference being a decrease in the tetrasaccharide peak in HS1. Quantitative analysis of the profiles demonstrated that 61 and 65% of the linkages in HS2 and HS1 were susceptible to this treatment, respectively (i.e. GlcA-containing disaccharides), a result which indicates that the sizes of the (heparitinase-resistant) sulfated domains in both E10 and E12 material are broadly similar. The remaining disaccharides must contain IdoA or IdoA(2S), indicating that there is a slightly higher content of IdoA(±2S) residues in HS2 chains. Since HS2 is less susceptible to heparinase (Table II), which cleaves at IdoA(2S) residues, and contains less 2-O-sulfated disaccharides (see Tables III and IV) this indicates that it contains a higher level of unsulfated iduronate than HS1.Table IIINitrous acid-derived disaccharide composition of heparan sulfate from HS preparations from two developmental stages of neuroepitheliaDisaccharideHS2HS1IdoA/GlcA-AManR12.913.9IdoA(2S)-AManR53.444.8GlcA-AManR(6S)10.211.4IdoA-AManR(6S)3.42.7IdoA(2S)-AManR(6S)18.724.8GlcA(2S)-AManR1.01.8GlcA-AManR(3S)0.300.4GlcA-AManR(3,6S)0.150.2Unknown0.00.0 Open table in a new tab Table IVLyase-derived disaccharide composition of heparan sulfate from the two sources of HSPeakDisaccharideHS2HS1%1ΔHexUA-GlcNAc44.844.83ΔHexUA-GlcNSO321.520.02ΔHexUA-GlcNAc(6S)8.06.77ΔHexUA(2S)-GlcNAc2.44.34ΔHexUA-GlcNSO3(6S)4.04.35ΔHexUA(2S)-GlcNSO312.411.38ΔHexUA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S)0.20.36ΔHexUA(2S)-GlcNSO3(6S)4.16.49Unknown2.41.8 Open table in a new tab Oligosaccharides derived by HNO2treatment of HS were reduced with sodium borohydride, separated on a Bio-Gel P-2 column, pooled, and freeze dried. SAX-HPLC separation of disaccharides resulted in the elution profiles in Fig. 3. Nitrous acid cleaves hexosaminidic bonds in HS leading to the production of saccharides with an authentic nonreducing end uronic acid, but the loss of N2 from the reducing end glucosamine and its conversion to a 2,5-anhydromannose residue. For SAX-HPLC, this moiety was reduced to 2,5-anhydromannitol. Each disaccharide peak was identified according to its elution time in comparison with standard HNO2-derived disaccharides. These results are summarized in Table III where the area under each peak has been integrated and shown as a percentage of total disaccharides released by HNO2 digestion. The major differences are a decrease in IdoA(2S)-AManR and increases in both IdoA(2S)-AManR(6S) and GlcA(2S)-AManR accompanying the transition from E10 to E12. Overall, there is a slight increase in total sulfation in the contiguous N-sulfated domains of HS1 when compared with HS2. HS2 is therefore less sulfated than its more mature counterpart HS1. To fully characterize the composition of the samples of HS, the chains were subjected to complete lyase depolymerization using heparitinases I, II, III, and IV. The products of this digestion were separated on a Bio-Gel P-2 column with over 95% of the radioactivity accounted for in the disaccharide peaks (data not shown), indicating sufficiently complete digestion to provide a representative compositional analysis. For analysis on SAX-HPLC, the disaccharides were pooled and freeze dried. The peaks in Fig. 4 were identified by reference to authentic standards (38Gallagher J.T. Walker A. Biochem.

The principal component of the plaque is the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), a 39–43-residue peptide. The conformational change required for the conversion of soluble peptide into amyloid fibrils is modulated by pH, Aβ concentration, addition of kinetic and thermodynamic enhancers, and alterations in the primary sequence of Aβ. We report here the ability of gangliosides to induce an α-helical structure in Aβ and thereby diminish fibrillogenesis. Circular dichroism and a fluorescence dye release assay data indicate that gangliosides interact with and induce α-helix formation in Aβ. We find that the sialic acid moiety of gangliosides is necessary for the induction of α-helical structure. Differences in the amount and the position of the sialic acid on the carbohydrate backbone also affect the conformational switch. The Aβ-ganglioside interaction at pH 7.0, monitored by CD, is stable over time and resistant to high concentrations of NaCl. The induction of α-helical structure is greater with Aβ1–40 than Aβ1–42. The ability of gangliosides to sequester Aβ from fibril formation was also evaluated by electron microscopy.

Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that amyloid fibrils are intimately associated with neuronal, microglial, and endothethial membranes. Cell processes are extended out into close proximity of amyloid deposits (20Yamaguchi H. Nakazato Y. Hirai S. Shoji M. Harigaya Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 593-597PubMed Google Scholar, 21Weigel J.

In addition, cell culture experiments have demonstrated that Aβ neurotoxicity is dependent on the formation of β-structure and fibrils (12Simmons L.K. May P.C. Tomaselli K.J. Rydel R.E. Fuson K.S.

Therefore, it is of interest to investigate possible Aβ interactions that decrease β-structure transitions, fibril formation, and subsequent neurotoxicity. We report here the investigation of the ability of various gangliosides to induce an α-helical structure in Aβ40 and Aβ42. It was our aim to investigate whether a specific ganglioside could reproduce the structural transition seen with mixed gangliosides and whether this was a function of the ceramide backbone or variation in carbohydrate and sialic acid content. We also investigated the effect of mixed gangliosides on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibril formation using electron microscopy. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were purchased from U.S. Peptide Inc. (Rancho Cucamonga, CA). To minimize the presence of endogenous fibril nucleation seeds, peptides were initially dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich), diluted in distilled H2O, and immediately lyophilized. The lyophilized peptide was then dissolved in 40% trifluoroethanol (TFE, Aldrich) in H2O and stored at −20 °C until use. Pure lipids or mixtures of lipids consisting of bovine brain phosphatidylcholine (PC), bovine brain mixed ganglioside preparation, the monosialogangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, disialoganglioside GD1a, trisialoganglioside GT1b, ceramide, sulfatide, and sphingomyelin were dissolved at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in either chloroform or chloroform:methanol (2:1). Bovine brain PC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids; all other lipids were purchased from Sigma. Mixed ganglioside preparations are composed of predominantly GM1, and the remainder consists of the GM, GD, and GT series of gangliosides as well as other minor gangliosides. An aliquot of each lipid was dried under a stream of nitrogen, lyophilized overnight, and suspended in PBS, pH 7.0, in the presence or absence of a saturated solution of 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Lipid suspensions were carried through 10 cycles of freeze-thaw in a acetone:dry ice bath. Unilamellar vesicles were then prepared by sonication for 30 min or until the solution cleared in a bath sonicator (Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT). Column chromatography on Sepharose 4B (Sigma) (1.5 × 12 cm) was used to separate free dye from dye-loaded vesicles. Discontinuous sucrose gradients were prepared by layering 10 and 40% sucrose solutions. To the top of each tube, 100 μl of sample was layered, and the gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in an SW 55Ti rotor in a Beckman LA70 Ultracentrifuge. A total of 20 fractions were collected using an ISCO Density Gradient Fractionator model 640. The lipid vesicles were detected using the Bartlett assay for phosphorus (34Barlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the peptide was detected by Tyr absorbance at 275 nm. Fractions exhibiting Tyr absorbance were confirmed to contain Aβ peptide by dot-blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-Aβ antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) and ECL detection. Dye-loaded vesicles were diluted in PBS, pH 6.0 or pH 7.0, to a final lipid concentration of 20 μm (35McLean L.R. Baron B.M. Buck S.H. Krstenansky J.L. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After 50 s incubation (with continual stirring), Aβ peptide samples, bee venom mellitin (Sigma), or solvent controls were added at a 1:20 peptide:lipid ratio. The final peptide concentration was 1.0 μm. To monitor dye leakage, we used a Photon Technology International Fluorimeter (London, Ontario, Canada). Excitation was at 506 nm, and emission was monitored at 524 nm with a 4-nm bandwidth. Data was collected at a rate of one data point every 5 s. At the end of the experiment, 10% Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.3% to obtain complete dye release and measure total fluorescence. Vesicles were not used unless the total fluorescence was greater than 200% of the initial fluorescence and the spontaneous diffusion of dye was less than 10% of the total fluorescence. The percentage of total dye release was defined as indicated in Equation 1. %dye release=100%×(observed fluorescence−initial fluorescence)(total fluorescence−initial fluorescence)Equation 1 CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spectrometer model 62DS (Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C. Spectra were obtained from 200 to 260 nm, with a 0.5-nm step, 1-nm bandwidth, and 20-s collection time per step. Peptide:lipid ratios were maintained at 1:20 with a final peptide concentration of 10 μm. The effect of various lipids on peptide conformation was determined by adding an aliquot of stock peptide solutions to lipid vesicles suspended in PBS with continuous stirring. The contribution of lipid vesicles to the CD signal was removed by subtracting the CD spectra of pure lipid vesicles from the CD spectra of peptide:lipid suspensions. Peptide conformations in 40% TFE:H2O were determined under the same conditions. When ellipticity at either 218 or 222 nm was measured, data were collected at a rate of 1 s/point for 300 data points. For negative staining, carbon-coated pioloform grids were floated on aqueous solutions of peptides (30 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of lipids (1:20, peptide:lipid ratio). After grids were blotted and air-dried, the samples were stained with 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid. The peptide assemblies were observed in a Hitachi 7000 operated at 75 kV. We have used synthetic lipid vesicles as a model system to investigate the interactions of Aβ with ganglioside containing cellular membranes. Gangliosides alone are unable to form stable vesicles (36Sarti P. Antonini G. Malatesta F. Vallone B. Brunori M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Tettamanti G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); consequently, the various gangliosides were mixed with PC in a 1:1 ratio (by weight) to produce stable vesicles. We have previously demonstrated that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are unable to cause membrane disruption and aggregation of PC vesicles (19McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 28McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The ability of Aβ40 and Aβ42 to bind PC, mixed gangliosides, and GM1 was investigated using a binding assay that utilized sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Mixed ganglioside:PC, GM1:PC, and PC vesicles were incubated with either Aβ40 or Aβ42 (Fig. 1). The Aβ-bound vesicles were separated from unbound vesicles by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in a 10–40% discontinuous sucrose gradient. The presence of peptide in the various fractions was detected by Tyr absorbance and dot-blot analyses with an anti-Aβ polyclonal antibody; lipid was detected by phosphorus assay. When samples containing Aβ40 and PC vesicles were examined, all the peptide was recovered near the top of the gradient, although the vesicles were found near the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were seen for Aβ42 incubated with PC vesicles (data not shown). However, when vesicles were made with mixed gangliosides and PC, the Aβ40 peptide was recovered further down the sucrose gradient coincident with fractions containing vesicles (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were seen for Aβ42-mixed ganglioside:PC vesicles and when both peptides were incubated with GM1:PC vesicles (data not shown). These results demonstrate that although Aβ40 and Aβ42 do not bind to PC vesicles, they bind ganglioside:PC vesicles, suggesting that any effects observed with ganglioside:PC vesicles will be solely the result of Aβ-ganglioside interactions. To investigate further the Aβ-ganglioside interaction, we employed a dye release assay. 5-(and 6-)Carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorocarboxyfluorescein is incorporated into various lipid vesicles at a concentration that induces self-quenching. The addition of a membrane disrupting molecule results in the release of dye and an increase in fluorescence. The integrity of the vesicles was determined by monitoring the spontaneous diffusion of dye over time. If the spontaneous dye release exceeded 10% of the total release or if bee venom mellitin did not induce 100% dye release, then the vesicles were not used in this study. The interaction of peptides with lipid vesicles may induce dye leakage as a result of peptide surface binding that disrupts vesicle integrity, penetration of the lipid membrane, or micellar fusion (37Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). We investigated the ability of Aβ40 and Aβ42 to induce dye leakage from lipid vesicles at pH 7.0 (Table I).Table IPercentage dye releaseTFEAβ40Aβ42Mixed3.3 ± 350.0 ± 3.50.2 ± 4.4GM15.7 ± 1.325.8 ± 1.74.3 ± 0.8GM25.4 ± 3.823.2 ± 1.64.3 ± 1.1GM35.6 ± 1.26.3 ± 6.75.4 ± 2.6GD1a6.3 ± 1.76.3 ± 5.13.7 ± 5.3GT1b13.3 ± 0.912.7 ± 4.29.9 ± 0.7Sph4.9 ± 2.414 ± 3.026.1 ± 1.4Ceramide18.5 ± 1.018.6 ± 1.318.5 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab We have previously demonstrated that Aβ40 is able to induce dye release from mixed ganglioside:PC and GM1:PC vesicles at pH 7.0, whereas Aβ42 could not (19McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To determine if this is a general phenomenon associated with all gangliosides or if there is a dependence on the carbohydrate and sialic acid content, we investigated the ability of Aβ40 and Aβ42 to induce dye leakage from vesicles containing GM2, GM3, GD1a, and GT1b (Table I). Aβ40 was able to induce dye leakage from GM2 containing vesicles but not GM3, GD1a, and GT1b containing vesicles. These results indicate that the position and amount of carbohydrate affect the Aβ40-ganglioside interaction. The inability of Aβ40 to induce leakage from ceramide containing vesicles confirms that the ganglioside head group, which is missing in ceramide, is critical for Aβ-ganglioside interaction. Aβ42 was unable to induce dye leakage from all ganglioside containing vesicles. On the glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway, ceramide is a precursor of gangliosides, cerebrosides, or sphingomyelin. We found that Aβ40 and Aβ42 were able to cause dye leakage from sphingomyelin vesicles (Table I). These results are surprising since the head group of sphingomyelin is either phosphorylethanolamine or phosphorylcholine, and their physical properties are very similar to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine. Previously, we have shown that Aβ40 and Aβ42 do not disrupt PE or PC vesicles (28McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The difference between sphingomyelin and PC:PE is the fatty acyl composition, the former containing one fatty acyl chain and one hydrocarbon chain of sphingosine, whereas the latter contains 2 fatty acyl chains. Variation in the dye release assay may result from the inability of the sphingosine group to pack efficiently in vesicle systems, thereby allowing access to the hydrophobic core of the lipid. Aβ40-induced dye release from mixed ganglioside and GM1 containing vesicles plateaus before 100% dye release; this may be the result of multiple vesicle types present in our system, one of which is accessible to disruption and another which is inaccessible. Alternatively, Aβ40 may have a strong interaction with a limited number of lipid molecules where it becomes sequestered, thereby leaving a number of vesicles unaffected. To differentiate between these two possibilities, the dependence of dye release on peptide concentration was examined. Incremental increases in concentrations of Aβ40 resulted in a stepwise increase in dye release from both mixed ganglioside:PC and GM1:PC vesicles (Fig. 2 A). The step-shaped Aβ40-ganglioside dye release curves suggested that binding of Aβ40 to mixed ganglioside or GM1 containing vesicles is effectively irreversible. Increasing concentrations of Aβ42 failed to induce dye leakage from either mixed ganglioside:PC or GM1:PC vesicles (Fig. 2 B). The data from the dye release and the sucrose gradient assays suggest that although Aβ42 is able to bind gangliosides, its interaction with the ganglioside head group does not induce disruption of the bilayer. The conformation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the presence of GM2, GM3, GD1a, GT1b containing vesicles was investigated by CD spectroscopy. As reported previously, Aβ40 (Fig. 3 A) and Aβ42 (Fig. 4 A) in 40% trifluoroethanol are partly α-helical (19McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 38Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Upon dilution into PBS, at pH 6.0 or pH 7.0, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 adopt a random structure at early time points (Figs. 3 A and 4 A). We have previously demonstrated that the interaction of Aβ40 and Aβ42 with mixed ganglioside:PC (Figs. 3 B and 4 B) and GM1:PC vesicles results in a α/β conformation at pH 7.0 but a β-structured conformation at pH 6.0 (19McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although Aβ40 interacts with GM2:PC vesicles, as demonstrated by the dye release assay, this is not accompanied by a significant change in the CD spectrum at either pH 6.0 or pH 7.0 (Fig. 3, C and D). GM3:PC vesicles were also unable to induce CD changes. Similarly, Aβ42 did not undergo significant changes in CD in the presence of GM2:PC or GM3:PC vesicles at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 (Fig. 4, C and D).Figure 4Circular dichroism spectra of Aβ42 in the presence or absence of various lipids.

Although Aβ40 did not induce dye release from GT1b:PC vesicles, the interaction with GT1b containing vesicles induces β-structure at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3 F). Aβ42 was unable to induce membrane disruption of GD1a:PC and GT1b:PC vesicles, but these interactions induce β-structure formation at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 (Fig. 4,E and F). It is interesting that the extent of β-structure is identical at pH 6.0 and pH 7.0; this is similar to the structural transition of Aβ42 in the presence of phosphatidylinositol vesicles (28McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These results imply that Aβ42 is interacting with the ganglioside head group and that induction of β-structure does not affect membrane integrity. We have previously demonstrated that asialo-GM1:PC vesicles were unable to induce the structural transitions of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, implying a critical role for the sialic acid moiety (19McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Neither ceramide nor sialic acid alone could induce the partly helical structure seen in Aβ40- and Aβ42-mixed ganglioside-PC interactions at pH 7.0 (Fig. 5). Similarly, these components could not induce β-structure in Aβ40 at pH 6.0. These results imply that although the sialic acid is critical for structure formation, its association with the carbohydrate backbone is also necessary. Both ceramide and sialic acid induced a small change in the structure of Aβ42 at pH 6.0. The ability of ceramide alone to induce a structural change may be the result of the presence of both a hydrogen acceptor (amide carbonyl) and a hydrogen donor (hydroxyl group) on ceramide, which we have previously shown to be necessary for β-structural transitions (28McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As previously noted, ceramide is a biosynthetic precursor to gangliosides, sphingomyelin and cerebrosides. To determine if the ability of Aβ40 and Aβ42 to induce dye release from sphingomyelin vesicles at pH 7.0 has a structural correlate, we investigated the ability of sphingomyelin to induce structure in Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 5, C and F). β-Structure was evident in Aβ42 in the presence of sphingomyelin at pH 6.0 but not pH 7.0. The ability of sulfated cerebrosides (sulfatides) to induce β-structure in Aβ40 and Aβ42 was investigated in light of the importance of sulfated glycosaminoglycans to enhance Aβ-fibrillogenesis (10Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Chin D.T. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 11Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J.

Pathol. 1988; 133: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a structural change in either Aβ40 or Aβ42 in the presence of sulfatide containing vesicles (data not shown). These results suggest that sulfated cerebrosides do not function in a similar manner to sulfated glycosaminoglycans during fibrillogenesis. The relative concentration of ganglioside required to induce the structural transitions in Aβ40 was determined at both pH 7.0 and pH 6.0 (Fig. 6). The ganglioside content was decreased by decreasing the ganglioside:PC ratio. The ability of mixed gangliosides or GM1 to induce α-helical structure was monitored at 222 nm. Decreasing the GM1:PC ratio of the lipid vesicles, from 0.5 to 0.33, eliminated the Aβ40 structural transition to α-helix at pH 7.0 (Fig. 6 A). On the other hand, decreasing the mixed ganglioside:PC ratio from 0.5 to 0.1 reduced helical content by only 36% (Fig. 6 B). These results may suggest that there is an unidentified ganglioside that induces more stable helix formation than GM1, or alternatively, mixed gangliosides can segregate within PC vesicles to a higher extent than GM1 enabling the necessary environment for the structural transition (36Sarti P. Antonini G. Malatesta F. Vallone B. Brunori M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Tettamanti G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar to the GM1 results, when the mixed ganglioside:PC ratio is decreased from 0.5 to 0.3, the ability to induce β-structure in Aβ40 at pH 6.0 is eliminated (Fig. 6 C). The monotonic relationship between β-structure and ganglioside content suggests that the structural transition does not involve the formation of a discrete peptide-ganglioside complex but is an interaction between the peptide and negatively charged regions of the membrane. These results are consistent with the β-structural transitions induced by acidic phospholipids (28McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The interaction of Aβ40 with mixed ganglioside containing vesicles may be the result of electrostatic and/or hydrophobic interactions. The ability of increasing concentrations of NaCl to shield charges on both Aβ and lipid vesicles can give an indication of the contribution of electrostatic interactions to the stability of the Aβ-ganglioside complex. The α-helical content of Aβ40 in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl was monitored at 222 nm, and β-structure was monitored at 218 nm. At pH 7.0, the helical structure was retained even at 1.0 m NaCl (Fig. 7 A). These results imply that the α-helical structure is not stabilized by charge interactions. At pH 6.0, the amount of β-structure present in Aβ40 decreased by one-third at 120 mm NaCl and did not change significantly up to 1 m NaCl (Fig. 7 B). These results indicate that the β-structure seen in Aβ40-ganglioside interactions is stabilized by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. When Aβ42-ganglioside interactions were monitored in NaCl concentrations up to 1 m and at pH 6.0, the amount of β-structure decreased. These results suggest that electrostatic interactions are"

In some cells, Bcl-xL overexpression can inhibit anti-Fas- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced apoptosis. To address the effect of Bcl-xL on caspase-8 processing, Fas- and TNFR1-mediated apoptosis were studied in the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line stably transfected with human Fas cDNA (MCF7/F) or double transfected with Fas and human Bcl-xL cDNAs (MCF7/FB). Bcl-xL strongly inhibited apoptosis induced by either anti-Fas or TNF-α. In addition, Bcl-xL prevented the change in cytochrome c immunolocalization induced by anti-Fas or TNF-α treatment. Using antibodies that recognize the p20 and p10 subunits of active caspase-8, proteolytic processing of caspase-8 was detected in MCF7/F cells following anti-Fas or TNF-α, but not during UV-induced apoptosis. In MCF7/FB cells, caspase-8 was processed normally while processing of the downstream caspase-7 was markedly attenuated. Moreover, apoptosis induced by direct microinjection of recombinant, active caspase-8 was completely inhibited by Bcl-xL. These data demonstrate that Bcl-xL can exert an anti-apoptotic function in cells in which caspase-8 is activated.

When activated by receptor aggregation, Fas and TNFR1 induce the activation of a set of cysteine proteases called caspases (5Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S.

The importance of caspases in mediating Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis has been demonstrated by the ability of both viral and small molecule caspase inhibitors to prevent apoptosis mediated by Fas and TNFR1 signaling (5Enari M.

The mechanisms by which Fas and TNFR1 stimulation lead to caspase activation are currently being elucidated. In the case of Fas, receptor aggregation either by Fas ligand or by antibody cross-linking induces the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) of proteins comprising Fas itself, an adaptor protein, FADD, and the inactive, zymogen form of caspase-8 (FLICE, MACH, and MCH5) (14Muzio M.

Shortly after formation of the DISC, procaspase-8 is proteolytically cleaved and the active protease, containing p20 and p10 subunits, is released from the DISC (17Medema J.P. Scaffidi C.

A similar DISC, involving TNFR1, TRADD, FADD, and procaspase-8, is thought to mediate TNF-induced apoptosis (15Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Bcl-xL also has been shown to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis (28Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL localize in cells to the cytoplasmic membranes of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei (29Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Screiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J.

Given the intracellular localization of Bcl-2 family members and the plasma membrane-localized, DISC-associated processing of procaspase-8, we were interested in determining whether Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 inhibit caspase-8 processing during Fas and TNFR1 stimulation. We chose to study MCF7 breast carcinoma cells transfected to express human Fas or doubly transfected to express human Fas and human Bcl-xL. Since MCF7 cells express TNFR1 endogenously, this afforded the opportunity to study both Fas and TNFR1 mediated apoptosis in the same cell. In this study, we demonstrate that, although MCF7 cells overexpressing Bcl-xL are protected from anti-Fas- or TNF-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 is processed with normal kinetics. In addition, Bcl-xL blocks apoptosis induced by microinjection of active caspase-8. Thus, Bcl-xLcan block apoptosis in cells in which caspase-8 has been activated. MCF7 cells stably transfected with human Fas cDNA (MCF7/F) or both human Fas and human Bcl-xL cDNAs (MCF7/FB) (kind gifts of Dr. V. Dixit, Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 μg/ml neomycin, and 150 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells at 60–75% confluence were co-treated with either 50 ng/ml anti-Fas (MBL, PanVera Labs, Madison, WI) plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide or 40 ng/ml TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide. For UV treatment, cells were irradiated with 100 mJ/cm2 short wavelength UV (UV Crosslinker, Fisher) and then incubated at 37 °C. At various times, cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman and centrifuging at 700 × g. Cells (∼20 million/plate) were lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% CHAPS). Following a 30-min incubation on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the clear supernatants were used for Western analysis. Protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein determination kit (Bio-Rad). Caspase-8 cDNA with most of the prodomain sequence (corresponding to amino acids 1–212) deleted was cloned into pET21b (Novagen, Madison, WI), transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and expressed as a COOH-terminal 6-His fusion protein. Bacterial cultures grown in LB/ampicillin at 37 °C were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C, and cell pellets were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C. Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonicating the pellets in 25 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, and centrifuging at 4 °C (30,000 × g for 40 min). His-tagged caspase-8 was purified from bacterial lysate by nickel chromatography using a Hi-trap column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with an imidazole gradient buffer (60 mm to 1m). The protein eluted from the column was found to be processed to p20 and p10 subunits and was enzymatically active (specific activity = 0.111 μmol of AMC/mg of protein/min). Unit activity of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme required to generate 1 μmol of AMC/h from 10 μm AcDEVD-AMC substrate in a 250 μl of assay mixture. To generate antibodies to caspase-8, rabbits were immunized with recombinant caspase-8 prepared as described above. Affinity purification columns were generated by binding denatured caspase-8 to cross-linked 6% beaded agarose through sulfhydryl groups (Sulfolink Kit, Pierce). Columns were incubated with the immune serum overnight and followed by washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Caspase-8 antibodies were eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5 (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 285-317Google Scholar). Specificity of the affinity purified caspase-8 antibody was confirmed by Western blotting against a panel of recombinant human caspases (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10). The caspase-8 antibody strongly recognized the p20 and p10 subunits of caspase-8 and cross-reacted only with p17, but not the p10, subunit of caspase-3. To generate the monoclonal antibody 1E8, mice were immunized with the peptide CRGTELDCGIETD (corresponding to the COOH terminus of the p20 subunit of human CPP32) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the amino terminus. B cells from excised spleens were fused with Sp2/0 myeloma cells. Hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western analysis. Single cell cloning was done by limiting dilution, and IgG was purified from monoclonal supernatants of large scale cultures using a protein G-Sepharose column (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 285-317Google Scholar). The 1E8 monoclonal was tested against the panel of recombinant caspases (see above) and found to recognize the p20 subunits of caspase-3 and -7. The monoclonal antibody to procaspase-3 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Cell lysates (50 μg of protein/lane) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 16% gels (Novex, La Jolla, CA) and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) + 0.4% casein (I-block, Tropix, Bedford, MA). Blots were incubated in 1 μg/ml primary antibody diluted in PBST/casein for 1 h. Following three washes in PBST, blots were incubated for 1 h in 1:15,000 dilutions of alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Tropix) in PBST/casein. Blots were then washed twice with PBST, twice in assay buffer (10 mm diethanolamine, pH 10.0, 1 mm MgCl2), and then incubated in 250 μm chemiluminescent substrate CSPD (Tropix) in assay buffer and exposed to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight. MCF7/F and MCF7/FB cells were plated at 25,000 cells per chamber in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Cells were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for various times. Prior to immunostaining, cells were fixed in 10% formalin in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, and stored at 4 °C for up to 24 h. Fixed cells were blocked for 1 h in a buffer containing PBS, 10% normal goat serum, and 0.4% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in 0.5 μg/ml anti-cytochrome c antibody (clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA) in a buffer containing PBS, 2% normal goat serum, and 0.4% Triton X-100. Following three washes with PBST, cells were incubated for 1 h with 4 μg/ml Texas Red conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR). Finally, cells were washed three times with PBST and mounted. Phase contrast and fluorescent images were captured on a Sony CatsEye digital camera using appropriate filters. MCF7 cells were scored for apoptosis (phase bright, condensed cells) and for cytochrome c immunolocalization. For each time point, at least 150–250 cells were counted; each time course experiment constituted duplicate or triplicate slides. The data presented are from a single experiment but are representative of results obtained in three experiments. Cell microinjection was performed using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope fitted with an Eppendorf pressure injector (model 5246) and micromanipulator (model 5171). Microinjection needles (about 0.1-μm inner diameter) were made from glass capillaries using a horizontal electrode puller (Sutter Instrument, model P-97) and loaded using Eppendorf microloaders. MCF7/F or MCF7/FB cells were plated on glass cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf) 24 h prior to injection. To identify injected cells, the injectate contained 0.3% solution of dextran conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes) in water. Dye alone or dye plus active caspase-8 were injected into the cytoplasm of MCF7 cells (pressure, 80 to 100 hPa; time, 0.3 s). Cells were switched into fresh medium immediately after injection. The concentration of caspase-8 in the pipette was 60 ng/ml, equivalent to 3 units/μl of active enzyme. Based on the approximate volume delivered per cell (0.05 pl) (34Minaschek G. Bereiter-Hahn J. Berthold G. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the concentration of caspase-8 delivered per cell is estimated to be 3 fg or 1.5 × 10−7 units of activity. 100–150 cells were injected per condition and cells were examined at various time points by phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified morphologically as round, condensed, phase bright cells. Photomicrographs were prepared from digital images obtained using a Sony CatsEye digital camera. MCF7 breast carcinoma cells stably expressing Fas alone (MCF7/F) or Fas plus Bcl-xL (MCF7/FB) (35Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) were treated with anti-Fas/cycloheximide or TNF/cycloheximide or exposed to UV irradiation. As determined by cell rounding and nuclear condensation (Fig. 1 A), all three stimuli induced apoptosis in 70–90% of MCF7/F cells within 24 h (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, about 90% of the cells expressing Bcl-xL were resistant to Fas, TNF, or UV, remaining flat with nuclei that appeared normal by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 1,A and B) or after staining with Hoechst 33258 (data not shown). Bcl-2 has been shown to inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria in pre-apoptotic cells (36Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Cytochrome crelease from mitochondria of Bcl-xL-transfected MCF7 cells treated with anti-Fas or TNF was studied by immunocytochemistry using a cytochrome c monoclonal antibody. In untreated cells, cytochrome c was localized to mitochondria in a perinuclear, punctate staining pattern (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with previous observations (37Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4265) Google Scholar), cytochrome c immunolocalization changed markedly following treatment with the apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 2 A). Within 5 h of treatment with TNF, more than 10% of the MCF7/F cells had an altered cytochrome c staining pattern, increasing to >90% of the cells by 24 h (Fig. 2 B). The altered cytochrome c staining pattern observed was either one in which the immunoreactive cytochromec was no longer confined to mitochondria, but had become diffusely localized in the cytoplasm, or in which the cells became immunonegative for cytochrome c. In contrast, in the MCF7/FB cells TNF treatment did not lead to a significant change in the cytochrome c immunolocalization pattern (Fig. 2 A). Instead, 90% of the Bcl-xL-expressing cells at 24 h post TNF treatment had a normal staining pattern (Fig. 2 B). Similar observations were made on MCF7/FB cells treated with anti-Fas or UV radiation (data not shown). Thus, as observed in other apoptotic paradigms (37Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4265) Google Scholar, 39Kim C.N. Wang X. Huang Y. Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Fang G. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3115-3120PubMed Google Scholar), Bcl-xLexpression prevents the changes in cytochrome cimmunolocalization that accompany apoptosis induced by either Fas or TNFR1 stimulation. In summary, by several criteria (Figs. 1 and 2), heterologous expression of Bcl-xL protects MCF7 cells from Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis. Caspase-8 processing following treatment with anti-Fas or TNF was studied by immunoblotting using affinity-purified caspase-8 antibodies that recognize the p20 and p10 subunits, but not the proform, of caspase-8. The specificity of the caspase-8 antibody was determined by immunoblotting of purified recombinant human caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10. The caspase-8 antibody was highly selective for both the p20 and p10 subunits of caspase-8, cross-reacting only with the caspase-3 p17, but not p10, subunit (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the p20 subunit observed in the MCF7 cells following anti-Fas or TNF treatment (see below) was not caspase-3 p20, caspase-3 expression in MCF7/F cells was determined by immunoblotting with a caspase-3-specific monoclonal antibody. While caspase-3 was readily detected in extracts of Jurkat cells, there was no detectable caspase-3 in extracts of MCF7/F cells (Fig. 3 G). Thus, the p20 subunit observed following anti-Fas or TNF treatment corresponds to caspase-8 p20 and not caspase-3 p17. The p20 and p10 subunits of active caspase-8 were first detectable in lysates of anti-Fas and TNF treated MCF7/F cells at 2 and 4 h post-treatment, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). Caspase-8 p20 and p10 subunits were detectable out to 8 h following anti-Fas or TNF treatment but declined rapidly thereafter, becoming undetectable by 24 h. Caspase-8 processing previously described in other cell types (17Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) was similarly transitory but occurred with more rapid kinetics than observed here. Interestingly, caspase-8 processing was not observed in the UV treated MCF7/F cells at any time point following UV irradiation (Fig. 3 C). Caspase-8 processing was also not observed following treatment with 1 μm staurosporine (data not shown). Processing of caspase-8 was also studied in MCF7/FB cells following anti-Fas or TNF stimulation. The appearance of caspase-8 p20 and p10 subunits appeared with the same kinetics and to the same degree in Bcl-xL-expressing MCF7/FB cells as in the control MCF7/F cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, overexpression of Bcl-xL in MCF7 cells does not block processing of caspase-8, even though it blocks subsequent apoptosis. Caspase-7 processing was also studied in the MCF7/F and MCF7/FB cells using a monoclonal antibody, 1E8, that recognizes the p20 subunits of both caspase-3 and -7. In MCF7 cells, however, 1E8 recognizes only caspase-7 p20 (Fig. 3, D and E), since caspase-3 is not expressed at detectable levels (Fig. 3 G). As described previously for TNF (35Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W.-W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1621-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), caspase-7 was processed in MCF7 cells in response to anti-Fas, TNF treatment, or UV radiation (Fig. 3,D–F). Caspase-7 p20 was first detected at 4 h and peaked at 16 h following anti-Fas, TNF, or UV (Fig. 3,D–F). In contrast to MCF7/F cells, the appearance of the caspase-7 p20 subunit was substantially attenuated in the MCF7/FB cells following anti-Fas or TNF treatment and completely inhibited following UV irradiation (Fig. 3, D–F). Thus, although caspase-8 is processed normally in MCF7/FB cells, caspase-7 processing is partially inhibited by Bcl-xL. Caspase-7 processing in response to UV irradiation was completely suppressed in the MCF7/FB cells, whereas in response to anti-Fas or TNF, caspase-7 processing was not completely suppressed (Fig. 3). This suggested that the processed caspase-8 observed in anti-Fas or TNF treated MCF7/FB cells might be enzymatically active and could contribute to the initial processing of some caspase-7 directly, as observed in vitro (16Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To determine if the processed caspase-8 in MCF7/FB cells was indeed active, we attempted to measure caspase-8 protease activity in extracts of anti-Fas and TNF-treated cells at various time points. The tetrapeptide Ac-DEVD-AMC is a substrate for caspase-8 (16Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) as well as other caspases. However, no significant DEVD-cleaving activity was observed in MCF7 cell lysates at any time point following anti-Fas or TNF treatment (data not shown). Our inability to measure caspase-8 enzymatic activity in extracts of MCF7/F cells is probably due to the >100-fold lower rate of catalysis of DEVD-AMC substrate by caspase-8 as compared with caspase-3. 2J. Krebs, unpublished observations. Although we were unable to measure caspase-8 activity directly even in control MCF7/F cells, we hypothesized that if the processed caspase-8 in MCF7/FB cells was active, the MCF7/FB cells should be resistant to apoptosis induced by intracellular delivery of active caspase-8. Therefore, we compared the ability of caspase-8 to induce apoptosis in MCF7/F and MCF7/FB cells following microinjection of active, recombinant caspase-8. Microinjection of a solution containing 3 units/μl human caspase-8 led to apoptosis in 70% of MCF7/F cells by 6 h post-injection (Fig. 4). Caspase-8-injected cells displayed rounded morphology with condensed nuclei similar in appearance to either anti-Fas- or TNF-treated cells (Fig. 4 A). However, in MCF7/FB cells, apoptosis induced by microinjection of caspase-8 was nearly completely inhibited (Fig. 4 B). Caspase-8-injected MCF7/FB cells remained normal in appearance with a smooth, flattened morphology and normal nuclei (Fig. 4 A). Thus, Bcl-xL was capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by delivery of active caspase-8 into the cell cyotosol. This study demonstrates that caspase-8 is processed with normal kinetics in MCF7 cells rendered resistant to Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL. Thus, Bcl-xL can function to block apoptosis in cells in which the membrane proximal caspase-8 has been activated. Consistent with this observation, Bcl-xL inhibited MCF7 cell apoptosis induced by microinjection of recombinant, active caspase-8. In several Fas-expressing cell types studied thus far (17Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), caspase-8 is recruited to the membrane DISC following Fas ligation and is proteolytically processed from its 54-kDa zymogen form to an active protease containing p20 and p10 subunits (17Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). That caspase-8 functions as a component of a similar DISC comprising TNFR1, TRADD, and FADD has been suggested by the ability of a dominant negative mutation of procaspase-8 to inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis (15Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrating activation of caspase-8 in response to TNF treatment provides the first direct evidence that this caspase also functions in the TNFR1 signaling pathway. Interestingly, apoptosis induced by UV irradiation or staurosporine did not lead to caspase-8 processing in MCF7 cells, suggesting that these stimuli engage the apoptotic pathway independently of caspase-8. Stable expression of Bcl-xL in MCF7 cells greatly attenuated apoptotic changes observed following anti-Fas, TNF or UV treatment. A similar inhibition by Bcl-xL of anti-Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis has also been observed in MCF7 cells transiently transfected with Bcl-xL and in cells microinjected with purified recombinant Bcl-xL. 3R. Armstrong and F. Li, unpublished observations. Our observations place Bcl-xL downstream of activated caspase-8 processing in the Fas- and TNFR1-induced apoptotic cascade in MCF7 cells. Consistent with this conclusion, Bcl-xL was capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by microinjection of active caspase-8. Biochemical studies have shown that processed, active caspase-8 is released from the DISC following receptor stimulation (17Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Although we did not study Fas-induced DISC formation directly, we would predict that it occurs normally in the Bcl-xL overexpressing cells. Although the subcellular localization and targets of activated caspase-8 are unknown, caspase-8 microinjected into the cytosol may have access to the targets of endogenous caspase-8. If true, then the caspase-8-injected cells are a good model of the anti-Fas- and TNF-treated cells. In both paradigms, Bcl-xL overexpression curtailed the apoptotic signaling cascade initiated by active caspase-8. A previous study demonstrated that Bcl-xL could inhibit apoptosis in Jurkat cells in which caspase-like activity was not completely suppressed (28Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that caspase-8 could have been activated in that Bcl-xL paradigm as well. How does Bcl-xL prevent apoptosis after the activation of the receptor-associated caspase-8 protease? The target substrates of caspase-8 in cells are unknown. Based on in vitro data, caspase-3, -6, and -7 could be downstream targets of caspase-8 (16Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,22Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), thus propagating the caspase signal. Alternatively, caspase-8 could cleave noncaspase targets, thus altering their functions (40Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Whatever proteins function as caspase-8 targets, overexpression of Bcl-xL must attenuate either their cleavage or the consequences of those cleavages. Bcl-xL, like Bcl-2, is thought to exert its antiapoptotic function in association with the intracellular membranes of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei (29Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Screiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar, 30Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C.

Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nùñez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could consider several possible models for Bcl-xL function in the system described herein. Bcl-xL could function to inhibit cytosolic caspase-8 protease activity directly. This would require co-localization of Bcl-xL and caspase-8 proteins, perhaps involving translocation of activated caspase-8 from the plasma membrane to internal membranes. To date, however, neither Bcl-xL nor Bcl-2 have been shown to have caspase inhibitory activity. Alternatively, the key targets of caspase-8 could be physically associated with and regulated by Bcl-xL. Bcl-xLhas been shown to interact with several proteins, including Bax (41Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) and the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death effector, CED4 (42Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 43Ottilie S. Wang Y. Banks S. Chang J. Vigna N.J. Weeks S. Armstrong R.C. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Cell Death Differentiation. 1997; 4: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Evidence for an indirect interaction between Bcl-xL and certain caspases via a mammalian CED4-like molecule has been presented (44Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). However, whether any Bcl-xL-interacting proteins are targets of caspase-8 is unknown. Bcl-xL might also regulate the availability of a cofactor necessary either for caspase-8 to cleave its substrates or for the consequences of those cleavages to ensue. Recent evidence has suggested that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL regulate the release of cytochrome c in pre-apoptotic cells (36Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar, 37Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

In the presence of additional cofactors present in cytosol, cytochromec is capable of activating caspase-3 (45Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). In the present study, Bcl-xL had a profound effect on changes in the intracellular immunolocalization of cytochrome c induced by anti-Fas and TNF. If a key function of caspase-8 is to stimulate cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequent propagation of the caspase cascade, then Bcl-xL is in the right intracellular compartment to regulate this event. Bcl-xL could accomplish this directly by binding to and sequestering cytochrome c (38Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Isreals S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) or indirectly as a consequence of its membrane channel-forming ability (46Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In either case, Bcl-xL would function upstream of cytochromec release, as suggested by previous studies (36Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar, 37Kluck R.M. Bossey-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4265) Google Scholar). The inability of Bcl-xL to inhibit apoptosis induced by direct intracellular microinjection of cytochrome c (47Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 18: 608-615Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) is consistent with this model. Regardless of the mechanism of Bcl-xL, our data suggest that caspase-8 signaling in this paradigm is propagated through a Bcl-xL-inhibitable step. This is surprising given the possibility that caspase-8 could activate downstream caspases directly (16Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 3 indicate that, in the Bcl-xL-expressing cells, activation of caspase-8 by anti-Fas or TNF leads to the processing of a small amount of caspase-7, whereas in UV-treated cells, in which caspase-8 is not activated, Bcl-xL completely prevents caspase-7 processing. If caspase-8 directly processes some caspase-7, it appears that this level of processing is below the threshold for inducing marked apoptotic changes in the MCF7/FB cells. The need for a Bcl-xL-inhibitable amplification of the caspase-8 signal may vary from one cell type to another (23Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) depending, in part, on the complement of downstream caspases that are present. In this respect, MCF7 cells may be unique in their lack of expression of caspase-3. The model described here provides an opportunity to address this question.

Tryptic digests of 32P-phosphorylated and -immunoprecipitated cPLA2 were analyzed by microbore high performance liquid chromatography and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping against synthetic phosphopeptide standards. Thrombin stimulated significant phosphorylation of platelet cPLA2 at two sites, Ser-505 and Ser-727.

In contrast to the small molecular weight phospholipase A2s that are secreted and are active on the outside of cells, cPLA2 is regulated by intracellular signals that are propagated from surface receptors. One important regulatory mechanism appears to be a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration which causes translocation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to internal membranes (4Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C.

A thorough characterization of the phosphorylation sites of human cPLA2 heterologously expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, and protein sequencing has revealed four sites of phosphorylation: Ser-437, Ser-454, Ser-505, and Ser-727 (17de Carvalho M.G.S.

The kinases phosphorylating the three novel serine residues in Sf9 cells are not known. Interestingly, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid causes a marked increase in arachidonic acid release from these Sf9 cells and a selective increase in the phosphorylation of cPLA2 at Ser-727 (17de Carvalho M.G.S.

Moreover, phosphorylation of Ser-727 decreased the electrophoretic mobility of cPLA2 on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, a characteristic that has been frequently used in numerous previous studies of cPLA2 phosphorylation in mammalian cells as a “selective” method to investigate Ser-505 phosphorylation. Thus, detailed phosphopeptide mapping and phosphorylation quantification studies are needed to obtain reliable information about the pattern of cPLA2 phosphorylation in agonist-stimulated cells.

Similar results were also obtained by the use of agonists that only partially stimulate platelet responses (26Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Hyslop P.A. Utterback B.G. Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol.

These results and the observation of multiple phosphorylation sites on cPLA2 expressed in Sf9 cells raise the possibility that platelet cPLA2 is phosphorylated on one or more residues other than Ser-505, and they also leave doubts about the usefulness of the indirect gel shift assay for assessing the level and site(s) of cPLA2 phosphorylation. Thus, high resolution phosphopeptide mapping studies are needed, and these are described in the present study. Recent studies suggest that cPLA2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in HeLa cells stimulated with interferon-α (28Flati V. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). cPLA2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with the protein tyrosine kinase Jak1, and transfection studies suggest that Jak1 is necessary for cPLA2 activation in this system. In light of studies in other cell types showing phosphorylation of cPLA2 only on serine, the possibility of cPLA2tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated in the present study using phosphopeptide mapping. Analysis of cPLA2 phosphorylation described here was carried out in part with microbore HPLC (mbHPLC) for the accurate quantification of the levels of site-specific cPLA2phosphorylation when only small amounts of protein obtained from non-transfected mammalian cells are available. It is shown that mbHPLC gives reliable quantification data; two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping on cellulose plates does not because of sample losses. Polyclonal anti-cPLA2antiserum was obtained as described previously (11Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol.

Peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC, and their structures were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Prostacyclin was kindly donated by Wellcome Laboratories (Beckenham, Kent, UK). Bovine thrombin, staurosporine, genistein, okadaic acid, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A were purchased from Sigma, and microcystin-LR came from Calbiochem.

To each of two T-75 flasks was added 10 ml of Sf9 cells (0.9 × 106/ml) in Grace's supplemented medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin G/streptomycin/fungizone (100-fold dilution of catalog number 15240-062 from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 27 °C for 1 h. Adherent cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressing human cPLA2 (29Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 18. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells in each flask were rinsed twice in Grace's supplemented phosphate-free medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin G/streptomycin/fungizone and were labeled with 10 mCi of 32Pi at 27 °C. After 48 h, cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-free medium, and then stimulated with 1 μm okadaic acid for 3 h. After two rinses, cells from each flask were lysed on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 3 μm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation. cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-cPLA2 antiserum (R11783 antiserum, 1:7.5 dilution) as described (17de Carvalho M.G.S.

The combined supernatants from each immunoprecipitate were loaded into a 55-mm wide preparative well (or two 28-mm wide wells) of a 1 mm-thick 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gel (Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II). Gels were run at 130 V until the bromphenol blue dye front just reached the bottom, and the bottom 2 cm of the gels were discarded for safety reasons. Gels were dried and phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Blood (100 ml) was drawn on the day of experiment from healthy volunteers by venepuncture using acidic citrate dextrose solution as anticoagulant (21Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma was separated from red blood cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 20 min, and platelets were isolated by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin at 30 °C. The platelet pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-free platelet buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose), and indomethacin (10 μm) was added to block cyclooxygenase. Platelets were radiolabeled with 25 mCi of 32Pi at 30 °C for 1.5–2 h. The platelet suspension was washed with platelet buffer containing acidic citrate dextrose solution and prostacyclin and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in platelet buffer at an approximate concentration of 1 × 109 platelets/ml. Indomethacin (10 μm) was added, and platelets were left at 30 °C for 30 min prior to experimentation. EGTA (1 mm) was added just before stimulation. The platelet suspension was distributed into 500-μl aliquots and prewarmed to 37 °C. When required, platelets were incubated in the presence of Me2SO (1%) or SB 203580 (20 μm) for 15 min. Platelets were gently shaken on a moving platform during stimulation with thrombin or stirred in an aggregometer at 1,200 rpm during stimulation with collagen. After addition of 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (final concentrations: 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.75% deoxycholate, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 5 μm staurosporine, 5 μm genistein, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μm Na3VO4), insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation, and lysates were pre-cleared using 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (1:2 in H2O, v/v). cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight using 2 μl of polyclonal anti-cPLA2antiserum (11Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B slurry. Immunoprecipitates were washed as described previously (21Börsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25885-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), extracted with Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. For the preparation of cPLA2 for mbHPLC analysis, the extracts of 8 immunoprecipitates, derived from 8 aliquots of platelet lysate, were pooled in a 55-mm wide preparative well. To control for the degree of phosphorylation in each experiment, single immunoprecipitates from stimulated and non-stimulated platelets were put onto a separate gel. Wild-type human cPLA2 was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified (29Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). His-tagged S505A cPLA2mutant was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using standard Ni(II) immobilized-ion affinity chromatography procedures (30Smith M.C. Furman T.C. Ingolia T.D. Pidgeon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7211-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Ten micrograms of dialyzed cPLA2 was incubated with 4 units of activated p42mapk (1 unit = 1 pmol of phosphorylation of myelin basic protein/min) at 30 °C in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm ATP, 100 μmNa3VO4, 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) in a total volume of 25 μl. The kinase reaction was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried. The exact position of cPLA2 on dried gels was located by autoradiography. 32P of cPLA2 in dried SDS-PAGE gels was quantified either with a PhosphorImager or by densitometry analysis of autoradiographs obtained with different exposure times. cPLA2 was eluted from the gel, precipiated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and digested with trypsin as described (17de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Yields were constantly monitored by Cerenkov counting. Fifty-two to 60% of the counts/min of platelet cPLA2(67–75% of cPLA2 from in vitro kinase experiments) was eluted from the gel slices (two elutions), and >95% of the eluted cPLA2 was recovered after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and washing with acetone. Each 200-μl frozen tryptic digest was thawed and analyzed by mbHPLC. To the digest was added a mixture of synthetic peptide standards (S437-PP, S454-PP, and S727-PPox), and the entire mixture was injected onto the mbHPLC system. Sufficient amounts of synthetic phosphopeptides were added to give an approximate full-scale detector response using the mbHPLC system described below (predetermined by analyzing the standards alone). mbHPLC was carried out with a Titanium Dynamax SD-200 HPLC system (Rainin) with PEEK tubing. The eluant from the pumps was connected to a low dead volume PEEK splitter (VICI Instruments MY1CPK). One outlet was connected to the inlet of a titanium Rheodyne injector (1-ml PEEK sample loop), and the other outlet to a standard analytical HPLC column (218TP52, Vydac Inc., virtually any analytical column can be used since its purpose is to provide back pressure to the splitter). The outlet of the injector was connected to the mbHPLC column (Vydac 901-3151-00, 0.5 × 150 mm, Michrom BioResources, Inc.). The outlet of the mbHPLC column was connected to the UV detector (Dionex detector equipped with a 2-μl PEEK flow cell). The outlet of the flow cell was connected to a 12-inch length of narrow-bore PEEK tubing (0.005 inch inner diameter) to provide sufficient back pressure to prevent outgassing in the flow cell. The flow rate through the mbHPLC column was adjusted to give 30 μl/min (total system flow rate was about 0.2 ml/min). The column was developed with 100% solvent A (0.06% CF3COOH in Milli-Q H2O (Millipore)) for 15 min, to 30% solvent B (0.06% CF3COOH in CH3CN (HPLC grade, Baker)) over 60 min, to 60% solvent B over 30 min, to 100% solvent B over 10 min, and then for 45 min at 100% solvent B. Eluting peptides were detected by monitoring the absorbance at 210 nm with the detector range set at 0.1–0.2 absorbance units full scale. Fractions were collected every 15 min during the first hour and then every 2 min into silicanized polypropylene tubes (VWR number 20172-935). Radioactivity was monitored by Cerenkov counting. Appropriate radioactive fractions were pooled for oxidation and/or two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. The yield of eluted phosphopeptides from the mbHPLC column was determined by summing the counts/min from all mbHPLC fractions from 0 to 160 min and dividing this number by the counts/min injected onto the column. This latter number was obtained by Cerenkov counting of the tryptic digest tube before and after its contents were injected onto the mbHPLC. Typically, >90% of the counts/min in the digest was injected onto mbHPLC. The yield of eluted phosphopeptides in platelet experiments where less than 3,000 cpm were applied onto the column was 82–98%. Pooled mbHPLC fractions or tryptic digests were dried in a Speed-Vac. Phosphopeptides were dissolved in 10 μl of glacial CH3COOH and spotted onto 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Kodak number 13255), which were developed by electrophoresis (1,400 V for 20 min) and ascending chromatography as described (17de Carvalho M.G.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).32P-Phosphorylated peptides were located with a PhosphorImager or by autoradiography. mbHPLC fractions were dried in a Speed-Vac at low temperature. Oxidation with performic acid was as described (31van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 35Google Scholar). Peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of glacial CH3COOH for two-dimensional maps or in 50 μl of H2O for mbHPLC, and solubility was checked by Cerenkov counting. MAPKAP-K2 was immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates (5 × 108platelets/lysate) for 2.5 h at 4 °C using 1 μl of antiserum and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B slurry. Immunoprecipitates were collected by microcentrifugation and washed three times in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 137 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. For the in vitro kinase assay, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 40 μl of 50 mmTris, pH 7.0, 100 μm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 50 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 30 μm substrate peptide KKLNRTLSVA (32Rouse J.

After 10 min, samples were briefly microcentrifuged. The kinase reaction was stopped by pipetting 30 μl of supernatant onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) and washing these in 75 mm phosphoric acid. Radioactivity of the dried filter papers was determined by liquid scintillation counting. HeLa S3 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.; 11965-092) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For radiolabeling, cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks (T25) to 70% confluence. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.; 11971-025) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and no fetal bovine serum and then labeled in 1 ml of the same medium containing 1 or 5 mCi of carrier-free32Pi. After a 4-h labeling period, cells were either left untreated or stimulated for 20 min with 1,000 units/ml interferon-α (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Inc.) or for 30 min with 0.5 mm sodium arsenite. Stimulations were stopped by placing the flasks on ice, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold medium. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of cold lysis buffer, and the cleared supernatant was treated with 1 μl of R11683 anti-cPLA2 antiserum to immunoprecipitate cPLA2as described (17de Carvalho M.G.S.

Immunoprecipitates were submitted to SDS-PAGE, and gel bands were processed for trypsin as described above for platelet studies. Half of each digest was submitted to mbHPLC, one-third to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, both as described above for platelets, and one-sixth to phosphoamino acid analysis as described (17de Carvalho M.G.S.

In these mbHPLC studies a conventional analytical flow cell was used in the detector (Rainin Dynamax with a 7200–075 flow cell). The delay between UV detection and emergence of counts/min from the tubing outlet was measured by co-injecting bovine serum albumin and32Pi and monitoring UV in real time and counts/min in 2-min fractions.

This study investigates the relationship between IGF-I receptor internalization and signaling via IRS-1 and Shc. A mutation in the C terminus of the IGF-I receptor decreased both the rate of receptor internalization and IGF-I-stimulated Shc phosphorylation by more than 50%, but did not affect IRS-1 phosphorylation. Low temperature (15 °C) decreased IGF-I receptor internalization and completely inhibited Shc phosphorylation. Although receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation were decreased in accordance with delayed binding kinetics at 15 °C, the ratio of IRS-1 to receptor phosphorylation was increased more than 2-fold. Dansylcadaverine decreased receptor internalization and Shc phosphorylation, but did not change receptor or IRS-1 phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, dansylcadaverine inhibited IGF-I-stimulated Shc-Grb2 association, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase activation, but did not affect the association of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase with IRS-1 or activation of p70 S6 kinase.

Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S117-S124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is believed that IGF-I binding initiates the migration of IGF-I receptors to clathrin-coated pits and the subsequent formation of early endosomes containing internalized but still active receptors. The ligand-receptor complex ultimately becomes dissociated and inactivated in the acidic environment of late endosomes, where ligands and receptors are sorted for degradation in lysosomes or recycling to the cell surface (17Furlanetto R.W. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2044-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Carpentier J.-L. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S117-S124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Activated IGF-I receptors at the cell surface, in coated pits, and in early endosomes have the potential to initiate specific cellular responses. For other hormone-receptor complexes, endosomal compartments have been shown to participate in the initiation and/or continuation of intracellular signaling reactions (15Bevan A.P. Drake P.G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hormone-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor begins at the cell surface but persists within the endosome compartment, such that there is a greater level of receptor phosphorylation in the endosome than in the plasma membrane (19Wada I. Lai W.H. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Generation of ceramide by tumor necrosis factor receptors in endosomes initiates the activation of NF-κB, while ceramide synthesis at the plasma membrane directs the activation of serine/threonine protein kinases and phospholipase A2 (20Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Thus, hormone signaling can occur at multiple steps in receptor internalization pathways, and this may provide a mechanism for regulating the intensity and pattern of signals generated by activated receptors. The relationship between ligand-induced IGF-I receptor internalization and the activation of specific cellular substrates that lead to signaling responses has not been studied. We and others have observed that the time courses of IGF-I stimulated IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation are different (21Smith R.J. Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1996; 104 (abstr.): 42Google Scholar, 22Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Sawa T. Ishihara H. Takata Y. Imamura T. Usui I. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). IRS-1 is maximally phosphorylated within 1 to 2 min of IGF-I stimulation, whereas Shc phosphorylation has been shown to reach a maximum only after 5 to 10 min (21Smith R.J. Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1996; 104 (abstr.): 42Google Scholar, 22Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Sawa T. Ishihara H. Takata Y. Imamura T. Usui I. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The time course of Shc but not IRS-1 phosphorylation correlates with the time required for ligand-induced receptor internalization (23Hsu D. Knudson P.E. Zapf A. Rolband G.C. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to determine whether IRS-1 and Shc phosphorylation results from their interaction with IGF-I receptors at distinct sites in the ligand-induced internalization pathway. Recombinant human IGF-I was provided by Eli Lilly Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Shc, Grb2, and pan-ERK antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The 3R S6 RSK substrate peptide and antibodies to the RSK-2 isoform of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal phosphotyrosine and IGF-I receptor (C-terminal) antibodies were prepared as described previously (24Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase-S6 substrate peptide and antibodies to p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, IRS-1, and IRS-2 were provided by Dr. Morris White. The monoclonal IGF-I receptor antibody (αIR-3) was provided by Dr. Steve Jacobs. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). 125I-Protein A and125I-IGF-I were from ICN Biomedical (Costa Mesa, CA) and Amersham Life Science, Inc. (Arlington Heights, IL), respectively. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Unless otherwise indicated, all studies were conducted with multiple clones of CHO cells stably transfected with the CAG+ isoform of the human IGF-I receptor. These cells, which have been described previously (25Condorelli G. Bueno R. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8510-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), express approximately 6 × 105 receptors/cell as assessed by ligand binding and Scatchard analysis. For studies on cells expressing mutated IGF-I receptors, a 961-base pair HindIII-BamHI fragment of the wild-type IGF-I receptor cDNA (base pairs 3195–4156) was subcloned into Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis as described by Kunkel (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide TCCGCGCCAGCTACGACGAGAGACA (mutant nucleotide underlined) was used to generate a cDNA fragment encoding a Phe to Tyr substitution at position 1310 in the C-terminal portion of the IGF-I receptor β-subunit. The mutated IGF-I receptor fragment was fully sequenced to exclude the possibility of additional unwanted mutations and used to replace the analogous fragment in the previously described APrM8 expression vector containing the full-length cDNA of the wild-type CAG+ IGF-I receptor (25Condorelli G. Bueno R. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8510-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple stably transfected clones of CHO cells expressing approximately 6 × 105 mutant receptors/cell were obtained by a co-transfection protocol using a neomycin resistance selection method as described previously (25Condorelli G. Bueno R. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8510-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of CHO cells expressing similar numbers of kinase-inactive IGF-I receptors (Lys to Ala substitution at position 1003) has been described (25Condorelli G. Bueno R. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8510-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For comparative studies on wild-type and mutant IGF-I receptors, the rate of receptor internalization was determined as described previously (20Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Cells were replica plated in 24-well dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C in assay buffer containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and rinsed twice more with wash buffer. Subsequently, 40,000 cpm of 125I-IGF-I (final IGF-I concentration 5 × 10−11m) in assay buffer was added to each well, and individual plates were incubated at 37 °C for timed periods of 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 min. Following incubation, the medium was removed, and the plates were immersed in ice-cold PBS plus 0.1% BSA (pH 7.5) and further washed by immersing twice in ice-cold PBS plus 0.1% BSA at pH 2.75 (determination of internalized IGF-I) or pH 7.5 (determination of total cell-associated IGF-I). The washed cells were solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH in 0.1% SDS, and 125I was quantified by γ-counting. The internalization rate constant (Ke), representing the slope of the line relating internalized to surface-bound hormone at each time point, was determined as described previously (27Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An integrated measure of surface-bound hormone was approximated by the trapezoidal rule using intervals of 2 min, and the slope of the line defining Ke was determined by linear regression. For the low temperature and inhibitor studies, the amount of IGF-I internalized was determined as described by Hsu and Olefsky (28Hsu D. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to subconfluency in 35-mm wells, serum depleted for 16–18 h, washed twice with PBS and once with Krebs-Ringer phosphate-Hepes binding buffer (pH 7.5) at room temperature, and incubated in binding buffer containing 125I-IGF-I (10−8m) for 10 min. The monolayer was then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, the surface-bound ligand was extracted with acidic binding buffer (pH 2.75) for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell-associated (internalized) radioactivity was determined by lysing the cells with 0.4 n NaOH. The percentage of ligand internalized was calculated by dividing the internalized counts/min by surface-bound plus internalized counts/min. To determine IGF-I stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells, subconfluent monolayers were incubated for 16–18 h in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.5% BSA and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). IGF-I was subsequently added to the medium at a dose of 10−8m for the indicated period of time, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4 in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) and lysed in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations determined using a Bradford dye binding assay kit with BSA as standard (Bio-Rad). For studies on the effects of low temperature, cell monolayers were incubated overnight with serum-free medium, and this was replaced with fresh medium preadjusted to 15 or 37 °C. After incubation for 30 min at the appropriate temperature, IGF-I was added, and cell lysates prepared as described above. For inhibitor studies, dansylcadaverine (500 μm), chloroquine (200 μm), or an appropriate diluent were added for 30 min prior to IGF-I stimulation. To detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, equal amounts of solubilized protein (1 mg) from cells treated under various conditions were incubated in lysis buffer with either αIR3 (1:200 dilution), IRS-1 (1:100 dilution), or Shc (1 μg/ml) antibody at 4 °C overnight. The antibody was then adsorbed to protein-A Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resulting immunocomplexes were washed three times by centrifugation and resuspension in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Specific protein immunoprecipitates, plus additional cell extracts not treated with antibodies (200 μg), were heated in Laemmli buffer with 100 mm DTT at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH). The blots were blocked in 5% BSA, probed with phosphotyrosine antibody (2 μg/ml), washed as described previously, and then incubated with125I-Protein A for 1 h at 25 °C (29Giorgino F. Chen J.H. Smith R.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1433-1444PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled protein bands were detected and quantitated using a PhosphorImaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The identities of the phosphorylated bands on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots corresponding to the β-subunit of the IGF-I receptor (105 kDa), IRS-1 (170 kDa), and Shc proteins (66, 52, and 46 kDa) were confirmed with antibodies specific for each of these proteins. IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activation was measured by immunoblotting CHO cell lysates (prepared above) with a phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody (1:2000 dilution). After detection with125I-Protein A, these blots were stripped and re-probed with a monoclonal pan-ERK antibody (1:5000 dilution) as described by the manufacturer (Transduction Laboratories). Protein bands corresponding to ERK 1 and 2 were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham). For co-precipitation experiments, cell lysates were incubated with IRS-1, IRS-2 (1:100 dilution), or Shc antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and electroblotting as described above. Blots of IRS-1 and -2 immunoprecipitates were subsequently probed with either an antibody that recognizes the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase (1:1000 dilution), or the respective immunoprecipitating antibody. To measure IGF-I-stimulated Shc-Grb2 association, Shc immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with a monoclonal Grb2 antibody (1:1000) as described by the manufacturer (Transduction Laboratories). The protein band corresponding to Grb2 was detected by the ECL method. RSK-2 activity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay as described previously (30Aronson D. Violan M.A. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For each treatment, 500 μg of cell extract was incubated with polyclonal RSK-2 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and subsequently complexed to protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, 3 times with LiCl buffer, 3 times with RSK kinase buffer (30Aronson D. Violan M.A. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and resuspended in kinase buffer containing 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 3R S6 peptide (RRLSSLRA), 40 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 15 min with agitation, terminated, and spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose papers. The papers were washed several times with 1% phosphoric acid and measured for radioactivity by the Cerenkov method. To determine the activity of p70 S6 kinase, 300 μg of cell lysate was incubated with p70 S6 kinase antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Following this incubation period, protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The immune complexes were washed 2 times with ice-cold buffer A (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 2 times with buffer B (1 mNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and once with 150 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2). Kinase assays were performed in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-S6 peptide (the final 30 amino acids of rat S6 sequence) for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. Reactions were terminated by heating with Laemmli buffer with 100 mm DTT at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were vacuum dried and exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E. and analyzed using a statistical model based on a one-way or two-way classification analysis of variance. Tests of significance for all possible comparisons were determined by Bonferroni's t test (SYSTAT, version 5.0, Evanston, IL). To determine the time course of IGF-I stimulated IRS-1 and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, multiple clones of stably transfected CHO cells expressing approximately 6 × 105 human wild-type IGF-I receptors/cell were stimulated with 10−8m IGF-I for 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the IGF-I receptor and IRS-1 were identified by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibody. For quantitation of phosphorylation of the Shc proteins, the cell extracts were first subjected to immunoprecipitation with Shc antibody, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed by phosphotyrosine antibody immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor was rapid, reaching a maximum within 2 min. Insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was unmeasurable in these cell extracts (data not shown), reflecting the specificity of IGF-I binding and the relatively low number of insulin receptors in the CHO cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 also was very rapid, reaching maximal levels within 1 to 2 min after the addition of IGF-I (Fig. 1,A and B). At 10 min, there was a 20% decrease in IRS-1 phosphorylation and no further change through 20 min of incubation. In comparison to IRS-1, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was more gradual, reaching a maximal and sustained level after 5 to 10 min of incubation with IGF-I (Fig. 1 A). Quantitative data are shown for the 52-kDa Shc isoform in Fig. 1 B, and a similar time course of IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation was also observed for the 46- and 66-kDa Shc isoforms. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that mutation of the Phe residue to Tyr at position 1310 in the C terminus of the IGF-I receptor leads to a decreased rate of ligand-induced receptor internalization in transfected CHO cells (31Condorelli G. Tocchetti G.C. Andreozzi F. Caiola A. Crescenzi E. Beguinot F. Smith R.J. Front. Endocrinol. 1994; 9: 373-376Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of ligand-induced internalization of Tyr-1310 mutant receptors is decreased by 50% in comparison with wild-type IGF-I receptors. The internalization rate of the Tyr-1310 mutant is only slightly greater than the rate of ligand-induced internalization of receptors that have absent kinase activity as a consequence of a Lys to Ala mutation at position 1003 in the ATP-binding site. Although internalization of the Tyr-1310 mutant receptor was markedly inhibited, IGF-I-induced autophosphorylation of this receptor construct was preserved and, in fact, modestly increased in comparison with wild-type receptors (Fig. 3 A, top and bottom panels). Thus, the mutant receptor has an effective IGF-I activated tyrosine kinase. The increased receptor autophosphorylation cannot be explained by a difference in receptor content, which was similar to that in cells transfected with the wild-type receptor as assessed by immunoblotting (middle panel in Fig. 3 A) or by Scatchard analysis of IGF-I binding data (not shown). The higher level of phosphorylation in the Tyr-1310 mutant may reflect, at least in part, phosphorylation of the additional C-terminal tyrosine residue. IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly stimulated by IGF-I in cells transfected with wild-type or Tyr-1310 receptors. There was no difference in IRS-1 content or in the level of IRS-1 phosphorylation catalyzed by these two receptor constructs (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the marked decrease in ligand-induced internalization of the Tyr-1310 receptor does not interfere with its capacity to interact with IRS-1 in intact cells. This contrasts with the effects of IGF-I on Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). Phosphorylation of all three Shc isoforms was stimulated by IGF-I in cells transfected with either receptor construct, but Shc phosphorylation was markedly decreased in cells expressing the internalization-defective Tyr-1310 receptor mutant. Quantitation of the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the dominant 52-kDa Shc isoform from multiple experiments (Fig. 3 C, bottom panel) demonstrated a 65% decrease in the level of Shc phosphorylation 10 min after IGF-I stimulation of cells expressing the Tyr-1310 receptor as compared with the wild-type receptor. A similar or greater decrease in Shc phosphorylation was evident at multiple time points extending to 60 min after IGF-I stimulation (data not shown). The protein level of the 52-kDa Shc isoform, as determined by direct immunoblotting, was also decreased in the Tyr-1310 cells (35% lower than in cells expressing wild-type receptors, p < 0.05), but the decrease in Shc protein content was less than the decrease in Shc phosphorylation in these cells. IGF-I stimulation of 52-kDa Shc phosphorylation was significantly decreased in the Tyr-1310 cells after correction for the change in Shc protein content (100 ± 8.6% for wild-type versus 70 ± 4.3% for Tyr-1310,p < 0.05). This observation was consistent for two different clones of wild-type Tyr-1310 cells that were studied. Therefore, the IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of Shc, but not IRS-1, was decreased in cells transfected with the internalization-defective mutant IGF-I receptor. To further investigate the relationship between receptor-mediated endocytosis and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, IGF-I receptor internalization in CHO cells expressing the wild-type receptor was inhibited by reducing the cell incubation temperature from 37 to 15 °C. Ligand-induced IGF-I receptor internalization after 10 min was decreased by 64% at 15 °C compared with cells at 37 °C (Fig. 4 A). Low temperature also decreased IGF-I stimulated receptor autophosphorylation at early time points (0–20 min) (Fig. 4 B). This is consistent with delayed ligand binding kinetics at 15 °C, which have previously been described (32Adashi"
https://openalex.org/W2001246952,"The human FasL enhancer region was cloned and functionally characterized in transformed and primary T cells. Within the 2.3 kilobase pairs of the FasL untranslated region, the distal 3′ 300-base pair portion contains a single transcription initiation site and confers basal and inducible transcriptional activity. Stimuli that increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> such as CD3 cross-linking or ionomycin, but not activation of protein kinase C, were found to induce FasL enhancer transcription in a cyclosporin-sensitive manner. Moreover, calcineurin and NFAT, but not AP1, were identified as necessary and sufficient effectors in driving FasL transcription through an NFAT cis-acting motif (GGAAA). Additional modes of T cell activation such as CD4 cross-linking were also found to induce NFAT binding to the FasL enhancer region and to functionally transactivate its transcription. These results indicate that the induction of FasL gene transcription in T cells after CD3 or CD4 activation is selectively mediated by calcineurin and NFAT."
https://openalex.org/W2048225641,"The primary structure of human macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) was determined from cDNA clones and shown to be highly similar to that of mouse (Elomaa, O., Kangas, M., Sahlberg, C., Tuukkanen, J., Sormunen, R., Liakka, A., Thesleff, I., Kraal, G., and Tryggvason, K. (1995)Cell 80, 603–609). Features such as potential carbohydrate attachment sites in the extracellular spacer domain III and the interruption of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats in the collagenous domain IV were conserved between the two species. However, the human MARCO polypeptide chain lacked the intracellular cysteine present in mouse, as well as two extracellular cysteines that form interchain disulfide bonds in the murine protein. In situ hybridization showed MARCO to be strongly expressed in macrophages of several tissues of human individuals with sepsis. No expression was observed in other cell types. The bacteria-binding region of MARCO was determined in binding studies with full-length and truncated variants of MARCO, and localized to a region proximal to the cysteine-rich part of the COOH-terminal domain V. The intrachain disulfide bond pattern of domain V was established showing that these bonds are between cysteine pairs C1-C5, C2-C6, and C3-C4.

Macrophages are bone marrow-derived cells that play a central role in host defense as well as in normal physiological processes such as the maintenance of tissues. Macrophages are present in most tissues, particularly in tissues that function in the filtration of blood or lymph fluid, such as liver, spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. A major characteristic of macrophages is their ability to recognize, internalize, and destroy harmful endogenous and foreign substances, thus functioning as scavengers. Macrophages have been shown to be able to bind pathogens either directly, or they recognize them as foreign after their coating by antibodies or complement (1Turpin J.A. Lopez-Berestein G. Lopez-Berestein G. Klostergaard J. Mononuclear Phagocytes in Cell Biology. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 71-99Google Scholar, 2Gordon S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Macrophages contain scavenger receptors with a broad binding specificity that may be used to discriminate between self and non-self in the nonspecific antibody-independent recognition of foreign substances (2Gordon S.

The type I receptor additionally contains a cysteine-rich COOH-terminal (SRCR) domain (5Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M.

These receptors are present in macrophages in diverse tissues throughout the body and exhibit an unusually broad ligand binding specificity. They bind a wide variety of polyanions, including chemically modified proteins, such as modified LDL, and they have been implicated in cholesterol deposition during atherogenesis.

Although the overall structure resembles that of the type I scavenger receptor, MARCO differs in that the extracellular domain is longer and completely lacks an α-helical coiled coil domain. Furthermore, MARCO is only expressed in macrophages of the marginal zone of the spleen and in lymph nodes and thus differs substantially from the scavenger receptor, which is expressed in macrophages of most tissues. In our previous study MARCO was shown to bind Gram-positive and negative bacteria, and acetylated LDL, but not yeast. Based on its binding activity and tissue distribution, MARCO is likely to play a role in host defense. The cysteine-rich motif (SRCR) present in SR-AI and MARCO has also been found in a number of other proteins. This motif is about 100 amino acid residues long and contains six or eight cysteine residues that were recently shown to form intrachain disulfide bonds in the globular SRCR domain of SR-AI (8Resnick D. Chatterton J.E. Schwartz K. Slayter H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26924-26930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The biological function of SRCR domains has not yet been established, but their presence in proteins with binding functions suggests a role in ligand binding or adhesion. Recently, one of the SRCR domains in CD6 was reported to participate in ligand binding interactions (9Whitney G.S. Starling G.C. Bowen M.A. Modrell B. Siadak A.W. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18187-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined the primary structure of the human MARCO receptor and studied its spatial expression using in situ hybridization. The nature of the intrachain disulfide bonds of the COOH-terminal cysteine-rich domain V was determined, and using full-length and truncated variants of MARCO, the bacteria-binding region was localized immediately proximal to the cysteine-rich region of domain V. Human liver and spleen cDNA libraries cloned in λgt11 (CLONTECH) were screened with a32P-labeled murine MARCO cDNA probe or by a PCR amplification method using standard protocols (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar, 11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The clones were isolated, subcloned into pUC19 vector, and sequenced from both strands. The human MARCO clones obtained from the cDNA libraries did not extend to the region encoding the translation initiation site when compared with the murine MARCO cDNA. To obtain the missing 5′ end sequence, human genomic libraries (CLONTECH) were screened and positive clones were subcloned into pUC19 vector for sequencing. Human tissues obtained from a newborn child who died from meningitis were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at autopsy. Sections of 7 μm were placed on silane-coated slides, allowed to dry, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and dehydrated in graded ethanol series. In situ hybridization was performed according to Wilkinson and Green (12Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Copp A.J. Cockroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 155-171Google Scholar) with some modifications. The sections were treated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were post-fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and acetylated with acetic anhydride in 0.1m triethanolamine (pH 8.0). The sections were washed with 50% deionized formamide in 2 × SSC both before and after acetylation. The slides were picked from the last washing solution one by one. Hybridization buffer (60% deionized formamide, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10% dextran sulfate, and 1 × Denhardt's solution) containing 500 ng of yeast tRNA/ml without probe was then added and prehybridized for 2 h at 52 °C. For the preparation of RNA probes, restriction fragmentsEcoRI-AccI (nucleotides 27–401) and KpnI-EcoRI (nucleotides 1327–1720) from human MARCO cDNA were cloned into pGEM-3Z plasmid vector (Promega). Probes were labeled with 35S-UTP using T3 and T7 polymerases. The probes were diluted to a final concentration of 40,000 cpm/μl. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 52 °C, and high stringency washes were carried out with 50% deionized formamide and 30 mm dithiothreitol at 65 °C for 60 min. The slides were treated with 20 μg/ml RNase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, dehydrated and dipped in NTB-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) for autoradiography. The sections were exposed for 14–18 days, developed using Kodak D-19, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted. For the production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, domains III (residues 71–147) and V (residues 421–520) of the human MARCO polypeptide were expressed inEscherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins using the pGEX-1λT vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). DNA fragments encoding domains III and V were generated by PCR, and all sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fusion proteins produced in bacteria were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Antisera were raised in rabbits using standard procedures, and IgGs were first purified by protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and then by negative immunoadsorption of unspecific antibodies against glutathione S-transferase and E. coliproteins. For cell transfections, cDNAs encoding the entire 520-residue sequence of MARCO (M-520) or truncated constructs encoding residues 1–420 (M-420), residues 1–431 (M-431), or residues 1–442 (M-442) were generated by site-directed insertion of a stop codon using PCR. The sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the products were cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) using restriction sites engineered into the primers. COS-7 cells were grown in high glucose (4.5 g/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml ascorbate. One day prior to transient transfection, the cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/90-mm tissue culture dish and then transfected overnight by the calcium phosphate method using 20 μg of DNA isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation. After 18 h the calcium phosphate precipitate was removed, and the cells were used after 24–48 h. To examine whether the transfected cells are able to transport the MARCO receptor to the cell surface, biotinylation of surface proteins was carried out, followed by their precipitation with streptavidin-agarose. For biotinylation, transfected COS-7 cells were grown in 90-mm Petri dishes, rinsed with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.3), containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+, and cooled in this buffer on ice. Cell surface proteins were labeled for 30 min on ice with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in PBS; Pierce), after which cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1m glycine and incubated in same buffer for 15 min on ice. For streptavidin precipitation, cells were lysed into a triple detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material. The cell lysate was incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, after which the streptavidin-agarose was pelleted by centrifugation and washed five times with the triple detergent buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted by heating the streptavidin-agarose in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates and avidin-precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using 5 μg/ml IgG against domain III of MARCO and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) as a secondary antibody. The immunoreaction was visualized using the chemiluminescence method (Renaissance; DuPont). Mouse IgG against paxillin (Transduction Laboratories), which is a cytoskeletal protein, was used as a negative control for cell surface biotinylation. Transfected cells cultured on coverslips were incubated with FITC-labeled E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus (Molecular Probes) for 1 h in 50:1–100:1 ratios. Following incubation cells were washed three times with PBS buffer, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, and stained using anti-MARCO IgG and FITC-labeled secondary antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence staining was localized with a fluorescence microscope. A cDNA fragment encoding domain V (starting from serine residue 421) was cloned into a baculoviral transfer vector pVL1393 (13Summers M. Smith G. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1986; : 1555Google Scholar) containing the coding sequence for the amino-terminal half of human matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 (residues 1–448). The resulting transfer vector, termed pVL1393–72FX, contained the coding sequence for the signal peptide, the three fibronectin type II-like repeats and the catalytic site of MMP-2 (14Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C.S. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6579-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by an artificial factor X cleavage site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg), a multiple cloning site, and the domain V of MARCO (residues 421–520). Recombinant baculovirus was produced by established methods (13Summers M. Smith G. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1986; : 1555Google Scholar) and used to infect H5 insect cells (Invitrogen). The recombinant protein was purified by gelatin-affinity chromatography and ion exchange HPLC as described earlier (15Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The purified fusion protein, in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, was concentrated to 1.5–2 mg/ml and digested with factor Xa at room temperature for two hours using an enzyme/substrate mass ratio of 1:50. To exclude rearrangement of disulfide bonds during the manipulation, control experiments with 5 mm iodoacetamide added prior to the factor Xa digestion was carried out. Digestion was terminated by adding 1.5 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 200-μl aliquots were purified by HPLC on a Delta Pak RP-4 300-Å 3.5 × 150-mm column, using a CH3CN gradient from 30% to 50% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min (flow 0.8 ml/min). Domain V of MARCO was identified by mass spectrophotometry MALDI-TOF and NH2-terminal sequencing, dried in a Speed-Vac, and dissolved in 8 murea, 0.4 m NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8), to a concentration of 0.5–1 mg/ml. Three volumes of 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), were added and digested with trypsin (ratio 1:20–1:50) at 37 °C overnight. Reduced (10% v/v mercaptoethanol) and unreduced aliquots were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, using the same eluents as above, but the gradient was from 25% to 55% CH3CN in 60 min (flow 0.6 ml/min). Peaks likely to contain disulfides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF and NH2-terminal sequencing. Tryptic peptides containing disulfide bonds were evaporated and dissolved in 25 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8), at 0.1 mg/ml and digested with V8 protease (enzyme substrate ratio 1:20) for several days at room temperature. Alternatively, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8) or 130 mm NH4Ac (pH 4) was used as a buffer. Digestion products were purified by reverse phase HPLC with a CH3CN gradient from 10% to 35% in 50 min (flow 0.6 ml/min), and characterized by MALDI-TOF and NH2-terminal sequencing. Analysis of human MARCO cDNA clones revealed a 1533-base pair open reading frame and a 152-base pair 3′-end untranslated sequence, starting with the TGA translation stop codon and containing a putative AATAAA polyadenylation signal. On the basis of Northern analyses and comparison with the murine sequence, the human MARCO mRNA has a size of about 1.8 kilobase pairs, indicating that the cDNA clones lacked the 5′-most end sequence. To obtain the missing 5′ sequence, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was carried out, but this did not yield further sequence. The missing sequence encoding residues 1–11 (Fig. 1) was therefore obtained by analysis of the coding sequence in a genomic clone. Evidence for residue 1 in Fig. 1 being the actual initiator methionine came from the fact that there is an in-frame stop codon three codons upstream of the codon for this methionine residue (data not shown). Together, the results showed that the open reading frame encodes a polypeptide chain of 520 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The identity of the amino acid sequence between the full-length human and murine polypeptide chains was only 68%, the similarity being 77%. The sequence identity of the chains between the two species is highest (74%) in the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain V and, as expected, in the collagenous domain IV (75%), which has glycine as every third amino acid (Table I). Between the intracellular domains I, the sequence similarity is surprisingly low (only 51%). Interestingly, the human MARCO subunit chain differs from the mouse chain in that it does not have any cysteine residues outside the cysteine-rich domain V, whereas the mouse chain has one cysteine residue within the intracellular domain I and two in the extracellular spacer domain III. Both potential carbohydrate attachment sites in the spacer domain III, as well as the interruption of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats in collagenous domain IV, are conserved between the two species. The transmembrane domain II has 69% sequence identity between mouse and man.Table ISequence identity and similarity between human and mouse MARCO receptorsDomainIdentitySimilarity%%I5151II6988III5767IV7578V7480 Open table in a new tab In situhybridization, carried out on several human tissues obtained from autopsies of two newborn infants who died from sepsis, revealed expression in macrophages in several tissues. In thymus, the expression was observed in scattered cells of the stromal compartment (Fig. 2). In the intestine, MARCO was expressed in cells located beneath the mucosal membrane, and, in kidney, positive macrophage-like cells were observed in the interstitium. Intense signals were seen in the liver, mainly in Kupffer cells. In spleen, the signals were detected in the white pulp region. No transcripts were detected in lung. In all tissues examined, the expression was exclusively observed in tissue macrophages. To determine the bacteria-binding region of MARCO, COS cells were transiently transfected with the full-length or truncated forms of MARCO cDNAs for binding studies. The truncated variants either completely lacked domain V (M-420) or contained up to 11 (M-431) or 22 residues (M-442) out of the 99-residue domain V. All the variants lacked that portion of domain V which contains the six cysteine residues. To verify production of the different MARCO variants, proteins produced by the various transfectants were studied by Western blotting (Fig. 3). The anti-MARCO antibodies reacted weakly with two sharp bands of about 60 and 43 kDa in reduced samples from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, lane 1). In the lysate prepared from cells transfected with the full-length construct, the antibodies specifically revealed a major diffuse band of about 60 kDa and a doublet of weaker bands of about 50 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2). Slightly smaller bands of about 45 kDa were observed in cell lysates of COS cells transfected with the truncated cDNAs M-431, M-442, and M-420 (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). Under nonreducing conditions, the bands had similar sizes, indicating the absence of interchain disulfide bonds (data not shown). Cell surface biotinylation was used to examine whether the truncated forms of MARCO were transported to the cell surface. In this experiment, COS cells transfected with the full-length and the shortest MARCO construct (M-420) lacking the entire domain V were biotinylated on ice, followed by precipitation of biotinylated proteins with streptavidin and Western blotting, essentially as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results unequivocally showed that the 420-residue truncated form was present on the cell membrane (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), similarly to full-length MARCO (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). As a control, a parallel experiment with mock-transfected cells was carried out. In this case, streptavidin-agarose was not found to precipitate any biotinylated polypeptides that could be detected by the anti-MARCO antibodies (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). As an additional control, we examined whether an intracellular protein, paxillin, is present in the protein fraction precipitated by streptavidin-agarose. However, paxillin was not detected in this fraction (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–3), even though it was easily detectable in the total cell lysate prepared from COS cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). In our previous study, mouse MARCO was shown to bind both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but not yeast (7Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To study whether the human MARCO has binding properties similar to those of mouse MARCO, COS cells were transfected with full-length human MARCO cDNA, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled E. coli, S. aureus, or zymosan A (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), after which the binding was detected by fluorescence microscopy. Specific binding of bacteria was observed to COS cells expressing full-length human MARCO (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, labeled zymosan A did not bind to MARCO expressing cells, as was shown previously for murine MARCO (data not shown). To more specifically characterize the bacteria-binding region of MARCO, we carried out transfections with the truncated variants (Fig. 5 F). The transfected cells were analyzed for their binding of FITC-conjugated bacteria. The results showed that cells expressing MARCO variants M-420 and M-431 did not bind bacteria (Fig. 5,C and D). However, cells expressing MARCO construct M-442 were found to bind bacteria, indicating that the cysteine-rich part of domain V is not needed for the bacteria binding activity of MARCO. The carboxyl-terminal domain V of MARCO contains six cysteines that probably form intrachain, but not interchain, disulfide bonds. Here, the nature of the intrachain disulfide bonds was studied in human domain V expressed as a recombinant protein in eukaryotic H5 cells using the baculovirus system. Domain V was expressed as a fusion protein with MMP-2 matrix metalloproteinase, where it replaced the COOH-terminal hemopexin domain of the enzyme. The expression construct was designed so that the MMP-2 fusion partner could be cleaved away with factor Xa. The final yield of purified protein was only 0.1 mg of protein/liter of cell culture medium, which is considerably lower than our normal yields of wild-type or point mutated MMP-2 (15Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was first purified with a single-step affinity column containing gelatin immobilized on Sepharose. This purification method is based on the high gelatin binding activity of the fibronectin type II-like repeats of MMP-2 (15Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MARCO domain V was then released from the MMP-2 fusion partner by cleavage with factor Xa, and the cleavage products were separated by HPLC, essentially as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractionation and amino acid sequence analysis of the cleavage products revealed that domain V itself contained two internal cleavage sites for the factor Xa, as illustrated in Fig. 6 A. The factor Xa fragment Xa2,3, which lacked 14 NH2-terminal residues of MARCO domain V and was additionally cleaved after arginine 469 (Fig. 6 A), was digested with trypsin. This yielded two trypsin fragments T1 and T2, which both contained internal disulfide bond(s) (Fig. 6 B). Amino-terminal sequencing and the molecular weight of T2 directly proved the presence of bonds between cysteine residues C4 and C3. Amino-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analyses of T1 showed that cysteine residues C1, C2, C5, and C6 were present in this fragment. In Fig. 6 B, we refer to this fragment also as fragment ΨT1, since 5 residues were sometimes cleaved away from the NH2 terminus due to chymotrypsin contamination in the trypsin preparation used. Finally, cleavage of T1 with V8 proteinase generated three cleavage products for which sequence analyses and molecular weight calculations allowed the unambiguous assignment of cysteine bonds, as illustrated in Fig. 6 C. The present study provided the primary structure of the subunit chain of the trimeric human macrophage MARCO receptor. Comparison with the mouse polypeptide revealed a sequence identity of 68% and similarity of 77%. An interesting difference between the two species is that the human chain lacks cysteine residues outside domain V, while the mouse chain has one in the intracellular domain I and two in the spacer domain III. The role of the single cysteine in the intracellular domain in mouse is not known, but we have shown previously that the two cysteine residues in the spacer domain participate in interchain disulfide bonds in the MARCO receptor (7Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Therefore, the three subunit chains of human MARCO are bound to each other only through the collagenous triple helix of domains IV, as the cysteine residues in the COOH-terminal domain V all form intrachain bonds. In the structurally related scavenger receptor SR-AI chain, a single cysteine residue in the spacer domain and another one in domain I are conserved in rabbit, mouse, bovine, and man (3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 16Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mouse class A scavenger receptor does contain a second cysteine in domain I, so the cysteine pattern is not completely conserved in this type of receptors. The present results further showed that two putative carbohydrate attachment sites in the spacer domain III of MARCO, as well as an interruption in the collagenous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat sequence, are conserved, indicating a functional importance for these regions. In situ hybridization analyses of tissues from two newborn infants revealed general expression of MARCO in macrophages of several organs such as thymus, intestine, and kidney and in Kupffer cells of the liver. In the spleen, expression was mainly seen in the white pulp region. The general macrophage expression observed here sharply contrasts what we previously found in the mouse, where expression was normally only present in macrophages of the marginal zone of the spleen and lymph nodes (7Elomaa O.

However, the results are not completely comparable, as it turned out that the human autopsy samples analyzed in the present study were obtained from infants who both died from sepsis. Therefore, it is possible that the expressio"
https://openalex.org/W2047350170,"Regulation of the human CYP11A gene encoding cytochrome P450scc, which catalyzes the first step of steroid synthesis, is regulated by many trans-acting transcription factors including steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Transfection experiments in human adrenal NCI-H295 cells demonstrate regulation of the P450scc gene promoter region that contains several putative SF-1 binding sites. Cotransfection of SF-1 with a luciferase reporter construct containing the P450scc gene 5′-flanking region from nucleotides −1676 to +49 increased promoter activity, and deletion of the nucleotide sequence from position −1676 to −1620, which removes a putative cAMP response element (CRE), did not affect the stimulatory response to SF-1. As well, further deletion of the promoter region to nucleotide −110, which contains only one SF-1 binding site, still retained the ability to respond to exogenous SF-1. However, mutation of the remaining site which abolished SF-1 protein/DNA interaction also abrogated any functional response to the factor. All the P450scc reporter constructs which responded to SF-1 were further stimulated by exogenous p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), suggesting interaction between SF-1 and p300/CBP. As well, mutation of the binding site that abrogated the response to SF-1 also abolished the response to p300 and CBP. Cotransfection of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, which has been shown to interact with p300/CBP and interfere with its function, decreased the stimulatory effect of SF-1 and p300/CBP. Cotransfection of a mutated E1A protein, RG2, which does not interact with p300/CBP, did not alter the stimulatory effect of SF-1 and p300/CBP on the P450scc promoter. Deletion of the region from amino acid residues 2–67 in E1A, which has been postulated to interact with p300/CBP, also abolished the inhibitory effect of E1A, whereas deletion of the region from residues 120 to 140 had no effect. Two regions of CBP from amino acids 1 to 451 and from 1460 to 1891 were demonstrated to interact with SF-1 in vitro. Coexpression of fragments of the p300 protein fused to the VP16 protein in the presence of SF-1 and the −110 P450scc reporter construct indicated in vivo the interaction of two regions of p300 with SF-1, thus confirming the in vitro results. Taken together these results indicate that regulation of the human P450scc gene by SF-1 is mediated by p300/CBP. Due to the many putative roles of SF-1 to regulate many genes, its interaction with p300/CBP is potentially a key component effecting important physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2057330039,"The autocatalytic processing of procathepsin L was investigated in vitro using purified recombinant proenzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris. Pure intermolecular processing was studied by incubating the mutant procathepsin L (C25S), which cannot autoactivate with a small amount of mature active cathepsin L. The results clearly establish that, contrary to recent reports, intermolecular processing of procathepsin L is possible. The main cleavage sites are located at or near the N terminus of the mature enzyme, in an accessible portion of the proregion, which contains sequences corresponding to the known substrate specificity of cathepsin L. Contrary to procathepsins B, K, and S, autocatalytic processing of procathepsin L can generate the natural mature form of the enzyme. A continuous assay using the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg 4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide hydrochloride has also been used to obtain information on the nature of the steps involved in the autocatalytic processing of wild-type procathepsin L. Processing is initiated by decreasing the pH from 8.0 to 5.3. The influence of proenzyme concentration on the rate of processing indicates the existence of both unimolecular and bimolecular steps in the mechanism of processing. The nature of the unimolecular event that triggers processing remains elusive. Circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements indicate the absence of large scale conformational change in the structure of procathepsin L on reduction of pH. However, the bimolecular reaction can be attributed to intermolecular processing of the zymogen."
https://openalex.org/W2051855988,"Although glucose regulates the biosynthesis of a variety of beta cell proteins at the level of translation, the mechanism responsible for this effect is unknown. We demonstrate that incubation of pancreatic islets with elevated glucose levels results in rapid and concentration-dependent phosphorylation of PHAS-I, an inhibitor of mRNA cap-binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E. Our initial approach was to determine if this effect is mediated by the metabolism of glucose and activation of islet cell protein kinases, or whether insulin secreted from the beta cell stimulates phosphorylation of PHAS-I via an insulin-receptor mechanism as described for insulin-sensitive cells. In support of the latter mechanism, inhibitors of islet cell protein kinases A and C exert no effect on glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, the immunosuppressant, rapamycin, and theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, promote marked dephosphorylation of PHAS-I. In addition, exogenous insulin and endogenous insulin secreted by the beta cell line, βTC6-F7, increase phosphorylation of PHAS-I, suggesting that beta cells of the islet, in part, mediate this effect. Studies with beta cell lines and islets indicate that amino acids are required for glucose or exogenous insulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, and amino acids alone dose-dependently stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, which is further enhanced by insulin. Furthermore, rapamycin inhibits by ∼62% the increase in total protein synthesis stimulated by high glucose concentrations. These results indicate that glucose stimulates PHAS-I phosphorylation via insulin interacting with its own receptor on the beta cell which may serve as an important mechanism for autoregulation of protein synthesis by translation. Although glucose regulates the biosynthesis of a variety of beta cell proteins at the level of translation, the mechanism responsible for this effect is unknown.

Studies with beta cell lines and islets indicate that amino acids are required for glucose or exogenous insulin to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, and amino acids alone dose-dependently stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, which is further enhanced by insulin. Furthermore, rapamycin inhibits by ∼62% the increase in total protein synthesis stimulated by high glucose concentrations. These results indicate that glucose stimulates PHAS-I phosphorylation via insulin interacting with its own receptor on the beta cell which may serve as an important mechanism for autoregulation of protein synthesis by translation. The metabolism of glucose regulates a variety of physiological processes by beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. These processes include insulin biosynthesis and secretion, beta cell replication, and the synthesis of a number of beta cell proteins. Glucose exerts a specific stimulatory effect on insulin gene expression over time intervals of hours (1Nielsen D.A. Welsh M. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13585-13589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Goodison S. Kenna S. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the biosynthesis of insulin is significantly controlled within minutes at the level of protein translation (3Permutt M.A. Kipnis D.M.

Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 37-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the enhancement of insulin synthesis by glucose at the translational level occurs rapidly and does not require synthesis of new mRNA, limited information is available on processes that regulate translation. More recent studies indicate that insulin is only one of a number of beta cell proteins whose synthesis is regulated by glucose at the level of translation (6Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Glucose has been shown to increase the biosynthesis of a secretory granule membrane protein, SGM 110 (7Grimaldi K.A. Siddle K. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and also chromogranin A (8Guest P.C. Rhodes C.J. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to a similar extent as insulin, suggesting that translational control may extend to a variety of other beta cell proteins. The initiation phase of mRNA translation is generally rate-limiting for protein synthesis. Initiation is mediated in part by the eIF 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; MEM, minimum essential medium; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; KRBB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RIA, radioimmunoassay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; MEM, minimum essential medium; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; KRBB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RIA, radioimmunoassay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate.-4F complex, which is composed of three subunits, eIF-4γ, eIF-4A, and eIF-4E (9Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). eIF-4γ is a large subunit (Mr 220,000) that binds eIF-4A (Mr 45,000) and eIF-4E (Mr 25,000). eIF-4A is an ATP-dependent helicase, and eIF-4E is the mRNA cap-binding protein. Thus, eIF-4F is involved in both the recognition of the capped mRNA and melting of secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region. eIF-4E is the least abundant of the eIF-4F subunits, and it is generally believed that the amount of eIF-4E is limiting for translation initiation. The availability of eIF-4E is regulated by PHAS-I, a heat- and acid-stable eIF-4E binding protein first identified in rat adipocytes (10Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A-C. Donze O. Lin T-A.

Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The nonphosphorylated form of PHAS-I binds tightly to eIF-4E, and prevents eIF-4E from binding to eIF-4γ. When phosphorylated in the appropriate site(s), PHAS-I dissociates from eIF-4E, allowing the factor to participate in translation initiation. PHAS-I is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by a variety of protein kinases. Casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinase have been reported to phosphorylate recombinant PHAS-I (12Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

This mitogen-induced phosphorylation is also sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (15Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Recent studies on PHAS-I have implicated a signaling pathway involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Thus, mTOR appears to be a site by which the rapamycin·FKBP12 complex mediates the dephosphorylation of PHAS-I (15Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T.

Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that PHAS-I has an important role in regulating translation in a variety of cells by signal transduction pathways that involve protein phosphorylation. Stimulus secretion coupling of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells is a complex process involving the transport and metabolism of glucose with the generation of metabolic intermediates including ATP. It is proposed that increases in ATP are associated with the closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels, cell depolarization, and Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (19Misler S. Barnett D.W. Gillis K.D. Pressel D.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is also strong evidence that protein kinases play a key role in modulating the insulin secretory process by beta cells. The major serine/threonine kinases that have been studied in insulin secretion include Ca2+ and calmodulin protein kinase (20Krueger K.A. Bhatt H. Landt M. Easom R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27464-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Ca2+ and phospholipid protein kinase C (21Metz S.A.

Lipid Res. 1987; 26: 125-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), cAMP protein kinase A (23Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently mitogen-activated protein kinases (24Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J.

J. 1996; 313: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also indicates that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion activates a beta cell surface insulin receptor kinase and the intracellular effector substrate, insulin receptor substrate-1, from βTC3 cells (26Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results and others (27Harbeck M.C. Louie D.C. Howland J. Wolf B.A. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 711-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that insulin released from the beta cell of the islet may bind to its own cell-surface receptor and serve as an autocrine mechanism for the regulation of beta cell function. We have therefore examined these aspects of stimulus secretion coupling of insulin secretion by beta cells on PHAS-I activation as reflected by its phosphorylation state, signaling pathways, and proposed functional role to regulate protein translation by the beta cell of the pancreatic islet. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Sasco (O'Fallon, MO) and Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Collagenase type P was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium, penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, l-glutamine, MEM amino acids solution, and MEM nonessential amino acids solution were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was supplied by the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center. Rapamycin and N-6,2′-o-dibutyryladenosine-3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Ficoll, theophylline, and CPT-cAMP were from Sigma. Insulin was obtained from Lilly and ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Pro-mix L-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix was from Amersham Corp. The primary antibody was generated in rabbit with recombinant His-tagged rat PHAS-I (11Lin T-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunologicals). All other chemicals were from commercially available sources. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB; 25 mm HEPES, 115 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, containing 3 mmd-glucose, and 0.1% BSA) was supplemented with MEM amino acids solution, MEM nonessential amino acids solution, andl-glutamine. For these experiments, the 1 × concentration of amino acids was defined as the following (in mm): l-arginine 0.73, l-cystine 0.2, l-glutamine 2.0,l-histidine·HCl·H2O 0.2,l-isoleucine 0.4, l-leucine 0.4,l-lysine HCl 0.5, l-methionine 0.1,l-phenylalanine 0.2, l-threonine 0.4,l-tryptophan 0.05, l-tyrosine 0.2,l-valine 0.4, l-alanine 0.1,l-asparagine 0.1, l-aspartic acid 0.1,l-glutamic acid 0.1, glycine 0.1, l-proline 0.1, l-serine 0.1. The concentrations of amino acids in CMRL-1066 and DMEM are comparable. Islets were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion as described previously (28McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreases were inflated with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the tissue was isolated, minced, and digested with 7 mg of collagenase/pancreas for 7 min at 39 °C. Islets were separated on a Ficoll step density gradient and then selected with a stereomicroscope to exclude any contaminating tissues. Islets were cultured overnight in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in “complete” CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium (cCMRL) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Where “CMRL” is stated, this culture medium does not contain fetal bovine serum. βTC3 and βTC6-F7 cells were kindly provided by Norman Fleischer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), and RINm5F cells were obtained from the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center. RINm5F cells were grown in cCMRL medium, and βTC3 as well as βTC6-F7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum as described by Knaack et al. (29Knaack D. Fiore D.M. Surana M. Leisor M. Laurance M. FuscoDeMane D. Hegre O.D. Fleischer N. Efrat S. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Petri dishes (60 × 15 mm) at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/3 ml. RINm5F cells were used after 1 day. βTC3 and βTC6-F7 cells were used after 5 days of culture, and medium was replaced once during that time. βTC3 and βTC6-F7 cells were pretreated in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose for 24 h before experiments were begun. Two separate protocols were used to prepare tissue for PHAS-I immunoblotting. In the first experimental protocol, islets (200–300/1 ml or 1500 cells/10 ml) were incubated in CMRL or DMEM at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 as described in the figure legends. The islets were then centrifuged (Beckman Microfuge B) for 10 s, the supernatant was removed for insulin RIA, and the islets were resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The islets were homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Heated supernatants were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the supernatants, and 50 μl were subjected to SDS-PAGE. An immunoblot was performed using rabbit anti-PHAS-I and donkey, anti-rabbit IgG, as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Detection was performed using ECL reagents from Amersham Corp. To reduce islet tissue requirements, a second protocol for PHAS-I immunoblotting was used. Following experimental treatments as described in the figure legends, islets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. βTC3 and βTC6–7F cells were glucose- and amino acid-depleted in KRBB for 2 h. Fresh KRBB was added containing test reagents as indicated in the figure legends for 30–120 min. Supernatants were saved for insulin RIA. The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 300 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were withdrawn, and 30 μl total protein from each reaction were used for PHAS-I immunoblotting analysis. For experiments to determine the binding of PHAS-I to eIF-4E, islet extracts were incubated with an affinity resin of the cap homolog 7-methyl-guanosine triphosphate, proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (11Lin T-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Groups of 100 islets were glucose and serum depleted in 1 ml of CMRL (0.1% BSA, 90% methionine-free) for 90 min. Rapamycin (25, 50, or 100 nm) was added to the medium for an additional 30 min. Medium was removed and replaced with 0.1 ml of 90% methionine-free CMRL + 3 or 20 mm glucose ± rapamycin for 1 h with 80 μCi of Pro-mix L-[35S] in vitro labeling mix. Islets were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.1% BSA, 0.02% NaN3), and protein was precipitated with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were washed once with 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 50 μl of Protosol. The scintillation mixture was added and the radioactivity was quantitated. PHAS-I generally appears as three migrating bands when separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. These bands are designated as α, β, and γ. The nonphosphorylated α-form migrates most rapidly. Increases in phosphorylation of the intermediate β-form to the most highly phosphorylated γ-form decreases migration of PHAS-I proportionately when separated by SDS-PAGE. Under most conditions with islets, the nonphosphorylated, α-form of PHAS-I is barely detectable. Initial studies were performed to determine both the effects of glucose concentration and the time dependence of glucose exposure on phosphorylation of PHAS-I. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of pancreatic islets to 20 mm glucose in cCMRL for 10, 30, or 180 min resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ (lanes 2,4, and 6) and the concomitant decrease of the intermediate migrating PHAS-I (β) compared with a basal glucose concentration of 5.5 mm (lanes 1, 3, and 5). The increased phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ in response to 20 mm glucose occurred rapidly within 10 min or less and was stable for at least a 3-h period. As a control, PHAS-Iα, β, and γ obtained from isolated rat adipocytes are shown inlane 7. To determine if glucose-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I is mediated by the metabolism of glucose and activation of major islet cell protein kinases, inhibitors of protein kinases A and C were initially evaluated. The selective protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine (10 μm) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), an agonist of protein kinase C, exerted no effects on glucose-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I. The cAMP analogues, CPT-cAMP (0.2 mm) and dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mm) as well as staurosporine (100 nm), a potent and nonselective inhibitor of protein kinase A and protein kinase C were also ineffective in modulating glucose-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I, suggesting that protein kinase A and most likely mitogen-activating protein kinase were not involved (30Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Thom A. Hazlerigg D.G. Morrison K.S. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Recent studies have indicated a role for the insulin receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mTOR in the signaling pathway involved in phosphorylation of PHAS-I by insulin-sensitive cells (15Brunn G.J.

To determine if insulin secreted from the beta cell stimulates phosphorylation of PHAS-I via an insulin-receptor mechanism, we evaluated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, the immunosuppressant, rapamycin, and theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that also blocks p70s6k (31Han J.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26619-26625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in this signaling pathway by pancreatic islets. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of islets in CMRL in the presence of 20 mm glucose (lane 2) resulted in increased phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ in comparison to 3 mm glucose (lane 1). Co-incubation of islets with wortmannin, rapamycin, and theophylline resulted in the dephosphorylation of PHAS-I to a level similar to that observed at basal glucose levels. PHAS-Iα, which is not normally visible at basal glucose concentrations, becomes apparent with these inhibitors. These findings are consistent with insulin-mediated phosphorylation of PHAS-I in insulin-sensitive cells. Experiments were next performed to determine if insulin secretion from beta cells of the islet may be responsible for enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-I. As illustrated in Fig. 3 A (lane 2), exposure of islets incubated in CMRL to 20 mm glucose for 30 min resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ in comparison to low glucose levels of 1 mm (lane 1). Furthermore, exposure of islets to exogenous insulin at 2, 20, and 200 nm (lanes 3, 4, and 5) under low glucose levels of 1 mm markedly stimulated in a dose-dependent manner phosphorylation of PHAS-I, similar to that observed with 20 mm glucose. These results suggested that glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I is mediated by insulin secreted into the incubation medium. To further support this possibility, islets were incubated at 24 °C, a condition that blocks almost completely insulin exocytosis from beta cells. Under these conditions of reduced temperature, ion fluxes are minimally affected (33Escolar J.C. Hoo-Paris R. Castex Ch Sutter B. Ch J. J. Endocrinol. 1987; 115: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Renstrom E. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and glucose utilization (3H2O formation from 5-[3H]glucose) and glucose oxidation (14CO2 formation from [U-14C]glucose) are reduced by only 50–60% (35Ishihara F. Aizawa T. Taguchi N. Sato Y. Hashizume K. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 143: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, blocking endogenous insulin secretion by reducing the incubation temperature from 37 °C (lanes 3,4, 7, and 8) to 24 °C (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) significantly attenuated glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ. Insulin secretion levels at basal 3 mm glucose were 3.8 ± 0.6 nm at 24 °C and 5.3 ± 0.7 nm at 37 °C. At a stimulatory glucose concentration of 20 mm, insulin secretion levels were 4.0 ± 0.5 nm at 24 °C and 16.0 ± 1.7 nm at 37 °C. Inhibition of glucose induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I was also observed when islets were co-incubated with norepinephrine (10 and 50 μm), conditions that inhibit insulin exocytosis (data not shown). Taken together, these findings support the concept that glucose-induced phosphorylation of PHAS-I is mediated by insulin secreted from the beta cell. Our previous studies were performed with islets incubated in CMRL culture medium. The ability of glucose to stimulate phosphorylation of PHAS-I was also evaluated in KRBB. Unexpectedly, it was found that glucose did not stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in KRBB in the complete absence of amino acids, even though islets secrete insulin normally in KRBB under these conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, an elevated glucose concentration of 20 mm stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ (lane 2 versus lane 1), and exogenous insulin (200 nm) produced similar effects from islets incubated in CMRL containing 1 mm glucose (lane 3). In contrast, neither an elevated glucose concentration (lane 5) nor exogenous insulin (lane 6) induced PHAS-I phosphorylation by islets incubated in KRBB in the complete absence of amino acids. To further define this requirement for amino acids in PHAS-I phosphorylation, the effects of amino acids alone and in the presence of exogenous insulin were evaluated with the beta cell line, RINm5F. In this experimental design, KRBB was supplemented with amino acids over the range of 0.1–10 × (see Material and Methods for concentrations defined as 1 ×). As shown in Fig. 5 A, amino acids dose-dependently stimulated phosphorylation of PHAS-I with a maximal effect observed at ∼1 ×, i.e. a similar complement and concentration of amino acids present in CMRL. As shown in Fig. 5 B, exogenous insulin (200 nm) (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) also synergized with amino acids to further enhance phosphorylation of PHAS-I by RINm5F cells. The enhancing effect of exogenous insulin on PHAS-I phosphorylation was observed at amino acid concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, and 1 ×. In Fig. 5 C, incubation of RINm5F cells in KRBB in the presence of 1 × amino acids (lane 2) resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ in comparison to the absence of amino acids (lane 1). Wortmannin, rapamycin, and theophylline induced the dephosphorylation of PHAS-Iγ stimulated by 1 × amino acids. To determine if the beta cell of the islet mediates this effect, conditions that stimulate insulin secretion from the beta cell line, βTC6-F7, were also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6 A, 20 mm glucose + 0.5 mm carbachol over an amino acid concentration range of 0.05–0.25 × in KRBB (lanes 4, 6, and 8) significantly enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-I. Insulin secretion observed in the absence of these secretagogues (lanes 3, 5, and 8) at amino acid concentrations of 0.05, 0.10, and 0.25 × was 1.2 ± 0.2, 0.9 ± 0.2, and 2.6 ± 0.7 nm, respectively. In the presence of 20 mm glucose + 0.5 mm carbachol, insulin secretion increased to 8.7 ± 2.0, 9.2 ± 0.5, and 14.8 ± 1.8 nm at these same amino acid concentrations and was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of PHAS-I. It is interesting to note that in lane 2 of Fig. 6 A in the absence of amino acids, PHAS-I phosphorylation is not increased even though insulin secretion is stimulated with 20 mm glucose + 0.5 mm carbachol (lane 1, 0.9 ± 0.3 nm versus lane 2, 5.8 ± 1.0 nminsulin). As observed previously with islets in Fig. 4, amino acids are essential for increased phosphorylation of PHAS-I mediated by glucose and exogenous insulin. In Fig. 6 B, the lowering of the incubation temperature from 37 to 24 °C significantly reduced both insulin secretion and phosphorylation"

UTP and ATP stimulated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation, Ca2+ release, and contraction that were abolished by U-73122 and guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)diphosphate, and partly inhibited (50–60%) by pertussis toxin (PTX). ATP analogs (adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate, and 2-methylthio-ATP) stimulated Ca2+ influx and contraction that were abolished by nifedipine and in Ca2+-free medium. Micromolar concentrations of ATP stimulated both Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release.ATP and UTP activated Gq/11 and Gi3 in gastric and aortic smooth muscle and heart membranes, Gq/11 and Gi1 and/or Gi2 in liver membranes, and Go and Gi1–3 in brain membranes. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by ATP and UTP was mediated concurrently by Gαq/11-dependent activation of phospholipase (PL) C-β1 and Gβγi3-dependent activation of PLC-β3. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was partially inhibited by PTX or by antibodies to Gαq/11, Gβ, PLC-β1, or PLC-β3, and completely inhibited by the following combinations (PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 antibodies; Gαq/11 and Gβ antibodies; PLC-β1 and Gβ antibodies; PTX with either PLC-β1 or Gαq/11 antibody).The pattern of responses implied that P2Y2 receptors in visceral, and probably vascular, smooth muscle are coupled to PLC-β1 via Gαq/11 and to PLC-β3 via Gβγi3.

Their co-existence raises the question as to which receptor subtype mediates preferentially the action of the endogenous ligand, ATP. In the present study, we have used a series of purine and pyrimdine agonists to characterize P2 receptors in dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells and identify the signaling pathways to which they are coupled. Comparative studies characterized the coupling of P2Y receptors to G proteins in vascular smooth muscle, heart, liver, and brain. P2X1 and P2Y2 receptors were shown to co-exist on gastric smooth muscle cells and to mediate Ca2+ mobilization and muscle contraction via three distinct pathways. UTP and nanomolar concentrations of ATP activated exclusively P2Y2 receptors, whereas micromolar concentrations of ATP activated additionally P2X1 receptors. The pattern suggests that contraction induced by purine and pyrimidine nucleotides may be preferentially mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the circular muscle layer of rabbit stomach by sequential enzymatic digestion, filtration, and centrifugation as described previously (38Bitar K.N.

The muscle cells were harvested by filtration through 500-μm Nitex mesh and centrifuged twice at 350 × g for 10 min. In some experiments, the muscle cells were reversibly permeabilized using the Trans.Port reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (40Murthy K.S. Zhang K-M. Jin J-G. Grider J.R.

Trans.Port reagent (15 μl/ml) was added with or without GDPβS (10 μm) and the mixture incubated at 31 °C for 20 min. Permeabilization was terminated by addition of Stop solution (30 μl/ml) and the cell suspension centrifuged for 15 min at 350 ×g. The cells were resuspended in control HEPES medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated at 31 °C for 1 h.

Homogenates prepared from dispersed gastric muscle cells were solubilized on ice for 1 h in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% sodium cholate. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Solubilized proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with subtype-specific G protein or PLC-β antibodies, and then for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.

Contraction of dispersed muscle cells was measured by scanning micrometry as described previously (38Bitar K.N. Makhlouf G.M. Nature. 1982; 297: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Bitar K.N. Makhlouf G.M. Science. 1982; 216: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Murthy K.S. Zhang K-M.

The length of 50 muscle cells treated with one concentration of a contractile agent was measured by scanning micrometry and compared with the length of 50 untreated muscle cells. All measurements were done in the presence of adenosine A1 and A2 antagonists (1 μm DPCPX and 0.1 μm CGS-15943, respectively) (47Murthy K.S. McHenry L. Makhlouf G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 300-306PubMed Google Scholar). Time course measurements were done at intervals ranging from 5 s to 5 min. As with other agonists, peak contraction was measured at 30 s and the response used to construct concentration-response curves. Contraction was expressed as the mean decrease in cell length from control in micrometers or as the percent decrease in cell length (range of control cell length in various experiments 96 ± 4 to 103 ± 5 μm). Cytosolic free Ca2+([Ca2+]i) was measured by fluorescence in suspensions of muscle cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ dye, fura 2, as described previously (40Murthy K.S. Zhang K-M. Jin J-G. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G660-G671PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kuemmerle J.F. Martin D.C. Murthy K.S. Kellum J.M. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1090-1096PubMed Google Scholar). Autofluorescence of unloaded cells was determined in each suspension and subtracted from the fluorescence of fura 2-loaded cells. Measurements were done in the presence of adenosine A1 and A2 antagonists. Ca2+ levels were calculated under basal conditions and upon addition of agonist from the ratios of observed, minimal and maximal fluorescence (49Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). IP3 was measured in dispersed muscle cells by a radioreceptor assay which utilizes 3H-labeledd-myo-IP3 and bovine brain microsomes as described previously (41Murthy K.S. Coy D.C. Makhlouf G.M. J.

Agonists were added for 30 s in the presence of adenosine A1 and A2 antagonists to 1 ml of muscle cell suspension (106 cells/ml) and the reaction terminated with an equal volume of ice-cold 10% perchloric acid. The supernatant was extracted and IP3 content in the aqueous phase was measured. The results were expressed as picomoles of IP3/106cells. PLC-β activity was determined in plasma membranes by a modification of the method of Uhing et al. (50Uhing R.J. Prpic V. Jiang H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2140-2146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (43Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1172-1179PubMed Google Scholar,51Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C969-C978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were isolated from dispersed muscle cells labeled with myo-[3H]inositol. PLC-β assay was initiated by addition of 0.4 mg of membrane protein to 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 nm free Ca2+, 1 μm GTPγS, 5 mmphosphocreatine, and 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase in a total volume of 0.4 ml. After incubation at 31 °C for 60 s, the reaction was terminated with 0.6 ml of 25% trichloroacetic acid (w/v). The supernatant was extracted four times with 2 ml of diethyl ether and the amount of labeled inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase was counted. All measurements were done in the presence of adenosine A1 and A2 antagonists. PLC-β activity was expressed as counts/min/mg protein/min. G proteins selectively activated by P2 receptor agonists in muscle cell membranes were identified by the method of Okomoto et al. (52Okomoto T. Ikezu T. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I.

Muscle cell homogenates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min, and the crude membranes solubilized for 60 min at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES medium (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA, 240 mm NaCl, and 1% CHAPS. The membranes were diluted 10-fold and incubated at 37 °C with 60 nm[35S]GTPγS in a medium containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μm EDTA, and 10 mmMgCl2. The reaction was stopped with 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl medium (pH 8.0) containing 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μmGTP, and the mixture incubated for 2 h on ice in wells precoated with specific G protein antibodies. The wells were washed three times with phosphate buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and the radioactivity from each well was counted. Coating with G protein antibodies (1:1000) was done after the wells were first coated with anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) for 2 h on ice. The measurements were done in the presence of adenosine A1 and A2antagonists. In separate experiments on rabbit aortic smooth muscle, heart, liver, and whole brain, membranes were obtained by homogenization of these tissues without prior cell isolation. The homogenates were treated as described above for gastric smooth muscle cells. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. of n separate experiments and evaluated statistically using Student's t test for paired or unpaired data. Concentration-response curves were analyzed using the P.fit 6.0 program. d-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate assay system,myo-[3H]inositol, and [35S]GTPγS were obtained from Amersham; fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester from Molecular Probes; U-73122 from Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA; polyclonal antibodies to PLC-β1, PLC-β2, PLC-β3, PLC-β4, and Gβ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; polyclonal antibodies to Gαi1, Gαo, Gαi1–2, Gαi3, Gαq/11, and Gαs, and peptide fragments against which antibodies to Gαq/11 (QLNLKEYNLV) and Gαi3 (KNNKECGLY) were raised from Calbiochem; Gαi2 from Chemicon, Temecula, CA; DPCPX, AMP-PCP, AMP-CPP, and 2-methylthio-ATP from Research Biochemicals, Natick, MA; CGS-15943 from Ciba-Geigy, Summit, NJ; and all other reagents from Sigma. Exposure of muscle cells to 1 μm UTP or ATP caused immediate contraction that was virtually linear during the first 10 s and attained a peak in 30 s followed by a decline to lower levels (Fig. 1 A). The biphasic time course was identical to that observed with other contractile agonists (38Bitar K.N. Makhlouf G.M. Nature. 1982; 297: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 53Bitar K.N. Bradford P.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16591-16596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peak response at 30 s was used to construct concentration-response curves. Prolonged exposure of muscle cells to purine or pyrimidine agonists resulted in time-dependent desensitization that was more rapid with P2X receptor agonists (e.g. AMP-PCP) than with P2Y receptor agonists (e.g., UTP) (Fig. 1 B). With either type of agonist, however, there was minimal desensitization (<2% of control response) during the initial 30-s period when peak response was measured. UTP, ATP, and ATP analogs caused concentration-dependent contraction of dispersed smooth muscle cells yielding curves with EC50 values of 33 ± 9 and 34 ± 6 nmfor ATP and UTP, respectively, 78 ± 17 and 85 ± 20 nm for AMP-PCP and AMP-CPP, respectively, and 178 ± 23 nm for 2-methylthio-ATP (Fig. 2). Except for the response to 2-methylthio-ATP, maximal contraction induced by all agonist (29 ± 3 to 30 ± 2% decrease in cell length) was similar to that elicited by other contractile agonists, such as cholecystokinin octapeptide (30 ± 3%) or acetylcholine (31 ± 4%). ATP, UTP, AMP-PCP, and AMP-CPP increased cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]i) in dispersed smooth muscle cells by 1-fold at 10 nm and by 3-fold at 10 μm (T"

The recently described protein Ldb1 (also known as NLI; LIM domain-binding protein) binds LIM domains in vitro and synergizes with the LIM-homeodomain protein Xlim-1 in frog embryo microinjection experiments. In this study we localized the transcriptional activation domain of Xlim-1 to its carboxyl-terminal region, and characterized the interactions of the amino-terminally located LIM domains with Ldb1. Ldb1 binds LIM domains through its carboxyl-terminal region, and can form homodimers via its amino-terminal region. Optimal binding to Ldb1 required tandem LIM domains, while single domains could bind at lower but clearly measurable efficiency. In animal explant experiments, synergism of Ldb1 with Xlim-1 in the activation of downstream genes required both the region containing the dimerization domain of Ldb1 and the region containing the LIM-binding domain. The role of Ldb1 may be to recruit other transcriptional activators depending on the promoter context and LIM-homeodomain partner involved.

The role of Ldb1 may be to recruit other transcriptional activators depending on the promoter context and LIM-homeodomain partner involved. LIM domains, cysteine-rich motifs which bind zinc and mediate protein-protein interactions, are found in diverse proteins which may also contain homeodomains, kinase domains, cytoskeletal components, or other conserved domains (reviewed in Refs. 1Dawid I.B. Toyama R. Taira M. C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1995; 318: 295-306PubMed Google Scholar and 2Gill G.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1285-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). LIM domain proteins have been classified into three groups (3Taira M. Evrard J.-L. Steinmetz A. Dawid I.B. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The first group contains paired LIM domains, classified as type A and B, near the amino terminus, and often but not always also contain a homeodomain (LIM-homeodomain proteins). This group contains LMO (LIM-only) proteins which contain little sequence not within the paired LIM domains. The second group contains one or two copies of a single sequence type of LIM domain (type C). The third group includes a heterogenous collection of LIM domains that are generally localized near the carboxyl terminus and are often associated with additional domains, some of which bind to cytoskeletal components. The biological consequences of disruption of LIM-homeodomain genes has been studied in several cases, demonstrating the importance of these genes in development, especially in neuronal cells. For example, mutation of the Caenorhabditis elegans mec-3 gene prevented the generation of touch receptor neurons (4Way J.C. Chalfie M. Cell. 1988; 54: 5-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Disruption of the murinelim-1 gene led to lack of head formation (5Shawlot W. Behringer R.R. Nature. 1995; 374: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), affecting forebrain, midbrain, and some hindbrain elements. Lhx3 null mice miss the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland (6Sheng H.Z. Zhadanov A.B. Mosinger Jr., B. Fujii T. Bertuzzi S. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang S.-P. Mahon K.A. Westphal H. Science. 1996; 272: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), while mice that lack Isl-1 function are deficient in motorneuron and interneuron formation (7Pfaff S.L. Mendelsohn M. Stewart C.L. Edlund T. Jessel T.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, the importance of the LIM-homeodomain proteins is clear, but the molecular mechanism of their action is not fully understood. The LIM-homeodomain protein Xlim-1 is specifically expressed in the Spemann organizer during the gastrula stage in Xenopus (8Taira M. Jamrich M. Good P.J. Dawid I.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Overexpression experiments indicate that the LIM domains of Xlim-1 exert a negative regulatory function, since mutant forms in which the LIM domains are disrupted can initiate neural and muscle induction in animal explants (9Taira M. Otani H. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Other types of experiments have also provided evidence that LIM domains play a negative regulatory role in the activity of LIM-homeodomain proteins (10German W.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 11Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These studies implied that LIM-homeodomain proteins may be activated in vivo by interaction with other proteins that would abrogate the inhibitory role of the LIM domains and, possibly, exert an additional activating or modulating function. Recently, we have isolated a LIM domain-binding protein, named Ldb1, 1The abbreviations used are: Ldb, LIM domain-binding protein; NLI, nuclear LIM interactor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; AD, activation domain; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. from mouse and Xenopus (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These proteins are 98% identical over their entire length. Ldb1 binds to LIM domains from all LIM-homeodomain proteins tested and to LMO1 and LMO2, but not to LIM domains of group II or group III proteins (1Dawid I.B. Toyama R. Taira M. C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1995; 318: 295-306PubMed Google Scholar). In explant experiments, Ldb1 synergizes with Xlim-1 in the activation of downstream target genes likegoosecoid and chordin. Since in embryo microinjection experiments, the activity of Xlim-1 plus Ldb1 is similar to that of Xlim-1 with mutated or deleted LIM domains we concluded that Ldb1 relieves the inhibitory effect of the LIM domains (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The same protein was isolated independently by Jurata et al. (13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and named NLI, and more recently by Bach et al. (14Bach I. Carriere C. Ostendorff H.P. Anderson B. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In our previous work (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) Ldb1 was isolated because of its ability to bind LIM domains in an overlay assay using a mouse expression library, while the Xenopus ortholog emerged from a two-hybrid screen using LIM domains as bait. In the initial characterization of the interaction with the aid of the overlay assay we found that tandem LIM domains bound Ldb1 effectively, whereas proteins that carried a point mutation in either LIM domain or in both LIM domains bound poorly (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These results differ to some extent from those of Jurata et al. (13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) who found that NLI (identical to Ldb1) was able to bind the individual LIM A domain of Isl-1 and LIM B domain of Mec-3. Since the experiments of Agulnick et al. (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and Jurata et al. (13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) used different methods they may not be directly comparable, yet it is clear that the precise requirements for LIM-domain binding to Ldb1/NLI are not fully understood at present. To better understand the molecular mechanism of activation of Xlim-1 by Ldb1 we wished to better define the binding of Ldb1 to Xlim-1 LIM domains. We report here the result of quantitative two-hybrid assays which show that single LIM domains of Xlim-1 do bind Ldb1 but tandem AB LIM domains show the highest affinity. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo methods we show that the amino-terminal region of Ldb1 is able to form homodimers, and that the LIM-binding portion of Ldb1 is localized to the carboxyl terminus. Furthermore, using microinjection experiments we show that both the region containing the dimerization as well as the region containing the LIM-binding domain of Ldb1 are required for synergy with Xlim-1 in activation of downstream genes. These studies begin to define the molecular details of the synergistic interaction between Ldb1 and LIM domains in LIM-homeodomain proteins. Plasmids pAS2–1, pLAM, pACT2, and yeast strains Y187 and CG-1945 were from CLONTECH. ABL60, ABL60–1m, -2m, -3m, LIM A, and LIM B (see Fig. 1) were generated by PCR using Xlim-1 (9Taira M. Otani H. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as template, and fragments were cloned into pAS2–1. pXLdb1-ACT2 was generated by subcloning XLdb1 from pXLdb1SP64RI (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) to pACT2. pLdb1-ACT2 and subsequent deletions were generated by PCR for ligation into pACT2 and/or pAS2–1. DBD-Xlim-1 constructs were made by subcloning full-length Xlim-1, followed by generating deletions using PCR for cloning into pAS2–1. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The two-hybrid screen using Ldb1 as probe was performed using pLdb1(1–310)-AS2–1 in yeast CG-1945. This screen was done using aXenopus gastrula pGAD10 library essentially as described (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 105 transformants were plated and there were 2 His+lacZ+ clones. The quantitative interaction assay (Figs. 1 and 4) was performed as described by Moehle and Hinnebusch (15Moehle C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Fusion genes were introduced into Y187 by the lithium acetate transformation procedure (CLONTECH, Ref. 16Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown to stationary phase at 30 °C with agitation. Precultures were diluted 1:50 into fresh media and grown to OD600 of approximately 0.6–0.8, at which point cells were washed and frozen at −70 °C. Cells were lysed in a Braun homogenizer (Burlingame, CA) at 4 °C. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min and assays for β-galactosidase were performed in microtiter plates (17Menzel R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) over a reaction time of 1–2 h. Protein assays were performed by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using reagent from Bio-Rad. Enzyme activities are expressed as units (nanomoles ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside cleaved per minute per milligram of total protein). This assay is normalized to total protein in the extract, and we performed Western blotting of each construct used (using Gal4 DBD and AD antibodies (CLONTECH), as necessary) to verify full-length production of fusion proteins in the yeast assays. Each assay was performed with three transformants per condition. Qualitative interactions (Figs. 2 and 3) were performed using yeast strain Y187. Transformations were plated and assayed by the filter-lift method (CLONTECH) for β-galactosidase. Results were recorded as positive if blue color was developed after 3 h at 30 °C. Assays were repeated three times.Figure 3Ldb1 dimerizes via its amino-terminal region. Results of qualitative one-hybrid and two-hybrid assays are shown for different combinations of constructs. A DBD-Ldb1 fusion is positive in the one-hybrid assay, implying the presence of an activation domain in Ldb1; both the carboxyl-terminal truncation (1–310) and amino-terminal truncation (200–375) are inactive. Thus, the DBD-Ldb1(1–310) fusion could be used as a partner in two-hybrid assays with Gal4-AD-Ldb1 fusions. The results show that the amino-terminal 200 residues of Ldb1 can support dimerization with the Ldb1 (1–310) tester constructs, but constructs containing residues 1–150 or 50–375 cannot. All fusion proteins were subjected to Western analysis to confirm size and relative amount as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Lhx1 protein was produced in a baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH), and Ldb1 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli as follows. An oligonucleotide encoding a recognition site for protein kinase A (PKA, amino acid sequence RRASV) was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pFLAG-CTC (Kodak/IBI), upstream of the COOH-terminal FLAG epitope tag. PCR products encoding Lhx1, Ldb1, or Ldb1 carboxyl-terminal deletions were then cloned into this vector upstream of the added PKA site. The Ldb1 constructs were transformed intoE. coli XL-1 blue (Stratagene) cells. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.5, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 90 min, and crude bacterial lysates were made by boiling cell pellets in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. The Lhx1 construct was PCR amplified, including the PKA site and FLAG-tag, and cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector BacPAK9 (CLONTECH). Recombinant virus was obtained as described (CLONTECH) using BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen), and infection of Sf9 cells was done as described (CLONTECH). Lhx1-expressing cells were lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors, and lysates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a FLAG M2 antibody-agarose column (Kodak/IBI) as recommended by the manufacturer and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein was eluted with FLAG peptide (Kodak/IBI) in the same buffer. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%, and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. Purified Lhx1 protein was32P-labeled with the catalytic subunit of PKA (New England Biolabs) as described (19Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Labeled protein was purified on a G-50 column in overlay buffer (modified from Ref. 20Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar): 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.7), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Carnation non-fat dry milk). Ldb1-containing extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–16% acrylamide gels, Novex), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. For Western blots, the filters were probed with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For Far Western analysis, filters were blocked for at least 1 h in overlay buffer, probed with labeled Lhx1 (approximately 1 × 108 dpm/μg) in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C, or for 4 h at room temperature, washed in the same buffer 3 times for 20 min total, and autoradiographed on Kodak X-Omat AR film. Quantitation was accomplished using NIH image software on scanned autoradiographs. Animal cap experiments were carried out essentially as described (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ldb1 (full-length), Ldb1 (1–310), and Ldb1 (210–375) were cloned into pCS2+ using PCR and pSP64RI-Xldb1 (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) as template. Constructs were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. RNA was generated using MEGAscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturers specifications and injected into the animal hemisphere of both blastomeres at the 2-cell stage. During blastula, animal caps were dissected and cultured in cap media (67% L15 (Leibovitz medium), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 7.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5) until mid-gastrula (stage 11) or tailbud (stage 25) and flash frozen in dry ice. Collected animal caps were extracted for RNA and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Plasmids used for probes were: otx2 (21Pannese M. Polo C. Andreazzoli M. Vignali R. Kablar B. Barsacchi G. Boncinelli E. Development. 1995; 121: 707-720PubMed Google Scholar),chordin (22Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. DeRobertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), goosecoid (23Cho K.W.Y. Blumberg B. Steinbeisser H. DeRobertis E.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and nrp-1 (24Richter K. Good P.J. Dawid I.B. New Biol. 1990; 2: 556-565PubMed Google Scholar). Images were collected using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. To characterize the sequence requirements for this interaction we used a quantitative yeast two-hybrid system to measure in vivo binding efficiency between Ldb1 and several LIM domain constructs (Fig. 1). A Gal4-DBD fusion containing the tandem LIM domains A and B and the adjacent 60-residue linker region (ABL60) bound strongly to Ldb1 (LDB). This binding was reduced substantially by a single point mutation in either LIM domain in which a critical cysteine residue, involved in zinc binding, was changed to glycine (9Taira M. Otani H. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mutation of either LIM A (1m) or LIM B (2m) had about the same effect, decreasing β-galactosidase activity approximately 7-fold; this level of interaction, resulting in 250–300 units of β-galactosidase activity, was quite sufficient to give a positive reaction in the qualitative two-hybrid assay (blue colonies). Cys to Gly mutation in both LIM domains (3m) decreased binding dramatically to background levels (3m, 3 units/mg; reporter, 7 units/mg), resulting in negative (white) colonies. These data are in general agreement within vitro binding data shown previously, which showed a reduction of binding by each mutation but was not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between them (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We tested whether isolated LIM domains are sufficient for binding Ldb1, and found that LIM A alone bound at a similar level as mutant 2m, while LIM B bound very weakly at an average of 19 units/mg or 1.2% of ABL60. Nevertheless, the interaction between LIM B and Ldb1 is still sufficient to yield blue colonies in the qualitative assay, attesting to its high sensitivity. Clearly, LIM B alone bound less efficiently that mutant 1m in which the LIM A domain structure is disrupted. This observation suggested that the 60-residue linker region may assist Ldb binding by LIM B in the 1m construct. We conclude from these results that both LIM domains of Xlim-1 are required for optimal binding of Ldb1, and furthermore, that isolated LIM A but not LIM B can interact with Ldb1 at a substantial if suboptimal level. These conclusions are in general agreement with those of Jurata et al. (13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) for Isl-1 LIM domains, given the increased sensitivity of the yeast assay. Ldb1 has no sequence similarity to other proteins in the data base, and no domain structure could be inferred from its sequence. Therefore, truncation experiments were used to test for residues required for LIM domain binding. The protein overlay assay shown in Fig. 2 A used truncated forms of Ldb1 transferred to a filter in equal amounts, as seen in thetop panel. The lower panel shows the binding of labeled Lhx1 (mouse Lim-1) to the various Ldb1 truncations. Full-length Ldb1 (1–375) binds strongly to Lhx1, and so do the truncated forms missing 25 or 45 residues from the carboxyl terminus. However, truncating an additional 20 amino acids (construct 1–310) dramatically decreased binding. Whether the apparent 7% binding relative to full-length Ldb1 is significant could not be determined by this assay, but two-hybrid data shown below suggest that it is not. This result indicates that the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids of Ldb1 are not required for high efficiency binding to Lhx1, but the adjacent region between amino acids 310 and 330 is required for binding. To compare these in vitro results with the situationin vivo, we performed qualitative yeast two-hybrid assays; the results are summarized in Fig. 2 B. The Gal4-DBD fusion of the ABL60 region of Xlim-1 binds effectively to the Gal4-AD-Ldb1 fusion, as shown in Fig. 1. In agreement with the in vitroresults from panel A, the 65-amino acid carboxyl-terminal deletion of Ldb1 (1–310) does not bind in this assay. Since the qualitative two-hybrid assay is very sensitive (see Fig. 1), this negative result suggests that the truncated LDB1 (1–310) is totally incapable of binding LIM domains. In contrast, the ABL60 LIM domain construct binds to Ldb1 truncated at the amino terminus (Ldb1 200–375 and Ldb1 210–375). The Ldb1 210–375 fragment was originally isolated in the two-hybrid screen previously described (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and this truncation which contains the LIM-binding domain was also used for microinjection studies (Fig. 5). We conclude from these results that the LIM-binding domain in Ldb1 is located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, but excludes the carboxyl-terminal 45 amino acids. Ldb1 was originally found using LIM domains as bait in both an overlay-type assay and a two-hybrid screen. A Gal4-DBD-Ldb1 fusion was positive for β-galactosidase without partner, i.e. in the one-hybrid assay (Fig. 3), indicating that Ldb1 could activate transcription in yeast. This activity is comparatively low (see Fig. 4), but reproducibly led to blue colonies. In contrast, Ldb1 (1–310), which did not bind LIM domains (Fig. 2), also did not elicit β-galactosidase activity in the one-hybrid assay (Fig. 3); likewise, the Ldb1 (200–375) could not activate the lacZ reporter. While the biological relevance of the weak activation function in Ldb1 is uncertain, these observations allowed us to use the Gal4-DBD-Ldb1 (1–310) fusion in a two-hybrid screen to search for Ldb1-interacting proteins other than LIM domain proteins. Somewhat surprisingly, such a screen of a Xenopus gastrula library yielded two full-length Ldb1 clones. This result suggested that Ldb1 could form homodimers. The interaction between Ldb1 molecules was characterized further in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3). Dimerization requires the amino-terminal region, as constructs from which 50 or more residues have been deleted were unable to interact with the tester construct, Ldb1 (1–310). Turning to truncations from the carboxyl terminus we found that an Ldb1 fusion containing the amino-terminal 201 residues was capable of interacting with the Ldb1 (1–310) tester, but construct 1–150 could not. Thus, the amino-terminal half of Ldb1 is responsible for homodimer formation. Since residues in intervals 1–49 and 150–201 are required, it appears likely that the entire region from the amino terminus to about residue 200 forms a dimerization domain in Ldb1. While functional studies in Xenopus embryos have shown the importance of the LIM domains in Xlim-1, the domain(s) of Xlim-1 which are responsible for transcriptional activity have not been well studied. The carboxyl-terminal region of Xlim-1 has been assumed to be involved in transcriptional activation, by comparison to studies of the related LIM-homeodomain proteins Isl-1 and Mec3 (25Sanchez-Garcia I. Osada H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4243-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,26Lichtsteiner S. Tjian R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Gal4-DBD fusion with the amino-terminal portion of Xlim-1 containing both LIM domains, the linker, and the homeodomain, is inactive in the yeast one-hybrid assay (Fig. 2). To analyze the activation function of Xlim-1 further we measured the potential transactivation activity of different Xlim-1 constructs by quantitative one-hybrid analyses in yeast (Fig. 4). The yeast reporter strain Y187, with or without a DBD-lamin C control plasmid, has very low transcriptional activity. As mentioned already (see Fig. 3), Ldb1 is capable of expressing a measurable activation function although its activity is quite low and its biological function unclear (Fig. 4). In contrast, full-length Xlim-1 mediates high level transactivation of the reporter construct in the yeast cells. The isolated carboxyl terminus of Xlim-1 (see DBD-CT239) shows a decrease in activity to only approximately 3% of full-length Xlim-1. However, removal of 27 amino acids from the amino terminus in the fusion protein (DBD-CT266) leads to recovery of activity to a level approximately 31% of full-length Xlim-1. Further deletion of 39 amino acids results in low activity that does not appear to be further affected by the deletion of an additional 56 amino acids. The diminished activity of all of these constructs containing carboxyl-terminal regions of Xlim-1 are above background as they are positive in the qualitative assay (blue colonies), which requires just a low level of activity (see Fig. 1). From these results we conclude that the transcriptional activation domain of Xlim-1 resides in the carboxyl terminus. The region 266–403 is sufficient for strong, albeit not maximal, activation and the region 266–305 is an indispensable part of the activation domain. The low activity of the fusion containing the entire carboxyl-terminal domain (DBD-CT239) suggest the possibility of a transcriptional repressor function in the region between residues 239 and 266, but possible effects of protein folding may also account for this apparent inhibition. While results presented here show Ldb1 to contain a dimerization domain as well as a LIM-binding domain, it is not clear how these domains are involved in the activation of Xlim-1. Xenopus microinjection experiments were performed to test the ability of these molecules to activate expression of various molecular markers in naive ectodermal explants. In animal cap assays, coinjection of Xlim-1 and Ldb1 synergized to activate the Spemann organizer markers goosecoid and chordin, as reported previously, and the neural markers nrp-1 and otx2 (Fig. 5, Ref. 12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, coinjections of Xlim-1 and a fragment of Ldb1 containing its LIM domain-binding portion did not synergize to activate these gastrula or neurula specific genes. The fragment of Ldb1 which contains the dimerization domain, when coinjected with Xlim-1, was likewise unable to induce goosecoid, chordin, or otx2, while very weakly inducing nrp-1. As an additional comparison, Fig. 5shows the level of gene activation achieved by the activated mutant of Xlim-1, 3m (9Taira M. Otani H. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and also includes RNA from whole embryos at the equivalent stage and from uninjected animal caps as positive and negative controls, respectively. These results indicate that both halves of Ldb1 are required to synergize with Xlim-1 to activate downstream genes and that the interaction of truncated Ldb1 with LIM domains is not sufficient for this activity in vivo. We have analyzed the interaction of Xlim-1/Lhx1 with Ldb1 to better understand the molecular action of both proteins. Xlim-1 appears to have latent properties and can be activated in Xenopusanimal explant experiments by mutation or deletion of both LIM domains (9Taira M. Otani H. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that wild-type Xlim-1 also can be activated by coexpression of Ldb1 in animal explants (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that tandem LIM domains of Xlim-1 are required for optimal binding of Ldb1, confirming and expanding our previously published in vitro results (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) with the use of the two-hybrid technology. While tandem LIM domains are required for optimal binding, individual domains can bind Ldb1. This was concluded from studying the Cys to Gly mutations 1m (LIM A mutation) and 2m (LIM B mutation) which interact with Ldb1 at a lower but still clearly measurable level as compared with the intact wild-type tandem LIM domains. However, the double LIM domain point mutation 3m showed no binding to XLdb1. In testing deletion constructs containing single LIM domains, we found that the LIM A domain of Xlim-1 bound to Ldb1 with an affinity approximately equal to the 1m and 2m mutants, while the LIM B bound very weakly but still gave a positive interaction signal in the qualitative assay (blue colonies). Of the various LIM domain constructs tested, only the double LIM domain mutation 3m showed no binding,i.e. yielded white colonies. These results agree in general with those of Jurata et al. (13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), who found that the Isl-1 LIM A domain binds to Ldb1/NLI but the LIM B does not. The fact that we were able to detect low level binding of the Xlim-1 LIM B domain to Ldb1 may be due to the increased sensitivity of the two-hybrid assay, or possibly to subtle differences in affinity of Ldb1/NLI for LIM domains from Xlim-1 and Isl-1. The major conclusion we draw from this portion of these studies is that tandem LIM domains bind much better to Ldb1 than single A or B LIM domains. While our results suggest that optimal binding to Ldb1 requires tandem AB LIM domains they do not address the question of possible affinity changes in response to other interacting proteins. Such additional interactions clearly occur, as, for example, Wadman et al.(27Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the existence of a complex containing Ldb1 together with GATA-1, E47, Tal1, and LMO2. This study implicated Ldb1 as a component of a bridging complex for transcriptional activation in hematopoiesis. In addition, it is clear that LIM domains from groups II and III, i.e. other than LIM-homeodomain or LMO proteins, interact individually with a variety of ligands (Refs. 28Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Wu R. Durick K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1285-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and furthermore, LIM domains may have more than one binding interface (28Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Since Ldb1 is a novel LIM-binding protein we investigated which portion of Ldb bound to LIM domains, and found that the carboxyl-terminal portion of Ldb1 is sufficient and necessary for binding in vivo and in vitro. This conclusion is in agreement with the fact that we isolated a carboxyl-terminal portion of Ldb1 (amino acids 210–375) in our original two-hybrid screen for LIM domain-binding proteins (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, Jurata et al.(13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported in their identification of NLI/Ldb1 that they isolated one example of the carboxyl-terminal portion of NLI/Ldb1 which bound LMO2 LIM domains. To better understand the role of Ldb1 in vivo we performed a two-hybrid screen with a portion of Ldb1, using the first 310 amino acids which are incapable of binding LIM domains. This portion of Ldb1 did not autoactivate the lacZ reporter in yeast, i.e. did not contain a transactivation domain. The screen yielded two clones, both of which were full-length Xenopus Ldb1. Further experiments confirmed the ability of Ldb1 to form homodimers and showed that Ldb1-Ldb1 interaction was mediated by the first 201 amino acids of the protein. This result is particularly relevant as at least one other member of the Ldb family exists in both mice and humans (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and it is possible and perhaps likely that Ldb1 could form a heterodimer with Ldb2. Given the relatively nonspecific binding of LIM-homeodomain and LMO proteins to Ldb1, this potential for cross-talk between members of the Ldb family may be important for establishing specificity through recruitment and/or maintenance of other factors which are presumably present in the LIM-homeodomain·Ldb transcriptional complex. Xlim-1 contains multiple domains with apparent distinct roles in the overall function of this protein as a transcription factor. The LIM domains are thought to be negative regulators of Xlim-1 function, and mediate interactions with other proteins, among which Ldb1 is a major example. The homeodomain is well known as a DNA-binding domain and mediates additional protein-protein interactions (31Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1994Google Scholar), but the carboxyl terminus of Xlim-1, which is slightly proline rich (17%, Ref. 8Taira M. Jamrich M. Good P.J. Dawid I.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), is largely uncharacterized. We show here that the carboxyl terminus of Xlim-1 contains a transactivation domain as defined in the yeast one-hybrid system. This is in agreement with studies showing transcriptional activity in the carboxyl terminus of the LIM-homeodomain proteins Isl-1 (25Sanchez-Garcia I. Osada H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4243-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Mec-3 (26Lichtsteiner S. Tjian R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using a quantitative assay we found that the full-length protein gave the highest level of activity even though we have shown that the portion of the protein up to and including the homeodomain is transcriptionally silent (Ref. 12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, Fig. 2), as also shown for the Isl-1 homeodomain (32Sanchez-Garcia I. Axelson H. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1301-1306PubMed Google Scholar). It is notable that wild-type Xlim-1 is a strong transcriptional activator in yeast when fused to the Gal4-DBD, whereas inXenopus animal explants the LIM domains appear able to inhibit the transcriptional activity of Xlim-1. We conclude from studies presented here that the transcriptional activation domain of Xlim-1 resides in the carboxyl terminus, and that this domain is maximally active when associated with its neighboring domains in the native protein. This work shows that both the region of Ldb1 containing the dimerization domain and the region containing the LIM domain-binding domain are required for activation of Xlim-1 in vivo. In support of this conclusion, preliminary experiments showed that Ldb1 (1–310) and Ldb1 (210–375) were not capable of inducing a partial secondary axis when coinjected with Xlim-1; we have shown previously that full-length Ldb1 is able to perform this activity (12Agulnick A.D. Taira M. Breen J.J. Tanaka T. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Nature. 1996; 384: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). If the entire role of LIM domains in LIM-homeodomain proteins were a negative one it could be predicted that LIM binding alone should activate Xlim-1. The fact that the carboxyl-terminal domain, which binds LIM domains efficiently, cannot synergize with Xlim-1 in vivoimplies that Ldb1 may recruit other transcriptional activators to the Ldb1·Xlim-1 complex. The work in this report is in general agreement with a recent paper by Jurata and Gill and co-workers (33Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that appeared as this work was being revised. These authors, using different methods from those reported here, show that NLI/Ldb1 dimerizes via its amino terminus, binds LIM domains via amino acids 300–338, and interacts with the LIM-homeodomain protein Lmx1 with highest affinity when both LIM domains are present. This portion of the work is fully consistent with our results. However, when Jurata et al. (13Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) performed transfections in cell culture to test activity of Ldb1, they found that Ldb1 inhibited the synergy that was previously demonstrated for Lmx1 and the transcription factor E47 on an insulin mini-enhancer response element. This contrasts with our finding of stimulation of gene activation in vivo by Xlim-1 plus Ldb1, emphasizing the role of context in LIM domain-Ldb interactions. The particular sequence of the enhancer-promoter element involved and the nature of additional protein factors that participate in the regulation of the gene under study may determine not only the strength of the functional interactions between LIM-homeodomain proteins and Ldb1 but also whether such interactions lead to the enhancement or repression of transcriptional activity.

IGF activity mediated via specific cell surface receptors can be inhibited or enhanced when bound to IGFBPs (1Zapf J. Eur. J.

All of the 18 cysteines in human IGFBP-3 (hIGFBP-3) and at least 16 in human IGFBP-1 (hIGFBP-1) are involved in disulfide bonds (3Sommer A. Maack C.A. Spratt S.K. Mascarenhas D. Tresse T.J.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A non-conserved region separates the N- and C-terminal domains. It is likely that the regions of the IGFBPs which share sequence homology may confer similar tertiary structures leading to the formation of the IGF binding domain (5Landale E.C. Strong D.D. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, relatively few studies have investigated which regions on the IGFBPs are important for binding IGFs. Recently an additional low affinity IGFBP has been identified (human MAC25 (6Oh Y. Nagalla S.R. Yamanaka Y. Kim H.-S. Wilson E. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30322-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)). Despite an overall low degree of sequence similarity to IGFBPs 1–6 11, or possibly 12 cysteines in the N-terminal domain remain conserved, indicating that conservation of the cysteines confers a structure that leads to a common IGF binding region. Identification of fragmented IGFBPs and the analysis of their IGF binding has indicated that both the N-terminal (7Huhtala M.L. Koistinen R. Palomaki P. Partanen P. Bohn H. Seppala M. Biochem.

Commun. 1988; 157: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) cysteine-rich domains can bind IGF independently. Interestingly, a monoclonal antibody directed to two sites in the last 47 C-terminal residues of hIGFBP-1 inhibited IGF binding (11Schuller A.G. Lindenbergh-Kortleve D.J. de Boer W.I. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L. Growth Regul. 1993; 3: 32-34PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our recent chemical modification study has implicated Tyr60 in the N-terminal region of bovine IGFBP-2 (bIGFBP-2) as an important residue in IGF binding (12Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30529-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Clearly further investigations to determine the specific residues of both the N- and C termini involved in IGF binding are required. This study aims to further define the IGF binding site of bIGFBP-2 by recombinant production of C-terminally deleted bIGFBP-2 mutants and analysis of their IGF binding abilities. A similar approach of C-terminal deletion analysis was previously carried out by Brinkmanet al. (13Brinkman A. Kortleve D.J. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using hIGFBP-1. Two important considerations in design of our bIGFBP-2 mutants were highlighted by the results obtained by Brinkman et al. (13Brinkman A. Kortleve D.J. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). First, removal of 17 amino acids of hIGFBP-1 resulted in production of a mutant protein that formed aggregates. As the last cysteine had been removed this formation of aggregates suggested that an unpaired cysteine had been generated as a result of the deletion. Clearly, it is extremely difficult to design such mutants without the knowledge of the disulfide bonding pattern. Since there are currently no reports of the disulfide bonding pattern of IGFBPs, our first step in design of C-terminally truncated bIGFBP-2 mutants was to define the disulfide bonding pattern of the C terminus. Second, despite identification of recombinant mutant protein, Brinkmanet al. (13Brinkman A. Kortleve D.J. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) failed to detect 125I IGF binding by Western ligand blotting. However, several reports (14Guidice L.C. Farrell E.M. Pham H. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1990; 71: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 15Ocrant I. Fay C.T. Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have highlighted that fragmented IGFBPs are capable of binding IGFs in competitive binding assays and affinity labeling studies where binding is not detected by Western ligand blotting. Indeed recombinant C-terminally deleted human IGFBP-5 (hIGFBP-5) lacking the C-terminal domain but retaining all of the central non-conserved region was shown to bind IGF-I in charcoal binding assays (8Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22467-22472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in analysis of IGF binding by our C-terminal truncation bIGFBP-2 mutants, it was essential that purified mutants were subjected not only to Western ligand blotting but also to charcoal binding assays. The major outcome of this study has been the identification of a site in the C-terminal domain of bIGFBP-2 involved in IGF binding. In addition, in defining the disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal domain, we also demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions of bIGFBP-2 are not linked by disulfide bonds. This indicated that bIGFBP-2 exists as two separate cysteine-rich domains separated by the non-conserved central region. The disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal domain was shown to be Cys186-Cys220, Cys231-Cys242, Cys244-Cys265. Bovine IGFBP-2 (5 μg), prepared as described below, was cleaved in 100 μl of 100 mm HCl using 100 molar excess CNBr (Sigma, Australia) over the number of methionines in bIGFBP-2 at room temperature overnight. Analysis of cleavage involved separation on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and Coomassie staining. The largest fragment was isolated for N-terminal amino acid sequencing using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) as described by Hobba et al. (12Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E.

N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using Edman degradation carried out automatically on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase sequencer with a 900A Control/Data Analysis Module. The other three products were sequenced following transfer from gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described by Matsudaira (17Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine IGFBP-2 (100 μg) was dissolved in 100 μl of 10 mm acetic acid and diluted to 3.5 ml in 250 mm Tris, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0. Trypsin (modified, sequencer grade, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was added at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w, enzyme/substrate) for 5 h at 37 °C. A further 10 μg of trypsin was added for 18 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid and stored at −20 °C. The peptide that resulted from the trypsin digest of bIGFBP-2 and eluted at 25.3 min on rpHPLC was lyophilized (10 μg) and reconstituted in 50 μl of 10 mm acetic acid. The peptide was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 6 m urea, 100 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (280 μl), to allow unfolding. Following dilution in 100 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, to a final volume of 990 μl, the peptide was cleaved with chymotrypsin (sequencer grade, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) at a ratio of 1:4 (w/w, enzyme/substrate) overnight at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid, and the digest was stored at −20 °C. Peptides generated following trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavages were separated by rpHPLC as described above. The absorbance of the peptide backbone bonds was monitored at 215 nm, Trp at 295 nm, and Tyr by specific fluorescence (excitation 275 nm, emission 305 nm). The cDNA clone for bIGFBP-2 was isolated and characterized in this laboratory as described previously (18Upton F.Z. Szabo L. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 5: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Bresatec Pty. Ltd., Australia. Site-directed mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad, Australia, was performed using the oligonucleotide 5′ GTC GAC GGT ATC GAT AAG CCT CTG CAG GCC ATA TGC AGC CGA GAC TGG GCG GCC CCG CGC TGC TGC TGC TGC C 3′ and the template bIGFBP-2 cDNAEcoRI fragment in Bluescript BKS+ (Stratagene). This introduced a PstI site at the 5′ end and cDNA encoding the amino acids MQPRLGGPALLLLP of the signal peptide as described by Bourner et al. (19Bourner M.J. Busby W.H.J. Siegel N.R. Krivi G.G. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The full-lengthPstI/EcoRI bIGFBP-2 cDNA fragment was introduced into the pXMT-2 expression vector (20Whyatt L.M. Duwel A. Smith A.G. Rathjen P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7971-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), kindly provided by P. D. Rathjen (Department of Biochemistry, University of Adelaide) resulting in the plasmid pGF-8. Four C-terminal deletion mutants were created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis as described by Clackson et al. (21Clackson T. Gussow D. Jones P.T. McPherson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor P. PCR: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 201Google Scholar) using pGF-8 template. The forward primer was 5′ ATG GGC AAG GGT GGC AAA CAT CAC GG 3′ (corresponding to residues 61–69, Fig. 1), and the following were the reverse primers: mutant A, 5′ TAC GAA TTC TAA GTT GTA GAA GAG ATG ACA CTC GGG 3′ (residues 214–222); mutant B, 5′ TAC GAA TTC TTA GTT AGG GTT CAC AGA CCA GCA CTC CCC ACG CTG CCC GTT 3′ (residues 223–236); mutant C, 5′ TAC GAA TTC TTA GTT CAG AGA CAT CTT GGA CTG TTT GAG GTT GTA CAG GCC ATG C 3′ (residues 236–248); mutant D, 5′ TAC GAA TTC TTA CTT GTC ACA GTT GGG GAT GTG TAG GGA 3′ (residues 263–270). The PCR reaction conditions using Taq polymerase from Promega Corp., Australia, were as recommended by the manufacturer using 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were digested with NotI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated to the pGF-8NotI/EcoRI 5927 base pair fragment. Correct sequences of PCR inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Large scale DNA preparations were purified by Superose 6 chromatography (Pharmacia Ltd., Australia) and transfection of 10 μg of DNA/5 × 106 cells was by electroporation at 0.27 V using a Bio-Rad gene pulser. Cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum and then washed and transferred to phenol red free DMEM supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and sodium sialate (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and glutamine. Medium was changed and collected every 24 h for up to 5 days. Bovine IGFBP-2 and truncation mutants were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). IGFBPs were detected by Western ligand blotting (23Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) with 125I IGF-II visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software, as well as by immunoblotting as described previously (24Forbes B. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. J. Endocrinol. 1990; 126: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with anti-bIGFBP-2 antiserum produced in this laboratory. WT bIGFBP-2 and mutants were isolated from transfected COS-1 cell medium by IGF-II affinity chromatography (IGF-II purchased from GroPep Pty. Ltd., Australia coupled to Affi-Prep-10 matrix as recommended by the supplier, Bio-Rad Laboratories Pty., Ltd., Australia). Bound IGFBPs were eluted in 0.5 m acetic acid and then applied directly to a cation exchange column (Resource S 1 ml column, Pharmacia Ltd., Australia). Using a gradient of 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, to 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, over 20 min at 1 ml/min monkey IGFBP-3 was separated from IGFBP-2. Bovine IGFBP-2 or mutants were separated from monkey IGFBP-2 by rpHPLC using the same conditions described above for separation of CNBr-cleaved bIGFBP-2. To confirm the correct mass for each peptide electrospray mass spectroscopy was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Psi-ex triple quadrupole mass spectrometer by Yogi Hayasaka at the Australian Research Council EMS unit, Adelaide. IGF binding ability was determined by charcoal binding assays as described (23Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). IGF peptides were kindly provided by GroPep Pty. Ltd., Australia. 125I IGF-I and125I IGF-II were produced by Spencer Knowles (CRC for Tissue Growth and Repair, Adelaide, Australia) using chloramine T to a specific activity of 29 μCi/μg (25Francis G.L. Upton F.M. Ballard F.J. McNeil K.A. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All IGFBPs were quantified for assays by rHPLC using the following extinction coefficients: wild type bIGFBP-2 (WT bIGFBP-2) 10.3 × 105, mutants A 9.73 × 105, B 8.86 × 105, C 8.23 × 105, and D 7.63 × 105 (26Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To solve the disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal region of bIGFBP-2 three separate cleavage steps were required. The first involved chemical cleavage with CNBr and showed that the N- and C-terminal regions were not linked by disulfide bonds. Subsequent cleavage with trypsin and chymotrypsin yielded the C-terminal disulfide bond pairing pattern. Cleavage sites for the three steps are shown in Fig. 1. Cleavage of bIGFBP-2 with CNBr liberated four fragments separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A). The largest product (fragment I, Fig. 2 A) was purified from the three other fragments by rpHPLC for N-terminal sequencing (chromatogram not shown). It had a single sequence corresponding to the N terminus of bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 2 B). The other cleavage products were sequenced following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fragment II had a single N-terminal sequence indicating cleavage after Met129. Separation of this C-terminal fragment from the N-terminal fragment under non-reducing conditions conclusively showed that the N- and C-terminal domains are not linked by disulfide bonds. Further analysis of fragments III and IV confirmed this conclusion. Fragment III yielded three N-terminal sequences produced by cleavage after Met144, Met200, and Met232(Fig. 2 B). As they are present in a single fragment we can conclude that these cleavage products are linked by disulfide bonds. Similarly fragment IV yielded three N-terminal sequences due to cleavage at Met161, Met200, and Met232, again all products being present in the one fragment linked by disulfide bonds (Fig. 2 B). Trypsin was chosen to analyze the C-terminal disulfide bond pairing of bIGFBP-2 as four of the six cysteines within the C terminus are in separate tryptic fragments (Fig. 1). Tryptic products were separated by rpHPLC. To locate the tryptic fragments of interest tyrosine fluorescence and tryptophan absorbance at 295 nm were monitored. Cys220 and Cys265 are found within separate tryptic fragments which both contain a Tyr. In addition a single Trp243 is within a fragment encompassing Cys242 and Cys244 (Fig. 1). Peak A (Fig. 3) was identified by fluorescence detection to contain Tyr (215 nm absorbance shown only). Following N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy peak A was identified as a single peptide containing 2 N-terminal sequences of fragments encompassing Cys186 and Cys220 (Table I). We could conclude that Cys186 and Cys220 form a disulfide bond in bIGFBP-2.Table IN-terminal sequencing and masses of tryptic and chymotryptic digestsMassestMassdetN-terminal sequence(s)Peak A33943393TP(C)QQELDQV...GPLEHLYSLH...Peak B35463545Q(C)KGE(C)W(C)V...GDPE(C)H...Peak C17481748(C)VNPNTGKGDPE(C)HLF Open table in a new tab Peak B (Fig. 3) not only contained Tyr fluorescence but also showed absorbance at 295 nm (not shown). This suggested that Cys265, within a Tyr-containing tryptic fragment, was linked to the fragment containing Cys242, Trp243, and Cys244. Indeed peak B when sequenced yielded three N termini (Table I). Mass determination confirmed that this single product contained three peptides linked by disulfide bonds (Table I). Peak B of the trypsin digestion (Fig. 3) was cleaved by chymotrypsin to further delineate the disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal region of bIGFBP-2. Cleavage at Trp243 between Cys242 and Cys244was achieved only in the presence of urea and was extremely inefficient. However, peak C (Fig. 3) was identified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy (Table I) to contain Cys244 and Cys265 within a single peptide. We concluded therefore that they are disulfide linked. The peptide containing Cys231 and Cys242 was not located, but we could deduce that these must be disulfide bonded. In summary the disulfide bonding pattern of bIGFBP-2 C-terminal region is as follows: Cys186-Cys220, Cys231-Cys242, and Cys244-Cys265. A series of four bIGFBP-2 C-terminal truncation mutants were designed as shown in Fig. 4. Mutant A was truncated by 14 amino acids. Mutants B and C were truncated by 36 and 48 amino acids and had Cys244 → Ser and Cys230 → Ser substitutions, respectively, to eliminate the possibility of intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Mutant D was truncated by 62 amino acids. Plasmids encoding the truncated forms of bIGFBP-2 were generated by PCR using the full-length bIGFBP-2 cDNA as a template (see “Experimental Procedures”). PCR products were digested withNotI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated to the bIGFBP-2 pGF-8 NotI/EcoRI 5927-base pair fragment. The four mutant constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells, and the respective proteins were purified from endogenous monkey IGFBP-2 and -3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant bovine IGFBP-2 and the four truncated mutants were of the expected size as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). Mass spectroscopy confirmed that bIGFBP-2, mutant A, mutant B, and mutant C were the correct mass within 2 mass units. Mutant D had an expected mass of 23,786, but its actual mass was measured as 23,658. N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed the correct sequence for five residues. Mutant D was digested with trypsin and the C-terminal fragment isolated and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. This showed that the C-terminal residue (Lys, mass = 128) was missing which was consistent with the observed mass difference. As the cDNA sequence of the clone encoding mutant D was correct, we can conclude that deletion of Lys221occurred subsequent to secretion into the culture medium. The ability of the mutants to bind IGF was analyzed initially by Western ligand blotting. Mutants A, B, and C bound 125I IGF-II to the same extent as bIGFBP-2 (WT, Fig. 5 a). Mutant D, however, did not bind IGF-II despite equal amounts of protein being assayed as determined by immunoblotting the same filter (Fig. 5 b). IGF binding by bIGFBP-2 and mutants was further analyzed by charcoal binding assays. Initially titration of 125I IGF-I and125I IGF-II with increasing amounts of binding protein revealed that mutants A, B, and C bound both radiolabeled ligands essentially to the same extent as WT bIGFBP-2. Mutant D, however, had a greatly reduced ability to bind both 125I IGF-I and125I IGF-II (Fig. 6,a and b). Competition binding assays (Fig. 6, c and d) revealed that mutant A had the same affinity as WT for 125I IGF-I and 125I IGF-II using competing IGF-I and IGF-II, respectively (summarized in Table II). Interestingly, mutants B and C demonstrated a higher affinity than WT for both IGF-I and I IGF-II in competition assays. To assess the binding affinity of mutant D much higher amounts were used than WT bIGFBP-2 (1.26 versus 0.016 pmol). Under these conditions mutant D had a lower affinity for IGF-II tracer when competing with IGF-II and a slightly higher affinity for IGF-I tracer when competing with IGF-I.Table IISummary of competition binding assays with 125I-IGF-I and 125I-IGF-II and IGF-I and IGF-II ligandsIGF-I (ED50)IGF-II (ED50)IGF-I:IGF-IIWT0.940.0811.75A0.990.0812.3B0.370.0312.3C0.630.0321.0D0.520.540.96 Open table in a new tab Preliminary tryptic mapping of mutant D (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) suggests that alteration in binding of mutant D is not due to a gross structural malformation as a consequence of, for example, incorrect disulfide formation by the remaining cysteines but rather due to a lack of crucial residues. We isolated the peptide containing the fragments with Cys186 linked to Cys220 as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. In addition the tryptic maps of unreduced mutant D and unreduced WT bIGFBP-2 appeared similar in that all Tyr-containing peaks eluted in the same positions, except the Tyr269-containing fragment which is not present in mutant D (data not included). Relative binding affinities of WT bIGFBP-2 and mutants were deduced by comparing the ED50 values in 125I IGF-I and125I IGF-II competition assays (Table II). WT bIGFBP-2 had a 11.75-fold preference in IGF-II binding to 125I IGF-II over IGF-I binding to 125I IGF-I (Table II). The mutants A and B exhibited a similar preference for IGF-II over IGF-I. Mutant C, however, had a greater preference for IGF-II over IGF-I (21 fold) than WT bIGFBP-2 in competition for IGF-I and IGF-II tracers. Interestingly, mutant D exhibited an equal affinity for IGF-I and IGF-II in competition assays. Our investigation involved the design of bIGFBP-2 C-terminal truncation mutants to be used as probes for identifying IGF binding sites. There is currently no information regarding disulfide mapping nor the three-dimensional structure of the IGFBPs, making the design of truncation mutants difficult. In this study our initial cleavage using CNBr showed that the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains of bIGFBP-2 are not linked by disulfide bonds. In addition a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin digestions allowed us to solve the disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal region. All Cys residues in the C-terminal region are involved in disulfide bonds, and the pattern has been shown to be as follows: Cys186-Cys220, Cys231-Cys242, and Cys244-Cys265. Cleavages were carried out at pH 7.4 and below thereby reducing the probability of disulfide bond reshuffling, and indeed no alternate bonding patterns were identified following either the tryptic or chymotryptic digestions. With the knowledge of the disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal domain, we proceeded to design four C-terminal deletion mutants. In those mutants with a disrupted Cys pair the remaining Cys was replaced by Ser, thereby eliminating the possibility of dimer formation or the formation of alternative Cys-Cys pairing. Indeed no dimers or aggregates were observed in production of any of the four mutants. Analysis of IGF binding ability of all mutants and particularly comparison of mutants C and D revealed that mutant D has lost residues between 222 and 236 crucial for IGF binding. Not only was mutant D unable to bind on a Western ligand blot but it bound IGFs poorly in charcoal binding assays. Its affinity for IGF-II was markedly reduced in 125I IGF-II competition assays. In addition it showed no preference for binding IGF-II over IGF-I, due to its greatly reduced affinity for IGF-II in comparison with WT bIGFBP-2. In contrast, mutant A lacking 14 C-terminal amino acids behaved similarly to WT bIGFBP-2 in both activity assays (Western ligand blotting and charcoal binding assays). We conclude therefore that the last 14 amino acids do not play a major role in IGF binding by bIGFBP-2. Mutants B and C (lacking 24 and 48 C-terminal amino acids) also behaved similarly to WT bIGFBP-2 on Western ligand blots but displayed a greater binding affinity for IGF-II in 125I IGF-II competitive binding assays. Mutant B also showed a greater binding affinity for IGF-I in 125I IGF-I competition binding assays (Table II). However, the difference in relative IGF-I and IGF-II binding affinities for mutant B was similar to WT bIGFBP-2, whereas mutant C had a greater divergence in relative binding affinity for IGF-II over IGF-I. This indicates that in removing 24 or 48 amino acids these mutants were still able to bind IGFs to the same extent as WT bIGFBP-2, but there has been an alteration in the region of bIGFBP-2 which determines IGF binding specificity. Subsequent removal of the amino acids 222–236 in mutant D greatly altered the IGF binding site resulting in an IGFBP which binds IGFs poorly. The fact that recombinantly produced C-terminally deleted bIGFBP-2 mutant D is a poorer IGF binder was not surprising. Proteolysed porcine IGFBP-2, identified as 25- and 16-kDa fragments, did not bind on Western ligand blots (27Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fragments of various IGFBPs lacking some or all of the C-terminal region, generated following specific proteolysis or during purification procedures, have also been shown to have greatly reduced IGF binding capacity in competitive binding assays (8Andress D.L.

Also, recombinant production of a C-terminally deleted hIGFBP-5 lacking the C-terminal domain but retaining all of the central non-conserved region was shown to bind IGF-I in charcoal binding assays (29Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, like mutant D, its ability to bind IGF-I was greatly reduced. Indeed, N-terminally truncated rat IGFBP-2 encompassing half of the non-conserved region and all of the C-terminal domain bound IGF-I with lower affinity than native rat IGFBP-2 in competition assays (10Wang J.F. Hampton B. Mehlman T. Burgess W.H. Rechler M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The same effect was seen with recombinantly expressed IGFBP-1 truncated from the N terminus by 60 residues. This mutant was unable to bind IGF on a Western ligand blot suggesting a greatly reduced ability to bind IGF (4Brinkman A. Kortleve D.J. Schuller A.G.P. Zwarthoff E.C. Drop S.L.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar result was noted with recombinantly expressed hIGFBP-3 fragments (30Baxter R.C. Firth S.M. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The results presented here and by others suggest that the individual domains of IGFBPs are unable to exhibit full IGF binding compared with native IGFBPs. It is likely that both domains are required for high affinity IGF binding. Indeed it is possible that the low affinity binding of IGFBP-3 identified by BIAcore analysis (31Heding A. Gill R. Ogawa Y. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13948-13952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) results from binding to a single domain, while high affinity binding is a consequence of interaction of IGF with both domains. Relating the deletion mutant information to the tertiary structure of bIGFBP-2 and IGFBPs in general is difficult without structural information. However, from our study it is possible to speculate that the C-terminal residues of bIGFBP-2, particularly residues 222–236, must lie in close proximity to the N-terminal domain to allow both domains to interact with IGF. In addition, we believe that the disulfide bonding pattern described for the bIGFBP-2 C-terminal domain in this paper could be the pattern for all IGFBPs as all six cysteines in the C terminus are present in every IGFBP 1–6 sequenced so far. Therefore we would suggest that the C-terminal domains of all IGFBPs are likely to have a similar disulfide bonding pattern and hence adopt a similar structure. Thus, although the amino acid sequence in this region of bIGFBP-2, which is totally conserved across all species sequenced so far, has limited homology to other IGFBPs, residues corresponding to the crucial residues 222–236 of bIGFBP-2 could be important for IGF binding by other IGFBPs. In summary, we have defined a site on bIGFBP-2 which is important for IGF binding. In addition, we have demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal domains are not connected by disulfide bonds, and we have solved the disulfide bonding pattern of the C-terminal domain of bIGFBP-2.

In the present study, we observed that three thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) binding elements (TBEs) located within a 255 base pair region flanking the 5′-end of the baboon SP-A2 (bSP-A2) gene are required for maximal cyclic AMP induction of bSP-A2 promoter activity. We found that TTF-1 DNA binding activity was increased in nuclear extracts of pulmonary type II cells cultured in the presence of cyclic AMP. By contrast, the levels of immunoreactive TTF-1 protein were similar in nuclear extracts of control and cyclic AMP-treated type II cells. The incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into immunoprecipitated TTF-1 protein also was markedly increased by cyclic AMP treatment. Moreover, exposure of nuclear extracts from cyclic AMP-treated type II cells either to potato acid phosphatase or alkaline phosphatase abolished the cyclic AMP-induced increase in TTF-1 DNA-binding activity. Interestingly, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to activate protein kinase C, also enhanced incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into TTF-1 protein; however, the DNA binding activity of TTF-1 was decreased in nuclear extracts of TPA-treated type II cells. Expression vectors encoding TTF-1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-cat) were cotransfected into A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells together with an SPA:human growth hormone fusion gene (255 base pairs of 5′-flanking DNA from the baboon SP-A2 gene linked to human growth hormone, as reporter) containing TBEs, or with a reporter gene construct containing three tandem TBEs fused upstream of the bSP-A2 gene TATA box and the transcription initiation site. Coexpression of TTF-1 and PKA-cat increased fusion gene expression 3–4-fold as compared with expression of TTF-1 in the absence of PKA-cat. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of TTF-1 was suppressed by cotransfection of a dominant negative form of PKA regulatory subunit RIα. We suggest that a PKA-induced increase of TTF-1 phosphorylation and TBE binding activity mediates cyclic AMP-induced expression of the SP-A gene in lung type II cells. Surfactant protein (SP)-A gene transcription is stimulated by factors that increase cyclic AMP.

Interestingly, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to activate protein kinase C, also enhanced incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into TTF-1 protein; however, the DNA binding activity of TTF-1 was decreased in nuclear extracts of TPA-treated type II cells.

We suggest that a PKA-induced increase of TTF-1 phosphorylation and TBE binding activity mediates cyclic AMP-induced expression of the SP-A gene in lung type II cells. Pulmonary surfactant, a phospholipid-rich, developmentally regulated lipoprotein synthesized exclusively by type II pneumonocytes, acts to reduce alveolar surface tension, thereby preventing alveolar collapse upon exhalation of air (1Clements J.A. King R.J. Crystal R.G. The Biochemical Basis of Pulmonary Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1976: 363-387Google Scholar). Four lung-specific proteins have been found to be associated with surfactant: surfactant protein (SP) 1The abbreviations used are: SP, surfactant protein; bSP, baboon SP; TTF-1, thyroid transcription factor 1; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; CRE, cyclic AMP-response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TBE, TTF-1 binding element; PKA-cat, catalytic subunit of PKA; RIα, PKA regulatory subunit Iα; hGH, human growth hormone; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation; bp, base pair(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus; β-Gal, β-galactosidase. -A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. These appear to serve important roles in surface activity, surfactant phospholipid reutilization, and immune function within the alveolus (2Hawgood S. Schiffer K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 375-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression of the gene encoding SP-A, the major surfactant-associated protein, occurs primarily in alveolar type II cells and to a lesser extent in bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells (3Auten R.L. Watkins R.H. Shapiro D.L. Horowitz S. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 3: 491-496Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Wohlford-Lenane C.L. Snyder J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol.

SP-A expression is subject to multifactorial regulation; we have observed that cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids have major regulatory effects (6Mendelson C.R. Boggaram V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 415-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In studies using rabbit, human, and baboon fetal lung in organ culture, SP-A mRNA and protein levels were found to be augmented by cyclic AMP analogues and by agents that increase the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (8Mendelson C.R.

Cyclic AMP also enhances the rate of type II cell differentiation and enlargement of prealveolar ducts (9Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SP-A is encoded by a single copy gene in rabbits (5Boggaram V. Qing K. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 266: L354-L366PubMed Google Scholar), there are two highly similar SP-A genes (the SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes). In human fetal lung in culture, expression of the SP-A2 gene is considerably more responsive to the stimulatory effects of cyclic AMP than is SP-A1 (17McCormick S.M. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L367-L374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for type II cell-specific and cyclic AMP regulation of SP-A gene expression, we have utilized differentiated type II cells in primary culture transfected with reporter gene constructs containing 5′-flanking sequences from the rabbit and human SP-A genes. Two E-box motifs were identified within the 5′-flanking sequence of the rabbit SP-A gene that are required for basal and cyclic AMP-induced expression of SP-A promoter activity (18Gao E. Alcorn J.L. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19697-19709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These elements were found to bind the basic helix-loop-helix-zipper factors USF1 (19Gao E. Wang Y. Alcorn J.L. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23398-23406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and USF2. 2E. Gao, Y. Wang, J. L. Alcorn, and C. R. Mendelson, unpublished observations. Anothercis-acting element, termed CRESP-A, which displays sequence similarity to both a palindromic cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) and a nuclear receptor half-site, also was found to be required for cyclic AMP induction of SP-A promoter activity in transfected type II cells (20Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Chen Q. Smith M.E. Gerard R.D. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1072-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Young P.P. Mendelson C.R. Am. J.

Characterization of CRESP-A indicated that this sequence does not bind the transcription factor CRE-binding protein, CREB, but rather may serve as a binding site for a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that binds DNA as a monomer (22Michael L.F. Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 159-170PubMed Google Scholar). A GT box element, located proximal to the transcription initiation site, also was found to be essential for basal and cyclic AMP regulation of the human SP-A2 gene. This element was found to bind Sp1, as well as a 55-kDa protein distinct from Sp1 (23Young P.P. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1082-1093PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that basal and cyclic AMP induction of SP-A promoter activity are mediated by the cooperative interaction of transcription factors bound to at least three different response elements. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1, also named thyroid enhancer-binding protein or NKx 2.1), is a homeodomain transcription factor that has been found to be involved in the tissue-specific regulation of three different thyroid-specific genes, namely thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, and thyrotropin receptor (24Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Mizuno K. Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1049-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTF-1 expression is restricted to the developing thyroid gland, lung epithelia, and restricted areas of the developing brain (24Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 29Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felce M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1095-1104Google Scholar). The importance of TTF-1 in development was underscored by the findings of targeted deletion of the TTF-1 gene; homozygous TTF-1 null mice were still-born and lacked lung parenchyma, thyroid, and anterior pituitary glands (30Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). TTF-1 was found to bind to DNA sequences located in the 5′-flanking regions of the mouse SP-A (31Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2056-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genes and to promote transactivation of heterologous reporter genes containing the 5′-flanking sequences from these surfactant protein genes in nonpulmonary cells. It remains to be determined how the actions of TTF-1 to influence morphogenesis of thyroid, pituitary, and lung during early embryogenesis are regulated differently from those actions to enhance expression of specific genes at later stages of fetal development and postnatally. It was our objective, in the present study, to define the role of TTF-1 in the cyclic AMP induction of SP-A gene transcription. In type II cell transfection studies, we observed that TTF-1 binding elements (TBEs) in the 5′-flanking sequence of the baboon SP-A2 (bSP-A2) gene are crucial for cyclic AMP induction of bSP-A2 promoter activity. We also found that cyclic AMP treatment of cultured type II cells promotes increased TTF-1 phosphorylation and an associated increase in TBE binding activity. Furthermore, cotransfection of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with TTF-1 in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line caused an increase in the capacity of TTF-1 to transactivate the SP-A2 promoter. We therefore suggest that the cyclic AMP-mediated increase in TTF-1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity serves a major role in the cyclic AMP induction of SP-A gene expression in lung type II cells. A full-length baboon TTF-1 cDNA (∼1.2 kilobase pairs) isolated from a 92-day gestational age fetal baboon lung cDNA library was ligated toEcoRI/SalI-digested pCMV5 vector to produce the TTF-1 expression vector, pCMV5/TTF-1. PKA expression vectors, RSV/PKA-cat-α, RSV/PKA-cat-β, and the mutated RSV/PKA-cat-βm (35Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Richard A. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University). An expression vector containing the mutant form of PKA regulatory subunit RIα under the control of the mouse metallothionein-1 promoter (MT-RIα-mut) (36Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin J.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16672-16678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Stanley McKnight (University of Washington, Seattle). bSPA2−255:hGH was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a DNA fragment containing 255 bp of the 5′-flanking DNA and 40 bp of the first exon of the bSP-A2 gene, followed by ligation to the first exon of the hGH structural gene in pACsk20GH, which contains the left 17% of human adenovirus 5 genome and the promoterless hGH structural gene. To generate fusion genes containing TBE mutations, oligonucleotides were made containing mutations in each of the three TBEs of the bSP-A2 gene (TBE1, TBE2, and TBE3); in each case, the TBE was replaced with a restriction enzyme site sequence. The binding sequence in TBE1 was changed to anEcoRI site, that in TBE2 was changed to a KpnI site, and that in TBE3 was changed to an XbaI site. These oligonucleotides where then used in polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′- or 3′-ends of the bSP-A2 genomic region from −255 to +40; bSP-A2 genomic clone was used as template. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with appropriate endonucleases and cloned into pACsk20GH. To construct (TBE)3SP-A:hGH, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences between −185 and −165 of the bSP-A2 gene 5′-flanking DNA containing TBE1 (5′-GTGCTCCCCTCAAGGGTCCTA-3′) were self-ligated to form a concatamer of three TBE1 repeats and inserted into the HindIII site of bSP-A2−50:hGH, where 50 bp of the 5′-flanking DNA and 40 bp of the first exon of the bSP-A2 gene were fused to the first exon of the hGH structural gene in pACsk20GH. To generate TTF-1 antiserum, a 150-bp cDNA fragment, encoding the amino-terminal 50 amino acids of TTF-1, was inserted intoBamHI/SacI-digested pGEX-KG (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to generate the pGEX-KG/TTF0.15 construct. This plasmid was used for generation of a recombinant GST-TTF-11–50 peptide in Escherichia coli. Bacterially expressed GST-TTF-11–50 peptide was then used to immunize a rabbit to generate TTF-1 antiserum. The antiserum was adsorbed with GST peptide to remove GST-specific antibodies. Lung tissues from mid-gestation human abortuses were maintained in organ culture in serum-free Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing Bt2cAMP for 3 days to promote type II cell differentiation. Phenotypically differentiated type II cells are not detected in mid-gestation human fetal lung. We previously observed that type II cells spontaneously differentiate when the human fetal lung is placed in organ culture in serum-free medium and that the rate of type II cell differentiation is enhanced by treatment with cyclic AMP analogues (9Odom M.J. Snyder J.M. Mendelson C.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After culture, the tissues were digested with collagenase for preparation of lung type II cells as described (20Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Chen Q. Smith M.E. Gerard R.D. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1072-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,37Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J. Margraf L. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 (ATCC CCL 185) was maintained in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%, v/v). To generate recombinant adenoviruses, 293 cells, a permissive human embryonic kidney cell line, were cotransfected with recombinant pACsk20GH containing bSP-A2:hGH fusion genes and with pJM17; the latter contains the entire adenovirus genome plus insertion of a 4.3-kilobase pair plasmid. The pJM17 itself is too large to be packaged into viral particles. Infectious viral particles are formed upon in vivo recombination of the plasmids to produce a recombinant viral genome of packageable size. Viral DNA was analyzed for the presence of the fusion genes by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. The recombinant viruses were titered in 293 cells at least twice to ensure the accuracy of the titer. Type II cells plated at a density of 5–9 × 106 cells/60-mm dish were maintained overnight in Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed twice with medium and incubated for 1 h with 1 × 106 recombinant viral particles, resulting in a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–0.2. In this manner, the same number of cells (1 × 106) were infected in each experiment. The medium was then aspirated and replaced with fresh medium in the absence or presence of Bt2cAMP (1 mm). Media from transfected cells were collected every 24 h and assayed for hGH by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from lung type II cells as described previously (38Lee K.A. Bindereif A.B. Green M.R. Gene. Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing TBE1 (underlined) (5′-GTGCTCCCCTCAAGGGTCCT-3′), CRESP-A (underlined) (5′-GAGCGGGTGACCTCAGCCCT-3′), or the GT box from the human SP-A2 gene (underlined) (5′-TCTCAGGGGTGGGGAAGAA-3′) were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and used as probes. Nuclear proteins were incubated with the radiolabeled DNA probes for 20 min at room temperature in reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) as nonspecific competitor. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. To determine whether TTF-1 DNA binding is phosphorylation-dependent, nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated either with 0.5 units of potato acid phosphatase (type III; Sigma) or 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 5 min at room temperature as described (39Avvedimento V.E. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a control, phosphatases were boiled for 15 min before incubation with nuclear extracts. Phosphatase reactions were stopped with 1 mm sodium vanadate and NaF. The phosphatase-treated nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled TBE1 oligonucleotides, fractionated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Human fetal lung type II cells were maintained either in control medium or in medium containing Bt2cAMP (1 mm) for 5 days. Parallel dishes of cells were incubated in control medium for 4 days and in medium containing TPA (10 nm) for an additional 24 h. For 32P labeling, the type II cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline solution and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) for 1 h. [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) was then added to achieve a concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml, and cells were further incubated in appropriate medium for 2 h. After washing twice with cold Tris-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm sodium vanadate). Cells were disrupted completely by scraping and shearing through a 27-gauge needle. After pelleting the cellular debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, aliquots of lysates containing 1 × 107 cpm were precleared with 50 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were then incubated with 5 μl of TTF-1 antiserum or the corresponding preimmune serum. The immune complexes were recovered upon incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with RIPA, twice with high salt RIPA (RIPA containing 1m NaCl), and twice more with RIPA. For [35S]methionine labeling, type II cells which had been cultured for 5 days under conditions described above were incubated in methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies) for 30 min; [35S]methionine was then added to achieve a final concentration of 0.125 mCi/ml. Cells were lysed, and TTF-1 was immunoprecipitated as described for 32P-labeled cells. The immunoprecipitates isolated from the 32P-labeled and [35S]methionine-labeled cells were resuspended in 2 × SDS-sample buffer, resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Transient transfections were carried out using A549 cells maintained in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The plasmids used consisted of either 4 μg of bSP-A2−255:hGH or (TBE)3SP-A:hGH fusion genes, together with 2 μg of either an expression vector containing the entire TTF-1 open reading frame (pCMV5/TTF-1) or the empty expression vector (pCMV5) and 2 μg of either an expression vector containing the whole coding sequence of PKA-cat (RSV/PKA-cat) or the empty expression vector (RSV), with or without 2 μg of an expression vector containing a mutant form of PKA regulatory subunit RIα (MT-RIα-mut); 1 μg of RSV/β-Gal was used as the internal control. Prior to transfection, the plasmids were combined with 30 μg of DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. A549 cells grown to logarithmic phase (50–70% confluence) on 60-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Plasmid-DOTAP mixtures in 2 ml of Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium without serum were then added to the cells. The cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium (1 ml) was then added to each dish, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 24 h. Media were then collected and assayed for hGH content by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute). Variations in transfection efficiency were corrected by normalizing hGH to β-galactosidase activity. In our initial studies of the regulation of the bSP-A2 gene, we observed that 255 bp of bSP-A2 5′-flanking DNA was sufficient to mediate high basal and cyclic AMP induction of bSP-A2 promoter activity in transfected type II cells. By DNase I footprinting and EMSA, three TBEs were characterized within the 255- bp 5′-flanking region. 3J. Li, E. Gao, and C. R. Mendelson, unpublished observations. Whereas, TBE1 manifested the strongest DNase I footprint, the findings of EMSA have clearly indicated that TBE2 and TBE3 also serve as specific TTF-1 binding sites. 3J. Li, E. Gao, and C. R. Mendelson, unpublished observations. The positions and sequences of these TBEs are shown in Fig. 1 A. To analyze the functional significance of the TBEs in mediating basal and cyclic AMP induction of bSP-A2 promoter activity in type II cells, the three TBEs were individually mutated within the context of the 255-bp bSP-A2 5′-flanking region. Fusion genes were constructed composed of 255 bp of bSP-A2 5′-flanking DNA with or without TBE mutations plus 40 bp of the first exon, linked to the human growth hormone (hGH) structural gene, as reporter. These fusion genes were then incorporated into the genome of a replication-defective human adenovirus 5 for highly efficient and reproducible transfer by infection (20Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Chen Q. Smith M.E. Gerard R.D. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1072-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J. Margraf L. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of recombinant adenoviruses were introduced into primary cultures of rat fetal lung type II cells incubated in the absence or presence of Bt2cAMP. The concentration of hGH that accumulated in the culture medium was determined by radioimmunoassay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, mutagenesis of TBE1 caused a marked reduction of bSP-A2−255:hGH fusion gene expression in transfected type II cells. Moreover, the cyclic AMP induction of fusion gene expression also was markedly decreased. Mutagenesis of TBE2 and TBE3 caused a moderate decrease in basal and cyclic AMP-induced fusion gene expression. These findings suggest that the integrity of TTF-1 binding elements is essential for maximal basal and cyclic AMP-induced bSP-A2 promoter activity in type II cells and that TBE1 plays the most critical role in this regard. To study the mechanism(s) whereby TTF-1 mediates cyclic AMP induction of SP-A promoter activity in type II cells, we first utilized EMSA to analyze the effects of cyclic AMP on TTF-1 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from cultured type II cells. An oligonucleotide containing TBE1 was radiolabeled and incubated with equivalent amounts of nuclear proteins from type II cells cultured for 5 days in the absence or presence of 1 mm Bt2cAMP. This incubation time was utilized because we previously observed that SP-A gene expression is markedly increased in type II cells incubated for 5 days in medium containing Bt2cAMP, as compared with cells maintained in control medium (37Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J. Margraf L. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complexes were separated from free probe on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 A). As can be seen, type II cell nuclear protein-TBE1 complex formation was markedly increased in nuclear extracts from type II cells cultured in the presence of Bt2cAMP as compared with those of type II cells cultured in control medium. The finding that formation of the protein-DNA complex was abol"

We investigated the effect of VEGF on heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. HB-EGF mRNA was induced by 8-fold after 2 h of VEGF stimulation, and it returned to base line within 6 h. VEGF did not alter the half-life of HB-EGF mRNA (55 min). Nuclear run-on experiments showed a 4.9-fold increase in HB-EGF gene transcription within 2 h of VEGF stimulation, and Western analysis demonstrated an associated increase in cellular HB-EGF protein. We found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) mRNA was also induced 3-fold after 5 h of VEGF stimulation, whereas neither endothelin 1 nor transforming growth factor-β1 was regulated by VEGF. Finally, conditioned medium from VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells produced an increase in DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells, and this effect was blocked by a neutralizing antibody to PDGF. The induction of HB-EGF and PDGF-BB expression in endothelial cells may represent the mechanism by which VEGF recruits mesenchymal cells to form the medial and adventitial layers of arterioles and venules during the course of angiogenesis.

During the formation of new blood vessels, endothelial cells are stimulated to migrate, proliferate, and invade surrounding tissue to form capillary tubules capable of carrying blood. An angiogenic stimulus is also necessary for the maturation of these vessels, which involves the migration and proliferation of pericytes and smooth muscle cells to form the basement membrane of capillaries, or smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts to form the tunica media and adventitia of arterioles and venules.

Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a 22-kDa protein that was originally purified from the conditioned medium of human macrophage-like U-937 cells (22Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of HB-EGF contains six cysteine residues with spacing characteristic of members of the EGF family, and HB-EGF shares 40% sequence identity with EGF. HB-EGF binds to the EGF receptor and triggers its downstream signal transduction pathways (23Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HB-EGF is mitogenic and chemotactic for several primary cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes, but not for vascular endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cells do express HB-EGF, however, and this expression can be induced by TNF-α and shear stress (24Temizer D.H. Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Susanni E.E Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J.

Up-regulation of HB-EGF expression also occurs in other pathological states that require angiogenesis, such as wound healing, and in human atherosclerotic plaques (29Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S.

Because VEGF is a critical factor in the development of new blood vessels, we speculated that VEGF may induce growth factors in vascular endothelial cells, which then act in a paracrine fashion to promote angiogenesis. We studied the regulation by VEGF of HB-EGF, PDGF-BB, ET1, and TGF-β1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). HB-EGF and PDGF-BB mRNA were up-regulated by VEGF in distinct temporal patterns. Moreover, the increase in HB-EGF mRNA was regulated transcriptionally and translated to an increase in accumulation of cellular HB-EGF protein. Primary culture HUVEC, HCAEC, and HASMC were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). HUVEC and HCAEC were grown in M199 (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). HASMC were grown in M199 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passaged every 3–5 days, and cells from passages 6–8 were used in the experiments described here. After the cells had grown to 80–90% confluence, they were placed in M199 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum for 1 h before the experiments. Recombinant human VEGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products) was dissolved in PBS (JRH Biosciences) and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA from cells in culture was prepared by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride. An HB-EGF cDNA fragment from HUVEC RNA was amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (31Yoshizumi M. Kourembanas S. Temizer D.H. Cambria R.P. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9467-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human PDGF-BB probe was obtained similarly by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using forward (5′-CGTCTGGTCAGCGCCGAGGGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGTCTTGTCATGCGTGTGCTT-3′) primers. The ET1 probe was obtained as described by Bloch et al. (32Bloch K.D. Friedrich S.P. Lee M.-E. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TGF-β1 probe was a gift from G. S. Hotamisligil (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA). Total RNA (10 μg) from cells in culture was fractionated on 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized with a random-primed 32P-labeled HB-EGF cDNA probe as described (31Yoshizumi M. Kourembanas S. Temizer D.H. Cambria R.P. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9467-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, filters were also hybridized with PDGF-BB, ET1, and TGF-β1 probes. The hybridized filters were then washed in 30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 55 °C and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −80 °C for 12–24 h or stored on phosphor screens for 6–8 h. To correct for differences in RNA loading, the filters were rehybridized with a radiolabeled 18 S oligonucleotide (5′-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-3′) probe. The filters were scanned and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Subconfluent HUVEC were not stimulated (control) or stimulated with VEGF for 2 h. The cells were subsequently lysed, and nuclei were isolated as described by Perrella et al. (25Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear suspension (200 μl) was incubated with 0.5 mm each of CTP, ATP, and GTP and with 125 μCi of 32P-labeled UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and resuspended at equal counts/min/ml in hybridization buffer (1.4 × 106 cpm/ml). Radiolabeled run-on transcripts were hybridized (40 °C) to denatured probes (HB-EGF and 18 S, 1 μg each) dot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then washed and scanned on a PhosphorImager running ImageQuant software (25Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent HUVEC were treated with VEGF or PBS for 2 h as described under “Cell Culture and mRNA Isolation.” Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and disrupted by passage through a 22-gauge needle five times. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, and the supernatant was used as cell lysate for Western blotting. A Bradford-based assay kit (Bio-Rad) was used to measure protein concentrations. Equal amounts of protein from each time point were fractionated by 15% Tricine/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. Western blotting was carried out using an ECL kit as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Life Science). HB-EGF was detected by chemiluminescence with a polyclonal primary antibody to HB-EGF (0.1 μg/ml, R&D Systems) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody to goat Ig. The film was scanned into Adobe Photoshop 3.0, and the signal density was measured with the NIH Image software. Cell migration was measured in a 48-well micro-Boyden chamber apparatus (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described (33Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Confluent HASMC were made quiescent by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.4% fetal calf serum for 72 h before the assay. HB-EGF and PBS (control) were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.25% bovine serum albumin and loaded into the lower wells of the Boyden chamber in triplicate. The wells were subsequently covered with a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filter with 8-μm pores (Nucleopore, Palo Alto, CA) coated with type I collagen (Vitrogen, Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Cells were washed four times in PBS and trypsinized (0.01% trypsin, 0.11 mmEDTA) for the minimum period of time required to obtain a mononuclear suspension. The cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.25% bovine serum albumin and resuspended at a density of 1 million cells/ml. Cells (50,000 cells in 50 μl) were loaded into the upper wells of the Boyden chamber. The chambers were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation, cells that had attached to the filter were fixed and stained in Dif Quick (American Hospital Supply, McGaw Park, IL). Cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filter were counted under a microscope at 20× magnification. Chemotaxis was calculated as the difference between the number of cells that had migrated in the presence of the chemoattractant and the number that had migrated in its absence. Primary cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) (25Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were plated on 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were made quiescent by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.4% calf serum for 72 h before the experiments were performed. HUVEC were grown as described, and placed in M199 supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum for 1 h before stimulation with 20 ng/ml VEGF. After 2 h of VEGF treatment, the conditioned medium was harvested from HUVEC and used to stimulate quiescent RASMC (final proportion of 33% conditioned medium and 67% RASMC medium). Prior to its addition to RASMC, HUVEC conditioned medium was treated with either no antibody, anti-human PDGF polyclonal antibody (8 μg/ml, R&D Systems) or normal goat IgG (8 μg/ml, R&D Systems) for 1 h at 25 °C. Conditioned medium was applied to the RASMC for 24 h. During the last 2 h of this incubation period, the cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) at 1 μCi/ml. Labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and washed with 95% ethanol. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted in 0.2 n NaOH and measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA from HUVEC, and blots were hybridized with a human HB-EGF cDNA probe. In response to stimulation with 10 ng/ml VEGF (Fig. 1 A), HB-EGF mRNA levels increased rapidly to a maximum at 2 h. After 6 h, the HB-EGF mRNA level returned to base line. VEGF also induced HB-EGF mRNA in HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that this response was not limited to HUVEC, we performed the same experiment in endothelial cells from another source, HCAEC. As in HUVEC, HB-EGF mRNA was induced by 10 ng/ml VEGF in HCAEC (data not shown). To determine whether induction of HB-EGF mRNA required protein synthesis de novo, we treated HUVEC with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (100 μm) for 1 h before adding VEGF. This dose of anisomycin completely inhibited leucine uptake in HUVEC (data not shown). Anisomycin did not prevent the induction of HB-EGF mRNA by VEGF (Fig. 2), suggesting that this process does not require new protein synthesis. We measured mRNA stability and rate of transcription to elucidate the mechanism by which VEGF up-regulates HB-EGF mRNA. The half-life of HB-EGF mRNA was determined in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. HUVEC were stimulated with VEGF (10 ng/ml) or vehicle (PBS) for 2 h. HB-EGF mRNA was then measured 0, 1, and 2 h after administration of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). The half-life of HB-EGF mRNA at base line was approximately 55 min (Fig. 3 A); it was not altered by exposure to VEGF. Nuclear run-on experiments were then performed to assess the rate of transcription. VEGF increased transcription of the HB-EGF gene in HUVEC by 4.9-fold (Fig. 3 B). These experiments demonstrate that the increase in HB-EGF mRNA levels after VEGF stimulation was the result of an increase in HB-EGF gene transcription. To determine whether the increase in HB-EGF mRNA in HUVEC was associated with an increase in HB-EGF protein, we performed Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody specific for recombinant human HB-EGF. The level of HB-EGF protein increased in HUVEC stimulated with VEGF for 2 h (Fig. 4 A). This observation demonstrates that the effect of VEGF on HB-EGF mRNA in HUVEC is associated with an increase in HB-EGF protein. Because the maturation of new blood vessels requires cell migration and investment of capillary tubules with pericytes and smooth muscle cells, we measured the chemotactic effect of HB-EGF on vascular smooth muscle cells. HB-EGF induced a significant increase in HASMC migration (Fig. 4 B). To see if VEGF increased the expression of other factors known to affect angiogenesis (34Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.-D. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 35Alberts G.F. Peifley K.A. Johns A. Kleha J.F. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10112-10118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we studied its effect on the mRNA levels of PDGF-BB, ET1, and TGF-β1 in HUVEC. Northern blot analysis showed that PDGF-BB mRNA increased as early as 2 h, and its induction reached 3-fold after 5 h of VEGF stimulation. TGF-β1 and ET1 mRNA levels were not altered by VEGF (Fig. 5). To further delineate the role of endothelium-derived growth factors on vascular smooth muscle cells, studies were performed using conditioned medium from HUVEC stimulated with VEGF. Compared with medium from vehicle-treated cells, medium from VEGF-stimulated HUVEC produced a significant increase in RASMC DNA synthesis (Fig. 6). Incubating the conditioned medium with a neutralizing antibody to PDGF prevented this increase in DNA synthesis. When control antiserum, normal goat IgG, was used in the same concentration as the PDGF antibody, the induction of DNA synthesis was not abrogated. A series of sequential events promote angiogenesis. These include (a) degradation of the vascular basement membrane and the interstitial matrix by endothelial cells, (b) endothelial cell migration and proliferation, (c) formation of new capillary tubes, and (d) formation of new basement membrane with investment of the tubule by pericytes and smooth muscle cells (1Hanahan D.

It has been established that VEGF is an endothelial cell-specific, multifunctional growth factor that plays a major role in the initiation of angiogenesis by acting directly as a mitogenic and a chemotactic factor, and indirectly by promoting remodeling of the extracellular matrix (16Dvorak H.F.

Although pericytes and smooth muscle cells are essential in the late phase of angiogenesis, there is no clear explanation of how these cell types are recruited into the process by angiogenic factors such as VEGF (39Nehls V.

Science. 1997; 277: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar) have shown that in PDGF-BB-deficient mouse embryos, endothelial cells of sprouting capillaries fail to attract pericyte progenitor cells. In a recent review article, Folkman and D'Amore (46Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) have proposed a model of new vessel formation in which HB-EGF and PDGF-BB act as recruiting signals for mesenchymal cells during the late phase of angiogenesis. We demonstrate here in endothelial cells that VEGF induces HB-EGF and PDGF-BB, which have mitogenic and chemotactic effects on pericytes and smooth muscle cells. This demonstration links VEGF to early (endothelial cell recruitment) and late (smooth muscle cell migration and investment) stages of angiogenesis. Since the transcriptional mechanisms downstream of VEGF have not been described, this represents a first step toward defining those mechanisms. The induction of VEGF and its receptors (flk-1 and flt) in human atherosclerotic lesions and in animal models of arterial injury has also been described (37Freeman M.R. Schneck F.X. Gagnon M.L.

These findings imply that VEGF may play a paracrine role in exacerbating neointima formation and vessel occlusion, both by inducing neovascularization in lesions and by stimulating the release of smooth muscle cell mitogens and chemoattractants, as suggested by Li et al. (50Li J. Perrella M.A. Tsai J.-C. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Zhou F. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

Our demonstration that VEGF induces the vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenic and chemotactic growth factors HB-EGF and PDGF-BB elucidates a mechanism by which this atherogenic process occurs. We have demonstrated that VEGF induces expression of angiogenic growth factors in vascular endothelial cells. VEGF up-regulates HB-EGF and PDGF-BB but not TGF-β1 or ET1. Induction occurs both in HUVEC and HCAEC (data not shown), suggesting that VEGF has this effect in vascular endothelial cells of various origins. HB-EGF and PDGF-BB are both chemotactic agents for vascular smooth muscle cells, and conditioned medium from endothelial cells treated with VEGF produces an increase in DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells. This growth-promoting effect of conditioned medium can be prevented by a neutralizing antibody to PDGF. Taken together, our data suggest that HB-EGF and PDGF-BB provide a critical endothelial cell-derived signal for the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells during angiogenesis, which is consistent with the model proposed by Folkman and D'Amore (46Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar).

The high mobility group (HMG) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG, high mobility group; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol; NLS, nuclear localization signal. proteins are a family of heterogeneous chromatin-associated DNA-binding proteins in eukaryotic cells. They are the most abundant non-histone proteins found in the nucleus and are divided into three classes: HMG-I/Y, HMG14/17, and HMG1/2 (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Johns E.W. Johns E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982: 1-68Google Scholar). These proteins were classically recognized by their high electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels and acid solubility. The HMG-I/Y class of proteins function as accessory transcription factors, whereas the HMG14/17 class are associated with nucleosomes. The HMG1/2 class of proteins contain the HMG DNA binding domain and are present at a level of about 1 copy/2–3 nucleosomes (3Kuehl L. Salmond B. Tran L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The HMG domain is a 70–80-amino acid region consisting mainly of hydrophobic and charged residues with a few highly conserved aromatic residues (4Landsman D. Bustin M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Members of the HMG1/2 class can be further divided into two subfamilies based upon the number of HMG domains, their DNA sequence specificity, and their evolutionary relationship (5Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific HMG1/2 proteins contain a single HMG domain, which are usually restricted by cell type and interact with relatively high affinity to a specific DNA sequence. These proteins include the human sex-determining factor SRY (6Sinclair A.H. Berta P. Palmer M.S. Hawkins J.R. Griffiths B.L. Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The other subfamily of HMG1/2 proteins are ubiquitously expressed and bind to DNA with structural specificity but little or no sequence specificity. One group of the non-sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins contain multiple HMG domains such as the abundant HMG1 and HMG2 proteins (10Wen L. Huang J.K. Johnson B.H. Reeck G.R.

The domain contains a primary hydrophobic core at the vertex of the L-shaped structure formed by conserved aromatic residues from the three α-helices. The NMR structures of the two sequence-specific HMG proteins, SRY and LEF-1, include their DNA recognition sequence (23Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar,24Love J.J. Li X. Case D.A. Giese K. Grosschedl R. Wright P.E. Nature. 1995; 376: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These structures show the DNA to be greatly distorted in the region of protein contact, with an overall bend of 80° and 120° for SRY and LEF-1, respectively. The DNA is severely underwound, resulting in a widened and shallow minor groove and a highly compressed major groove. In conjunction with the helical underwinding, large positive roll angles are induced by numerous DNA-protein contacts, which include a partial intercalation of an amino acid side chain into the minor groove of the DNA. The sequence-specific HMG structures provide a basis for understanding how the non-sequence-specific HMG1/2 proteins interact with high specificity to distorted DNA containing bends, cruciforms, or DNA kinked by cisplatin (28Bianchi M.E.

Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that a subgroup of non-sequence-specific HMG1/2 proteins, which contain only one HMG box, can bind with higher affinity to linear DNA than HMG1/2 but exhibit only a modest preference for cruciform DNA (30Payet D. Travers A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly clear that the addition of basic amino acids to a single minimal HMG box enhances the bending capacity and affinity for DNA (24Love J.J. Li X. Case D.A. Giese K. Grosschedl R. Wright P.E. Nature. 1995; 376: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 35Carlsson P. Waterman M.L. Jones K.A.

However, despite the fact that some of the non-sequence-specific single HMG box proteins rival the DNA binding affinities of sequence-specific proteins, the exact mode of DNA binding by the non-sequence-specific HMG proteins has not yet been determined. The biological functions of HMG1/2-like proteins are just beginning to be elucidated. They can function as architectural factors through their ability to strongly distort DNA structures. In this regard, they have been shown to promote assembly of specialized recombination complexes derived from prokaryotic systems (38Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 39Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Lavoie B.D.

HMG1/2 proteins and their homologs can substitute for prokaryotic chromatin proteins to condense DNA in vivo (33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and can facilitate nucleosome assembly and disassembly in vitro (42Bonne-Andrea C. Harper F. Puvion E.

Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4959-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, efficient activated transcription of certain genes requires HMG proteins, which, in part, may be related to their ability to promote assembly of preinitiation complexes (41Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 46Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some in vitro studies have found that HMG proteins inhibit transcription (47Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell.

The yeast system provides a genetic tool to investigate the biological roles of HMG proteins and to correlate in vitro activities with in vivo functions. A number of HMG box proteins have been reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae including the non-histone proteins 6A/B (NHP6A/B) (14Kolodrubetz D. Burgum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3234-3239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently the high mobility group proteins HMO1/2 (15Lu J. Kobayashi R. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33678-33685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NHP6A/B are closely related 11-kDa proteins that contain a single HMG box. The HMG box of NHP6A is 45% identical to rat HMG1 box B and 80% identical to the HMG box of NHP6B (Fig. 1 A). NHP6A/B are unique in that they both contain a highly basic amino acid region that precedes the HMG box. These proteins have a higher affinity for and bend DNA more efficiently than mammalian HMG1/2 (33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigate the importance of the N-terminal basic segment for high affinity DNA binding. Neither NHP6A nor NHP6B is essential since Δnhp6A and Δnhp6B mutants grow normally, but the double mutant grows slowly at 30 °C and is not viable at high temperatures. The Δnhp6A/B mutants display a variety of morphological changes and are defective in activated transcription of a subset of genes (41Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 50Costigan C. Kolodrubetz D. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We show in this paper that the N-terminal segment of NHP6A is critical for its DNA binding activities and functional properties. NHP6A mutants containing substitutions in other selected regions have also been analyzed with respect to their in vitro and in vivo properties. The NHP6A mutants were constructed by direct cloning of PCR products using mutant oligonucleotide primers or by site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Kunkel (51Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The sequence of the oligonucleotides used to generate the mutations is given in Table I. In several cases (P21A, M29A, and M29D), mutant PCR products were cloned by a three-way ligation using internal restriction sites (Table I). pRJ1228 (pET11a-NHP6A; Ref. 33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR and the vector for reconstructing mutant NHP6A genes. pRJ1340 and pRJ1341 were generated by cloning into pBS KS+ and pBS KS−, respectively, a PCR product obtained using a 5′ NHP6A primer containing anEcoRI/NdeI site and a 3′ NHP6A primer containing a BamHI site. Single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis was prepared from pRJ1340 and pRJ1341 using CJ236 (dut ung; Ref. 52McClary J.A. Witney F. Geisselsoder J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant genes were subsequently transferred using the NdeI and BamHI sites into pET11a for protein overexpression. Each mutant gene was sequenced in its entirety.Table IMutations introduced into NHP6AMutationOligonucleotide sequence (5′-3′)1-aUnderlined sequences indicate the mutated codon(s) except for the HMK primer, which represents the new coding strand at the C-terminal end of the NHP6A gene.Method of mutagenesis1-bSee “Experimental Procedures”; Kunkel refers to site-directed mutagenesis by the method of Kunkel (51).E. coli expression plasmid1-cThe E. coli expression plasmid are derived from pET11a.Yeast CEN plasmid1-dThe yeast CEN plasmids are derivations of pRS313 (pRJ1364) that contain the control sequence for NHP6A.Δ(2–7)GCCGCCGCATATGAAGAAGAGAACCACTAGAAAGDirect PCRpRJ1338pRJ1381Δ(2–12)GCCGCCGCATATGAGAAAGAAGAAGGACCCAAATGCCCDirect PCRpRJ1294pRJ1370Δ(2–16)GCCGCCGCATATGGACCCAAATGCCCCTAAGAGGGCTTTGTGCDirect PCRpRJ1295pRJ1371P18AAACCACTAGAAAGAAGAAGGACGCAAATGCCCCKunkelpRJ1335pRJ1482P21AGAAGAAGGACCCAAATGCCGCTAAGAGGGCThree-way ligation (AvaII)pRJ1254pRJ1483P18A/P21AAACCACTAGAAAGAAGAAGGACGCAAATGCCGCTAAGAGGGCTTTKunkelpRJ1355pRJ1484Y28DAGGGCTTTGTCCGCCGACATGTTTTTCGCTAACGAAAACKunkelpRJ1455pRJ1485M28ADCTTTGTCCGCCTACG(A/C)CTTTTTCGCTAACGThree-way ligation (AciI)pRJ1293,1333pRJ1486F30VCTTTGTCCGCCTACATGGTCTTCGCTAACGAAKunkelpRJ1357pRJ1487F31VDCTTTGTCCGCCTACATGTTTG(T/A)CGCTAACGAAKunkelpRJ1359,1457pRJ1372HMK (C-term)CGCGGATCCCTACACGCTCGCGCGACGAGCCAAAGTGGCGTTATATAADirect PCRpRJ13321-a Underlined sequences indicate the mutated codon(s) except for the HMK primer, which represents the new coding strand at the C-terminal end of the NHP6A gene.1-b See “Experimental Procedures”; Kunkel refers to site-directed mutagenesis by the method of Kunkel (51Kunkel T.A.

Open table in a new tab The NHP6A mutations were introduced into yeast as follows. The 300-bp control region upstream of the NHP6A gene was obtained by PCR of genomic S. cerevisiae DNA using primers containingXhoI and NdeI sites engineered at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. After digestion with XhoI and NdeI, the product was inserted into pRJ1340 to give pRJ1342, which links the NHP6A promoter to the NHP6A gene flanked byNdeI and BamHI restriction sites. This NHP6A region was then subcloned between the XhoI and BamHI sites into pRS314 (TRP1 CEN6 ARSH4; Ref. 53Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create pRJ1364. Different mutant NHP6A genes were substituted in place of the wild-type gene using the unique NdeI and BamHI sites. In addition, HMG1 box B and box B′ were obtained by PCR of pT7-RNHMG1 (54Bianchi M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with NdeI and BamHI engineered ends. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, these products were ligated into pRJ1364, positioning them downstream of the NHP6A promoter. Recombinant proteins were expressed from the pET11a-derivatives in RJ1878 (BL21 (DE3)hupA::cm hupB::km; Ref. 33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NHP6A synthesis was induced for 3 h at 37 °C in LB when the cells reached an A600 = 0.6 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Two liters of cells were disrupted by sonication in 1/10 volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g, and the NaCl concentration was increased to 1 m. Polyethyleneimine (Sigma) was added to 0.3%, and the nucleic acids were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. Residual polyethyleneimine was removed by batch chromatography with 20% (v/v) cellulose phosphate P-11 (Whatman), and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 0.05 m buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, plus 0.05 m NaCl). The dialysate was passed through a 4-ml S-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in the same buffer, and the NHP6A protein was eluted in a 50-ml linear gradient from 0.05 m to 1.0 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing the NHP6A protein were pooled and subject to 2% trichloroacetic acid precipitation at 0 °C for 30 min to remove contaminating proteins. After centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 × g, the supernatant was adjusted to 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the homogeneous NHP6A was recovered by centrifugation as before. The precipitate was washed with acetone, dried briefly, resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol) and dialyzed overnight in the same buffer. Wagneret al. (55Wagner J.P. Quill D.M. Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7394-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that trichloroacetic acid precipitation affected DNA binding by HMG1, but we have been unable to detect any difference between NHP6A purified using trichloroacetic acid precipitation or under entirely native conditions using multiple chromatography steps. Proteins concentrations were quantitated by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue using a titration of lysozyme as a standard. Values obtained were within 1–3% of the amounts determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility). Labeled DNA fragments for gel mobility shift and ligation assays were obtained using PCR reactions containing [α-32P]dATP and pRJ551–44, pRJ551–66, or pRJ551–76 as described (38Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 56Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After digestion with EcoRI, fragments of lengths 66, 75, and 98 bp containing EcoRI cohesive ends, respectively, were purified in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Circular DNA was formed from reactions containing 8 ng of linear fragment, 40 ng of NHP6A, and 20 units of T4 ligase that were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h under the conditions described previously (33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The products were then digested with 100 units of exonuclease III for 60 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and precipitated with ethanol resulting in >90% monomer circle. Gel mobility shift and ligase-mediated circularization assays were performed as described in Ref. 33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Hin-catalyzed DNA inversion reactions were performed as described previously using pMS551–83, which contains 83 bp between the centers of hixL1 and the proximal Fis binding site in the enhancer (56Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). NHP6A-HMK, containing the heart muscle kinase recognition sequence (RRASV) fused to the C-terminal end of NHP6A, behaved identically to the wild-type in DNA binding assays (data not shown). 10 μg of NHP6A-HMK was labeled by incubating with 5 units of bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>6000 mCi/mmol; Andotek) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched with 10 mm EDTA, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described above, and the32P-labeled NHP6A-HMK was resuspended in buffer B. The specific activity of the protein under potential gel quenching conditions was determined by polymerizing a known amount in a 6% polyacrylamide gel plug (29:1 acrylamide:N,N-bisacryloylcystamine; Sigma). The plug was incubated with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C to dissolve the disulfide cross-links and counted in scintillation fluid (EcoSint; National Diagnostics). 98-bp DNA fragments were prepared as described above. The DNA concentration was determined by a Hoefer TK100 fluorometer using Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma) and by quantitation (ImageQuant, Molecular Dynamics) of digital images of ethidium bromide-stained polyacrylamide gels in which an aliquot of the fragment was electrophoresed together with varying concentrations of pBR322 digested with HaeIII. Both methods gave the same results. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described above, except that electrophoresis was in 6% 29:1 acrylamide:N,N-bisacryloylcystamine gels. The gels were stained with SybrGreen (Molecular Probes) and visualized with a Hitachi FMBIO II Fluorimager. The first and second complex bands were excised, the gel slice dissolved with β-mercaptoethanol as described above, and counted in scintillation fluid. The molar amount of protein in each complex was calculated from its specific activity; the molar amount of DNA was determined by comparison to varying amounts of the DNA fragment electrophoresed on the same gel. The wild-type and NHP6A mutant genes contained on pRS314 were transformed into RJY6012 (MATαura3–52 leu2–3, 112 his3Δ200 trp1-Δ201 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9 gal3 nhp6A:: ura3 nhp6B::LEU2) by the lithium acetate method (57Rose M.D. Winston F. P. H. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The transformants were streaked once on selective media (SD minus His or Trp; Ref. 57Rose M.D. Winston F. P. H. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) and inoculated into liquid selective media. Growth was monitored at A600, and the doubling time in log phase at 30 °C was determined in duplicate for two individual transformants. For quantitation of NHP6A levels, transformants were grown in 25 ml of liquid selective media until the A600 was 1.0. The cells were washed with distilled water and resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The yeast were lysed by passing the mixture three times through a French press. After a brief incubation at 100 °C, the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. 200 μg of total protein was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was immunoblotted with anti-NHP6A (41Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) as a loading control. CUP1 transcription was assayed in RJY6024 (RJY6012 + pLΔ3D241 containing the CUP1-lacZ reporter; Refs. 41Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and 58Durrin L.K. Mann R.K. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At least 2–4 transformants were grown in SD media under selective conditions for 2–4 days and then subcultured into fresh selective media and grown for 6 h. 1 mm CuSO4 was then added, and β-galactosidase activity measured after an additional 2 h at 30 °C in which the final cultureA600 was 0.5–1.0. Transcription reactions (25 μl) were performed using 130 μg of yeast nuclear extracts in the presence of the acidic activator GAL4-λVP4, NHP6A, and 100 ng of G5E4T as the DNA template. mRNA levels were detected by primer extension. Reaction conditions, GAL4-λVP4, and G5E4T have been described previously (41Paull T.T. Carey M. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,59Ohashi Y.

Circular dichroism spectra from 190 to 240 nm was measured with an AVIV 62ADS circular dichroism spectrophotometer with 20 iterations at 25 °C. Proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and protein concentrations determined as above. Secondary structure characteristics were calculated by the self-consistent method using DICROPROT (60Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl.

Chem.270, 22058–22065), a urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell secreted protein having growth-inhibitory properties. We report here cloning of the 1.03-kilobase rat ps20 cDNA clone from the PS-1 (adult rat prostate smooth muscle) cDNA library. Partial clones were obtained by nested polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers, and full-length ps20 cDNA clones were isolated by plaque hybridization. Sequence analysis revealed that ps20 protein contains a WAP-type “four-disulfide core” motif and is a novel member of the WAP signature protein family composed primarily of secreted serine protease inhibitors. Native ps20 immunoprecipitated from smooth muscle cells and recombinant ps20 both resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent molecular mass of 27–29 kDa under reducing conditions and 21–23 kDa under non-reducing conditions, respectively. Stable ps20-transfectant COS-7 cell lines secreted ps20 and were growth-inhibited relative to mock transfectants. In addition, COS-7 and prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells were growth-inhibited by bacterially expressed ps20. Northern analysis indicated differential expression by tissue with highest expression in the heart. Immunohistochemical localization of ps20 protein showed cell-specific expression by both visceral and vascular smooth muscle in all tissues, including the prostate gland.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2241-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 29Hennighausen L.G. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This family is composed of small, secreted serine protease inhibitors, which exhibit a variety of growth- and differentiation-regulatory functions and affect extracellular matrix remodeling and carcinoma progression. We demonstrate here that recombinant ps20 inhibits the proliferation of prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells and COS-7 cells. In addition, we show that ps20 is expressed specifically in the smooth cell type of the prostate gland and other tissues including vascular smooth muscle. These studies suggest that ps20 may function as a mediator of local growth and differentiation mechanisms. An oligo(dT) reverse transcribed cDNA library of 109 to 1012 plaque-forming units/ml was prepared using the ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PS-1 cells (adult rat prostate smooth muscle-like cell line) (30Gerdes M.J. Dang T.D. Lu B. Larsen M. McBride L. Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), were grown to post-confluence in Bfs medium (90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 5% fetal calf serum, 5% NuSerum (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA), 5 μg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with androgens (0.5 μg/ml testosterone) (26Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared using the RNAgents total RNA isolation system and poly(A) RNA selected with the PolyATtract® system (both from Promega, Madison, WI). RNA was size-fractionated on a Sephacryl column prior to ligation with vector arms. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of ps20 was determined and previously reported (27Rowley D.R. Dang T.D. Larsen M. Gerdes M.J. McBride L. Lu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22058-22065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar): N-Thr-Trp-Glu-Ala-Met-Leu-Pro-Val-Arg-Leu-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ser-X-X-X-X-Val-Ala-Ala-(Thr)-Gly-X-Arg-Gln-Pro-(His)-C. Degenerate ps20 primers were designed from this sequence: primer P34 (256-fold degenerate, amino acids 1–7), primer P36 (16-fold degenerate, amino acids 1–7), primer P37 (64-fold degenerate, amino acids 7–13), and primer P38 (16, 384-fold degenerate, amino acids 27–19). Inosines were incorporated at sites of complete degeneracy (31Knoth K. Roberds S. Poteet C. Tamkum M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 109-132Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in primers P34 and P38, whereas optimal mammalian codon usage was assumed in the design of primers P36 and P37. The ps20-specific primers P40 and P42 were designed from clone 3438–1pCRII sequence and ps20-specific primers P45 and P46 from clone 42T7pCRII sequence. Primer sequences (IUPAC nomenclature) are identified in terms of rat ps20 full-length cDNA sequence (Fig. 2): P34 (nt 130–150), 5′-ACI TGG GAR GCI ATG YTI CC-3′; P36 (nt 130–150), 5′-ACM TGG GAR GCY ATG CTS CC-3′; P37 (nt 148–168), 5′-CCY GTS MGR CTG GCY GAR AA-3′; P38 (nt 209–183), 5′-GGC TGY CKI IIS CCK GTK GCR GCN AC-3′; P40 (nt 169–151), 5′-TCA GCT TGG GAC TTC TCA G-3′; P42 (nt 153–171), 5′-GAG AAG TCC CAA GCT GAA G-3′; P45 (nt 425–444), 5′-GGA GGA AGT GTT ACA AGC AG-3′; and P46 (nt 1011–992), 5′-GGT GGG CAG ATT TAT TCG GG-3. Primers P34–P42 were synthesized and purified using high performance liquid chromatography by Keystone Labs, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA). Primers P45 and P46 were synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Primary PCR amplifications were performed using a ps20 degenerate primer and a vector primer (T3 or T7) with 1 μl of the PS-1_BfsλZAP express cDNA library phage lysate as template under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 30 s to 2 min, for 35 cycles, followed by 72 °C for an additional 7 min. Secondary PCR reactions were performed under identical conditions using a 1-μl aliquot of a primary amplification reaction as template and were resolved by 20% polyacrylamide gels or 3% low melt agarose gels for small (<100 bp) fragments and by 0.7% low melt agarose gels for larger fragments. To amplify specific bands for cloning into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), tertiary PCR reactions were performed repeating the conditions used for secondary PCR reactions but using products of secondary reactions resolved on low melt agarose gels and excised as template. Standard conditions for 20-μl PCR reactions were: 0.5 unit of Taqpolymerase (storage buffer B), 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm each dNTP (all Promega), and 20 pmol of each primer. Full-length cDNA clones were isolated by plaque hybridization of 42T7–1pCRII insert with the PS-1_BfsλZAP express library. The complexity of plaques to be screened was reduced by using ps20-specific primers P45 and P46 (see Fig. 1 D) to screen pools of PS-1_BfsλZAP library lysate for the presence of ps20 clones by detection of the diagnostic 586-bp fragment. Initially, 24 pools of 50,000 plaques were screened with a positive signal detected in each pool. One positive pool was further diluted 1:50 into pools of 1000 plaques for rescreening. Of 10 pools, 5 scored positive. One of these pools was diluted 1:10 into pools of 100 plaques. Of 12 pools, 5 scored positive and 3 of these were screened by plaque hybridization. Plaques were transferred to Nytran 0.45-μm membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), DNA cross-linked by the Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene), and membranes prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 2 × PIPES buffer, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). Clone 42T7pCRII insert was purified from an agarose gel slice by Spin-X columns (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), 150 ng labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) by random priming with Klenow enzyme (labeling grade, Boehringer Mannheim). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by NucTrap probe purification column (Stratagene), and denatured probe hybridized with filters at 1–3 × 106 counts/ml overnight, at 42 °C in hybridization mixture. Filters were washed three times for 10 min each at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; two times for 20 min each at 55 °C in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; and exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Positive plaques were screened by PCR, phagemids excised from λ arms by the Rapid Excision Kit (Stratagene), and DNA prepared either by mini alkaline lysis (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar) or by Qiagen tip-500 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The full-length ps20 cDNA clone, ps20–2bpBKCMV, was confirmed by sequencing. For expression in mammalian cells, the lacZ ATG and prokaryotic 5′-untranslated sequences were removed from the vector of the ps20–2bpBKCMV clone by NheI and SpeI digestion and re-ligation to generate the ps20–2bpBKCMV-lac construct. Multiple pass DNA sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 377 Sequencer version 2.1.1 (University of Texas Houston Molecular Genetics Core Facility) using Ampli-Taq polymerase, 3 pmol of primer (pBKT3–1-, pBKT7–1-, M13–20-, and ps20-specific primers), and 1 μg of double-stranded DNA per reaction, or by manual sequencing with Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemica Corp./Amersham Life Science) (33Kyprianou N. Isaacs J.T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2124-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Sequences were assembled using MacVector version 4.1 and AssemblyLign version 1.0 (Kodak). Nucleotide sequence searches were performed on all available data bases using the BLASTN and TBLASTN (blast enhanced alignment utility) algorithms (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions of deduced amino acid sequence were made by SOPMA (Self Optimized Prediction Method from Alignment) (35Geourjon C. Deleage G. CABIOS. 1993; 9: 87-91PubMed Google Scholar) and SBASE (36Pongor S. Hatsagi Z. Degtyarenko K. Fabian P. Skerl V. Hegyi H. Murvai J. Bevilacqua V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3610-3615PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by BLASTX and TBLASTX (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) searches of the available data bases (37Kuroki J. Hosoya T. Itakura M. Hirose S. Tamechika I. Yoshimoto T. Ghoneim M.A. Nara K.

Secretory peptide prediction was confirmed by PSORT version 6.3. Total RNA was isolated from adult male Sprague-Dawley rat tissues (intact, castrate 2 weeks, and castrate 6 weeks), adult female rat tissues (kindly provided by J. S. Richards, Baylor College of Medicine) and from U4F cells grown to post-confluence in Bfs medium. Total RNA was prepared using RNA Stat-60 total RNA isolation reagent (Tel-Test “B,” Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA was electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels (containing 1 × MOPS and 5.1% of a 37% formaldehyde solution), which were transferred to neutral charged nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by downward capillary blotting. Inserts from T340pCRII and 42T7pCRII were excised, gel-purified, labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP, purified, and denatured as described above. Blots were UV-cross-linked and exposed to probe at 1–5 × 106 counts/ml, overnight, at 42 °C; washed with multiple 20 min washes at 60 °C in 0.1% SDS containing 2 to 0.1 × SSC; and exposed to Kodak XAR film for 24 h to 2 weeks, as necessary. The amino-terminal sequence of native ps20 was determined as described previously (27Rowley D.R. Dang T.D. Larsen M. Gerdes M.J. McBride L. Lu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22058-22065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A unique 14-amino acid synthetic peptide, ps20 peptide-(1–14), corresponding to the amino terminus of purified ps20 (see Fig. 2), was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer: N-Thr-Trp-Glu-Ala-Met-Leu-Pro-Val-Arg-Leu-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ser-C (Baylor College of Medicine Protein Core Facility). For initial immunization, ps20 peptide was solubilized in sterile, tissue culture grade H2O (400 μg/ml), mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1 ratio), and injected in 500-μl (100-μg) aliquots at multiple subcutaneous and intramuscular sites of three female New Zealand rabbits. At 3 weeks following immunization, sera samples were analyzed by solid phase enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Each rabbit received a booster of 100 μg of peptide in 500 μl of Freund's incomplete adjuvant injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly at 2 weeks and 5 weeks. Serum samples were tested for ps20-specific antibody every 2 weeks and immunoglobulin subtype determined by ELISA analysis. High titer antiserum (reactive at 1:1 × 106 dilution) was pooled, and the IgG class was precipitated by ammonium sulfate (50% saturation), resolubilized in 1 × PBS, and dialyzed overnight against 1 × PBS at 4 °C. This antibody preparation is referred to as ps20ab-1. ps20ab-1 was affinity-purified by peptide column chromatography. ps20 peptide-(1–14) (10 mg) was coupled to 1 g of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (38Post M. Smith B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 793: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and poured into a 2-ml Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). ps20ab-1 was diluted in BBS buffer (200 mm sodium borate, 160 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0) and chromatographed through the column at 4 °C. The column was washed extensively in BBS (10–15 column volumes) and bound antibodies eluted with glycine-Cl buffer (0.05 mglycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.28). Fractions (2 ml) were eluted and collected directly in tubes containing 0.5 ml of neutralizing buffer (0.5 m phosphate, pH 7.7). Fractions were assayed for protein content, and peak fractions were pooled and assayed for specific immunoreactivity by ELISA. The U4F urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell line (26Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was derived from a urogenital sinus organ explant (25Rowley D.R. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2955-2960PubMed Google Scholar) and the PS-1 cell line (30Gerdes M.J. Dang T.D. Lu B. Larsen M. McBride L. Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) derived from an adult rat prostate organ explant. U4F cells and PS-1 cells were maintained in medium Bfs as described previously (26Rowley D.R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 29-38Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Rowley D.R. Dang T.D.

Rowley D.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PC-3 cells (ATCC CRL-1435, human prostate adenocarcinoma) were maintained as recommended by the ATCC and as described previously (27Rowley D.R. Dang T.D. Larsen M. Gerdes M.J. McBride L. Lu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22058-22065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The COS-7 cell line (ATCC CRL-1651, SV40 transformed African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like) was maintained in 90% DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM-10) (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were tested for mycoplasma every 6 months. COS-7 cells were seeded at 1.7 × 106 cells/ml in 100-mm culture dishes in 90% DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM-10) with no antibiotics 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected at 80% confluence with 4.1 μg of ps20–2bpBKCMV-lac DNA or pBKCMV-lac control plasmid DNA (prepared by Qiagen tip-500) and 41.0 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), following recommendations of the manufacturer. To select for stably transfected COS-7 cell lines, 48 h following transfection with either ps20–2bpBKCMV-lac DNA or pBKCMV-lac control plasmid DNA cells were split 1:15 and replated in COS-7 cell medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Cells were grown in G418-containing medium for 3 weeks when pools of G418-resistant colonies were collected. Clonal cell lines were obtained by serial dilution in 96-well plates and assayed for ps20 expression by Western analysis of the conditioned medium. Once established, stable cell lines were maintained in 400 μg/ml G418-containing medium (DMEM-10/G418). Cells were grown to desired density and then incubated with a solution of crystal violet (0.5% (w/v) crystal violet, 3.2% formaldehyde, 0.17% (w/v) NaCl, 22% ethanol overnight, washed three times with H2O, allowed to dry, and photographed. Cells were seeded in a 150-μl volume in 96-well plates at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/ml (PC-3) and 2.5 × 104cells/ml (COS-7-derived cell lines), and allowed to attach overnight. Sample was added in triplicate in a 50-μl volume (if applicable) and allowed to incubate an additional 24 h. Cultures were pulsed with 10 μl of 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham) during the final 3 h of incubation, fixed, and processed as described previously (27Rowley D.R. Dang T.D. Larsen M. Gerdes M.J. McBride L. Lu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22058-22065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To assay for ps20 activity in the conditioned medium (CM) of transfectant lines, cultures were seeded in a 5-ml volume in 25-mm2 flasks at 1 × 105 cells/ml in standard medium, CM collected after 24 or 48 h, and 100 or 200 μl of CM added to pBKCMV-4 cells and cultures assayed as described above. All assays were performed in triplicate and each experiment repeated multiple times (n ≥ 3). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (error bars) and significance determined by Student's t test. 75-mm2 flasks of PS-1 and U4F cells, grown in Bfs medium, were allowed to reach post-confluence. Cells were then incubated in M medium for 6 h then for 24 h in 4 ml of medium M made with DMEM lacking Cys, Met, and glutamine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.6 mCi of 35S (ICN, Boston, MA). 300 μl of35S-labeled medium was incubated overnight with an equal amount of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) and 10 μl of ps20ab-1 or 50 μl preimmune sera followed by a 1-h incubation with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). Beads were washed four times in 500 μl of RIPA buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer with or without 100 mm dithiothreitol, and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed for 30 min in 30% methanol with 10% acetic acid, incubated for 20 min in Enlightning (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Kodak) for 12–48 h. PCR primers, P69 and P60, were used to synthesize a modified 585-nt fragment of the ps20 coding region for cloning into the bacterial expression vector, pET23c (Novagen, Madison, WI), a vector that allows incorporation of a His tag (six consecutive histidine residues) at the carboxyl terminus. At the amino terminus, the secretory peptide (amino acids 1–26) was replaced with a Met-Ala and the fifth codon was modified to optimize for bacterial expression. Primer P69 (nt 117–153; 5′-C TCT catatg GCT ACT TGG GAA GCA ATG TTG CCG GTC-3′) includes an NdeI site (lowercase) containing an internal ATG start site. Nucleotides modified from ps20 cDNA sequence are underlined. Primer P60 (nt 672–697; 5′-C TCCgaa ttc TGG AAA GTG CCT CTG T-3′), contains anEcoRI site (lowercase) immediately following the final amino acid for cloning into pET23c. Because the EcoRI site in the pET23c vector is out of frame with the His tag, the vector was modified by deleting the four-nucleotide SacI 3′ overhang downstream of the EcoRI site; the entire construct was digested withSacI, digested with T4 polymerase in the presence of 100 μg/ml dNTPs at 37 for 10 min, re-ligated, and confirmed by sequencing. The ps20 cDNA clone ps20–2bpBKCMV (1 ng) was used as template using standard PCR procedures with primers P69 and P60 to amplify a PCR product that was cloned into the T-tailed vector, pCRII. The insert from one clone, rps20pCRII, confirmed by automated sequencing, was excised by a NdeI/EcoRI double digest and ligated with NcoI/EcoRI-digested pET23c. An insert-containing clone, rps20–1pET23c, was confirmed by sequencing and transformed into the BL21(DE3)pLysS bacterial expression cell line (Novagen). 500-ml cultures were grown to OD600 = 0.6, protein expression induced by 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and soluble cell extracts generated by sonication in SB buffer (50 mm phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) on ice followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Soluble recombinant rat ps20 His-tagged protein (rps20-His) was purified on a nickel-charged resin (Ni+-NTA, Qiagen). The column was washed and eluted with an imidazole gradient, as recommended by the manufacturer. Fractions containing rps20-His with apparent >95% purity were pooled and dialyzed to remove imidazole. The rps20pCRII clone was modified by cloning the oligonucleotide 5′-CATAcGGATCCCTCGAGCATATG-3′ into the NdeI site providing an artificial ATG prior to nucleotide 129 (amino acid 26) of the rps20 cDNA sequence. The lowercase nucleotide represents a mutation in the 5′ NdeI site, and the underlined nucleotides represent BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively. This clone, rps20BXpCRII, was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and the 647-base pair fragment purified on a 0.8% agarose gel by the following procedure. The 647-base pair fragment was run onto DE-81 paper (Whatman) and incubated overnight at 25 °C in 500 μl of 0.5 × TBE, 1.25 m NaCl. The paper was then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in dH2O. This rps20 fragment was then cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites in the pGEX2TK vector (Pharmacia) (39Okada A. Belloq J. Chenard M. Rio M. Chambon P."
https://openalex.org/W2020421918,"Progression through G2/M of the mammalian cell division cycle requires the coordinated expression of many gene products, but little is known of the transcriptional regulators involved. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc5 is a putative transcription factor implicated in G2/M transit. We recently identified a cDNA encoding a putative human transcription factor, now designated human Cdc5 (hCdc5), with homology to S. pombeCdc5. Widespread expression of hCdc5 in human tissues and homology with expressed sequences in other eukaryotes suggested an evolutionarily conserved general function. Nuclear import of hCdc5 upon serum stimulation of mammalian cells suggested a possible role in cell proliferation. We now report that overexpression of hCdc5 in mammalian cells shortened G2 and reduced cell size. A dominant negative mutant of hCdc5 lacking the carboxyl-terminal activation domain slowed G2 progression and delayed entry into mitosis. Thus, hCdc5 is the first transcriptional regulator shown to affect G2 progression and mitotic entry in mammalian cells.

Orchestration of the cell division cycle includes a series of checkpoints which ensure that some events are completed before others begin (1Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). One set of controls determines whether the cell replicates its genome in preparation for division (G1/S), whereas another checks that DNA replication is complete and that the cell has grown sufficiently for division to take place (G2/M) (2Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases mediate these events and are themselves regulated through several mechanisms (3Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, regulation of the Cdc2·Cdc13 cyclin complex by the Wee1 kinase and Cdc25 phosphatase is thought to be the primary mechanism controlling G2/M (4Okayama H. Nagata A. Jinno S.

Upstream regulators of Wee1 and Cdc25 also have been described. Nim1 kinase inactivates Wee1 through phosphorylation (10Coleman T.R. Tang Z. Dunphy W.G.

More generally, whereas G2/M progression clearly requires the coordinated expression of many gene products, little is known about how these are regulated at the level of transcription. Characterization of transcription factors regulating G2 progression and mitotic entry would significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms controlling this portion of the cell cycle.The cdc5 gene product in fission yeast is a putative transcription factor implicated in G2/M transit (18Nasmyth K.

Haploid yeast bearing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the cdc5 gene arrest with a diploid complement of DNA, single nucleus, and decondensed chromosomes without evidence of mitotic arrest or defective DNA replication (18Nasmyth K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We recently identified a cDNA encoding a putative human transcription factor (20Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with homology to S. pombe Cdc5 (19Ohi R. McCollum D. Hirani B. Den Haese G.J. Zhang X. Burke J.D. Turner K. Gould K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this new protein was 75% identical to that of Cdc5 over 223-amino-terminal residues containing the DNA binding domain, but this identity decreased to 17% over the subsequent 535 amino acids (20Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Its widespread expression in human tissues and homology with expressed sequences in other eukaryotes suggested an evolutionarily conserved general function (20Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nuclear import upon serum stimulation of mammalian cells suggested a possible role in cell proliferation (20Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Without clear evidence that this was a functional Cdc5 homolog, however, the new protein initially was designated Pombe Cdc5-related protein.We now describe the functional analysis of Pombe Cdc5-related protein in mammalian cells. These studies strongly suggest that it is a human homolog of S. pombe Cdc5, and so we henceforth refer to it as hCdc5. 1The abbreviations used are: hCdc5, human Cdc5; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus. 1The abbreviations used are: hCdc5, human Cdc5; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus. Overexpression of hCdc5 shortened G2 and reduced cell size. A dominant negative mutant of hCdc5 lacking the carboxyl-terminal activation domain slowed G2 progression and delayed entry into mitosis. These results demonstrate that hCdc5 regulates G2 progression and mitotic entry and is the first transcriptional regulator shown to effect G2/M transit in mammalian cells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study the effects of hCdc5 on the mammalian cell division cycle, we attempted its constitutive overexpression in a variety of cell types but were unable to generate stable lines. As this suggested that constitutive expression at high levels might be incompatible with cell survival, we generated a BALBc/3T3-based cell line, designated 3T15.8.22, in which hCdc5 was expressed under control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter (23Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar, 24Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Recombinant hCdc5 was not detectable in the presence of tetracycline; however, in the absence of tetracycline, recombinant hCdc5 was expressed at levels ∼2-fold above that of the endogenous protein (Fig. 1 A), as determined by densitometry. As has been shown for transiently expressed (20Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5833-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and endogenous hCdc5, 2H. S. Bernstein, unpublished observation. stably expressed recombinant hCdc5 translocated to the nucleus upon serum stimulation (data not shown).To assess the effect of increased hCdc5 expression on cell cycle progression, 3T15.8.22 cells were synchronized in G0 with low serum then stimulated with high serum and measured for DNA content at various times (Fig. 1 B). Induction of hCdc5 by removal of tetracycline accelerated progression through the cell cycle; cells returned to G1 by 18 h after release from quiescence in the absence of tetracycline compared with 24 h in the presence of tetracycline. By contrast, the parent cell line 3T15.8, which expressed the tetracycline repressor-VP16 fusion protein but not exogenous hCdc5, returned to G1 in 24 h in the presence or absence of tetracycline (data not shown). This cell cycle acceleration was maintained over time, as manifest by an increase in cell number over several cycles (Fig. 1 C). Over 72 h of continuous growth, cells overexpressing hCdc5 exhibited an abbreviated cell cycle length of ∼19 h, whereas cells in which recombinant hCdc5 expression was repressed by tetracycline grew at a slower rate, with a cycle length of ∼28 h. The cell cycle length of 3T15.8 cultures was ∼26 h and unaffected by tetracycline.To determine which phase of the cell cycle was shortened by overexpression of hCdc5, we analyzed asynchronously dividing 3T15.8.22 and 3T15.8 cultures grown in the presence and absence of tetracycline (Fig. 1 D). In 3T15.8.22 cultures, a highly significant tetracycline-dependent decrease in the calculated length of G2/M was noted (1.9 h versus 7.4 h). An effect in S phase also was seen (2.2 h versus 5 h). Control 3T15.8 cultures showed no significant tetracycline-dependent effect. Thus, hCdc5 overexpression significantly accelerated G2/M.In fission yeast, cells must reach a size threshold to enter mitosis (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 25Nurse P. Nature. 1975; 256: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, size requirements for mitotic entry are presumed but have not been demonstrated. Since mammalian cells overexpressing hCdc5 displayed a remarkable acceleration of G2/M, we asked whether overexpression might affect cell size. Dividing 3T15.8.22 cultures were synchronized in G0 with low serum in the presence or absence of tetracycline, then stimulated with serum and analyzed over time for DNA content and cell size by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). In the absence of tetracycline, 3T15.8.22 cultures showed a decrease in average cell size as they completed a division cycle and entered G0. Upon stimulation with serum, this smaller average cell size was maintained over at least two cell cycles. Moreover, unlike the parent cell line or 3T15.8.22 cultures in the presence of tetracycline, cells overexpressing hCdc5 exhibited little increase in size as they approached mitosis.Figure 2Overexpression of hCdc5 causes a decrease in cell size. Dividing cultures were synchronized in low serum for 48 h, then stimulated with serum. Forward light scatter (FSc) as a function of cell size was measured at timepoints indicated. Data shown are mean ± S.E. (n = 4). Average cell size of 3T15.8.22 cultures decreased as they completed a cycle in the absence of tetracycline. Upon stimulation with serum, 3T15.8.22 cells remained smaller in the absence of tetracycline, with no significant increase in size over the course of the cell cycle compared with cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The basis for the decrease in cell size with overexpression of hCdc5 is unknown. In fission yeast, wee1 ts mutants and Cdc25 overexpressors display shortened G2 and decreased cell size but a normal cell cycle length (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that a size set point has been altered. In mammalian cells overexpressing hCdc5, decreased cell size occurred in the setting of a shortened cell cycle. A similar phenomenon has been observed in mammalian cells overexpressing cyclin D1. In these cells, decreased cell size was noted in the context of an uncompensated decrease in G1/S transit time and growth acceleration (26Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The size reduction seen in hCdc5 overexpressing cultures may thus be due either to a readjustment of the size requirements for mitotic entry or, more simply, to a shortened cell cycle length with less time for cell growth.Constitutive expression of recombinant hCdc5 at levels approximately 2-fold that of the endogenous protein in dividing cultures resulted in a surprisingly dramatic phenotype. If endogenous hCdc5 levels varied throughout the cell cycle, constitutive overexpression might result in relative changes in hCdc5 levels much greater than 2-fold during certain phases of the cell cycle. To investigate this possibility, we performed immunoblot analysis of synchronized BALBc/3T3 and 3T15.8.22 cultures with antibodies against endogenous and recombinant hCdc5. This demonstrated that endogenous hCdc5 was expressed early in the cell cycle (Fig. 3), suggesting that its effects in G2/M are not regulated at the level of expression. As little else is known about the regulation of this recently described protein and its effectors, the mechanism by which hCdc5 overexpression influences cell growth parameters remains to be elucidated.Figure 3hCdc5 is expressed early in the cell cycle. Panel A, hCdc5 expression in synchronized cells. BALBc/3T3 cultures were made quiescent in low serum for 48 h, then stimulated with serum and harvested at indicated timepoints. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hCdc5 monoclonal antibody (B1) or polyclonal antibodies to murine cyclins E (p50 CLNE), A (p60 CLNA), or B1 (p62 CLNB1). Although hCdc5 is barely detectable in quiescent cells, it is almost uniformly expressed in other phases of the cell cycle. Similar analysis of recombinant hCdc5 in 3T15.8.22 cultures in the absence of tetracycline demonstrated that the induced expression of recombinant hCdc5 paralleled that of the endogenous protein (data not shown). Panel B, cell cycle synchronization. Cells at each timepoint were fixed in ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and evaluated by flow cytometry for DNA content distribution to confirm synchronization. 2N and 4N refer to DNA content.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further examine the role of hCdc5 in G2 progression, we generated a mutant, designated Δ675, that contained the DNA binding and nuclear localization domains of hCdc5 but lacked its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 4 A). Studies of the carboxyl terminus of hCdc5 fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain suggested that this region contained a domain capable of activating transcriptionin vitro (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, mutant Δ675 should compete with wild-type hCdc5 for binding to as yet unidentified target promoters but should fail to activate them. Jurkat human T cell leukemia cultures were transiently transfected with a vector directing expression of wild-type hCdc5 or Δ675 together with a plasmid directing expression of GFP as a marker for transfection (21Iavarone A. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the Δ675 cDNA expressed a protein of the expected molecular weight by immunoblot, and immunostaining confirmed that the mutant protein localized to the nucleus (data not shown). GFP-positive cells in asynchronously dividing cultures were analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry (Fig. 5 A). Cells expressing the Δ675 mutant accumulated in G2/M, whereas cells transfected with the empty vector had a phase distribution similar to untransfected cells. Cultures transfected with wild-type hCdc5 distributed toward G1, consistent with the experiments with stable lines described above. Co-expression of wild-type hCdc5 with Δ675 titrated the effect of the mutant on G2/M accumulation (Fig. 5 B), consistent with the mutant acting specifically in the hCdc5 pathway.Figure 4Mutant hCdc5 fails to activate transcriptionin vitro. Panel A, schematic representation of hCdc5 and Δ675 deletion mutant constructs. NLS, nuclear localization signal. Panel B, transcription reporter assay. COS-7 cultures were co-transfected with hCdc5 fusion constructs, pFR-Luc reporter plasmid, and pRL-SV40 plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. Plasmids containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone and a GAL4-VP16 activation domain fusion were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.

Data shown are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). The amino-terminal portion of hCdc5 (GAL4-hCdc5(432–675)), present in mutant Δ675, failed to activate transcription in the absence of the carboxyl terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Mutant hCdc5 specifically delays mitotic entry. Panel A, phase distribution in transfected Jurkat cells. Jurkat cultures were transfected with pNGFP-N1 and hCdc5, Δ675, or pcDNA3 and GFP-positive cells were analyzed. A representative experiment is shown (n = 3). Transient expression of Δ675 caused cells to distribute toward G2/M, whereas expression of hCdc5 resulted in a distribution toward G1 relative to cells transfected with pcDNA3. Panel B, antagonistic effect of hCdc5 and Δ675. Cells were transfected with indicated amounts of plasmid (μg/106 cells) and analyzed as inA. Data shown are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). An increase or decrease in the fraction of cells in G2/M was seen with Δ675 (p < 0.05) or hCdc5 (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with pcDNA3 or untransfected cells. hCdc5 antagonized the effect of Δ675, suggesting that Δ675 acts as a dominant negative. Panel C, prophase index assay. Cells were transfected as in A, treated with nocodazole, and scored for chromosomal condensation. Prophase index is plotted as a function of time. Data shown are mean ± S.E. (n = 2). In the presence of nocodazole, cells accumulated in prophase at a slower rate when transfected with Δ675 (p < 0.01) and at a faster rate with hCdc5 (p < 0.05) compared with pcDNA3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next used mutant Δ675 to ask whether inhibition of hCdc5 function delayed G2 versus mitosis itself (Fig. 5 C). Jurkat cultures transfected as above were examined for chromosomal condensation at various times after exposure to nocodazole, which arrests these cells in prophase (27Kung A.L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9553-9557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Krek W. DeCaprio J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). GFP-expressing cells transfected with Δ675 exhibited a significantly slower rate of accumulation of cells arrested in prophase compared with empty vector transfectants. Cells expressing wild-type hCdc5 displayed a slightly faster rise in prophase index compared with empty vector and a significantly accelerated increase compared with cells expressing the mutant. This result suggests that hCdc5 acts at least in part during G2 before the onset of prophase in mitosis. Taken together with the flow cytometry data (Fig. 5 B), these findings strongly support a role for hCdc5 in the transcriptional regulation of G2 progression and mitotic entry.hCdc5, S. pombe Cdc5, and other Cdc5-like proteins are putative transcription factors by virtue of their primary structures (19Ohi R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the carboxyl terminus of hCdc5 is capable of activating transcriptionin vitro (Fig. 4 B). Genes regulated by Cdc5 family members, however, remain unknown. The Cdc2·cyclin B complex drives G2 progression in mammalian cells (3Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 32King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 by Wee1 kinase, and stimulatory dephosphorylation by Cdc25C phosphatase constitutes the major regulatory mechanism governing Cdc2-cyclin B activity (15Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 16Lee M.S. Ogg S. Xu M. Parker L.L. Donoghue D.J. Maller J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). S. pombe wee1 ts mutants and Cdc25 overexpressors display shortened G2 and reduced size (5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of hCdc5 in mammalian cells results in a similar phenotype, hCdc5 might be a transcriptional activator for Cdc25C or an inhibitor of Wee1 such as Nim1 (11Parker L.L. Walter S.A. Young P.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Nature. 1993; 363: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Wu L. Russell P. Nature. 1993; 363: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Another formal possibility is that Cdc5 family members are regulated by and act as effectors of Cdc2 kinase. Although this is supported by the recent finding that a Xenopus laevishomolog of Cdc5 is an in vitro substrate for Cdc2 kinase (31Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), there is as yet no other evidence to suggest that transcriptional events regulated by Cdc2 are important for G2 progression and mitotic entry.Characterization of hCdc5 provides a new tool for investigating and manipulating the mammalian cell cycle. Identification of genes regulated by hCdc5 will shed light on the precise mechanism by which Cdc5-like proteins regulate cell cycle progression, specifically G2/M. Moreover, inhibitors of hCdc5 function might prove useful for arresting cell proliferation in human neoplasms. Conversely, overexpression of hCdc5 in concert with other regulatory molecules may allow cellular regeneration of cardiac myocytes or other nondividing tissues. Orchestration of the cell division cycle includes a series of checkpoints which ensure that some events are completed before others begin (1Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). One set of controls determines whether the cell replicates its genome in preparation for division (G1/S), whereas another checks that DNA replication is complete and that the cell has grown sufficiently for division to take place (G2/M) (2Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases mediate these events and are themselves regulated through several mechanisms (3Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, regulation of the Cdc2·Cdc13 cyclin complex by the Wee1 kinase and Cdc25 phosphatase is thought to be the primary mechanism controlling G2/M (4Okayama H. Nagata A. Jinno S. Murakami H. Tanaka K. Nakashima N. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 17-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The Cdc2·Cdc13 complex accumulates during S phase, but Cdc2 is phosphorylated and thereby maintained in an inactive state by Wee1 (6Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 7Fleig U.N. Gould K.L. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). As cells complete DNA replication, Cdc25 dephosphorylates Cdc2 (8Moreno S. Nurse P. Russell P. Nature. 1990; 344: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), heralding progression through G2 and entry into mitosis. Upstream regulators of Wee1 and Cdc25 also have been described. Nim1 kinase inactivates Wee1 through phosphorylation (10Coleman T.R. Tang Z. Dunphy W.G.

Nature. 1993; 363: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas protein phosphatase 2A has been shown to negatively regulate mitotic entry by its interaction with Wee1 and/or Cdc25 (13Kinoshita N. Yamano H. Niwa H. Yoshida T. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The biochemical events controlling G2/M transit in mammalian cells are remarkably similar to those in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Mammalian Cdc2 kinase accumulates in S phase (14Shimizu M. Ichikawa E. Inoue U. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Nojima H. Okayama H. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2882-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is regulated by a Wee1 kinase (15Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and Cdc25 phosphatase (16Lee M.S. Ogg S. Xu M. Parker L.L. Donoghue D.J. Maller J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol.

More generally, whereas G2/M progression clearly requires the coordinated expression of many gene products, little is known about how these are regulated at the level of transcription.

Depending on the peptide and the antigen-presenting cell, the initial contact of the TCR with the complex of peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules may lead to activation, anergy, or T cell apoptosis (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The transduction of signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus is mediated by transient interactions between various signaling proteins, among which are tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and adapter proteins without catalytic function. The signaling process is complex and still not well understood (2Zenner G. Dirk zur Hausen J. Burn P. Mustelin T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events act as triggers for transient interaction between the various signal transducing proteins. Recognition of specific protein sequences containing phosphorylated tyrosines is mediated by particular conserved modular binding domains, such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (3Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) and the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (5Margolis B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Signal transducing proteins may also have binding domains, which recognize structures that do not undergo enzymatic changes during signal transduction, such as the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. SH3 domains bind to proline-rich sequences (6Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 7Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This may localize the SH3 domain-containing protein to proline-rich structures like the cytoskeleton. Additionally, SH3 domains of cytoplasmic enzymes may aid in the recruitment of specific substrates for the enzyme (3Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Not all signal transducing proteins have catalytic functions. Some proteins, like Slap (8Pandey A. Duan H.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), function as adapters, linking catalytic signaling proteins to receptors at the cell membrane or to downstream effectors like Ras (14Pratt J.C. Ravichandran K.S. Sawasdikosol S. Chang J.-H. Burakoff S.J. Immunologist. 1996; 4: 122-127Google Scholar). We initiated experiments to identify genes that are specifically expressed in activated CD8+ T cells using a subtractive strategy. By using this approach, we have isolated and characterized a novel gene that is strongly expressed in T cells shortly after activation. The gene continues to be expressed in long term cultures of activated T cells. We propose that this protein, due to the presence of an SH2 domain and putative SH3 and PTB binding motifs, is an adapter molecule involved in protein-protein interactions during T cell activation. This novel protein may be termed TSAd, for T cellSH2 domain-containing adapter protein. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide (AEEVPGEGSLFLQAETRAWF) derived from amino acid (aa) position 59–78 of the deduced F2771 polypeptide by immunizing rabbits with peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-TCR mAb T10B9 was obtained as a gift from J. S. Thomson, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL), and QIAexpressMRGSHis IgG was obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Anti-p56lck antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For detection of phosphotyrosine, the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were obtained from citrate-anticoagulated blood or buffy coats of healthy blood donors by Isopaque-Ficoll (Nycomed AS, Oslo, Norway) gradient centrifugation. Positive selection of cells from buffy coats or PBM using superparamagnetic Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) coated with mAb specific for CD4, CD8, or CD19 has been described previously (15Brinchmann J.E. Gaudernack G. Thorsby E. Jonassen T.O. Vartdal F. J. Virol. Methods. 1989; 25: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Funderud S. Erikstein B. Asheim H.C. Nustad K. Stokke T.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 2961-2966PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed directly after isolation, or the beads were detached from the cells by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with goat anti-Fab antiserum (Detachabead, Dynal) (18Rasmussen A.M. Smeland E.B. Erikstein B.K. Caignault L. Funderud S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 146: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cell subsets thus isolated contained <2% contaminating cells as assessed by flow cytometry and showed >95% viability as determined by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. CD8+ cells were left overnight in RPMI supplemented with 10% pooled human serum at 37 °C, 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2before being activated by incubation with anti-TCR mAb T10B9 coated onto Dynabeads and interleukin-2 (10 units/ml). The cells were harvested after 72 h, and 30–100 × 106 cells were frozen as cell pellets at −70 °C for later RNA extraction. For mRNA expression studies, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were activated with anti-TCR, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (19Coligan J.E. Kruisebeek A.M. Marguilies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Son, New York1995Google Scholar). B cells were activated with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Cells were harvested after 3 days, or at different time points as shown under “Results.” COS-1 cells (CRL-1650) (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Jurkat (TIB-152), MOLT-3 (CRL-1552), KT-1, RAMOS (CRL-1596), THP-1 (TIB-202), and K-562 (CCL 243) cell lines (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum. EBV-transformed B cell lines from healthy donors were established in our laboratory. Absence of mycoplasma infection was ascertained by the use of an ATCC mycoplasma PCR detection kit (ATCC). A cDNA library in the pcDNAI plasmid vector was custom made by Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) from 100 × 106 CD8+ T cells activated 3 days previously with anti-TCR coated Dynabeads as described above. cDNA synthesis was performed with a mixture of oligo(dT) primer and random priming. The cDNAs smaller than 800 bp was removed. The resulting cDNA library contained 2.23 × 106 primary recombinants. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated directly from 50–70 × 106 lysed cells using 5 mg of Dynabeads oligo(dT)25 (Dynal) as described previously (20Aasheim H.C. Deggerdal A. Smeland E.B. Hornes E. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 716-721PubMed Google Scholar). Seven to 10 μg of mRNA were obtained from 50–70 × 106 cells (lymphoid cell lines). Total RNA was extracted from fresh or frozen pellets of 50 × 106 cells by the guanidine thiocyanate method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Preparation of a subtraction probe was performed as described previously in detail (22Aasheim H.C. Logtenberg T. Larsen F. Austin C.A. Cowell I.G. Methods in Molecular Biology: cDNA Library Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 115-128Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of mRNA was isolated from Jurkat cells (subtractor) using oligo(dT)25 as described above and first strand cDNA was synthesized while mRNA was still bound to the Dynabeads, using a combination of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by rTth heat-stable polymerase (Perkin Elmer) (22Aasheim H.C. Logtenberg T. Larsen F. Austin C.A. Cowell I.G. Methods in Molecular Biology: cDNA Library Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 115-128Google Scholar). This leads to immobilized first strand cDNA (subtractor). The subtraction was performed by hybridizing 1 μg of mRNA isolated from anti-TCR activated CD8+ T cells (see above), to the immobilized first strand cDNA subtractor beads. Three rounds of hybridization was performed to ensure optimal subtraction. mRNA hybridizing to the subtractor beads were removed between each round of hybridization. After the last hybridization, the hybridization solution contained the specific target mRNA. This was isolated using oligo(dT)25, and specific target cDNA was synthesized on the beads. Amplification of the specific target mRNA was performed essentially as described (22Aasheim H.C. Logtenberg T. Larsen F. Austin C.A. Cowell I.G. Methods in Molecular Biology: cDNA Library Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 115-128Google Scholar, 23Lambert K.N. Williamson V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 775-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Poly(A) tails were added to the cDNA by incubating the beads with terminal transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and dATP for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. After washing the beads in TE, 50 μl of a PCR amplification mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdNTPs, 2.5 units/100 μl Taq polymerase; Perkin Elmer) containing 20 pmol of the T-primer (5′-dTTGCATTGACGTCGACTATCCAGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) was added. The T-primer was extended by incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, then 15 min at 40 °C, and 15 min at 72 °C. After 2 min at 94 °C, 15 PCR cycles (94 °C, 1 min, 72 °C 5 min) were performed, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. Reamplification of 5 μl of this reaction was performed for an additional 20 cycles as above in 50 μl of the same PCR amplification mixture containing 50 pmol of L-primer: 5′-dTTGCATTGACGTCGACTATCCAGG-3′. This PCR product was purified using Geneclean kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA), and one-fifth of it was radiolabeled and used as a probe for library screening. The library was spread on LB agar containing 12.5 μg/ml ampicillin and 7.5 μg/ml tetracycline. Colony lift using Optitran BA-S 85 reinforced cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel) was performed essentially as described (24Grunstein M. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3961-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) at 42 °C. The PCR-amplified subtraction probe was labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham, UK). After overnight hybridization, a stringency wash was performed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Positive colonies were rescreened twice with the same subtraction probe, and positive inserts were partially sequenced (see below). The F2771 clone was one of 15 clones isolated from 5 × 104 colonies. Several full-length F2771 clones were isolated from the same cDNA library as described above using the originally isolated F2771 cDNA as a probe. Three near full-length cDNA clones (F2771–19, F2771–21, and F2771–45) as well as the original F2771 cDNA clone were sequenced in both directions using restriction fragment subcloning and oligonucletide primers specific for the F2771 sequence already obtained. Several shorter cDNAs including a 3.5-kilobase pair primary transcript of F2771 (F2771–4.2) were partially sequenced. Sequencing was performed using Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham) following the manufacturer's instruction. Samples (10 μg) of total RNA were size-fractionated on 1% agarose gel/formaldehyde denaturing gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N nylon, 0.45 μm; Amersham) and cross-linked to the membranes by UV light. The membranes were hybridized and washed as described above, using radiolabeled F2771 insert as a probe. All blots were exposed to XAR-5 film at −70 °C using intensifying screens or PhosphorImager. Chromosomal localization of the F2771 gene was performed by PCR amplification using F2771-specific primers and DNA from a monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid DNA panel obtained as a generous gift from the UK HGMP Resource Center, Cambridge, UK. Chromosomal localization was also performed using FISH on human metaphases as described previously (25Pedeutour F. Szpirer C. Nahon J.L. Genomics. 1994; 19: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of the biotinylated (Bionick, Life Technologies, Inc., France) F2771 probe were denaturated 5 min at 70 °C and reannealed with 10 μg of Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) 30 min at 37 °C, then incubated overnight on metaphase spreads. Revelation of the signal was performed using three layers of avidin-fluorescein. Prodidium iodide (as a counterstain) and 4,5-diamino-2-phenyleindole (for chromosome identification) were added to antifade mounting medium. Slides were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, and metaphases were analyzed using a high performance cooled CCD camera C4880 (Hamamatsu) interfaced to a 486DX33 PC with a Matrox 640 card (Alcatel software package). The F2771–19, F2771–21, and F2771–45 inserts representing three different splice variants of the F2771 cDNAs were cloned into pcDNAI-His2, a modified pcDNAI vector encoding a MRGS-His6 tag 3′ of the XhoI site in the polylinker of pcDNAI generated by us. The inserts were PCR-amplified using a modified F2771-specific primer introducing anXhoI site at the stop codon at position 1252 and cloned into the XhoI and HindIII site of pcDNAI-His2. The presence of the correct sequence was verified by sequencing. The resulting constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE Dextran method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cells were transferred to Chamber slide culture chambers (Nunc, Napierville, IL) the day after transfection. Three or four days later, the cells were fixed in 100% acetone and incubated in a 1/200 dilution of QIAexpressMRGS·His antibody at room temperature for 30 min. Visualization was done using the alkalic phosphatase anti-alkalic phosphatase technique (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Cellular localization of His-labeled protein was assessed by microscopy. Cell lysates were prepared by lysis of cells in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10 mm Na2+ orthovanadate, 50 mmiodoacetamide, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was assessed by colorimetric detection using Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Five μg of each lysate was run on a precast 16% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). Alternatively, immunoprecipitation of proteins from the cell lysates was performed using the indicated antibodies and Sepharose A according to standard methods (19Coligan J.E. Kruisebeek A.M. Marguilies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Son, New York1995Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and blotting of the gel onto nitrocellose was performed according to standard methods (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, and signals were developed using ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham, UK). Data base searches were performed using the Blast (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and Fasta and Tfasta programs from the GCG program package (27Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9378) Google Scholar). Search for protein motifs was also performed using the compilation of protein sequence analysis programs at the UK HGMP Resource Center, Cambridge, UK. 2Protein sequence analysis programs are also available via the World Wide Web (http://expacy.hcuge.ch/www/tools.html). The alignment of multiple SH2 domains was performed using the pfscan program. 3The pfscan program is available via the World Wide Web (http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/profilescan.html). Using a subtractive strategy, we isolated a novel cDNA clone, F2771, derived from anti-TCR activated human CD8+ T cells. Initial Northern blot analysis showed that the F2771 cDNA hybridized to a single band of approximately 1700 bp, expressed in activated CD8+ cells and not in the Jurkat cell line used as subtractor, thus confirming the efficiency of the subtraction (data not shown). The entire F2771 cDNA sequence was found to consist of 1592 bp, excluding the nucleotide polyadenylate stretch (Fig. 1 A). A common AAUAAA polyadenylation signal is localized at position 1556. The F2771 sequence has an open reading frame from position 2 to position 1254. Attempts to identify a transcription start site upstream of the obtained F2771 sequence, either by primer extension analysis of RNA or PCR amplification of the 5′ F2771 ligated to the pcDNAI vector, failed to reveal a more 5′ start site (data not shown). Thus, the first putative initiation codon is at nucleotide 87, within a sequence (GCTCTCATGG) that shows moderately good similarity to the Kozak translation initiation consensus sequence (XCXGCCATGG; Ref. 28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This putative initiation codon yields a predicted polypeptide chain of 389 aa with a predicted molecular mass of 43 kDa. Two other F2771 hybridizing cDNAs representing two different alternate splice variants of the F2771 gene were isolated. One of these cDNAs may employ a different start site at nucleotide 171 (ACAGACATGA) yielding a polypeptide of 361 aa. The other cDNA includes a 30-bp insertion at position 399, yielding a predicted polypeptide of 399 aa. The F2771 sequence showed only low overall homology to any genes or gene families. However, several expressed sequence tags (29Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) with high degree of similarity to F2771 were identified in the EST (expressed sequence tag) Data Bank. The predicted polypeptide of F2771 contains a putative SH2 domain, which is located at aa positions 95–186 (Fig. 1, A and B) (30Sadowski I. Stone J.C. Pawson T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 4396-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 31Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal part of the F2771 sequence (aa 239–389), the motif RPKPXXP is repeated twice, and there are also several other repeats of ((R/P)XX)n. These motifs may represent binding sites for SH3 domains (32Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Two of the 10 tyrosines of the F2771 sequence are found within an NPXY motif, i.e. Tyr-216 and Tyr-280 (Fig. 1 A). When phosphorylated on tyrosine, NPXY motifs may represent binding sites for PTB domains (33Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the F2771 cDNA is given in Fig. 1 C. By using a monochromosomal cell hybrid DNA panel and F2771-specific primers, we localized the F2771 gene to chromosome 1 (data not shown). These data were further confirmed by FISH analysis. Fluorescent signals were observed in the 1q21 position (Fig. 2) on 20 human metaphases from two unrelated healthy donors (one male and one female), respectively. The initial Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the F2771 cDNA hybridized to a single band of approximately 1700 bp, expressed in activated CD8+ cells but not in the T leukemic cell lines Jurkat. When examining the tissue distribution, the F2771 gene was found to be expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), thymus, and spleen (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, we found that the F2771 gene was expressed in tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-activated CD4+ and CD8+ cells, but not in resting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, nor in B cells (Fig. 3 B). The resting cells were obtained by positive selection from buffy coats using anti-CD4, anti-CD8, or anti-CD19 Dynabeads, respectively, and directly lysed after a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with the beads. Several lymphoid cell lines (the KT-1 and MOLT-3, the B lymphoma cell line Ramos, the erythroleukemoid cell line K-562, and the myelocyte cell line THP-1), as well as the monkey fibroblast cell line COS-1, did not express F2771 mRNA as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). When probing 105 cDNA clones from the cDNA library of activated CD8+ T cells using the initially isolated F2771 cDNA as a probe, we isolated 16 different F2771 clones. Thus, we were able to estimate the frequency of F2771 expression to be higher than 1/10,000 transcripts. Exposure of freshly isolated PBM to the plastic of culture bottles activate monocytes and thereby possibly T cells (34Fuhlbrigge R.C. Chaplin D.D. Kiely J.M. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3799-3802PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that after a 2-h incubation of PBM on plastic at 37 °C to remove adherent cells, the F2771 gene was already induced to maximal mRNA expression in the nonadherent PBM fraction (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, we found that positive selection of CD4+ cells by cross-linking of the CD4+ receptor using immunomagnetic beads (15Brinchmann J.E. Gaudernack G. Thorsby E. Jonassen T.O. Vartdal F. J. Virol. Methods. 1989; 25: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) induced the expression of the F2771 mRNA within 2 h when incubated in RPMI plus 10% human serum at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). Similar data were obtained by cross-linking of the CD8 receptor or the TCR (data not shown). The increased levels of F2771 mRNA were sustained for at least 24 h in unstimulated culture of positively selected T cells after the removal of the immunomagnetic beads using anti-Fab (Fig. 4 C, lanes labeled 0 h CD4-cells and 0 h CD8-cells). In CD4+ but not in CD8+ cells, the F2771 expression in these T cells could be further increased by cross-linking of TCR (Fig. 4 C). Finally, we found that the F2771 gene continues to be expressed throughout long term cultures of activated CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4 C, right panel). By the use of “analysis and prediction of protein sorting signals” (PSORT; Ref.35Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), the F2771 protein was found to lack a hydrophobic signal sequence, transmembrane regions and nuclear localization signals. This indicates that the F2771 protein is an intracytosolic protein. To verify this prediction, three cDNA clones (F2771–19, F2771–21, and F2771–45) encoding F2771 polypeptides of 361, 389, and 399 aa, respectively, were modified to encode a C-terminal histidine tag (MRGS-His6). Microscopy of COS-1 cells transiently transfected with these constructs, visualized using an anti-His-specific antibody and the alkalic phosphatase anti-alkalic phosphatase technique, showed staining of the cytoplasm and not the nuclei of positive cells (Fig. 5). This observation supports the prediction that the F2771 protein is an intracytosolic protein. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against a peptide derived from aa 56 to aa 78 in the predicted F2771 polypeptide sequence. In Western blots of cell lysates, this antiserum detected one protein band at 52 kDa expressed in PHA blasts and freshly isolated PBM, but not in Jurkat, KT-1, MOLT-3, or K562 leukemic cell lines, or in EBV-transformed B cells (Fig. 6 A). The 52-kDa protein could be detected by Western blot in freshly isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6 B). Protein expression was increased in cells left overnight in unstimulated culture (cells labeled 0 h CD4-cells and 0 h-CD8 cells). A further increase in protein expression was observed in these T cells after 1 day of PHA stimulation (Fig. 6 B). This corresponds to the observed changes in F2771 mRNA expression in positively selected CD4+ and CD8+ T cells treated in a similar way (Fig. 4 C). The F2771 antiserum could immunoprecipitate a 52-kDa protein from lysates of PHA blasts (Fig. 7 A). F2771 immunoprecipitates from lysates of PBM stimulated with PHA for 1 and 2 days reacted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. However, phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated protein was also observed in lysates from freshly isolated PBM (Fig. 7 B). Attempts to coprecipitate the p56lck protein from lysates of PHA blasts, using the anti-F2771 antiserum or vice versausing an antiserum against the p56lck protein, failed to reveal an association between the two proteins (Fig. 7 A and data not shown). We have identified and characterized a novel human cDNA (F2771) encoding a putative adapter protein with T cell-specific expression. The F2771 cDNA encodes a protein with predicted molecular mass of 43 kDa, including an SH2 domain, as well as putative SH3 and PTB interaction motifs. T"

The minimum unit for PSII capable of oxygen evolution under physiological conditions contains seven major intrinsic proteins of the reaction center peptides D1 and D2, two apoproteins of cytochrome b559, psbI gene product, and two chlorophyll-binding peptides CP47 and CP43, and three extrinsic proteins of 33, 23, and 17 kDa which are associated with the lumenal surface of thylakoid membranes (1Burnap R.L.

In cyanobacterial and red algal PSII, these two extrinsic proteins are absent, but a low-potential cytochromec550 and a 12-kDa protein have been found as the alternative extrinsic components (10Shen J.-R.

The extrinsic 33-kDa protein, on the other hand, is present in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms from cyanobacteria to higher plants and plays an important role in stabilizing binding and maintaining functional conformation of the manganese cluster which directly catalyzes the H2O-splitting reaction (for reviews, see Refs. 13Ghanotakis D.F.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar) significantly decreases the oxygen evolving activity but the activity can be considerably restored by rebinding of the protein (17Miyao M.

Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 283-289Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Removal of the protein also leads to a gradual liberation of two out of the four manganese per PSII (20Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 281-286Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immobilization of the protein with PSII intrinsic components by a water-soluble carbodiimide, EDC, which directly links amino and carboxyl groups in contact, prevents release of the protein upon CaCl2 or urea/NaCl wash or heat treatment, thereby stabilizing binding of the manganese cluster and the oxygen evolving activity against these treatments (21Enami I.

Based on these studies, the association of the 33-kDa protein with PSII has been proposed to involve electrostatic interactions between positive and negative charges on both the extrinsic protein and some PSII intrinsic subunits as well as hydrogen bonding (21Enami I. Kaneko M. Kitamura N. Koike H. Sonoike K. Inoue Y. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 224-232Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 453-457Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that positive charges on the 33-kDa protein are important for the electrostatic interaction with PSII intrinsic proteins, whereas negative charges on the protein do not contribute to such interaction (27Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we proposed that the positive charges of ε-amino groups on Lys4, Lys20, Lys66 or Lys76, Lys101, Lys105, Lys130, Lys159, Lys186, and one or two Lys in Lys230-Lys236 in the extrinsic 33-kDa protein electrostatically interact with negative charges on PSII intrinsic proteins (27Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments have indicated that the three extrinsic proteins bind to the PSII complex in the order of the 33-, 23-, and 17-kDa proteins (28Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 303-308Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Andersson B. Larsson C. Jansson C. Ljungberg U. Åkerlund H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 21-28Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Miyao M. Murata N. Top. Photosynth. 1987; 9: 289-307Google Scholar). Among these three extrinsic proteins, the 33-kDa protein is required for stoichiometric and functional binding of the 23-kDa protein, whereas both the 33- and 23-kDa proteins are required for functional binding of the 17-kDa protein. The extrinsic proteins cannot, however, directly bind to each other when they are not associated with the PSII complex (24Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These results suggest that binding of the extrinsic proteins to the PSII complex alters the conformation of the extrinsic proteins themselves and/or that of the intrinsic part of the complex so as to create the binding sites for the other extrinsic proteins (24Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine whether conformational changes occur with the 33-kDa protein accompanying its binding to PSII and the possible importance of such conformational changes, we performed intramolecular cross-linking of the 33-kDa protein with a water-soluble carbodiimide, EDC, by which the conformational changes of the protein are expected to be suppressed. The intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein was found to retain the rebinding and manganese-stabilizing capabilities but not the reactivating ability, suggesting that a suitable flexibility of the 33-kDa protein is needed for its full functioning in oxygen evolution. Oxygen-evolving PSII membranes were prepared from spinach chloroplasts with Triton X-100 as in Ref. 31Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, with slight modifications as described in Ref. 21Enami I. Kaneko M. Kitamura N. Koike H. Sonoike K. Inoue Y. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 224-232Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar. The PSII membranes were suspended in medium A containing 40 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 0.4 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The extrinsic 33-kDa protein was extracted from the PSII membranes by 1 m CaCl2 treatment (16Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 255-260Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and purified according to Refs. 27Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K.

Acta. 1986; 850: 146-155Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar. For cross-linking, the purified 33-kDa protein was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with distilled water. The concentration of the 33-kDa protein was determined using an extinction coefficient of 16 mm−1cm−1 at 276 nm (33Eaton-Rye J.J. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intramolecular and intermolecular cross-linking of the 33-kDa protein was carried out in a solution containing 4 μm 33-kDa protein and 1 mm EDC at 25 °C for 12 h. After the reaction was stopped by adding 100 mm sodium acetate, the reaction mixture was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.6). The pH of the protein mixture was then adjusted to pH 10 with concentrated NaOH solution and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h to recover carboxyl groups from modification by EDC. After the pH was returned to 6.5 by adding 500 mm Mes (pH 6.5), the cross-linked 33-kDa protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration and then passed through a Sephacryl S-100HR column equilibrated with 100 mm Mes (pH 6.5) to separate the intramolecularly and intermolecularly cross-linked products. For reconstitution, native PSII membranes were washed with 2.6m urea, 0.2 m NaCl to remove the three extrinsic proteins of 33, 23, and 17 kDa (17Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The resulting PSII membranes were incubated with either the native or the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein at a protein to Chl ratio of 0.6 (w/w), in medium A at 0 °C for 30 min in the dark at a Chl concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The reconstituted PSII membranes were collected by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 10 min, then washed once with and resuspended in medium A. Oxygen evolution was measured at 25 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in medium A, to which 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.4 mmphenyl-p-benzoquinone were supplemented. Chl concentration was determined by the method of Porra et al. (34Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), with a slab gel of 11.5% acrylamide containing 6m urea. Samples were solubilized with 5% lithium lauryl sulfate and 75 mm dithiothreitol. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and photographed. For determination of manganese released from urea/NaCl-washed PSII membranes reconstituted with the native or intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein, membrane suspensions after incubation for 0–48 h at 0 °C in the dark were centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 10 min and manganese remaining in the supernatant was assayed with a Hitachi polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Z-8000). Amounts of manganese per PSII were estimated by assuming the antenna size of PSII as 250 Chl. The circular dichroism (CD) measurements of the native or intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein were performed with a JASCO J-500A spectropolarimeter as described in Ref. 36Motoki A. Miura K. Shimazu T. Kanai S. Hirano M. Katoh S. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. 2. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 413-416Google Scholar. The untreated and intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa proteins were denatured in 8 m urea and 25 mm Mes (pH 6.5) at 37 °C for 15 h, and then 3m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) was added to a final concentration of 2m urea. The denatured 33-kDa protein was digested first with lysyl endopeptidase at a protein to lysyl endopeptidase ratio of 50 (w/w) for 15 h at 37 °C, and then with another lysyl endopeptidase at the same concentration for 15 h at 37 °C. The digested mixture was subjected to a reversed phase column (Bondasphere 5μ C4 300A, Waters Inc.) in an HPLC set-up (LC-9A, Shimadzu Inc., Japan). The column was eluted with a gradient of 0–75% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the elution pattern was monitored at 210 nm. Each fraction was collected, dried, and resolubilized in 2 μl of 67% acetic acid out of which, 1 μl was mixed with a same volume of matrix (a mixture of 1:1 volume of glycerol and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol), and analyzed with a fast atom bombardment mass spectrometer (JEOL JMS HX-110) at a voltage of 10 kV with xenon as the ionization gas. The resulting mass spectra were analyzed with a DA5000 data system and assigned to the known protein sequence. The peptides obtained from HPLC were also analyzed for their N-terminal sequence by Edman degradation of the peptides followed by sequence analysis with a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystem, model 477A and 476A). To suppress the formation of intermolecularly cross-linked products, a diluted solution of the 33-kDa protein (4 μm) was used for treatment of EDC. A small amount of intermolecularly cross-linked product was, however, formed as shown in Fig. 1. The polypeptide pattern of the EDC-treated 33-kDa protein showed two Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands with apparent molecular masses of about 55 and 27 kDa (lane 1), which correspond to dimer and monomer of the 33-kDa protein resulting from intermolecular and intramolecular cross-linking, respectively. No trimer and polymer are formed under the conditions employed here. The intermolecularly (dimer) and intramolecularly (monomer) cross-linked products of the 33-kDa protein could be clearly separated by a Sephacryl S-100HR column (lanes 2 and 3); upon electrophoresis, the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein migrated faster and appeared as a broader band as compared with the untreated protein. The three extrinsic proteins of 33, 23, and 17 kDa were removed by washing PSII with 2.6 m urea plus 0.2m NaCl (lanes 1, 2, Fig. 2) (17Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 350-354Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The native 33-kDa protein was able to rebind to urea/NaCl-washed PSII completely (lane 3). Because the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein migrated faster than the native 33-kDa protein and thus comigrated with the large amount of LHC II bands, detection of the 33-kDa protein reconstituted was done as follows. PSII membranes reconstituted with the native or intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein were again treated with 2.6 m urea plus 0.2 m NaCl and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were concentrated 5-fold by ultrafiltration as the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein showed a much weaker Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining intensity than the native 33-kDa protein. The result shown in lane 4R of Fig. 2 indicates that the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein rebound to PSII to a significant amount. To estimate the amount of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein rebound, the 33-kDa protein corresponding to the amount when the protein was completely rebound was electrophoresed together (lanes 3C and 4C). The comparison of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining intensities inlanes 4C and 4R revealed that the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein was completely rebound to PSII. It should be noted that the band of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein rebound (lane 4R) showed a similar broad band as the original cross-linked protein (lane 4C). If this is due to heterogeneous cross-linking, the results suggested that the 33-kDa protein was able to rebind to PSII irrespective of the heterogeneous cross-linking. These results indicate that the binding sites of the 33-kDa protein remain intact after intramolecular cross-linking. Table I shows oxygen-evolving activity of urea/NaCl-washed PSII membranes reconstituted with the native or intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein. Removal of the three extrinsic proteins by urea/NaCl wash reduced the oxygen evolving activity to 4% of the original activity. The activity was restored to 66% by reconstitution with the native 33-kDa protein, whereas it was scarcely restored by reconstitution with the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein. This indicates that the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein lost its reactivating ability of oxygen evolution even though it was completely rebound to PSII.Table IReactivation of oxygen evolution by reconstitution of the native or intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein with urea/NaCl-washed PSII membranesOxygen evolutionReactivationμmol O2/mg Chl/h%PS II membrane534Urea/NaCl-washed PS II membrane22 + Native 33-kDa protein351100 + Intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein364 Open table in a new tab When urea/NaCl-washed PSII membranes lacking the three extrinsic proteins were incubated at 0 °C in the dark, two out of the four manganese per PSII released after 48 h (Fig. 3) (20Ono T. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 281-286Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the native 33-kDa protein effectively suppressed the release of manganese (Fig. 3). Reconstitution of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein also suppressed the manganese release equally effectively (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the cross-linked 33-kDa protein still retained its ability to stabilize binding of the manganese cluster. To examine the changes on structural flexibility of the 33-kDa protein by intramolecular cross-linking, the far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra (CD spectra) of the native and the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein were measured at high temperatures (Fig. 4). The secondary structure of the native 33-kDa protein was appreciably affected at 60 °C and its random conformation appeared at 70 °C (Fig. 4 A). On the contrary, the CD spectral changes of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein required much higher temperature than those of the native 33-kDa protein, and the random conformation of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein appeared at 90 °C (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that structural flexibility of the 33-kDa protein was significantly decreased by intramolecular cross-linking. Fig. 5 shows the peptide maps of the native (A) and the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein (B) which had been digested with lysyl endopeptidase and separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Peptide peaks 2, 3, 4, and 6 drastically decreased and new peptide peaks A and B appeared by intramolecular cross-linking. Therefore, peaks A and B are expected to be the peptides containing intramolecularly cross-linked sites. To identify the intramolecularly cross-linked sites, N-terminal amino acid sequences and molecular masses of these two peptides were determined (Table II). Two amino acid sequences were detected by Edman degradation of peptide peak A, which completely agreed with amino acid sequences from Tyr45-Lys49 and Ile237-Gln247 of the 33-kDa protein, in which only Lys48 and Glu246 were not detected. Peptide peak A had a measured mass of 1927.10 Da, which is consistent with the predicted mass of Tyr45-Lys49 plus Ile237-Gln247 minus one molecule of H2O (1927.18 Da). These results clearly indicate that peptide peak A is the intramolecularly cross-linked product between the amino group of Lys48 in Tyr45-Lys49and the carboxyl group of Glu246 in Ile237-Gln247. The N-terminal sequence of peptide peak B agreed with Arg5-Lys20 of the 33-kDa protein, in which Glu10 and Lys14 were not detected. A measured mass of peptide peak B (1968.00 Da) was consistent with the predicted mass of Arg5-Lys20 minus one molecule of H2O (1968.20 Da). These indicate that peptide peak B is the intramolecularly cross-linked product between the carboxyl group of Glu10 and the amino group of Lys14 in Arg5-Lys20. These results indicate that amino acid residues between Lys48 and Glu246 and between Glu10 and Lys14 are closely associated with each other through electrostatic interaction.Table IIN-terminal amino acid sequences and molecular masses of the peptide peaks A and B shown in Fig. 5 and their assignmentsPeptide peakAmino acid sequenceMolecular massMeasuredCalculated 45 49AY T A (K) K237 ∣——————∣ 2471927.101927.18I E G V W Y A Q L (E) Q 5 20BR L T Y D (E) I Q S (K) T Y L E V K1968.001968.20∣—————∣ Open table in a new tab Peptide peaks 2, 3, 4, and 6, which were significantly decreased by intramolecular cross-linking, were found to be Gly160-Lys186, Ile237-Gln247, Thr15-Lys44, and Leu77-Lys101, respectively, by mass spectrometeric analysis (data not shown). Peptide peaks 3 and 4 are involved in the intramolecularly cross-linked peptide peaks A and B. The cross-linked products containing peptide peaks 2 and 6 were not, however, found on the peptide map of lysyl endopeptidase digests of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein (Fig. 5 B). It is likely that these cross-linked products were retained in and not eluted from the reversed-phased HPLC column. Thus, in addition to the intramolecular cross-linking between Lys48 and Glu246 and between Glu10 and Lys14, intramolecular cross-linkings containing the peptide of Gly160-Lys186 and Leu77-Lys101 seem to be formed. The present results demonstrated that the rebinding and manganese-stabilizing capabilities of the 33-kDa protein were retained but its reactivating ability was lost by intramolecular cross-linking of the protein with EDC. This implies that different mechanisms exist for the stabilization of manganese binding and reactivation of oxygen evolution; the latter but not the former was impaired by the intramolecular cross-linking. Several possibilities may be considered as responsible for loss of the reactivating ability, e.g. an inhibition of homodimerization of the 33-kDa protein which might be essential for its functioning, a loss of the function of the 33-kDa protein in maintaining binding of Ca2+ and/or Cl− (37Chen C. Kazimir J. Cheniae G.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13511-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and a suppression of conformational changes of the 33-kDa protein possibly accompanying its binding to PSII. Our present results support the hypothesis that a conformational change occurred accompanying binding of the 33-kDa protein, and this conformational change was suppressed by the intramolecular cross-linking, since the secondary structure of the protein was significantly stabilized against heat treatment by intramolecular cross-linking (Fig. 4). This suggests that the structural flexibility of the 33-kDa protein was remarkably reduced. In addition, while urea/NaCl-washed PSII membranes reconstituted with the native 33-kDa protein completely rebound the 23-kDa protein, the PSII reconstituted with the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein scarcely rebound the 23-kDa protein (data not shown). Since the 23-kDa protein cannot directly associate with the 33-kDa protein in solution (24Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 315-321Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), these results suggest that binding of the 33-kDa protein to PSII alters the conformation of the protein itself which is essential for binding of the 23-kDa protein. The occurrence of a structural change of the protein is consistent with results of pH-dependent structural changes (38Shutova T. Irrgang K.-D. Shubin V. Klimov V.V. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6350-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), effects of genetic or chemical modification of its disulfide-forming cysteines (39Betts S.D. Ross J.R. Hall U.K. Pichersky E. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Tanaka S. Kawata Y. Wada K. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7188-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or the effects of conformational constrains resulting from other amino acid substitutions (41Betts S.D. Ross J.R. Pichersky E. Yocum C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6302-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From the present and previous results, however, we cannot determine whether the conformational change of the 33-kDa protein itself or a further structural rearrangement of intrinsic PSII proteins allosterically induced by binding of the 33-kDa protein is responsible for the reactivation of oxygen evolution. The possible structural changes of intrinsic PSII proteins upon binding of the 33-kDa protein have been previously reported; for example, we recently showed that removal of the 33-kDa protein makes the C-terminal region of CP43 accessible to trypsin, thus suggesting that removal of the protein at the lumenal side induces a conformational change of the CP43 protein at the stromal side (42Enami I. Tohri A. Kamo M. Ohta H. Shen J.-R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An effect on properties of the acceptor side of PSII upon either biochemical removal of the 33-kDa protein (43Vass I. Ono T. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 224-235Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or genetic deletion of the psbO gene encoding the 33-kDa protein (44Vass I. Cook K.M. Deak Z. Mayes S.M. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 195-201Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Burnap R.L. Qian M. Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13712-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) has also been reported based on thermoluminescence and fluorescence measurements. Based on these results, we propose the following mechanism for reactivation of oxygen evolution by binding of the 33-kDa protein: binding of the 33-kDa protein to PSII alters the conformation of the 33-kDa protein itself which allosterically results in structural changes of intrinsic PSII proteins ligating the manganese atoms, leading to formation of a functional conformation of the manganese cluster and then the reactivation of oxygen evolution. Although the primary structure of the 33-kDa protein has been determined in various species of plants (46Miura K. Shimazu T. Motoki A. Kanai S. Hirano M. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), there is only very limited information concerning the tertiary structure of the protein. Two Cys residues (Cys28and Cys51) of the protein form a disulfide bond important for maintaining the functional structure of the protein (40Tanaka S. Kawata Y. Wada K. Hamaguchi K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7188-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 45Burnap R.L. Qian M. Shen J.-R. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13712-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 47Tanaka S. Wada K. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 17: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The secondary structural analysis of the 33-kDa protein in solution by far-UV CD spectroscopy revealed that the protein contains a large proportion of β-sheet and a relatively small amount of α-helical structure (48Xu Q. Bricker T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the positive charges of ε-amino groups on Lys4, Lys20, Lys66 or Lys76, Lys101, Lys105, Lys130, Lys159, Lys186 and one or two Lys in Lys230-Lys236 in the 33-kDa protein electrostatically interact with negative charges on PSII intrinsic proteins (27Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This implies that these Lys residues are located on the surface of the protein which interacts with PSII intrinsic proteins when it binds to PSII. The present study revealed that the positive charges of the amino group of Lys48 and Lys14electrostatically associate with the negative charges of the carboxyl group of Glu246 and Glu10, respectively, when the protein is free in solution. This is very interesting, since we have reported that the carboxyl group of Glu246 or C terminus electrostatically interacts with the amino group of Lys190 of the 33-kDa protein when the protein is associated with PSII (49Ohta H. Yoshida N. Sano M. Hirano M. Nakazato K. Enami I. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 2. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 361-364Google Scholar). This indicates that the carboxyl group in the C-terminal region of the 33-kDa protein electrostatically interacts with different amino groups, depending on whether the protein is free in solution or binds to PSII, which again suggests that the 33-kDa protein alters its conformation upon binding. Fig. 6 summarizes the localization of amino acid residues interacting with each other in the spinach 33-kDa protein which have been determined in the present and previous studies (27Miura T. Shen J.-R. Takahashi S. Kamo M. Nakamura E. Ohta H. Kamei A. Inoue Y. Domae N. Takio K. Nakazato K. Inoue Y. Enami I. J. Biol.

Amino acids associated with each other through electrostatic interaction or disulfide bond are connected with a line when the protein is free in solution and with a dotted line when the protein binds to PSII. Domains involving Lys residues which are located in the regions interacting with PS II intrinsic proteins areboxed. These results provide an important information for the tertiary structure of the 33-kDa protein.

This pathway has been regarded as restricted to prokaryotic organisms but is an important source of energy to the primitive protozoan Giardia intestinalis. In this paper we report the cloning and expression of the arginine deiminase gene from this parasite. Degenerate oligonucleotides based on amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides from the purified protein were used to amplify a portion of the arginine deiminase gene. This was then used as a probe to screen HindIII and PstI “mini” libraries to obtain two overlapping clones that contained the arginine deiminase gene.

Giardia intestinalis is one of the most commonly transmitted intestinal pathogens in the world. There are two stages in the life cycle, both well adapted to two different, hostile environments. Infection is most often by ingestion of the cyst from a contaminated water or food supply. Excystation is induced by passage through the stomach, resulting in the emergence of the motile trophozoite form, which colonizes the upper small intestine and causes the symptoms of giardiasis, including vomiting and diarrhea, by an as yet unknown mechanism. Completion of the life cycle occurs when trophozoites are carried downstream by the intestinal fluid and then encyst, followed by emergence from the host. Current treatment against giardial infection is problematic, due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains and lack of compliance. Hence there is a need for new and specific drugs against infection. In addition to being a major health burden, G. intestinalishas recently been described as the “missing link” between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Kabnick K.S. Peattie D.A. Am. Sci. 1991; 79: 34-43Google Scholar). Therefore Giardia is an important tool for the study of the evolution of the complex nature of the eukaryotic cell. Metabolism in Giardia, for example, is indicative of the primitive nature of this organism. InGiardia, the arginine dihydrolase (ADH) 1The abbreviations used are: ADH, arginine dihydrolase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide(s); bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix assisted laser desorption-time of flight; CHEF, contour-clamped homogeneous electric field. 1The abbreviations used are: ADH, arginine dihydrolase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide(s); bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix assisted laser desorption-time of flight; CHEF, contour-clamped homogeneous electric field. pathway is an important source of energy, with arginine the preferential fuel used in the early and most proliferative stages of in vitro growth (2Edwards M.R. Schofield P.J. O'Sullivan W.J. Costello M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This pathway has been reported in only two other eukaryotes,Trichomonas vaginalis (3Linstead D. Cranshaw M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Tritrichomonas fetus (4Yarlett N. Lindmark D.G. Goldberg B. Ali Moharrami M. Bacchi C.J. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1994; 41: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), both also placed on early branches of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree (5Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The ADH pathway is normally confined to the prokaryotic kingdom, where it provides both a source of energy and nitrogen (6Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway consists of three enzymatic steps, involving arginine deiminase, ornithine transcarbamolyase, and carbamate kinase, with ATP production at the final enzymatic step as follows: arginine → citrulline → ornithine + carbamyl phosphate → CO2 + NH4+ + ATP. The activities of all the arginine dihydrolase pathway enzymes have been demonstrated in Giardia (7Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Matthews J. Wilson J.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with carbamate kinase being the most active enzyme yet reported in cell-free extracts. The activity of ornithine transcarbamolyase, the least active enzyme in the pathway, is approximately 5-fold higher than the reported activities of some glycolytic enzymes (7Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Matthews J. Wilson J.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Kranz P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An arginine-ornithine exchange transporter has been described in Giardia that has properties similar to arginine transporters found in some prokaryotes that utilize the ADH pathway (9Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The function of the pathway in intact trophozoites has been demonstrated in metabolic flux experiments by measuring the release of radiolabeled CO2 from [guanidino-14C]arginine (7Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Matthews J. Wilson J.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These are all properties consistent with the ADH pathway representing a major metabolic capacity of the protozoan. We are interested in characterizing the first enzyme in the pathway, arginine deiminase, which catalyzes the irreversible conversion of arginine to citrulline, primarily as a candidate for future drug design. Very few sequences of arginine deiminase are available from genome data bases, and there is very little homology between these published sequences, which prevents the cloning of the arginine deiminase gene from Giardia from degenerate oligonucleotides. We have recently reported the purification of arginine deiminase from Giardia and the sequence of five tryptic peptides (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the first report of the isolation, characterization, and overexpression of the arginine deiminase gene from a eukaryotic organism, and we suggest that it may be an attractive chemotherapeutic target against giardial infection. G. intestinalistrophozoites, Portland I strain, were cultured as described previously (11Knodler L.A. Edwards M.R. Schofield P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Encystation of trophozoites was as described previously (12Que X. Svard S.G. Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Aley S.B. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). G. intestinalis genomic DNA was prepared by the method described by Yee and Dennis (13Yee J. Dennis P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7539-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by cesium chloride equilibrium density centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated using RNAZol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), and cDNA was synthesized as described previously (12Que X. Svard S.G. Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Aley S.B. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Degenerate sense and antisense oligonucleotides were derived from tryptic peptides obtained from the purified giardial arginine deiminase (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Table I) and synthesized on a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer. PCR conditions were as described in the manufacturer's protocol for Tthpolymerase (Biotech International, Australia) with 500 ng of genomic DNA. Annealing was at either 45 or 50 °C and extension at 72 °C for 40 cycles. PCR products were treated with Klenow fragment and ligated into the SmaI site of the pTZ18 vector. For identification of the polyadenylation addition position, PCR of trophozoite cDNA was performed with a sense oligonucleotide ADI 1840 (nts 1840–1859 of the giardial arginine deiminase sequence) and an oligo(dT) primer SGS-10 (CGAGCTGCGTCGACAGGC(T)17) (12Que X.

The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for sequencing.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used in PCR for amplification of a portion of the arginine deiminase gene and the tryptic peptides from which they were designedPeptideOligonucleotideNucleotide sequence1415′-GTI GA (A/G) GGI GCI CCN GCN TA-3′25′-GTA IGC IGG NGC NCC (T/C)TC-3′2335′-GCI TA(C/T) GGI (C/T)TI TA(C/T) CA(A/G) AA-3′45′-CTT (T/C)TG (A/G)TA IAG NCC (G/A)TA-3′2755′-GTI GA(C/T) GA(A/G) TGG AT(A/C/T) GA(C/T) GT-3′65′-AC (G/A) TC IAT CCA (T/C)TC (G/A)TC-3′ Open table in a new tab Trophozoite genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested to completion with either BamHI,EcoRI, HindIII, or PstI, and the resulting fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gels. The DNA was transferred to Hybond N+membrane (Amersham Corp.) and probed overnight at 55 °C with a randomly labeled (MegaPrime Kit, Amersham Corp.) 600-bp PCR product, amplified with oligonucleotides 4 and 5. Total RNA (15 μg) from trophozoites and encysting cells was separated on a 1.3% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.9% (v/v) formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridized overnight at 60 °C with a randomly labeled (MegaPrime, Amersham Corp.) 1.5-kb HindIII/PstI fragment from the arginine deiminase gene. Poly(A+) mRNA was isolated from 100 μg of total trophozoite RNA using the Dynabeads oligo(dT) Purification Sytem (Dynal). Total RNA and mRNA were similarly separated on 1.0% (w/v) agarose containing 7.5% (v/v) formaldehyde. The total RNA and mRNA were transferred onto nylon membrane and probed with the full-lengthKpnI/BamHI ADI fragment. Giardia chromosome blots, prepared from chromosome-sized DNA molecules separated by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis (14Upcroft J.A. Healey A. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1993; 23: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were generously supplied by Dr. Jacqueline Upcroft (Queensland Institute of Medical Research). Southern hybridization was performed using the full-length BamHI/KpnI fragment of the ADI gene at 60 °C. PstI-restricted DNA fragments of approximately 3.2 kb were excised from an agarose gel, electroeluted, and ligated into pTZ19 vector that had been digested with PstI and dephosphorylated. Transformation was into theEscherichia coli strain JM101. Colonies were transferred to Hybond N+ membrane and hybridized overnight at 60 °C with the 600-bp amplicon that had been randomly labeled (MegaPrime, Amersham Corp.). This procedure was repeated withHindIII-restricted fragments of approximately 3.1 kb. The clones chosen from the PstI and HindIII “mini” libraries were subjected to exonuclease III digestion according to the Erase-A-Base kit instructions (Promega). DNA sequencing was with the Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Corp.) or the Pharmacia T7 sequencing kit. The ANGIS (Australian National Genomic Information Service) network was used for computer analysis of sequence data. A 1.8-kbKpnI/BamHI fragment representing the entire arginine deiminase coding sequence was amplified by PCR fromGiardia genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The KpnI/BamHI fragment was subsequently cloned into the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen). The recombinant expression shuttle (pQE-30-ADI) was transformed into E. coli M15(pREP 4) cells (Qiagen) and grown in LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Induction of expression with IPTG appeared toxic to the E. coli, thus non-inducing conditions were used for protein expression. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking for 5.5 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 2000 × g. The pelleted cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (1.8 mmKH2PO4, 5 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.4, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl) and resuspended in phosphate buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm leupeptin). Cell lysates were prepared by sonication on ice at a concentration of 1 g of cells to 5 ml of buffer using a Branson Sonifier 250 (40% duty cycle, output 2–3, 2-min bursts). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 40 min at 27,000 ×g to remove particulate material. Purification of the recombinant protein was performed using a His-trapR chelating column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 ml of start buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The histidine-tagged recombinant protein was absorbed onto the column and was washed twice with 10 and 16 ml of start buffer containing 10 and 50 mm imidazole, respectively. The recombinant protein was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mNaCl, 500 mm imidazole) in 1-ml fractions. Purified recombinant and total cellular protein were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Recombinant arginine deiminase activity was measured by the colorimetric determination of citrulline formation (9Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Inhibition of recombinant arginine deiminase activity by various arginine analogues was performed, and the results were compared with their previously reported effects on the native enzyme (9Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies were in the presence or absence of potential inhibitors at 10 mmconcentration with 1 mm arginine, 3.5 μg/ml of protein, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, in the assay. SDS-PAGE was performed in Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.3, on 10% (w/v) separating gels with a 4% (w/v) stacking according to the method of Laemmli (12Que X. Svard S.G. Meng T.C. Hetsko M.L. Aley S.B. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Novex) at 25 V for 90 min. Transfer membranes were blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and the membrane was probed with Nickel-NTA conjugate coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Qiagen) at a dilution of 1:1000. The blot was developed using 5% nitro blue tetrazolium chloride in 70% dimethylformamide + 5% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in dimethylformamide. Native molecular mass of the active recombinant protein was determined by gel filtration using a Smart Chromatography System (Pharmacia). Tryptic digestion of purified recombinant protein was performed using modified sequencing grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). Digestion was carried out in a 1-ml reaction volume containing 400 μg of purified recombinant enzyme, 10 μg of trypsin, 2 m urea, 0.1 m(NH4)2CO3, 50 mmglycine at 37 °C for 17.5 h. The peptides were separated from salts using a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters, Millipore). The salts were first eluted with 4 ml of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), and then the peptides were eluted in 2 ml of solvent B (0.09% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile in water). The eluted peptides were concentrated to 100 pmol/μl. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using 10-pmol fractions spotted onto a matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxyceramide) which was then subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer analysis using a Laser MAT 2000 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Finnigan). Computer analysis of data was with MacProMass from PSIEX. Oligonucleotide primers designed from tryptic peptides of the purified arginine deiminase were used in PCR to amplify a portion of the target gene. Since the order of the tryptic peptides in the giardial enzyme was unknown, it was necessary to test all possible combinations of sense oligonucleotides from one peptide with antisense oligonucleotides from the other two peptides in PCR, i.e.six oligonucleotide combinations in all (Table I). Only one oligonucleotide combination gave consistent results in PCR (results not shown). Oligonucleotides 4 and 5 gave a single PCR product of approximately 600 bp. The clone had oligonucleotides 5 and 4 perfectly matched to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the amplicon, respectively. Additionally, an amino sequence that could be a possible match to tryptic peptide 6 (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was present toward the N-terminal end of the translated PCR amplicon. This 600-bp amplicon was used in Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA, with a unique fragment detected for each restriction digest. The fragment sizes detected were 13.5 kb for BamHI, 6.1 kb forEcoRI, 3.1 kb for HindIII, and 3.2 kb forPstI (results not shown). A mini library from 3.2-kbPstI-restricted fragments was constructed and probed with the 600-bp PCR amplicon. Sequences of two positively hybridizing clones P6/19B and P7/19B, representing the PstI fragment inserted into pTZ18 in both orientations, were determined by overlapping DNA fragments generated by exonuclease III digestion. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame from nt 1680 of P6/19B and truncated at the 3′-end of the insert. This open reading frame contained amino acids encoded in the originally amplified PCR fragment and an additional sequence identical to tryptic peptide 17 (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To obtain the 3′-end of the arginine deiminase gene, a HindIII mini library was screened, and two positively hybridizing clones were identified and designated HE1/19 and HE9/19. Additional sequence of the arginine deiminase gene was obtained by “primer walking” on both strands using oligonucleotides designed from known sequence. An amino acid sequence consistent with tryptic peptide 14 (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was located in this additional sequence. Thus all five tryptic peptides derived from the purified enzyme (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are present in the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame. Approximately 3700 bp of sequence was obtained from thePstI- and HindIII-derived clones, of which 1743 bp were an open reading frame encoding arginine deiminase. The deduced amino acid sequence is presented in Fig. 1. Restriction sites for HindIII and PstI and the location of oligonucleotides 4 and 5 that generated the original 600-bp PCR product are indicated. Amino acid sequences consistent with the tryptic peptides from the purified enzyme (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are shown in bold. The 1743-nt open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 64,090 Da, which is in close agreement with the reported molecular mass of 64,000 Da determined by SDS-PAGE of the purified arginine deiminase from G. intestinalis (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A number of motifs identifying possible regulatory elements involved in gene transcription in G. intestinalis were located in the upstream and downstream regions of the arginine deiminase gene. These regulatory elements are underlined in Fig. 1. In most giardial genes there is a short AT-rich region ending at the ATG translation start codon, which has been proposed to be a promoter element associated with RNA polymerase II transcription (16Yee J. Dennis P.P. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 759-767Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The arginine deiminase gene has such an AT-rich element adjacent to the start codon (−16 AAAAAAATCCTAGTAC −1). Additionally, a second motif, with the consensus CAAAT, ATTTG, or abbreviated forms, has also been suggested as a regulatory element (16Yee J. Dennis P.P. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 759-767Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and occurs a number of times in the region upstream of many giardial genes, including arginine deiminase (Fig. 1). The sequence AGTPuoAAPyd is proposed to serve as a polyadenylation signal in Giardia (17Peattie D.A. Alonso R.A. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2323-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and such a sequence (AGTGAAT) is located in the 3′-untranslated region of the arginine deiminase gene, 3 nts downstream from the TGA termination codon. By using an oligonucleotide specific for the arginine deiminase gene and an oligo(dT) in PCR with trophozoite cDNA, polyadenylation of the arginine deiminase transcript was found to occur 10 nts downstream of this heptanucleotide sequence (Fig. 1). Total RNA from trophozoites and encysting cells (6 and 24 h in encysting medium) was subjected to Northern blot hybridization with a 1.5-kb HindIII/PstI fragment of the arginine deiminase gene. A band of approximately 1.8 kb was detected (Fig. 2, panel A). Since no introns have been reported for giardial genes to date, this transcript size is in agreement with the predicted size of the transcribed gene sequence plus a polyadenylation tract. The transcript levels for arginine deiminase were of comparable abundance in trophozoites and in 6- and 24-h encysting cells. Levels of mRNA for an internal control whose transcript levels show no developmental variation 2L. A. Knodler, E. O. Sekyere, T. S. Stewart, P. J. Schofield, and M. R. Edwards, unpublished observations. ascertained equal loading of RNA for each condition. Similar results were obtained when trophozoite poly(A+) mRNA was subjected to Northern blot hybridizations (Fig. 2, panel B). Chromosome-sized DNA molecules were separated using CHEF gel electrophoresis and subjected to Southern hybridization with the 1.8-kb BamHI/KpnIADI fragment. The ADI gene was located on chromosome 5 (14Upcroft J.A. Healey A. Upcroft P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1993; 23: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of Giardia (Fig. 3). Sequence information for the arginine deiminase gene is available from seven sources to date, all prokaryotic organisms, Mycoplasma arginini (18Kondo K. Sone H. Yoshida H. Toida T. Kanatani K.

A ClustalW alignment of these amino acid sequences with the giardial sequence is shown in Fig. 4. The giardial protein is the largest reported to date, with the majority of the additional amino acid sequence occurring as a C-terminal extension compared with the other deiminases. Arginine deiminase from G. intestinalis was most similar to the H. salinariumenzyme with 26% identity and 50% similarity between the two sequences. The giardial arginine deiminase gene was cloned into the expression vector pQE 30 and transformed in E. coliM15[pREP 4] cells. Clones containing the pQE 30-ADI construct were isolated, and the recombinant protein was expressed under non-inducing conditions, since induction with IPTG was toxic to the host cell. The active 6x histidine-tagged recombinant protein was purified in a single step using a His-TrapR(Pharmacia) chelating column. This single step resulted in a purification of 33-fold with 67% of enzyme activity being recovered (Table II). Overall 2 mg of the recombinant arginine deiminase could be purified from 96 mg of starting material. To maintain enzyme activity for longer periods the elution buffer was exchanged for 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol. E. coli containing the expression vector alone had no detectable arginine deiminase activity.Table IIPurification scheme for recombinant arginine deiminase from G. intestinalisPurification stepTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunits/mg protein-fold%Crude extract961095His-Trap1.9236.53367 Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE analysis indicated the purified recombinant protein had a molecular mass of 66 kDa (Fig. 5). The native molecular mass of the active recombinant enzyme was determined to be 140 kDa by gel filtration, indicating that the active recombinant enzyme is a dimer. Western analysis with a nickel-NTA/alkaline phosphatase conjugate that binds to the histidine tag identified the purified recombinant protein and a single band from an E. coli extract expressing the pQE-30-ADI construct (Fig. 5). Tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The experimental mass spectrum corresponded to the mass profiles predicted for the amino acid sequence data of the recombinant arginine deiminase (Fig. 6). A total of 19 mass peaks that were observed could account for more than 50% of the putative sequence of the recombinant protein. Inhibition of recombinant arginine deiminase activity by various arginine analogues at a concentration of 10 mm in the presence of 1 mm arginine was assessed. The arginine analogue inhibition profile for the recombinant enzyme (Table III) and the native enzyme (9Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was comparable.Table IIIComparison of the inhibition of recombinant and native arginine deiminase by a number of arginine analoguesArginine analogueEnzyme activityNative enzyme3-aResults were previously reported (9).Recombinant enzyme% controlAlpha amino group blocked or absent 4-Guanidinobutyric acid9690Alpha carboxyl group absent Agmatine5554 Putrescine5468Guanidino group altered or absent Lysine10097 Ornithine2423Side chain altered Canavanine2910 Homoarginine16253-a Results were previously reported (9Knodler L.A.

Open table in a new tab G. intestinalis as a representative of one of the earliest diverging branches of the eukaryotic tree (5Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) has retained many prokaryotic features. We have previously demonstrated that the arginine transport system in Giardia is supportive of its position as a transition between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the metabolism of arginine also reflects the primitive nature of this parasite. Here we report the cloning and expression of the first enzyme involved in the energy-producing catabolism of arginine via the ADH pathway, arginine deiminase. This is the first sequence available for this gene from a eukaryotic organism. The arginine deiminase gene family appears to be poorly conserved. This prevented the use of degenerate oligonucleotides based on consensus sequences to obtain a fragment of the arginine deiminase gene. Instead primers were designed from tryptic peptides obtained from purified arginine deiminase that we have recently reported (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is the first example of the isolation of a gene from G. intestinalis using this approach. The amino acid sequence homology of the giardial arginine deiminase was highest with the deiminase fromH. salinarium (accession number X80931) (50% similarity). The similarity with P. aeruginosa (22Baur H. Luethi E. Stalon V. Mercenier A. Haas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and M. hominis (21Harasawa R. Koshimizu K. Kitagawa M. Asada K. Kato I. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 36: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was 49 and 46%, respectively. It seems that within species the sequences are well conserved, for example there is 82% similarity between the M. arginini (18Kondo K. Sone H. Yoshida H. Toida T. Kanatani K. Hong Y. Tanaka J. Mol. Gen. Genetics. 1990; 221: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and M. hominis (21Harasawa R. Koshimizu K. Kitagawa M. Asada K. Kato I. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 36: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) sequences. However, when comparing sequences between species, the similarity is markedly reduced, with 54% similarity between the M. arginini (18Kondo K. Sone H. Yoshida H. Toida T. Kanatani K. Hong Y. Tanaka J. Mol. Gen. Genetics. 1990; 221: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and P. aeruginosa(22Baur H. Luethi E. Stalon V. Mercenier A. Haas D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) deiminases for example. There are three small but well conserved regions common to all arginine deiminase sequences (Fig. 4) as follows: at amino acid residues 173–176 (F(M/T/Q)R(D/E)), 226–231 ((I/L/V)EGGD(F/V)), and 280–284 (MHLD(C/T)). Presumably these conserved regions are important in enzyme structure and functioning. However, these conserved regions were not found in the amino acid sequences for other arginine-utilizing or arginine-producing enzymes, including peptidyl-arginine deiminase (EC3.5.3.15), arginase (EC 3.5.3.1), argininosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.1), arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19), and nitric-oxide synthase (EC 1.14.23). This suggests that residues distantly located in the primary structure of arginine deiminase may be involved in the arginine binding site and catalysis. To date, no arginine binding motif has been identified. Giardial arginine deiminase gene was cloned into the expression vector pQE-30 carrying the 6x histidine tag at the 5′-end. The recombinant protein was expressed by transformed E. coli under non-inducing conditions, since induction with IPTG was highly toxic to the expressing cells. It is likely that both the expression and function of the native enzyme are highly controlled, as uncontrolled expression of the highly soluble and active arginine deiminase would compromise protein synthesis and other biochemical processes requiring arginine. We have previously shown that the intracellular arginine pool in Giardia trophozoites is almost undetectably low (11Knodler L.A. Edwards M.R. Schofield P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Non-inducing conditions allowed expression at a level that was tolerated by the host cells. A one-step purification procedure resulted in the isolation of homogeneous recombinant arginine deiminase. The activity of the recombinant protein was comparable with that of the purified native arginine deiminase (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the patterns of inhibition by various arginine analogues were similar for both the recombinant and native enzymes. A major advantage was that the recombinant enzyme was much more stable than the native enzyme, which loses all activity within 8 h of isolation (10Knodler L.A. Schofield P.J. Gooley A.A. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Further characterization by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of a tryptic digest of the purified recombinant arginine deiminase showed a mass spectrum consisting of peaks corresponding to mass:charge ratios of specific tryptic peptides of the recombinant arginine deiminase. The only mass peaks that were observed and could not be accounted for by the tryptic hydrolysis of the recombinant protein were a small peak (m/z1622.0) and the highest mass peak (m/z 3853.8). The regions of sequence that were not observed as tryptic peptides may be accounted for by incomplete hydrolysis, by the generation of small peptides (m/z <750) or by losses of polar peptides during desalting. The approach provides a quick and simple method for confirming the sequence of an expressed protein. Although a peptide containing the N-terminal 6x histidine tag was not observed, the presence of the tag was demonstrated by Western analysis (Fig. 5) and by the effectiveness of the one-step purification procedure. Thus it appears that the physical and kinetic properties of the recombinant and native enzymes are comparable. In addition to being specific for the parasite, it is desirable that a new chemotherapeutic agent has minimal deleterious effects on the human host. For this reason, metabolic pathways and cell components that are unique to a parasite, or significantly different to those of the host, are desirable targets for future drug design. In this paper, we present a potential site for chemotherapeutic attack against giardiasis. Arginine deiminase is not found in humans and is involved in an important energy producing pathway in Giardia. Availability of large quantities of recombinant enzyme should pave the way for future studies on the regulation and mechanism of arginine deiminase action in Giardia. Furthermore, availability of the recombinant protein will facilitate the pursuit of detailed knowledge of enzyme structure that is required for designing synthetic competitors of this enzyme to combat giardial infection."

Because interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a cytokine with known antiproliferative and antitumoral activity, binds with high affinity to the heparan sulfate side chains of perlecan, we investigated the activity of IFN-γ on perlecan gene expression and cell growth in colon carcinoma cells. We found that IFN-γ rapidly and efficiently blocked perlecan gene expression with concurrent growth suppression, a phenomenon that was independent of a functional p21WAF1/CIP1. These effects were transcriptionally mediated, did not require new protein synthesis, and were fully reversible. Moreover, we found these IFN-γ-induced effects to be generalizable because they could be reproduced in a variety of cells with various histogenetic backgrounds. The transcriptional repression of the perlecan gene required intact Stat1 protein, and these effects were likely mediated by Stat1-binding sites in the distal promoter region. Thus, the IFN-γ-mediated transcriptional repression of perlecan may represent a novel antitumoral effect of this cytokine through which it eliminates a powerful angiogenic stimulus.

Thus, the IFN-γ-mediated transcriptional repression of perlecan may represent a novel antitumoral effect of this cytokine through which it eliminates a powerful angiogenic stimulus. Proteoglycans play key roles during inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cancer growth primarily through their ability to act as modifiers of growth factors and by actively participating in the fine tuning of receptor/ligand interactions (1Couchman J.R. Woods A. Roberts D.D. Mecham R.P. Cell Surface and Extracellular Glycoconjugates. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 33-81Crossref Google Scholar). An important member of the proteoglycan gene family is perlecan, a ubiquitous heparan sulfate proteoglycan that has been involved in the control of cell proliferation, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis (2Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The complex structure of perlecan protein core (3Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its widespread distribution (4Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J.

Cytochem. 1995; 43: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that this gene product is involved in several fundamental biological processes. For instance, increased perlecan levels are found in metastatic melanomas (6Cohen I.R. Murdoch A.D. Naso M.F. Marchetti D. Berd D. Iozzo R.V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5771-5774PubMed Google Scholar) and correlate with a more aggressive behavior (7Timar J. Ladanyi A. Lapis K. Moczar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar). In tumor xenografts induced by subcutaneous injection of human prostate carcinoma cells in nude mice, human-derived perlecan was deposited along the basement membrane of newly formed murine vessels (2Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, perlecan may act as a scaffold upon which proliferating capillaries grow and eventually form functional blood vessels (2Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Indeed, perlecan binds basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GAS, IFN-γ-activated site; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; p21, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TBS, Tris borate buffer; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GAS, IFN-γ-activated site; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; p21, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TBS, Tris borate buffer; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s).

Rapraeger A.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1443-1455PubMed Google Scholar) and acts as a low affinity receptor for FGF-2 thereby promoting angiogenesis (10Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). FGF-2 binds directly to the heparan sulfate side chains located in the N-terminal Domain I, and its release by proteolytic processing (11Whitelock J.M. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Underwood P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) may represent a biological mechanism by which dynamic molecules can be functionally disengaged at the active site of tissue remodeling and tumor invasion (12Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this view, reduction of endogenous perlecan levels by stable antisense transfection causes a marked suppression of autocrine and paracrine function of FGF-2 in melanoma cells (13Aviezer D. Iozzo R.V. Noonan D.M. Yayon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1938-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, antisense expression of perlecan cDNA induces tumorigenesis in fibrosarcoma cells and a faster appearance of tumors in nude mice (14Mathiak M. Yenisey C. Grant D.S. Sharma B. Iozzo R.V. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2130-2136PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular context is important in mediating the functions of perlecan.A systematic study of murine embryogenesis has revealed that perlecan expression appears early in tissues of vasculogenesis such as the heart primordium and major blood vessels (15Handler M. Yurchenco P.D. Iozzo R.V. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Subsequently, perlecan mRNA levels increase, and this correlates with the onset of tissue differentiation of various organs including kidneys, lungs, spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. In adult human tissues, perlecan epitopes are distributed along all vascularized organs, including the sinusoidal spaces of the liver, spleen, and lymphoreticular organs (4Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The latter suggests that perlecan may play a role in the normal development and homeostasis of lymphoid organs.In addition to binding a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, perlecan binds to transforming growth factor-β and is transcriptionally induced by this cytokine (16Iozzo R.V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5219-5228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and also binds to interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (17Lortat-Jacob H. Kleinman H.K. Grimaud J.-A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with high affinity (Kd= 10−9m) (18Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ is a glycoprotein synthesized primarily by T lymphocytes and is involved in the regulation of the immune response (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). It possesses antiviral, antiproliferative, and antitumoral activity in a number of cells and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the expression of early response genes through the activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar, 20Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). This activation occurs through both Tyr phosphorylation, which is critical for the translocation and binding to the DNA, and Ser/Thr phosphorylation, which is crucial for maximal transcriptional activation (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Upon activation, STAT proteins dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they bind to the IFN-γ activated site (GAS) (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar).Because one of the main goals of our laboratory is to understand how specific cytokines regulate perlecan gene expression, we embarked on a study to determine whether IFN-γ affects perlecan gene expression and, if so, to characterize the mechanism of action. We discovered that IFN-γ concurrently suppressed tumor cell growth and perlecan gene expression. These effects were transcriptionally mediated, did not require new protein synthesis, were fully reversible, and were general since they could be reproduced in a variety of cells with various histogenetic backgrounds. The results also showed that the transcriptional repression of the perlecan gene required a functional Stat1 protein and that these effects were likely mediated by Stat1-binding sites located in the distal promoter region. Thus, the IFN-γ-mediated transcriptional repression of perlecan may represent a novel antitumoral effect of this cytokine through which it eliminates a powerful angiogenic stimulus from the tumor microenvironment. Proteoglycans play key roles during inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cancer growth primarily through their ability to act as modifiers of growth factors and by actively participating in the fine tuning of receptor/ligand interactions (1Couchman J.R. Woods A. Roberts D.D. Mecham R.P. Cell Surface and Extracellular Glycoconjugates. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 33-81Crossref Google Scholar).

Cytochem. 1995; 43: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that this gene product is involved in several fundamental biological processes. For instance, increased perlecan levels are found in metastatic melanomas (6Cohen I.R. Murdoch A.D. Naso M.F. Marchetti D. Berd D. Iozzo R.V. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5771-5774PubMed Google Scholar) and correlate with a more aggressive behavior (7Timar J. Ladanyi A. Lapis K. Moczar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar). In tumor xenografts induced by subcutaneous injection of human prostate carcinoma cells in nude mice, human-derived perlecan was deposited along the basement membrane of newly formed murine vessels (2Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, perlecan may act as a scaffold upon which proliferating capillaries grow and eventually form functional blood vessels (2Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Indeed, perlecan binds basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GAS, IFN-γ-activated site; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; p21, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TBS, Tris borate buffer; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; GAS, IFN-γ-activated site; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; p21, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TBS, Tris borate buffer; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s).

Rapraeger A.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1443-1455PubMed Google Scholar) and acts as a low affinity receptor for FGF-2 thereby promoting angiogenesis (10Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). FGF-2 binds directly to the heparan sulfate side chains located in the N-terminal Domain I, and its release by proteolytic processing (11Whitelock J.M. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Underwood P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) may represent a biological mechanism by which dynamic molecules can be functionally disengaged at the active site of tissue remodeling and tumor invasion (12Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this view, reduction of endogenous perlecan levels by stable antisense transfection causes a marked suppression of autocrine and paracrine function of FGF-2 in melanoma cells (13Aviezer D. Iozzo R.V. Noonan D.M. Yayon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1938-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, antisense expression of perlecan cDNA induces tumorigenesis in fibrosarcoma cells and a faster appearance of tumors in nude mice (14Mathiak M. Yenisey C. Grant D.S. Sharma B. Iozzo R.V. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2130-2136PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular context is important in mediating the functions of perlecan. A systematic study of murine embryogenesis has revealed that perlecan expression appears early in tissues of vasculogenesis such as the heart primordium and major blood vessels (15Handler M. Yurchenco P.D. Iozzo R.V. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Subsequently, perlecan mRNA levels increase, and this correlates with the onset of tissue differentiation of various organs including kidneys, lungs, spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. In adult human tissues, perlecan epitopes are distributed along all vascularized organs, including the sinusoidal spaces of the liver, spleen, and lymphoreticular organs (4Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The latter suggests that perlecan may play a role in the normal development and homeostasis of lymphoid organs. In addition to binding a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, perlecan binds to transforming growth factor-β and is transcriptionally induced by this cytokine (16Iozzo R.V. Pillarisetti J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5219-5228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and also binds to interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (17Lortat-Jacob H. Kleinman H.K. Grimaud J.-A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with high affinity (Kd= 10−9m) (18Lortat-Jacob H. Grimaud J.-A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ is a glycoprotein synthesized primarily by T lymphocytes and is involved in the regulation of the immune response (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). It possesses antiviral, antiproliferative, and antitumoral activity in a number of cells and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the expression of early response genes through the activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar, 20Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). This activation occurs through both Tyr phosphorylation, which is critical for the translocation and binding to the DNA, and Ser/Thr phosphorylation, which is crucial for maximal transcriptional activation (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Upon activation, STAT proteins dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they bind to the IFN-γ activated site (GAS) (19Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Because one of the main goals of our laboratory is to understand how specific cytokines regulate perlecan gene expression, we embarked on a study to determine whether IFN-γ affects perlecan gene expression and, if so, to characterize the mechanism of action. We discovered that IFN-γ concurrently suppressed tumor cell growth and perlecan gene expression. These effects were transcriptionally mediated, did not require new protein synthesis, were fully reversible, and were general since they could be reproduced in a variety of cells with various histogenetic backgrounds. The results also showed that the transcriptional repression of the perlecan gene required a functional Stat1 protein and that these effects were likely mediated by Stat1-binding sites located in the distal promoter region. Thus, the IFN-γ-mediated transcriptional repression of perlecan may represent a novel antitumoral effect of this cytokine through which it eliminates a powerful angiogenic stimulus from the tumor microenvironment.

Stark (Cleveland Clinic Foundation Research Institute) for generously providing the p21 −/− and Stat1 −/− cell lines, respectively."

To obtain information about the structure and assembly of mammalian type X collagen, we generated recombinant human type collagen X by stable expression of full-length human α1(X) cDNA in the human embryonal kidney cell line HEK293 and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080. Stable clones were obtained secreting recombinant human type X collagen (hrColX) in amounts of 50 μg/ml with α1(X)-chains of apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. Pepsin digestion converted the native protein to a molecule migrating as one band at 65 kDa, while bands of 55 and 43 kDa were generated by trypsin digestion. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against purified hrColX reacted specifically with type X collagen in sections of human fetal growth cartilage. Circular dichroism spectra and trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion experiments of hrColX at increasing temperatures indicated triple helical molecules with a reduced melting temperature of 31 °C as a result of partial underhydroxylation. Ultrastructural analysis of hrColX by rotary shadowing demonstrated rodlike molecules with a length of 130 nm, assembling into aggregates via the globular noncollagenous (NC)-1 domains as reported for chick type X collagen. NC-1 domains generated by collagenase digestion of hrColX migrated as multimers of apparent mass of 40 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, even after reduction and heat denaturation, and gave rise to monomers of 18–20 kDa after treatment with trichloroacetic acid. The NC-1 domains prepared by collagenase digestion comigrated with NC-1 domains prepared as recombinant protein in HEK293 cells, both in the multimeric and monomeric form.

Electron microscopic studies indicate that type X collagen molecules form fine pericellular filaments in vivo in association with type II collagen (21Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 53-62Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), or assemble into a hexagonal meshwork in vitro (22Kwan A.P.L. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Rotary shadowing data show that type X collagen molecules aggregate primarily through their COOH-terminal, nontriple helical NC-1 domains, which are highly hydrophobic (20Schmidt T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Conflicting data, however, have been reported concerning the size of type X collagen extracted from hypertrophic cartilage or isolated from the culture medium of hypertrophic chondrocytes, ranging from 58 to 82 kDa for the intact chains (15Kirsch T. von der Mark K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 575Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol.

Thus, the issue of whether there is processing of type X collagen following biosynthesis and secretion has not been settled. Two studies provide evidence for the secretion of a 70-kDa procollagen form and processing in the culture medium of chicken chondrocytes (24Jimenez S.A. Rao V.H. Reginato A.M. Yankowski R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Kwan A. Sear C.H.J. Grant M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Ayad S. Kwan A.P.L. Grant M.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), while another study did not support processing of type X collagen in cartilage organ cultures within 4 h (19Summers T.A. Irwin M.H. Mayne R. Balian G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 581-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that intact, recombinantly expressed human α1(X) chains migrate with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa significantly above that of α1(X) chains extracted from chondrocytes cultured in alginate, supporting the notion that type X collagen may be processed by chondrocytes but not by HEK293 cells. A number of functions have been proposed for type X collagen. Its role in the structural integrity of the hypertrophic cartilage has become evident from the genetic analysis of patients affected with Schmid type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), a mild autosomal disorder associated with growth plate abnormalities, short stature, and waddling gait (27Warman M.L.

All mutations detected have been located in the NC-1 domain of type X collagen and include single amino acid substitutions, deletions, and premature termination mutations. Furthermore, an essential role for type X collagen in endochondral ossification of hypertrophic cartilage is supported by a study on a mouse made transgenic with a shortened chicken Col10α1 gene. Coexpression of the mutant type X collagen with the endogenous type X collagen resulted in severe alterations in the cartilage growth plate and a hunchback, probably owing to the formation of unstable hybrid molecules (31Jacenko O. Luvalle P. Olsen B.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that type X collagen may be involved in mineralization of cartilage (3Schmid T.M. Cole A.A. Chen Q. Bonen D.K. Luchene L. Linsenmayer T. Yurchenco P. Birk D. Mecham R. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, New York1994: 171-206Crossref Google Scholar). In the developing growth plate and in chondrocyte cultures, type X collagen expression precedes calcification of hypertrophic cartilage (32Iyama K.-I. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Linsenmayer T.F.

Furthermore, type X collagen synthesis is altered in chondrocytes from the rachitic chicken (36Reginato A.M. Shapiro I.M. Lash J.W. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9938-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kwan A.P.L. Dickson I.R. Freemont A.J. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and recently it was shown that purified type X collagen regulates calcium uptake by matrix vesicles isolated from hypertrophic cartilage (38Kirsch T. von der Mark K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative role of type X collagen in mineralization and endochondral ossification of hypertrophic cartilage is supported by mice with a Col10A1 null mutation showing alterations in the endochondral bone trabecular meshwork in the growth plate, as well as a shift of matrix vesicles from the hypertrophic to the resting zone (40Kwan Kin Ming Pang M.K.M. Zou S. Cowan S.K. Kong R.Y.C. Pfordte T. Olsen B.R. Sillence D.O. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A striking feature of type X collagen and their isolated NC-1 domains is the unusual stability of the trimeric molecules which migrate as trimers in SDS-PAGE even after denaturation under reducing conditions (20Schmidt T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Chan D. Cole W.G. Chow C.W. Mundlos S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

However, when pre-α1(X) collagen chains are synthesized with SMCD mutations in the NC-1 domain by cell-free translation and transcription, they are no longer able to from stable trimers in vitro (41Chan D. Cole W.G. Chow C.W. Mundlos S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1747-1753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Chan D. Weng Y.-M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when Col10A1 genes with mutations in the NC-1 domain were transfected into eukaryotic cells, no corresponding proteins were secreted from the cell nor expressed as intracellular protein, indicating failure of the mutated chains to assemble to triple helical molecules, which causes intracellular degradation (42Chan D. Weng Y.-M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutant collagens lacking the amino-terminal NC-2 domain or containing in-frame deletions in the triple helix, however, were secreted as trimeric molecules (42Chan D. Weng Y.-M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the assembly of α1(X) subunits into trimeric molecules and extracellular meshworks as well as the sequences within the NC-1 and NC-2 domains involved in these events are of central importance for our understanding of the structure-function relationship of type X collagen in hypertrophic cartilage. The question remains, however, what the structural requirements (e.g. degree of prolylhydroxylation, completeness of the globular domains) are for the assembly of α1(X) chains to triple helical molecules in vivo, and which mutations would be tolerated for assembly under less dissociating conditions than those applied prior to SDS-gel electrophoresis (41Chan D.

Such studies require the production of sufficient amounts of normal and mutated type X collagen molecules or their NC-1 domains, respectively. Here we describe the preparation of human recombinant type X collagen in amounts sufficient to investigate structure and assembly of this collagen. We show that the recombinant protein expressed in HEK293 or HT1080 cells migrates on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa, while α1(X) extracted from chondrocyte cultures or from cartilage migrate with an apparent mass of 60 kDa. Although the 75-kDa human recombinant type X collagen (hrColX) is partially underhydroxylated, it is secreted, and triple helical molecules with a melting temperature of 31 °C were obtained that form aggregates in vitro via their globular NC-1 domains. Furthermore, we compare the NC-1 domains released by collagenase digestion of hrColX with NC-1 domains prepared as recombinant proteins in HEK293 cells. Both migrate as aggregates of apparent mass of 40 kDa in SDS-PAGE and are extremely stable and resistant to heat denaturation and reduction in the presence of detergent and urea, but dissociate into monomers of approximately 20 kDa after acid treatment. A 265-bpHindIII-XhoI fragment corresponding to position +31 to +295 (EMBL no. X68952) of human type X collagen cDNA (43Thomas J.T. Cresswell C.J. Rash B. Nicolai H. Jones T. Solomon E. Grant M.

The XbaI-XhoI insert was combined with a 2080-bp XhoI-SspI fragment (position 295–2383, EMBL no.

A cDNA fragment coding for the entire NC-1 domain starting 3′ of the COOH-terminal Gly-Pro-Pro triplet of the α1(X) triple helix (position 1651–2139, according to Reichenberger et al.(44Reichenberger E.

The primers introduce an NH2-terminal NheI site, a stop codon, and a COOH-terminal NotI site. The polymerase chain reaction product (497 bp) was cloned into puC 18 and sequenced. The insert was excised with NheI and NotI and cloned into the pCMV/AC7, an eukaryotic expression vector containing the signal peptide sequence of BM40 (47Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K.-H.

Pihlajaniemi, and K. von der Mark, manuscript in preparation. The human kidney epithelial cell line HEK293 and the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. One million cells/10-cm culture dish were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 20 μg of the expression vectors pCMV-ColX or pCMV-NC1, mixed with 1 μg of a selection plasmid pSV2pac containing a puromycin resistance gene according to Nischt et al. (46Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Puromycin-resistant HEK293 or HT1080 clones were selected and tested for type X collagen expression by precipitating the culture medium with 10% trichloroacetic acid, analyzing the precipitate by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-human type X collagen (48Girkontaite I. Frischholz S. Lammi P. Wagner K. Swoboda B. Aigner T. von der Mark K. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). NC-1-expressing clones were screened by Western blotting of the supernatants using the monoclonal antibody X34 specific for the native NC-1 domain (48Girkontaite I. Frischholz S. Lammi P. Wagner K.

Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 277-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and Häuselmann et al. (52Häuselmann H.J. Aydelotte M.B. Schumacher B.L. Kuettner K.E. Gitelis S.H. Thonar E.J. Matrix. 1992; 12: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) for 1 week in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml ascorbate-phosphate. For type X collagen analysis, the alginate beads were dissolved in 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and the released chondrons were dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Type X collagen production was detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody prepared against recombinant human type X collagen (see below). Two HEK293 clones (5/16, 6/16) and one HT1080 clone (7/7), which secreted up to 50 μg/ml hrColX were expanded to mass culture. Partial purification of hrColX was achieved by dialysis of the serum-free supernatant against phosphate-buffered saline or against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Purification to more than 95% homogeneity was achieved by dialysis against 0.02 mNaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, equilibrated in the same buffer. The material not bound to DEAE-cellulose was further purified by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, at room temperature. Type X collagen was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient between 0 and 1000 mm NaCl. Rabbit antisera against human type X collagen were obtained by subcutaneous immunization with 3 × 0.2 mg of purified hrColX. The antisera were tested for reactivity against hrColX and lack of cross-reactivity with human types I and II collagen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting as described previously (15Kirsch T. von der Mark K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 575Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The antisera R239 and R244 revealed a titer of 1:60,000 in immunoblotting against hrColX. The titers against type I and II collagen were 104-fold lower. The specificity of the antibody for type X collagen was verified by the selective staining of the hypertrophic zone of human epiphyseal growth cartilage (see Fig. 4). Circular dichroism spectra of purified hrColX, dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 0.25 mg/ml, were recorded at 20 °C on a Jaso J-715 dicrograph using 0.01- or 0.05-cm path length thermostated cuvettes. Melting curves were recorded by measuring molar ellipticity at different wavelengths (198, 222, or 225 nm) between 15 and 70 °C, increasing the temperature by 30 °C/h. The protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis in triplicate samples. For trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion, serum-free hrColX containing cell culture supernatants were heated to various temperatures up to 50 °C for 30 min, rapidly cooled to 20 °C, and then digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin (2 × crystallized, Boehringer Mannheim, bovine pancreas, EC 3.4.4.4) and 2.5 mg/ml chymotrypsin (Boehringer, EC 3.4.4.5) for 1 h at 20 °C (53Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For pepsin digestion, type X collagen was dialyzed against 0.5m acetic acid and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml pepsin (swine stomach, 2 × crystallized, Serva, Heidelberg, EC 3.4.4.1) for 18 h at 4 °C. For collagenase digestion, purified type X collagen or serum-free cell culture supernatant was dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The material was heat denatured at 45 °C for 30 min and digested with highly purified collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum microbial collagenase, EC3.4.4.19, Advanced Biofacturers, Lynnbrook, NY) for 4 h at 37 °C. After enzyme digestion, the material was either precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, or concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Amino acid analysis of hrColX after hydrolysis with 6 n HCl was performed on a Biotronic amino acid analyzer (courtesy of Dr. K. H. Mann, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, FRG). For amino-terminal sequencing, 20 μg of recombinant type X collagen were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7% polyacrylamide gels, blotted to a Hybond® nylon membrane, and sequenced on an automatic solid phase amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (courtesy of Dr. R. Deutzmann, Department of Biochemistry, University of Regensburg, FRG). For electron microscopic examination, purified hrColX was dialyzed against 0.2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate, mixed with an equal volume of glycerol, and sprayed onto mica discs. Rotary shadowing and electron microscopic analysis was kindly performed by H. Wiedemann at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, as described in Kühn et al.(54Kühn K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Risteli J. Dieringer H. Voss T. Glanville R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A full-length human type X collagen cDNA was generated from cDNA and genomic clones (32Iyama K.-I. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Linsenmayer T.F. Trelstad R.L. Hayashi M. Anat.

Bone Miner. 1992; 18: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMVsis. The resulting expression vector pCMV-ColX was stably transfected into human embryonal kidney cells HEK293 and fibrosarcoma cells HT1080. Puromycin-resistant clones were selected and tested for type X collagen production by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the secreted proteins. Several stable clones were obtained secreting up to 50 μg/ml protein with a molecular mass of 75 kDa, which was not secreted by mock-transfected cells. The band reacted specifically with a rabbit antiserum against human type X collagen (15Kirsch T. von der Mark K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 575Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive band was purified to homogeneity from serum-free conditioned medium of the HEK293 6/16 clone or from the HT1080-7/7 clone by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, followed by CM-cellulose chromatography, both under native conditions (Fig. 1 b). Pepsin digestion of purified hrColX reduced its size to 62 kDa (Fig. 1 c). The hrα1(X) synthesized by pCMV-ColX clones migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent mass of 75–80 kDa (Figs. 1 and2) compared with globular protein standards, while the actual Mr calculated from the cDNA sequence starting at Val20 (see below) is 64149, not considering potential glycosylation. By comparison, the apparent mass of α1(X) extracted from hypertrophic fetal chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads (51Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. McCallum D.K. Connect.

https://openalex.org/W2087662647,"Activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels is thought to involve two distinct steps: a recognition event in which a ligand binds to the channel and a conformational change that both opens the channel and increases the affinity of the channel for an agonist. Sequence similarity with the cyclic nucleotide-binding sites of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and the bacterial catabolite activating protein (CAP) suggests that the channel ligand binding site consists of a β-roll and three α-helices. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the third (or C) α-helix moves relative to the agonist upon channel activation, forming additional favorable contacts with the purine ring. Here we ask if channel activation also involves structural changes in the β-roll by investigating the contribution of a conserved arginine residue that, in CAP and the kinases, forms an important ionic interaction with the cyclized phosphate of the bound ligand. Mutations that conserve, neutralize, or reverse the charge on this arginine decreased the apparent affinity for ligand over four orders of magnitude but had little effect on the ability of bound ligand to open the channel. These data indicate that the cyclized phosphate of the nucleotide approaches to within 2–4 Å of the arginine, forming a favorable ionic bond that is largely unaltered upon activation. Thus, the binding site appears to be polarized into two distinct structural and functional domains: the β-roll stabilizes the ligand in a state-independent manner, whereas the C-helix selectively stabilizes the ligand in the open state of the channel. It is likely that these distinct contributions of the nucleotide/C-helix and nucleotide/β-roll interactions may also be a general feature of the mechanism of activation of other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins.

Cyclic nucleotides regulate the activity of a diverse family of proteins involved in cellular signaling.

Despite obvious divergence among the effector domains of these proteins, the cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) sites appear to share a common architecture. Solution of the crystal structures of CAP (3Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and a recombinant bovine PKA RIα subunit (4Su Y.

Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that their CNB sites are formed from an α-helix (A helix), an 8-stranded β-roll, and two more α-helices (B and C), with the C-helix forming the back of the binding pocket. Six residues are invariant among all members of the CAP and kinase families: three glycines involved in turns between strands of the β-roll, an arginine and a glutamate, each of which contact the cyclic nucleotide, and an alanine whose function is uncertain (1Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). Strikingly, these six residues are conserved in the CNG channels. Thus, it has been suggested that the invariant residues play important and conserved roles in the folding/function of the CNB sites of these diverse proteins (1Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, only three of these residues (two glycines and the arginine) appear to be conserved among the more distantly related voltage-gated channels that bear the CNB site motif and whose gating may be modulated by direct binding of cyclic nucleotide (KAT1 (7Anderson J.A.

Surprisingly, this structural similarity of the CNB site does not appear to be reflected in the conformation of the bound agonist. Thus, the crystal structures reveal cAMP binds in an anti conformation to CAP (3Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) but in a syn conformation to PKA RIα (4Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N-h. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S.

While experiments with cyclic nucleotide analogs and modeling, based upon the CAP and PKA R1α structures, have been used to investigate the conformation adopted by agonists in other CNB sites, this issue is unresolved (1Shabb J.B.

This uncertainty, coupled with the lack of a crystal structure for any of the CNB proteins, in either the absence of bound agonist or presence of antagonist, leaves an important question unresolved: what are the structural changes that take place within these binding sites that result in the activation of each of the CNB proteins? By employing site-directed mutagenesis and patch clamp recording of CNG ion channels, it is possible to separate the coupled processes of ligand binding from activation, permitting a dissection of the molecular contributions of protein-ligand interactions to each of these events. Such studies have demonstrated that residues within the C-helix selectively contribute to channel activation (20Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Indeed, an aspartic acid residue (Asp604) in the bovine rod subunit 1 (bRET1 (16Kaupp U.B. Niidome T. Tanabe T. Terada S. Bönigk W. Stühmer W. Cook N.J. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 342: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar)) C-helix appears to interact with the purine ring of cGMP selectively when the channel is open (21Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). That is, the binding energy of this interaction predominantly serves to stabilize ligand binding in the active conformation of the binding site, thereby leading to stabilization of the active (open) state of the channel. However, the state dependence of interactions between the cyclic nucleotide and other residues in the binding site are less well defined. Here we ask whether regions other than the C-helix of the CNB site are likely to be altered upon channel activation and thereby contribute to the increased affinity of the open channel for agonist. Studies of cyclic nucleotide analogs bearing sulfur substitutions on one or another of the exocyclic oxygens of the cyclized phosphate raise the possibility that residues in the β-roll may also contribute to activation gating. These data show that, in the kinases, the equatorial sulfur-substituted derivative (Rp-cAMPS) is an antagonist, whereas the axial sulfur-substituted compound (Sp-cAMPS) is an agonist (22De Wit R.J.W.

J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in CNG channels formed from bRET1, both cGMP derivatives are agonists and both cAMP derivatives are antagonists (26Kramer R.H. Tibbs G.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the exocyclic oxygen atoms interact with residues in the β-roll, these data raise the possibility that large and possibly divergent structural changes may take place in the β-roll of each of the CNB proteins upon activation (1Shabb J.B.

The homologous residue forms an ionic bond with the cyclized phosphate of the nucleotide in both CAP and the RIα subunit of PKA (1Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 3Weber I.T.

Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), which suggests that this residue is well placed to detect any significant rearrangement between the ligand and the β-roll upon activation. We have previously reported that substitution of this conserved arginine with the polar but uncharged glutamine residue leads to a 27-fold increase in the K½ (agonist concentration producing half-maximal activation) in a chimeric channel (ROON-S2, see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). Despite this reduction in sensitivity to ligand, there is no apparent change in the ability of bound ligand to activate the ROON-S2 channel, as determined from the maximum open probability (Pmax) of the channel in the presence of a saturating concentration of ligand (27Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These data suggest that either the conserved arginine contacts the bound agonist in a state-independent manner (that is, it interacts equally well with ligand in the open and closed states of the channel) or that the polar glutamine residue is able to substitute effectively for the arginine to maintain any state-dependent contacts. Here we explore further the role of Arg559 by studying a wide range of mutations that conserve, neutralize, or reverse the charge of this residue. Such mutations are tolerated and cause a progressive decrease in the affinity for agonist with little or no detectable change in the ability of bound agonist to activate the channel. These data are consistent with the formation of a state-independent, electrostatic interaction between this arginine and the cyclized phosphate of the ligand, although they also reveal an unexpected steric influence of chain length. Point mutations were made by a polymerase chain reaction/subcloning strategy, and the resulting cDNA was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction fragment (17Goulding E.H. Ngai J. Kramer R.H. Colicos S. Axel R. Siegelbaum S.A. Chess A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 45-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The amino acids swapped in the construction of the chimeras are given in the legend to Fig. 1. The majority of these experiments were performed in the background of two chimeric channels for technical reasons. The chimera RO133 is comprised of bRET1 whose pore-forming P-region has been replaced with the corresponding amino acids from fOLF1 (28Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Liu D. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Channels formed from this chimera have cyclic nucleotide-gating properties identical to those of bRET1 but have the large single channel conductance of fOLF1 channels, facilitating measurements of single channel currents and, hence,Pmax (28Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Liu D. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The other construct we utilized was a double chimera, ROON-S2 (27Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in which we replaced both the P-region and amino-terminal N-S2 domain of bRET1 with sequences from fOLF1. This construct has both a large single channel conductance and a very high sensitivity to cGMP (due to the presence of the fOLF1 N-S2 domain and the bRET1 CNB domain (20Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). The high apparent affinity of this parent chimera permitted us to study ligand-dependent gating of CNB-site point mutants whose apparent affinities for cGMP were shifted by up to 4 orders of magnitude. In the parent bRET1 and fOLF1 backgrounds, such mutations shift the dose-response curve of the channel into a cGMP concentration range that is greater than 100 mm and thus unmeasurable. We have previously shown that the only effect of introducing the fOLF1 N-S2 domain in the bRET1 background is to increase the efficacy with which bound ligands activate this construct; the selectivity of the bRET1 CNB site for ligand is not compromised (20Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Throughout the text, the invariant arginine in β7 is identified according to the numbering sequence of either bRET1 (Arg559) for those constructs that contain the bRET1 CNB site (bRET1, RO133, and ROON-S2) or of fOLF1 (Arg529). In constructs where this residue is mutated, the identity of amino acids substituted for the arginine is shown by a letter after a slash mark in the construct name (single letter amino acid code); constructs with no slash mark and letter contain an arginine. Inside-out patches were obtained from Xenopus oocytes 1–7 days after injection with cRNA (Message Machine, Ambion). In most experiments, recordings were performed with symmetrical solutions (67 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Na-cGMP was included in the intracellular solution by iso-osmolar replacement of NaCl. In some experiments, we completely replaced the KCl and NaCl with 100 mm Na-cGMP. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) and then digitized (Macintosh Centris 650 personal computer; ITC-16 interface and PULSE software, Instrutech Corp.) following low pass filtering (8 pole Bessel filter, Frequency Devices 902). Single channel recordings were filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Macroscopic currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz. All data were acquired at a holding potential of −80 mV. K½ was estimated from fits to the Hill equation, Popen =Pmax/[1 + (K½/[A])h], whereK½ is the apparent affinity, [A] is the agonist concentration, h is the Hill coefficient, and Popen is the observed open probability at a given concentration of cGMP. For all constructs except ROON-S2/D, this was determined from patches containing many channels and calculated according to Popen = (IcGMP/Imax)Pmax, where IcGMP is the macroscopic current at a given concentration of cGMP and Imax is the maximal current at a saturating concentration of cGMP, measured in the same patch. As such macroscopic recordings were never obtained for ROON-S2/D, all open probabilities were determined from single channel recordings, as described below. For the following constructs,Pmax was determined from single channel patches in the presence of a saturating concentration of cGMP (given in parentheses): ROON-S2 (0.3 mm), ROON-S2/K (3 mm), ROON-S2/Q (3 mm), ROON-S2/N (30 mm), RO133 (3 mm), fOLF1 (3 mm), and fOLF1/Q (30 mm). For each patch, 20–40 s of continuous recording was accumulated into an all points amplitude histogram, such as those shown in Fig. 2. As these histograms included all open and closed events, the area of the closed peak represents the closed probability (Pclosed) and Pmax is equal to 1 −Pclosed. However, for ROON-S2/L, ROON-S2/E, ROON-S2/D, and RO133/Q, 30 mm cGMP was not saturating. Higher concentrations of cGMP caused the maximal current to decrease, possibly due to desensitization. Accordingly for these four constructs, we first normalized the dose-response data by the open probability directly measured with 30 mm cGMP. Pmax was then obtained by fitting the Hill equation to the normalized data. This introduced only a minor correction for ROON-S2/L, ROON-S2/E, and RO133/Q. The correction was larger for ROON-S2/D, which had the most displaced dose-response curve. For ROON-S2/L and ROON-S2/D, this procedure can lead toPmax values that are slightly larger than 1, reflecting the error inherent in this procedure given that the observed open probabilities are so close to 1 originally. Where appropriate, the values for Popen (with 30 mm cGMP) are reported in the legends to Figs. 4 and 6, in addition to the estimated value of Pmax. This small error will not significantly affect our estimates of K½. Throughout the manuscript, data are given as mean ± S.E. or mean ± range for those cases in which n = 2. Fits are weighted to the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the mean data.Figure 4Effects of mutation of Arg559 in ROON-S2.

This correction is significant only at very low open probabilities.

AlthoughK½ values depend, in general, on both ligand affinity and the coupled gating reaction, for those mutations that do not alter channel gating (Pmax), changes inK½ must reflect a selective change in ligand affinity. Since the Arg559 mutations studied here do not alter Pmax, we have used the observed changes inK½ with the various Arg559 point mutants to calculate the change in free energy of the actual binding reactions. Thus, the change in free energy of binding, Δ(ΔG), upon changing charge at Arg559 is given by, Δ(ΔG)=−RT ln(K2/K1)Equation 1 where K1 and K2 are the K½ values for the wild-type and mutant channels, respectively. Assuming that the change in free energy reflects a simple coulombic interaction between the residue at position 559 and the cyclized phosphate of cGMP, it follows that, Δ(ΔG)=NΔq1q2/4πɛɛ0rEquation 2 and from Equations 1 and 2, we obtain the electrical distancer, r=NΔq1q2/−4RTπɛɛ0ln(K2/K1)Equation 3 where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, Δq1 is the change in charge at position 559 between wild-type and mutant channels,q2 is the charge on the cyclized phosphate of the ligand, N is Avogadro's number, and ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of the binding site environment and the vacuum permittivity, respectively. As this is a solvent-accessible part of the binding site, we assume that the charged groups are fully ionized and that the dielectric constant equals that of water. We have previously shown (20Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that the simplest kinetic scheme that describes the equilibrium gating properties of CNG channels is the cyclical allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (18Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6048) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D). According to the model, the channel undergoes an allosteric transition between the closed (C) and open (O) state in the absence of ligand, with an equilibrium constant L0 (equal to [C]/[O]). Agonists activate the channel by binding more tightly to the open state than to the closed state (dissociation constants KO and KC, respectively), thereby shifting the equilibrium from the closed state to the open state by the term (KO/KC)n (wheren is the number of agonists bound to the channel). To partition the effects of mutating the conserved arginine between ligand-binding reactions and the channel-opening reaction, the increase in channel open probability as a function of ligand concentration was fit to the MWC model.

(EC 1.6.2.4) is required for microsomal eukaryotic cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase activity, transferring either both electrons or (sometimes) the first electron for these reactions (1Vermilion J.L. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 266-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of foreign compounds, such as lipophilic pollutants, pesticides, and drugs, as well as in many biosynthetic reactions (for instance, in steroid, alkaloid, and terpenoid biosynthesis). Although in plants there is CPR diversity, in animal and fungal systems only one CPR has been identified; it functions with the many members of the microsomal P450 superfamily in a particular organism (2Sevrioukova I.F. Peterson J.A. Biochemie. 1995; 77: 562-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The soluble domain of the enzyme can be generated for structural studies via x-ray crystallography (3Djordjevic S. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Shea T. Camitta M.G.W. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 3214-3218Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Yabusaki Y. Murakami H. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa O. DNA. 1988; 7: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but it was previously reported to be unable to support mammalian CYP activity where the N-terminal membrane anchor was required (5Black S.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5929-5938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested in the yeast CPR, and we developed and characterized systems to examine the function of the soluble domain of the enzyme with comparison to human CPR. We show here, using whole transformants and cell-free systems, that the soluble yeast enzyme can support CYP activity, in contrast to human CPR, which is shown to be inactive.Within the CYP superfamily, CYP51 is the only family found in animal, plant, and fungal kingdoms, and it represents an ancient metabolic role for CYP in sterol biosynthesis, undertaking C14 demethylation via three sequential hydroxylations (6Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Sonoda Y. Sato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18502-18505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fungal enzyme is the target for azole antifungals, which are selective in their inhibition over the human and plant orthologues, are central to antifungal chemotherapy, and represent about one-third of the agricultural fungicides used. Two other enzymes of fungal ergosterol biosynthesis require CPR, CYP61 (a sterol 22-desaturase (7Hata S. Nishino T. Katsuki H. Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Agric. Biol.

Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 388-418Google Scholar). The former may also be present in plants, in which 22-desaturation is observed, unlike in animals, but the latter is present in all organisms producing sterols (11Weete J.D. Adv. Lipid Res. 1989; 23: 115-167Crossref Google Scholar).As expected for an antifungal target, gene disruption ofCYP51 was observed to be lethal, but the strain could be rescued by providing an ergosterol supplement that could be taken up only anaerobically (12Kalb V.F. Woods C.W. Turi T.G. Dey C.R. Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. DNA. 1987; 6: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, gene disruption of yeastCPR produced viable mutants (13Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and ergosterol was present. 2K. Venkateswarlu, D. C. Lamb, D. E. Kelly, N. J. Manning, and S. L. Kelly, unpublished observation. 2K. Venkateswarlu, D. C. Lamb, D. E. Kelly, N. J. Manning, and S. L. Kelly, unpublished observation. No additionalCPR genes could be detected or were subsequently revealed within the yeast genome. In reconstituted assays with purified CYP, enzyme cytochrome b5 can act as alternative donor for the second electron required for monooxygenase activity (14Imai Y. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and may have been supporting catalytic activity in the disruptant. Supporting this concept was the observation that the gene encoding cytochrome b5 can act as a suppressor of aCPR gene disruption phenotype, noted by Sutter and Loper (13Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), namely hypersensitivity to the CYP51 inhibitor ketoconazole (15Traun G. Epinat J.-C. Rougeulle C. Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene. 1994; 149: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity suggested that a large reduction in ergosterol biosynthesis might have occurred, making the strain more sensitive, with reduction in ergosterol levels below the critical level occurring at a lower concentration of drug.Here, we present the first full biochemical characterization of a yeast strain disrupted in the gene encoding CPR, including measurement of activity, enzyme localization, and qualitative and quantitative investigation of sterol profiles. It is shown that an absence of yeast CPR does not result in a dramatic reduction in ergosterol synthesis in the cell. Furthermore, the ability of an N-terminal truncated soluble yeast enzyme to complement a strain containing no CPR and reconstitute CYP activity is demonstrated. This is in direct contrast to genetically engineered soluble human CPR, which is shown to be inactive, thus revealing a fundamental structural difference between the yeast and mammalian CPR forms.DISCUSSIONOne of the earliest roles of CPR, as for the CYP superfamily, may have been in sterol biosynthesis. CPR also functions in the squalene epoxidation reaction (10Yoshida Y. McGinnis M.R. Current Topics in Medical Mycology. 2. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 388-418Google Scholar), which precedes sterol 14α-demethylation undertaken by CYP51 (6Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Sonoda Y. Sato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18502-18505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as sterol 22-desaturation undertaken by CYP61, one of the last steps in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (30Kelly S.L. Lamb D.C. Baldwin B.C. Corran A.J. Kelly D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9986-9988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The previous finding of hypersensitivity to ketoconazole on disruption of the gene encoding CPR was in many ways consistent with the concept of inefficient sterol biosynthesis, so that only a low dose of CYP51 inhibitor would arrest growth. We confirmed the observation of Sutter and Loper (13Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Analysis of sterols by gas chromatography and thin layer chromatography did not reveal accumulation of intermediates, such as lanosterol or ergosta-5,7-dienol, that are indicative of a block to enzyme activity at the steps in which CPR participates. This indicated that the electron donor system remaining in the cells is efficient, delivering both electrons for CYP activity.Previously, the N terminus of mammalian CPR has been indicated to be the membrane anchor for the protein because trypsin cleavage was observed to release a soluble domain (5Black S.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5929-5938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this was not catalytically active in reconstituted systems, suggesting a role for the N terminus in interactions with CYP. Our studies indicate that the N-terminal 33 amino acids are important for membrane anchoring and targeting for yeast CPR, which contains a similar hydrophobic sequence. In contrast to previous studies on mammalian enzyme, this cytosolic protein is catalytically active and complementscpr-disrupted sterol biosynthesis on both expression and addition of purified enzyme to the in vitro system. This observation was confirmed in reconstitution studies with CYP61, in which normal activity was observed, as well as studies with C. albicans and human CYP51. This difference from mammalian studies was confirmed for the human enzyme and reflects a fundamental difference between the CPRs from different kingdoms. We can conclude that the yeast CPR membrane anchor is not required for supporting P450 activity in vivo or in vitro. Recently, the structure of rat CPR was resolved at 2.6 Å (31Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), and similar resolution of the yeast enzyme structure may help to elucidate the fundamental differences between the enzymes. For crystallization, the rat protein was produced in its soluble form after tryptic digestion, and the manner in which the hydrophobic domain allows interaction with CYP enzymes remains unclear. Presumably, the hydrophobic domain is important for the correct spatial interaction to allow electron transfer to CYP enzymes. Such interactions appear unimportant for yeast CPR in its interaction with fungal and mammalian CYP forms, and we are currently undertaking crystallization trials on soluble yeast CPR to resolve this and other issues. NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) 1The abbreviations used are: CPR, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; CYP, cytochrome P450; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: CPR, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; CYP, cytochrome P450; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. (EC 1.6.2.4) is required for microsomal eukaryotic cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase activity, transferring either both electrons or (sometimes) the first electron for these reactions (1Vermilion J.L. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 266-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of foreign compounds, such as lipophilic pollutants, pesticides, and drugs, as well as in many biosynthetic reactions (for instance, in steroid, alkaloid, and terpenoid biosynthesis). Although in plants there is CPR diversity, in animal and fungal systems only one CPR has been identified; it functions with the many members of the microsomal P450 superfamily in a particular organism (2Sevrioukova I.F. Peterson J.A. Biochemie. 1995; 77: 562-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The soluble domain of the enzyme can be generated for structural studies via x-ray crystallography (3Djordjevic S. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Shea T. Camitta M.G.W. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 3214-3218Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Yabusaki Y. Murakami H. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa O. DNA. 1988; 7: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but it was previously reported to be unable to support mammalian CYP activity where the N-terminal membrane anchor was required (5Black S.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5929-5938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested in the yeast CPR, and we developed and characterized systems to examine the function of the soluble domain of the enzyme with comparison to human CPR. We show here, using whole transformants and cell-free systems, that the soluble yeast enzyme can support CYP activity, in contrast to human CPR, which is shown to be inactive. Within the CYP superfamily, CYP51 is the only family found in animal, plant, and fungal kingdoms, and it represents an ancient metabolic role for CYP in sterol biosynthesis, undertaking C14 demethylation via three sequential hydroxylations (6Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Sonoda Y. Sato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18502-18505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fungal enzyme is the target for azole antifungals, which are selective in their inhibition over the human and plant orthologues, are central to antifungal chemotherapy, and represent about one-third of the agricultural fungicides used. Two other enzymes of fungal ergosterol biosynthesis require CPR, CYP61 (a sterol 22-desaturase (7Hata S. Nishino T. Katsuki H. Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Agric. Biol.

Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 388-418Google Scholar). The former may also be present in plants, in which 22-desaturation is observed, unlike in animals, but the latter is present in all organisms producing sterols (11Weete J.D. Adv. Lipid Res. 1989; 23: 115-167Crossref Google Scholar). As expected for an antifungal target, gene disruption ofCYP51 was observed to be lethal, but the strain could be rescued by providing an ergosterol supplement that could be taken up only anaerobically (12Kalb V.F. Woods C.W. Turi T.G. Dey C.R. Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. DNA. 1987; 6: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, gene disruption of yeastCPR produced viable mutants (13Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and ergosterol was present. 2K. Venkateswarlu, D. C. Lamb, D. E. Kelly, N. J. Manning, and S. L. Kelly, unpublished observation. 2K. Venkateswarlu, D. C. Lamb, D. E. Kelly, N. J. Manning, and S. L. Kelly, unpublished observation. No additionalCPR genes could be detected or were subsequently revealed within the yeast genome. In reconstituted assays with purified CYP, enzyme cytochrome b5 can act as alternative donor for the second electron required for monooxygenase activity (14Imai Y. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and may have been supporting catalytic activity in the disruptant. Supporting this concept was the observation that the gene encoding cytochrome b5 can act as a suppressor of aCPR gene disruption phenotype, noted by Sutter and Loper (13Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), namely hypersensitivity to the CYP51 inhibitor ketoconazole (15Traun G. Epinat J.-C. Rougeulle C. Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene. 1994; 149: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity suggested that a large reduction in ergosterol biosynthesis might have occurred, making the strain more sensitive, with reduction in ergosterol levels below the critical level occurring at a lower concentration of drug. Here, we present the first full biochemical characterization of a yeast strain disrupted in the gene encoding CPR, including measurement of activity, enzyme localization, and qualitative and quantitative investigation of sterol profiles. It is shown that an absence of yeast CPR does not result in a dramatic reduction in ergosterol synthesis in the cell. Furthermore, the ability of an N-terminal truncated soluble yeast enzyme to complement a strain containing no CPR and reconstitute CYP activity is demonstrated. This is in direct contrast to genetically engineered soluble human CPR, which is shown to be inactive, thus revealing a fundamental structural difference between the yeast and mammalian CPR forms. DISCUSSIONOne of the earliest roles of CPR, as for the CYP superfamily, may have been in sterol biosynthesis. CPR also functions in the squalene epoxidation reaction (10Yoshida Y. McGinnis M.R. Current Topics in Medical Mycology. 2. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 388-418Google Scholar), which precedes sterol 14α-demethylation undertaken by CYP51 (6Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Sonoda Y. Sato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18502-18505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as sterol 22-desaturation undertaken by CYP61, one of the last steps in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (30Kelly S.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9986-9988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The previous finding of hypersensitivity to ketoconazole on disruption of the gene encoding CPR was in many ways consistent with the concept of inefficient sterol biosynthesis, so that only a low dose of CYP51 inhibitor would arrest growth. We confirmed the observation of Sutter and Loper (13Sutter T.R. Loper J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Then, to determine which genome, mitochondrial or nuclear, was responsible for this age-related, mitochondria-specific reduction, pure nuclear transfer was carried out from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-less HeLa cells to four fibroblast lines, two from aged subjects, one from a fetus, and one from a patient with cardiomyopathy, and their nuclear hybrid clones were isolated. A normal fibroblast line from the fetus and a respiration-deficient fibroblast line from the patient were used as a positive and a negative control, respectively. Subsequently, the mitochondrial translation and respiration properties of the nuclear hybrid clones were compared. A negative control experiment showed that this procedure could be used to isolate even nuclear hybrids expressing overall mitochondrial respiration deficiency, whereas no respiration deficiencies were observed in any nuclear hybrids irrespective of whether their mtDNAs were exclusively derived from aged or fetal donors. These observations suggest that nuclear-recessive mutations of factors involved in mitochondrial translation but not mtDNA mutations are responsible for age-related respiration deficiency of human fibroblasts.

These observations suggest that nuclear-recessive mutations of factors involved in mitochondrial translation but not mtDNA mutations are responsible for age-related respiration deficiency of human fibroblasts. It has been presumed that somatic mutations accumulate in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) much faster than in nuclear DNA because mitochondria are highly oxygenic organelles due to their function in producing energy, mtDNA lacks histones protecting it from mutagenic damage, and its repair systems are limited (1Shay J.W. Werbin H. Mutat. Res. 1987; 186: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that the accumulation of various somatic mutations in mtDNA and the resultant decrease in mitochondrial respiratory function could be involved in aging processes in mammals (2Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Ozawa T. Tanaka M. Lancet. 1989; 3: 642-645Abstract Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 3Miquel J. Arch. Gerontol.

There have been many reports that the respiration capacity of mitochondria in highly oxidative tissues decreases during aging (4Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Moreover, the accumulation of somatic and pathogenic mtDNA mutations, which have been shown to cause various kinds of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (5Holt I.J. Harding A. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Nature. 1988; 331: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 6Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schon E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), was also shown to increase with age in normal subjects (9Soong N.W. Hinton D.R. Cortopassi G Arnheim N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Flint Beal M. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). However, as the nuclear genome encodes most mitochondrial proteins including factors necessary for replication and expression of the mitochondrial genome, it is possible that only mutations in the nuclear genome contribute to the age-related decline of mitochondrial respiratory function. In fact, there is no convincing evidence that mtDNA somatic mutations are responsible for this age-related phenotype. Previously, we observed age-related reduction of cytochromec oxidase (COX) 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochromec oxidase; HAT, hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine; Oua, ouabain; TIG, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). activity and mitochondrial translation in cultured human skin fibroblasts isolated from donors of various ages (0–97 years), and in studies on their mtDNA transfer to mtDNA-less (ρ0) HeLa cells, we showed that mtDNA mutations were not responsible for the observed age-related mitochondrial dysfunction of human skin fibroblasts (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, using an mtDNA transfer system similar to ours (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. mtDNA transfer from human skin fibroblasts to ρ0 human cells, Laderman et al. (12Laderman K.A. Penny J.R. Mazzucchelli F. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15891-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported contradictory results, suggesting the presence of age-related heritable alterations in fibroblast mtDNA. However, the procedure for isolating cybrids by the transfer of fibroblast mtDNA to ρ0 cells is not appropriate for unambiguous determination of whether accumulation of mtDNA mutations is involved in age-related mitochondrial dysfunction, because during selection to exclude ρ0 cells using medium without uridine and/or pyruvate, cybrids expressing respiration deficiency due to accumulation of mtDNA mutations might also be eliminated preferentially, so that only cybrids with normal mitochondrial respiratory function are isolated. Thus in these conditions (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Laderman K.A. Penny J.R. Mazzucchelli F. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15891-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), defective cybrids with mutant mtDNA from both young and aged subjects may have been excluded preferentially. Recently, to determine whether the mitochondrial or nuclear genome is responsible for mitochondrial diseases, we developed a system for delivery of a normal nuclear genome from ρ0 HeLa cells to fibroblasts from patients with respiration deficiency by isolating nuclear hybrids (13Isobe K. Kishino S. Inoue K. Takai D. Hirawake H. Kita K. Miyabayashi S. Hayashi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12606-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In these nuclear hybrid clones, the nuclear genome was derived from both parental ρ0 HeLa cells and fibroblasts, whereas the mitochondrial genome is exclusively from fibroblasts. Thus, if mitochondrial dysfunction is restored by the introduction of pure ρ0 HeLa nuclei, it should be attributed to nuclear-recessive mutations, and if not, it should be due to either mtDNA mutations or nuclear-dominant mutations. Moreover, since HeLa nuclei completely free from mtDNA can be introduced into fibroblasts simply by fusion of the fibroblasts with ρ0HeLa cells followed by hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) and ouabain (Oua) selection, this nuclear genome delivery system does not impose any selective pressure upon mitochondrial respiratory function to remove ρ0 parental cells. Therefore, it should be effective for isolating nuclear hybrid clones, even when they express mitochondrial respiration deficiency like ρ0 cells. In the present work, we did not use mtDNA transfer techniques but used nuclear transfer techniques that do not eliminate clones expressing complete respiration deficiency, so that we could exclude the possibility of preferential selection of respiratory-competent clones. By this method, we showed that nuclear-recessive mutations involved in mitochondrial translation are responsible for age-related mitochondrial respiration deficiency, and that mtDNA mutations, if they occurred, did not play any significant role in expression of the phenotype. Normal human skin fibroblast lines TIG3S, TIG2S, TIG1, TIG104, TIG105, TIG106, TIG107, TIG101, and TIG102 were obtained from the Department of Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (TIG). Fibroblast lines TIG3S, TIG2S, and TIG1 were from fetuses, whereas TIG104, TIG105, TIG106, TIG107, TIG101, and TIG102 were derived from 70, 72, 80, 81, 86, and 97-year-old subjects, respectively. For the study of aging, all TIG fibroblast lines were carefully established in TIG from normal subjects with no clinical abnormalities. TIG3S was used as a positive control of mitochondrial respiratory function in nuclear transfer experiments. As a negative control, we used a respiration-deficient fibroblast line CM derived from a 18-year-old patient with fatal cardiomyopathy with a tRNAIle 4,269 pathogenic mtDNA mutation (14Taniike M. Fukushima H. Yanagihara I. Tsukamoto H. Tanaka J. Fujimura H. Nagai T. Sano T. Yamaoka K. Inui K. Okada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The ρ0 HeLa cells are resistant to 20 μm 6-thioguanine and 2 mm Oua (6Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The fibroblast lines and ρ0 HeLa cells were grown in normal medium (RPMI 1640, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, 15% fetal bovine serum). Intercellular transfer of HeLa nuclei to fibroblast lines was achieved by fusion of the fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (13Isobe K.

Briefly, cells in the fusion mixtures were cultivated in selective medium (RPMI 1640, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, 15% fetal bovine serum, HAT (Sigma), 2 mm Oua). On day 10 after fusion, colonies grown in the selection medium were cloned by the cylinder method, and the nuclear hybrid clones were then cultivated in the normal medium. Total DNA (2μg) extracted from 2 × 105 cells was digested with the single-cut restriction enzyme XhoI to estimate the contents of mtDNA in fibroblasts from fetal and elderly donors or digested withHhaI to determine whether mtDNA of the cybrids was derived from mtDNA of the donor cells. The fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled HeLa mtDNA. For quantitation of mtDNA of normal size in the fibroblasts, the membranes were exposed to imaging plates (Fuji Film, Tokyo) for 30 min, and radioactivity was measured with a bioimaging analyzer, Fujix BAS 2000 (Fuji Film). Quantitation of the mtDNA content was normalized by the use of [α-32P]dATP-labeled 18 S rDNA as an internal control. Total cellular RNA was extracted with an isogen RNA isolation kit (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Total denatured RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed in 1.1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred to a nytran membrane. The membrane was hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled oligonucleotide probes of mtDNA-coded COI (nucleotide positions 5,847–7,746) and 16 S rRNA (1,740–3,130) and with [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probes of nuclear DNA-coded mitochondrial transcription factor A and ATPase F1α (13Isobe K.

For detection of a small amount of a common deletion mutant mtDNA, ΔmtDNA4977, amplification was carried out with 20 ng of total DNA in 10 μl of solution containing 0.5 μm of a primer set and 0.25 unit of EX-Taqpolymerase (Takara, Japan), as described previously (11Hayashi J.

Briefly, three sets of oligonucleotide primers were used for amplification: F1 (nucleotide positions 7,901–7,920) on the light strand and R1 (14,220–14,201) on the heavy strand; F2 (8,201–8,220) and R2 (13,851–13,832); F3 (8,282–8,305) and R3 (13,650–13,631). The first round of PCR employed the outer primer set F1 and R1. After incubation for 5 min at 94 °C for complete denaturation of the DNA, 30 cycles were carried out at 94 °C for 30 s for denaturation, 54 °C for 30 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 75 s for extension using a DNA thermal cycler (Thermal sequencer TRS-300; Iwaki Garasu, Japan). The second round of PCR employed the inner primer set F3 and R3, and an additional 20 cycles were run at 94 °C for 30 s for denaturation, 60 °C for 25 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 25 s for extension. For detection of very small amounts of deletion mutant mtDNA molecules, the primer set F2 and R2 was used in the second round, and the primer set F3 and R3 was used in the last round (18Kubota N. Hayashi J.-I. Inada T. Iwamura Y. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The amplified products were separated in 2.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.1 μg/ml). PCR products purified using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) were sequenced directly with a Taq polymerase kit (Prism) with fluorescent primers and dideoxynucleotides. Sequencing reactions were analyzed with an Applied Biosystems model 377 automatic sequencer. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (13Isobe K.

Briefly, semiconfluent cells in a dish were incubated in methionine-free medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h in the presence of emetine (0.15 mg/ml) to inhibit cytoplasmic translation. The mitochondrial fraction was obtained by homogenization in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, followed by differential centrifugation. Proteins in the mitochondrial fraction (20 μg/lane) were separated by SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 24 h, and the labeled polypeptides were located and measured with a bioimaging analyzer. For measurement of cytoplasmic translation activity, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h in the presence of chloramphenicol (0.1 mg/ml) to inhibit mitochondrial translation, and proteins in the whole cells (50 μg/lane) were separated by SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 12 h, and the labeled total polypeptides were located and measured with a bioimaging analyzer. For biochemical analysis, log-phase cells were harvested, and COX activity was measured as the rate of cyanide-sensitive oxidation of reduced cytochrome cas described before (19Miyabayashi S. Narisawa K. Iinuma K. Tada K. Sakai K. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi Y. Morinaga S. Brain Dev. 1984; 6: 362-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption rate was measured by trypsinizing cells (1.5 × 107), incubating the suspension in phosphate-buffered saline, and recording oxygen consumption in a polarographic cell (1.0 ml) at 37 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., OH) (20Soejima A.

First, we compared the COX activities of three fibroblast lines from fetuses and six from aged subjects (70, 72, 80, 81, 86, and 97 years old) and confirmed that the COX activities of the lines from aged subjects were only about 20–40% those of the fetal lines (Fig. 1), consistent with our previous observations (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the reasons for the decrease in COX activity in aged subjects, we compared the levels of mtDNA and its transcripts in the fibroblasts. Southern blot and Northern blot analyses showed that their levels did not change substantially with the age of the fibroblast donors (Fig. 2). Then we compared the mitochondrial translation activities of the fibroblasts by measuring [35S]methionine incorporation into mtDNA-encoded polypeptides in the presence of emetine to inhibit cytoplasmic translation. Results showed that mitochondrial translation activity decreased with aging (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, we found that the cytoplasmic translation activity in fibroblasts remained constant, as shown by [35S]methionine incorporation into nuclear DNA-encoded polypeptides in the presence of chloramphenicol to inhibit mitochondrial translation. All fibroblast lines from both fetal and aged donors showed similar [35S]methionine incorporation activity (Fig. 3 b), suggesting that age-related reduction of translation activity was limited to mitochondria. Therefore, the observed age-related decrease of COX activity could be due at least partly to reduction of mitochondrial translation activity.Figure 2Comparison of contents of mtDNA and its transcripts in fibroblast lines from fetuses and aged subjects.3S, 2S, 1, 106, 107, and 102 show results for TIG3S, TIG2S, TIG1, TIG106, TIG107, and TIG102, respectively. a, Southern blot analysis of a XhoI restriction fragment of mtDNA.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 22Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), we examined which genome was responsible for the age-related, mitochondria-specific reduction. For this, we used our recently developed procedure for delivery of pure normal nuclear genomes from ρ0 HeLa cells to fibroblasts by isolating nuclear hybrids (13Isobe K. Kishino S. Inoue K. Takai D. Hirawake H. Kita K. Miyabayashi S. Hayashi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12606-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As ρ0 HeLa cells have been shown to possess no mtDNA (6Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and to be resistant to both 6-thioguanine and Oua, HeLa nuclei free from mtDNA could be introduced into fibroblasts simply by fusion of fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells followed by cultivation in selective medium with Oua + HAT (Table I). Oua and HAT were used to exclude unfused parental fibroblasts and ρ0 HeLa cells, respectively (see “Materials and Methods”). Accordingly, the nuclear genome of the nuclear hybrids was derived from both parental ρ0 HeLa cells and fibroblasts, whereas the mitochondrial genome was exclusively from fibroblasts.Table ISomatic cell genetic characteristics of parent cells and their nuclear hybridsCell linesDrug resistanceCrossSelectionNumber of clonesParent cell lines Nuclear donorρ0HeLa6-thioguaniner1-ar, -resistant., Ouar Nuclear recipientsTIG3S (0)1-bNumbers in parentheses indicate donor ages of fibroblast lines.TIG106 (80)TIG102 (97)CM (18) Nuclear hybridsNH3Sρ0 HeLa × TIG3SOua + HAT12NH106ρ0 HeLa × TIG106Oua + HAT12NH102ρ0 HeLa × TIG102Oua + HAT12NHCM1-cSeven of 12 clones had more than 95%, two had 87%, and 3 had 35–42% mtDNA with a tRNAIle 4,269 (A to G) mutation.ρ0 HeLa × CMOua + HAT121-a r, -resistant.1-b Numbers in parentheses indicate donor ages of fibroblast lines.1-c Seven of 12 clones had more than 95%, two had 87%, and 3 had 35–42% mtDNA with a tRNAIle 4,269 (A to G) mutation. Open table in a new tab First, it was necessary to show unambiguously that our nuclear genome delivery system did not exclude clones expressing complete respiration deficiency, even though our system does not have to use selective pressure upon mitochondrial respiratory function for removal of parental ρ0 HeLa cells. To demonstrate the reliable isolation of respiration-deficient clones, we carried out nuclear transfer from ρ0 HeLa cells to respiration-deficient fibroblasts containing 90% mtDNA with a pathogenic mutation (A to G) in tRNAIle at 4,269 derived from a patient with fatal cardiomyopathy (14Taniike M. Fukushima H. Yanagihara I. Tsukamoto H. Tanaka J. Fujimura H. Nagai T. Sano T. Yamaoka K. Inui K. Okada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19060-19066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then we examined the content of the mtDNA with the tRNAIle 4,269 mutation in all 12 nuclear hybrid clones by analysis of the SspI restriction pattern of the PCR products as described previously (15Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. Tada K. Fukushima H. Inui K. Okada S. Goto Y. Nonaka I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19060-19066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results showed that seven nuclear hybrid clones contained more than 95% mutant mtDNA (Table I). We compared mitochondrial translation activity by [35S]methionine incorporation into the polypeptides synthesized in mitochondria using clones containing predominantly the mutant or wild-type mtDNA. Fig. 4 shows that [35S]methionine incorporation into all 13 polypeptides encoded by mtDNA was reduced in clones NHCM1 and 3 containing more than 95% pathogenic mutant mtDNA to the level in ρ0 HeLa cells, resulting in overall loss of COX activity (Fig. 5). These results proved the reliability of our nuclear delivery system for isolating clones with complete respiration deficiency.Figure 5Recovery from age-related reduction of COX activity specifically observed in fibroblasts from aged subjects by introduction of pure HeLa nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Using this procedure, we introduced pure HeLa nuclei into the fibroblast lines TIG3S (fetal), TIG106 (80 years old), and TIG102 (97 years old). After selection with Oua + HAT, 12 nuclear hybrid clones growing in the selective medium were isolated from each fusion mixture (Table I). The possibility that the clones we isolated were hybrids between the fibroblasts and contaminating presumptive revertant ρ0 HeLa cells with recovered HeLa mtDNA was excluded by the fact that no HeLa mtDNA was present in these nuclear hybrid clones, as demonstrated by HhaI digestion of the PCR products (data not shown), a procedure that can distinguish HeLa mtDNA from other human mtDNAs, as described previously (23Hayashi J.-I. Werbin H. Shay J.W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4001-4006PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial genome of these clones was derived exclusively from the fibroblasts. Using these nuclear hybrid clones, we compared mitochondrial translation activity by analysis of [35S]methionine incorporation into mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides. As shown in Fig. 4, all nuclear hybrid clones showed similar mitochondrial translation activities irrespective of whether their mtDNA was derived from fetal or aged subjects, suggesting that all mtDNA-encoded factors necessary for the translation in mitochondria, such as 22 mitochondrial tRNAs and 2 rRNAs, were intact in fibroblasts from the aged subjects. Then, we compared COX activities and found that these phenotypes were also completely restored by the introduction of HeLa nuclei (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained on comparison of oxygen consumption rate (data not shown). These observations suggest that accumulation of nuclear-recessive mutations of factors involved in mitochondrial translation was responsible for the defects but that all mtDNA-encoded factors necessary for the formation of functional respiration complexes as well as those necessary for the mitochondrial translation were intact. Therefore, mtDNA in the fibroblasts of aged subjects did not contribute to the observed age-related decline of mitochondrial respiratory function in the aged fibroblasts. Recently, very small amounts of mtDNA molecules with large scale deletion mutations that are not detectable by Southern blot analysis were observed in human (9Soong N.W. Hinton D.R. Cortopassi G Arnheim N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Flint Beal M. Wallace D.C. Nat.

Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15510-15515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by the PCR technique. Since a common mutant mtDNA with a 4,977-bp deletion, ΔmtDNA4977, was found to accumulate preferentially in human brain with increase in age (9Soong N.W. Hinton D.R. Cortopassi G Arnheim N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Flint Beal M. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), we examined using the PCR technique whether ΔmtDNA4977 also accumulated in fibroblast lines from aged subjects. We found that the 392-bp fragment amplified from ΔmtDNA4977 was not detectable in DNA samples of all six fibroblast lines from the aged donors and from fetuses (Fig. 6 a). On the other hand, when the sensitivity of the amplification conditions was significantly increased, a 279-bp fragment derived from a deletion mutant mtDNA other than ΔmtDNA4977 was observed in one fetal fibroblast line (Fig. 6 b). Sequence analysis showed that the deletion was 5,090 bp long with a break point from nucleotide positions 8,450 to 13,541, and that the deletion was flanked by a 4-bp direct repeat (5′-AATAT-3′). Thus, even if a very small amount of deletion mutant mtDNA is present in fibroblast lines, it is not associated with aging. Since the discovery of the intrinsic limitation for population doubling in cultured human diploid fibroblasts (26Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4327) Google Scholar), they have been used extensively as models for investigating in vitrocellular aging (27Shmookler Reis R.J. Goldstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9078-9085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Goldstein S. Science. 1990; 249: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, decrease of mitochondrial respiratory function has not been observed in human diploid fibroblasts duringin vitro cellular aging, i.e. during increase of their population doubling level of fibroblast cultivation (29Goldstein S. Ballantyne S.R. Robson A.L. Moerman E.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but has been observed during aging in vivo, i.e. with age of the fibroblast donors (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, increase of the population doubling level did not affect both COX and mitochondrial translation activities in fibroblast lines from fetus and aged subjects (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This seems consistent with the observation of Goldstein et al.(29Goldstein S. Ballantyne S.R. Robson A.L. Moerman E.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that there was no gross deficit in energy metabolism at increased population doubling level when fibroblasts from the same donor with different population doubling level were compared. The apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro aging could be attributed to the difference of their time scales; in vitro cellular aging lasted only for several months, whereasin vivo aging lasted up to 70–100 years. Therefore, the age-related mitochondrial dysfunction observed in human skin fibroblasts is the phenomenon restricted to in vivoaging. In this study, we showed that this in vivo aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction could be due at least partly to reduction of mitochondrial translation activity. We then examined whether similar reduction could be observed in cytoplasmic translation activity in fibroblasts from the aged subjects and found that the age-related reduction was limited to translation in mitochondria (Fig. 3,a and b). Then, to determine which genome, mitochondrial or nuclear genome, is responsible for this age-related, mitochondria-specific defects, pure nuclear transfer was carried out from ρ0 HeLa cells to fibroblast lines from fetal and aged subjects. Results showed that the age-related, mitochondria-specific defects observed in human skin fibroblasts were due to nuclear-recessive mutations of the factors involved in mitochondrial translation, although we could not completely rule out the possibility of contribution of nonnuclear DNA- and non-mtDNA-encoded factors in ρ0 HeLa cells to the correction of the age-related defects. We previously reported that age-related reduction of COX activity in human skin fibroblasts inherited in a nuclear-recessive way, based on the observation that the reduction was restored by the introduction of pure HeLa nuclei (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our previous work we used only one nuclear hybrid clone isolated by the fusion of aged fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells and did not examine positive control clones using fetal fibroblasts (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that we may have picked up by chance a respiration-competent clone or that the apparent restoration of COX activity by the introduction of HeLa nuclei was not sufficient to exclude the involvement of mtDNA somatic mutations in age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, we did not prove that respiration-deficient clones could be isolated in selection medium with Oua + HAT using respiration-deficient fibroblasts as negative controls. In this study, pure HeLa nuclear transfers to normal fibroblasts from a fetus were carried out as a positive control and to respiration-deficient fibroblasts from a patient with cardiomyopathy as a negative control. The negative control experiment showed that we could isolate nuclear hybrid clones expressing no mitochondrial translation or COX activity (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, our system for isolation of nuclear hybrids is suitable for isolating respiration-deficient clones and excludes the possibility of preferential selection of respiratory-competent clones. By this method, we showed that the activities of both mitochondrial translation and respiratory function of fibroblasts from all aged subjects were restored to comparable levels to those of fetal fibroblasts by the introduction of pure HeLa nuclei, suggesting that mtDNA in fibroblasts from aged subjects is functionally intact. Recently, by isolating cybrid clones using a similar mtDNA transfer system to that which we reported previously (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Laderman et al. (12Laderman K.A. Penny J.R. Mazzucchelli F. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15891-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported contradictory observations, suggesting that mtDNA is involved in age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in human fibroblasts. They claimed the occurrence of age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations in human fibroblasts based on the observations that 5% cybrid clones with mtDNA imported from fibroblasts of elderly subjects showed slightly lower mitochondrial respiratory function than those from younger subjects. However, they did not prove the presence of any mtDNA mutations in the clones with a lower respiratory function. Moreover, since the other 95% clones with mtDNA from elderly subjects showed comparable respiratory function to those with mtDNA from younger subjects, their observations could be reinterpreted as showing that most mtDNA molecules in fibroblasts from aged donors do not have more mutations than those from younger subjects. Furthermore, the presence of only 5% clones with a lower respiratory function could hardly explain the age-related shift to 60–80% reduction of the respiratory function in fetal fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Therefore, the apparent discrepancy between the report of Laderman et al. (12Laderman K.A. Penny J.R. Mazzucchelli F. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15891-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and ours (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be due simply to a difference in the interpretation of observations. In these mtDNA transfer techniques, however, the selection medium without uridine has to be used for isolation of cybrids to exclude parental ρ0 cells (11Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Laderman K.A. Penny J.R. Mazzucchelli F. Bresolin N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15891-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This medium could also exclude cybrids expressing respiration deficiency, resulting in the selective isolation of respiratory-competent cybrids. Therefore, in the present work, we did not use mtDNA transfer techniques but used nuclear transfer techniques that do not eliminate clones expressing complete respiration deficiency (Figs. 4 and 5). Then, we compared both mitochondrial translation activity and mitochondrial respiratory function and showed that no respiration-deficient clones were present among 36 nuclear hybrid clones irrespective of whether their mtDNA were derived exclusively from fetal or aged donors (Fig. 5). These observations completely excluded the possibility that accumulation of mtDNA with somatic mutations plays a role in the age-related respiration defects observed in human skin fibroblasts. Recently, a deletion mutant ΔmtDNA4977 was found to accumulate preferentially in human brain with increase in age (9Soong N.W. Hinton D.R. Cortopassi G Arnheim N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Flint Beal M. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In this study, however, we showed that no ΔmtDNA4977 was detected in mtDNA of any human fibroblast lines from aged or fetal subjects by PCR amplification (Fig. 6 a), whereas one fragment derived from a very small amount of mtDNA with a deletion mutation other than ΔmtDNA4977 was observed in a fibroblast line from a fetus by PCR amplification using three sets of primers (Fig. 6 b). These observations suggest that large scale deletion mutant mtDNA molecules, if they do occur, do not accumulate in mitotic cells with age, partly due to selection against the surviving cells containing these deletion mutants (5Holt I.J. Harding A. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Nature. 1988; 331: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). On the other hand, they could be propagated in specific conditions, such as in blood cells of patients with Pearson syndrome (30Rötig A. Cormier V. Blanche S. Bonnefont J.-P. Ledeist F. Romero N. Schmitz J. Rustin P. Fischer A. Saudubray J.-M. Munnich A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and in cybrid clones (6Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Although the observations of PCR experiments do not exclude the possibility of accumulations of various other unidentified somatic mutations in the mtDNA populations of fibroblasts from aged subjects, our nuclear transfer experiment completely ruled out the possibility of their involvement, at least in age-related respiration defects in fibroblasts. We recently proposed the idea that mitochondria and the mitochondrial genome function as a single dynamic cellular unit in living human cells by the presence of exchanging mtDNA and its products between mitochondria (31Hayashi J.-I. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-i. Nonaka I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This was supported from the evidence for the coexistence and cooperation of mutant HeLa mtDNA with chloramphenicol resistance and mutant mtDNA with a large scale deletion originated from organelles of different cells (32Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As mtDNA mutations in different genes can complement each other (32Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the presence of various kinds of mutant mtDNA molecules in single cells would not have serious additive influence on mitochondrial respiratory function. All these considerations indicate that age-related accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA, even if it occurs in fibroblasts, is not responsible for the age-related decrease in mitochondrial respiratory function observed in human fibroblasts. As the nuclear genome encodes most mitochondrial proteins including factors necessary for expression of the mitochondrial genome (33Larsson N.-G. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 151-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and as the defects were at least in part ascribable to reduction of mitochondrial translation activity, we are now investigating nuclear-coded factors particularly involved in mitochondrial translation to understand the precise mechanisms of the age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in human skin fibroblasts."

To monitor the molecular changes on the promoter of the rabbit uteroglobin gene during early pseudopregnancy in vivo, we have applied the genomic footprinting methodology to endometrial tissue. Estrogen induction results in the simultaneous occupancy of an estrogen-responsive element and an adjacent GC/GT box in the promoter. DNA binding assays demonstrate that the corresponding regulatory factors are the ligand-induced estrogen receptor and the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. Both factors functionally synergize in primary endometrial cells, showing that the GC/GT box is an essential part of a composite estrogen-responsive unit. However, the estrogen receptor and Sp1 do not bind cooperatively to their sites in vitro, suggesting that other mechanisms might be responsible for the hormone-dependent binding of Sp1 in vivo. Since hormone treatment leads to the appearance of a distinct DNase I-hypersensitive site over the promoter chromatin, an estrogen-induced change in the local chromatin structure could facilitate binding of Sp1in vivo.

Gene expression is controlled by combinatorial arrangement of sequence-specific transcription factors that interact with each other and with components of the transcription initiation complex. Modulation of gene transcription is achieved by factors whose activity is reversibly influenced by ligands or posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation. The transcriptional effects of ligand-inducible steroid hormone receptors represent a typical example. To attain efficiency and specificity in gene regulation, steroid hormone receptors interact with ubiquitous or tissue-specific factors as well as with co-activators, which bridge to the general transcriptional apparatus (1Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). The particular combination of factors and the nature of the interactions required for regulated expression of a gene is specified in the form of complex arrays of cis-acting elements in its enhancer and promoter regions. These elements are usually identified through gene transfer experiments and in vitro DNA binding studies. However, the binding of factors to cognate DNA elements, as well as interactions with other factors, is conditioned by the native organization of DNA in chromatin, which imposes defined topological constraints (2Felsenfeld G. Boyes J. Chung J. Clark D. Studitsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9384-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, demonstration of the functional relevance of DNA elements requires a genomic analysis of the chromosomally organized gene in intact cells. To approach these issues, we have studied the steroid hormone-dependent regulation of the rabbit uteroglobin gene. In female animals, the gene is transcriptionally active in epithelial cells of the endometrium during the preimplantation phase of pregnancy (3Beier H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acat. 1968; 160: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Krishnan R.S. Daniel J.C.J. Science. 1967; 158: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Estrogen and progesterone exert a stimulatory effect on transcription (5Müller H. Beato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whereas the action of progesterone is probably mediated by an upstream enhancer region containing two clusters of progesterone receptor binding sites (6Jantzen C. Fritton H.P. Igo-Kemenes T. Espel E.

Redeuilh G. Theis K. Suske G. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the promoter of the endogenous uteroglobin gene by genomic footprinting in endometrial epithelium from uterus in situ. Upon hormone treatment, we detect endometrium-specific occupancy of the noncanonical ERE in the promoter. Concomitantly, we observe estrogen-dependent recruitment of Sp1 to an adjacent site, which proved to be functionally essential for estrogen induction of the promoter. We provide evidence that Sp1 but not the related transcription factor Sp3 (8Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) mediates estrogen induction. Within this composite unit, the estrogen receptor (ER) and Sp1 bind noncooperatively in vitro. Synergistic binding in vivo could involve the chromatin configuration of DNA, since estrogen treatment induces a change in the chromatin structure of the promoter documented by the appearance of a prominent DNase I-hypersensitive site. For the construction of the uteroglobin promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid, a HindIII (−395) to XhoI (+14) uteroglobin promoter fragment (9Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the pXP2 plasmid (10Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter linker-scanner mutants were generated from similar constructs (9Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar). Further mutations were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (11Barettino D. Feigenbutz M. Valcarcel R. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 541-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The following expression plasmids for insect cells were used: for the expression of OctI, pPacOct (kindly supplied by C. Möws (12Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1988; 12: 1582-1599Crossref Scopus (474) Google Scholar)); for human ER (13Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), pPacER (constructed and provided by G. Suske); for Sp1, pPacSp1 (14Courey A.J. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). DMS footprinting was performed according to Ref. 16Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S. Mueller P.R. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar. In brief, endometrial epithelium or liver cells were exposed to 0.2% DMS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by washing several times with phosphate-buffered saline. Epithelial cells were separated, and genomic DNA was prepared, cleaved with piperidine, and submitted to a ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction as described (17Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The following gene-specific oligonucleotides were used: for the upper strand, ERA1 (GATCCTGGGTGCTCCT), ERA2 (TCACAGCCACTTGGGCCTCAGC), and ERA3 (GGCCTCAGCTTCTCCTGTGACAGG); for the lower strand, ER1 (ACTGCATTATTTACTTGGG), ER2 (CATTGACTTGGTGGGATAAGTAAATATTCCC), and ER3 (TTCCCTTTTCTCAATCCAGTTTCCATCCC). Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared according to Ref. 18Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar. The following double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were used: GTI, named Sp, containing a uteroglobin Sp-binding site (−232 to −223) (8Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar); a uteroglobin promoter (Fnu4HI–HpaII) fragment comprising an ERE and Sp-binding site (−304 to −207) or the respective linker-scanner mutants (9Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar); and a consensus ERE (19Truss M. Chalepakis G. Slater E.P. Mader S. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The gel-purified oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled by the Klenow filling-in reaction, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed through gel filtration. Recombinant human ER was expressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection with the expression plasmid HEGO (13Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Sp1 (20Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and ER (21Greene G.L. Sobel N.B. King W.J. Jensen E.V. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 20: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min at room temperature. Poly(dI-dC) and calf thymus DNA were added as nonspecific competitor, and binding buffers were as described in Ref. 22Schauer M. Chalepakis G. Willmann T. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar but containing 3 mm ZnCl2. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before loading on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. 10−7m diethylstilbestrol was included in experiments with ER. Gels were run in 0.5-fold Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 7 V/cm and room temperature for 120 min, dried, and autoradiographed. SL2 Schneider cells were maintained in Schneider's modified Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (insect cell-qualified, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 25 °C. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (23DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A 60-mm dish received 5 μg of reporter plasmid, different amounts of co-expression plasmids, and calf thymus DNA to a total of 10 μg of DNA. Hormones were added directly to the culture medium after 2.5 h of chloroquine treatment (0.1 mm). Anti-estrogen, ICI 164.384 (10−7m), was eventually applied to noninduced cells to further reduce basal reporter expression (24Bondy K.L. Zacharewski T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5277-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and extracts were prepared. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and normalized to protein concentration, since co-expressed Sp transcription factors might have affected standardization with an internal reporter plasmid (26Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Thurston S.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Adult ½- to 1-year-old female New Zealand White or chinchilla bastard rabbits (3–4 kg) were housed in individual cages under controlled conditions of temperature and light (12 h light-dark) and were kept separated from male rabbits to prevent pheromone-triggered ovulation. Pseudopregnancy was induced by hCG (Ekluton, Vemie Veterinär Chemie, Kempen) injection (200 IU/kg of body weight) intramuscularly at day 0. Animals were killed at day 4 by lethal injection of T61 (Hoechst, Germany) in the ear vein. The uterus and liver were rapidly excised and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. Details of the method used to isolate, cultivate, and transfect endometrial epithelium cells will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the inner luminal surface of the uterus was incubated with collagenase at 37 °C and flushed, and cells were collected by centrifugation. The suspension of cells was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on polystyrene culture dishes. The medium was supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were cultivated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The purity of the primary cell preparation was determined by immunocytochemistry employing an antibody against rabbit uteroglobin. Transient transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Hormones were added to the medium as ethanolic solution immediately after transfection, and incubation was continued for 48 h. Diethylstilbestrol was used as estrogen agonist, and ICI 164,384 (24Bondy K.L. Zacharewski T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5277-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used as as anti-estrogen. An equivalent amount of solvent was used as control. Treatment of cells with DNase I was performed as described (17Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). 6 μg of genomic DNA were cleaved with PvuII, resolved in 1.2% agarose gel, and blotted on Biodyne A nylon membrane (Pall, Dreieich). Hybridization was carried out with a radioactively labeled (PvuII-BamHI) uteroglobin gene fragment (+193 to +9) according to Ref. 28Church G.M. Gilbert W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar. Quantitative evaluation was performed directly from the dried gels applying phosphor screen autoradiography using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) or from autoradiographs using laser scanner and ScanPack software (Biometra, Göttingen). Expression of the rabbit uteroglobin gene in epithelial cells of the endometrium is induced by estrogen and progesterone (5Müller H. Beato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using in vitro DNA binding experiments and transient gene transfer, we have defined a noncanonical ERE located around −258 (7Slater E.P. Redeuilh G. Theis K. Suske G. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and three Sp-binding sites (also referred to as GC/GT boxes) located around −225, −200, and −65, respectively (9Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To determine the role of these putative regulatory elements in hormone induction in vivo, we have studied their occupancy by the genomic footprinting technique (16Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S. Mueller P.R. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Since there are no suitable endometrial cell lines available, we have applied the DMS footprinting technique to the rabbit endometrial epithelium in situ after hormonal treatment of the animal. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis of the modified and piperidine-cleaved DNA revealed two hormone-dependent footprints in the promoter region between −300 and −200, which appeared in the endometrial epithelium but not in liver (Fig. 1 B). Protection of three guanine residues over the ERE was found in both strands (open triangles), whereas a hypermethylated guanine residue was found in the lower strand (filled triangle). When compared with the liver lanes and taking as reference an unchanged band just upstream of the ERE, the protection in the upper strand was 30% in average for the three guanines. Over the adjacent GC/GT box, five guanine residues were protected in the lower strand and a single guanine in the upper strand. The corresponding residues are indicated in the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1 A. The footprints were observed in the hormonally induced endometrial epithelium but not in the uninduced endometrial epithelium from oestrus female rabbits (Fig. 1 C, and see below). These footprints over the ERE and over the adjacent GC/GT box never appeared singly but always pairwise after various hormonal treatment leading to induction of the promoter. Interestingly, no prominent footprints were observed over the other putative GC/GT boxes located further proximally (data not shown). The distal footprint extended from −264 to −252. The pattern of protected guanines resembles an in vitro footprint formerly described for the ER (7Slater E.P. Redeuilh G. Theis K. Suske G. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We verified that estrogens produced by the ovaries upon hCG stimulation are responsible for the induced footprint over the ERE by exposing the explanted uterus from oestrus animals to estrogen treatment. A footprint was induced when specific ligands of the ER, such as the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol, were applied. The observed pattern resembled the footprints from pseudopregnant animals treated with hCG described above (Fig. 1, compare B and C). An estrogen-dependent in vivofootprint over the ERE was detectable as early as 30 min after hormone treatment (data not shown) and was visible for at least 4 h, suggesting a direct estrogen response. Similarly to the pairwise occurrence of footprints in hCG-induced endometrial epithelium, estrogen treatment of uterus explants elicited the concomitant occupancy of the ERE and the adjacent GC/GT box (Fig. 1 C). An in vitro approach was chosen to identify the binding proteins at their respective sites. A DNA fragment encompassing both relevant regions was incubated with nuclear extracts of the endometrial epithelium from hCG-induced animals and subjected to EMSA. Two specifically retarded bands were observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). The faster migrating band was supershifted by an antibody to ER and, therefore, corresponds to the bound ER (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), whereas the slower band was supershifted by an antibody against Sp1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 2; see below). Moreover, the faster band was competed by an excess of a consensus ERE oligonucleotide, while the slower band was competed by an oligonucleotide carrying a binding site for Sp factors (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Consistently, a mutation in the ERE eliminated the faster band, whereas a mutation in the GC/GT box eliminated the slower band (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 6, respectively). Similar results were obtained in binding experiments using recombinant purified Sp1 expressed in vaccinia virus and recombinant human ER expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). The identity of the genomic footprints found in vivo was further proven by comparison with corresponding footprints generatedin vitro. Both recombinant proteins, the baculovirus-expressed human ER and the vaccinia virus-expressed Sp1, protected virtually the same guanine residues as mapped in vivo (Fig. 1 D). The same protection pattern was found when examining the retarded complexes obtained with extracts of induced endometrial epithelium that were immunologically identified as the endogenous ER and Sp1 (data not shown). The identity of contacts in both strands suggests that the genomic footprints originated from binding of ligand-activated ER and from Sp1. According to binding studies in vitro and gene transfer experiments, two additional putative Sp-binding sites in the uteroglobin promoter have been proposed (9Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To reveal the functional significance of the various Sp-binding sites, we performed transient transfection experiments in primary epithelial cells from the endometrium. We selected linker-scanning mutations that affect Sp factor binding to the individual GC/GT boxes (9Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The wild type uteroglobin gene promoter fragment spanning from −395 to +14 conferred moderate estrogen inducibility to the reporter (Fig. 3 A,line 1), in accordance with the estrogen induction of uteroglobin transcription observed in intact animals (5Müller H. Beato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation of the ERE completely abolished induction, confirming its function as a response element (Fig. 3 A, line 2). Unexpectedly, mutation of the GC/GT box adjacent to the ERE drastically reduced estrogen induction (Fig. 3 A, line 3), whereas mutations of the more promoter-proximal GC/GT boxes, at −195 and at −65, did not reduce estrogen induction but consistently resulted in slightly higher induction (Fig. 3 A, lines 4 and 5, respectively). Combination of these individual mutants completely abolished estrogen induction (Fig. 3 A,lines 6–8). This experiment demonstrates that estrogen-activated transcription requires not only binding of the activated receptor to its response element but also a synergistic interaction with another unrelated transcription factor, namely one of the Sp factors bound to the adjacent GC/GT box. Interestingly, the basal transcription rate was differently affected by these mutations. Mutation in the GC/GT box at −65 led to a strong decrease in basal activity, whereas the two more distal GC/GT boxes exhibited weaker effects, suggesting a differential role of these sites for basal and activated transcription. Since the Sp family of transcription factors includes several members with similar affinities for GC/GT boxes (8Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 15Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 29Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we performed co-transfection experiments with ER in SL2 insect cells, which are devoid of endogenous Sp factors (14Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The co-transfected ER alone conferred only weak estrogen induction to a reporter gene driven by the uteroglobin promoter; but estrogen induction was significantly enhanced by co-expression of Sp1, whereas a comparable co-expression of Sp3 had no such effect (Fig. 3 B). Since Sp1 and Sp3 were expressed at similar levels in insect cells (20Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and Sp1 is the most abundant GC/GT box binding activity in nuclear extracts of endometrial tissue (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 5), we tentatively conclude that Sp1 participates in the estrogen-dependent activation of the uteroglobin gene. The contribution of other GC/GT box-binding factors, such as Sp4 or BTEB (30Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujiikuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), in the tissue-specific activation of the gene was not tested, since these proteins were not detectable in the tissue extracts by EMSA (8Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). The recruitment of Sp1 to its binding site triggered by the binding of the liganded ER could be due to cooperative DNA binding of the two factors. To test this hypothesis, we performed a titration experiment with the recombinant human ER and Sp1 proteins and a DNA fragment comprising the ERE and the adjacent GC/GT box. In the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of both factors, a ternary complex containing ERE and Sp1 was observed (Fig. 2 B,lanes 8 and 11–16), as verified by methylation protection (data not shown). A similar gel retardation experiment was performed with DNA fragments mutated in either the ERE or the GT/GC box. As expected, the retarded band corresponding to the mutated site was not visible, and no ternary complex was detected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 17 and 18). A quantitation of the different DNA-bound proteins as resolved by EMSA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 13–16), reveals a linear function between the amount of added ER and the appearance of the ternary complex (Fig. 2 C). These data exclude a significant cooperativity in binding of ER and Sp1 to the corresponding region in the promoter in vitro. An alternative explanation for the simultaneous binding of ER and Sp1 in vivo would be a hormone-induced alteration in chromatin structure, which could facilitate Sp1 binding. To assess this possibility, we measured the sensitivity of nuclear chromosomal DNA toward nucleolytic agents like DNase I or methidiumpropyl-EDTA. In nuclei treated with DNase I, already at the lowest enzyme concentration used, a narrow hypersensitive site was found at position −80 exclusively in the endometrial epithelium of hormonally induced animals (Fig. 4 A). The same region was also hypersensitive toward methidiumpropyl-EDTA (data not shown). Thus transcriptional activation of the uteroglobin gene promoter is accompanied by an alteration of the nucleoprotein organization as indicated by the preferential accessibility toward nucleolytic agents at a precise position of the promoter. DNA regulatory elements can be identified in transfection experiments in cell culture, but the ultimate definition of sequences involved in the regulation of a particular gene can only be accomplished by studies in the intact tissue or even in the animal. One way to approach this goal is to analyze the regulatory regions of DNA using genomic footprinting techniques to identify sites that are occupied in vivo under physiologically relevant conditions (28Church G.M. Gilbert W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). This type of experiment has usually been performed with cell lines in culture, with the well known limitations imposed by immortalization and artificial culture conditions. Here, we report the molecular analysis of steroid hormone effects in the native endometrial epithelium performed in an organ explant and applied to the rabbit uteroglobin gene. This methodology also allows us to monitor the pharmacological effects of related therapeutic agents in the complex background of the intact animal. The predictions derived from these studies have been experimentally tested via gene transfer in a homogenous and nearly authentic cellular system, i.e.primary cells from the endometrial epithelium. Previous gene transfer experiments led to the independent identification of a noncanonical ERE and several GC/GT boxes in the rabbit uteroglobin promoter, but the contribution of these elements to gene regulation was unclear since the experiments were carried out in cells not expressing the endogenous uteroglobin gene (7Slater E.P.

Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, it was not known whether the GC/GT elements participate in hormonal induction of the uteroglobin gene. The results of genomic footprinting experiments in the endometrial epithelium in situ demonstrate a selective behavior of the different GC/GT boxes, namely the simultaneous occupancy of the ERE and only the adjacent GC/GT box following induction of uteroglobin gene expression during early pseudopregnancy. A similar pattern was observed when animals were treated only with estrogens, although the extent of the observed changes was less pronounced, probably reflecting cooperative hormonal effects throughout early pseudopregnancy. Altogether, these findings suggest a permissive role for the liganded ER in the occupancy of the adjacent GC/GT box. Binding experiments with nuclear extracts from induced endometrial cells and with recombinant purified proteins suggest that the factors responsible for the observed in vivo footprints are the ER and members of the Sp family of transcription factors. In addition to the ERE, the integrity of the adjacent GC/GT box was essential for estrogen induction in primary endometrial cells. In transfection experiments in insect cells, which lack Sp factors, ER alone was insufficient for estrogen-dependent induction of the uteroglobin promoter. Since Sp1 was able to transcriptionally synergize with ER, while Sp3 is virtually inactive and represents only a minor fraction of GC/GT box-binding protein in endometrial epithelium extracts, we assume that Sp1 is the protein mediating the synergistic occupancy of ERE and GC/GT box. Sp3 has been shown to contain an inhibitory domain that represses transactivation mediated by Sp1 (15Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility of modulating the estrogen response by changes in the cellular level of Sp3 relative to Sp1 should be considered (31Saceda M. Grunt T.W. Colomer R. Lippman M.E. Lupu R. Martin M.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4322-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The simultaneous occupancy of the adjacent ERE and GC/GT box could be due to protein-protein interactions, which would imply cooperative binding of the two proteins to their respective sites. However, although ER and Sp1 can bind to a promoter fragment simultaneously, quantitative binding experiments do not reveal a significant binding cooperativity in vitro. Other factors could be involved in synergistic binding of ER and Sp1. Co-activators, such as CBP/p300, have been suggested to participate in Sp1 and ER transactivation and could therefore mediate, directly or indirectly, their synergism (32Hanstein B. Eckner R. DiRenzo J. Halachmi S. Liu H. Searcy B. Kurokawa R. Brown M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11540-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Such multiple interactions between regulatory proteins could be difficult to reproduce in cell-free binding reactions, since the concentration of some partners in crude nuclear extracts might be limiting. Multiple interactions of ER and Sp1 with components of the basal transcription machinery, such as TATA box binding protein-associated proteins, have been described (33Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G.

Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), which could mediate the functional synergism (36Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Their particular role in synergistic recruitment of the transcriptional preinitiation complex could be investigated in reconstituted in vitro transcribing systems. An alternative explanation could involve the chromatin context of the DNA template. It is conceivable that ER and Sp1 do synergize for DNA binding on chromatin, although they do not synergize on free DNA, a behavior that has been described for other factors (37Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 38Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with nucleosomes assembled on uteroglobin promoter DNA would be required to clarify this issue. Finally, hormone-dependent chromatin remodeling could possibly explain the observed synergism. Binding of ligand-activated ER to the uteroglobin ERE in chromatin could induce a change in the chromatin structure required for entry or access of Sp1 to the promoter. This mechanism is supported by the appearance of a hormone-inducible DNase I-hypersensitive site in the active promoter chromatin. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the glucocorticoid- or progestin-induced binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor NF1 to the murine mammary tumor virus promoter (17Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 39Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, further knowledge about the nucleosomal organization of the uteroglobin promoter is required. A similar hormone-dependent binding of sequence-specific transcription factors to the vicinity of a steroid hormone-responsive element has been observed for the estrogen-inducible apo-very low density lipoprotein II promoter (41Wijnholds J.

Thus, hormone-dependent recruitment of ubiquitous transcription factors to nearby and topologically restricted sites may be a crucial mechanism of hormonal gene regulation (45Schippers I.J.

https://openalex.org/W2107575431,"A structure-based model describing the interaction of the two-domain PI-SceI endonuclease with its 31-base pair DNA substrate suggests that the endonuclease domain (domain II) contacts the cleavage site region of the substrate, while the protein splicing domain (domain I) interacts with a distal region that is sufficient for high affinity binding. To support this model, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to assemble a set of 49 PI-SceI mutant proteins that were purified and assayed for their DNA binding and cleavage properties. Fourteen mutant proteins were 4- to >500-fold less active than wild-type PI-SceI in cleavage assays, and one mutant (T225A) was 3-fold more active. Alanine substitution at two positions in domain I reduces overall binding >60-fold by perturbing the interaction of PI-SceI with the minimal binding region. Conversely, mutations in domain II have little effect on binding, reduce binding to the cleavage site region only, or affect binding to both regions. Interestingly, substitutions at Lys301, which is part of the endonucleolytic active site, eliminate binding to the cleavage site region but permit contact with the minimal binding region. This experimental evidence demonstrates that the protein splicing domain as well as the endonuclease domain is involved in binding of a DNA substrate with the requisite length.

This experimental evidence demonstrates that the protein splicing domain as well as the endonuclease domain is involved in binding of a DNA substrate with the requisite length. The yeast PI-SceI endonuclease catalyzes the hydrolysis of two specific phosphodiester bonds within an asymmetrical recognition site (1Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This enzyme is a homing endonuclease (for a review, see Ref.2Mueller J.E. Bryk M. Loizos N. Belfort M. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 111-143Google Scholar) that occurs as an intein situated within an H+-ATPase protein subunit. Like other homing endonucleases, PI-SceI recognizes an extremely long sequence (31 bp) 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA. and cuts DNA to yield 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl ends (3Gimble F.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21844-21853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and biochemical studies indicate that the PI-SceI recognition sequence can be divided into two regions (4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Region I contains the cleavage site that is cut by the enzyme to generate a 4-base pair overhang, and region II includes an adjacent 17-bp sequence (the minimal binding sequence) that is sufficient for high affinity binding. Mutagenesis of the substrate reveals that PI-SceI tolerates substitutions at numerous positions, since substitutions at only nine positions in the substrate lead to severely reduced activity (4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Like the other homing endonucleases that have been studied, PI-SceI requires Mg2+ as a cofactor. The metal ion is likely to be required for the hydrolytic reaction, since it is required for catalysis but not for specific binding. Mn2+ can substitute for Mg2+, and it stimulates more efficient cleavage by the enzyme at cognate and noncognate sites (1Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 5Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of PI-SceI has been recently determined by x-ray crystallography and reveals a bipartite domain structure (6Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Domain I contains the protein splicing active site, which is composed of the N- and C-terminal amino acids and two other His residues that have been shown to be required for activity or have been implicated in the reaction (7Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The residues that compose the putative endonucleolytic active site, a lysine (Lys301) and two aspartic acid residues (Asp218 and Asp326), are present in domain II and form a catalytic triad that displays structural similarity to charged clusters found in restriction enzymes (6Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 9Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By using the PI-SceI structural information and the knowledge that the enzyme contacts two discrete regions of the recognition sequence, a model for the docking of PI-SceI with its substrate was constructed where domains I and II of the protein contact regions II and I, respectively, of the substrate (Fig. 1). In this model, both domains are proposed to contact the substrate, since the binding surface on the endonuclease domain alone is insufficient to contact the entire 31-bp recognition sequence. A bend of ∼55° was introduced into the middle of the substrate to accommodate the angular orientation of the two domains with respect to each other, and experimental evidence confirms the existence of this distortion (4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the scissile bonds of the DNA were placed in close proximity to Asp218and Asp326, which are thought to bind the Mg2+co-factor. Two symmetry-related β-sheets (sheets 7 and 9) in domain II that flank the active site aspartic acid residues may serve as platforms that contact the cleavage site region. Furthermore, we speculate that a pair of β-hairpin loops between β15 and β16 and between β21 and β22 that lie above the sheets contain amino acids whose side chains mediate substrate binding. The interaction of domain I with region II of the substrate may involve a cluster of positively charged amino acids situated along the same face of PI-SceI as the endonucleolytic active site. The structure of a second homing endonuclease, I-CreI, was recently reported, and a model for its binding to DNA bears similarity to that proposed for PI-SceI (10Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). I-CreI is a homodimeric protein that resembles domain II of PI-SceI, but it lacks the protein splicing domain. Like PI-SceI, I-CreI contains a set of β-sheet structures with interconnecting extended loops that are proposed to form the protein interface that binds the DNA substrate. To determine the identity of amino acid residues involved in contacting the PI-SceI recognition sequence, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to create a set of mutant proteins with single amino acid changes at numerous positions on the proposed DNA binding interface. These mutant proteins were purified and assayed for their substrate cleavage and DNA binding activities. The major finding of the work is that residues in both domains mediate DNA binding. Moreover, the binding behaviors of wild-type PI-SceI and several mutants provide compelling evidence for a high affinity interaction between domain I and the minimal binding region and for a substantially weaker association between domain II and the cleavage site region. TALON metal affinity resin and TALONspin columns were obtained from CLONTECH. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Wild-type and mutant PI-SceI proteins were expressed from plasmid pET PI-SceI C-His, which encodes a 479-amino acid PI-SceI derivative containing a polyhistidine C-terminal extension that facilitates rapid protein purification by metal affinity chromatography. To construct pET PI-SceI C-His, PCR mutagenesis (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) was used to insert six silent restriction sites (SpeI, ApaI, BssHII,BstEII, BsiWI, and MluI sites at positions 243, 406, 484, 717, 813, and 943, respectively, relative to the first codon) into plasmid pET23PI-Sce ESARC (9Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pET23PI-Sce-9. Plasmid pET23PI-Sce-9 was used as a template in a PCR reaction with two oligonucleotides (5′-TTCGGATCCGCGACCCATTTTGCATGGACGACAACCT-3′ and 5′-CGGTACGCGTGAAACATTTCTG-3′) to generate a 449-bp fragment. This product was digested with MluI and BamHI and ligated into MluI/BamHI-digested pET23PI-Sce-9 DNA to create pET PI-SceI C-His. The entire PI-SceI coding region of pET PI-SceI C-His was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Omitting the N-terminal methionine residue, pET PI-SceI encodes a 479-amino acid PI-SceI derivative with a C-terminal tail having the sequence KWVADPNSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH-COOH. Protein splicing-mediated cleavage of the C-terminal affinity tag was prevented by substituting Asn454 with alanine. To introduce mutations into the PI-SceI coding sequence, oligonucleotide primers were used in either cassette mutagenesis or two-step overlapping PCR amplification protocols (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). All introduced mutations and inserted sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Plasmid pET PI-SceI C-His encoding wild-type or mutant PI-SceI proteins was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). For most of the mutant proteins characterized, a 200-ml culture was grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1 mmNaOH) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.6–0.8. Expression of PI-SceI protein was induced with 0.5–1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued overnight at 15 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 mm imidazole, and lysed by sonication (3 × 1 min) at 4 °C. All further manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The clarified lysate was applied to a TALON spin column (0.5 ml of TALON metal affinity resin) pre-equilibrated with sonication buffer, and the metal affinity columns were inverted for 5 min and centrifuged at 700 ×g for 2 min. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of sonication buffer containing 1 mm imidazole, and PI-SceI was eluted from the columns with sonication buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Elution fractions containing PI-SceI, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and dialyzed overnight in buffer D (10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 40 mm KCl (buffer D40). The dialyzed protein was applied to a 1-ml SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer D40, the resin was washed with 2.5 ml of buffer D40, and protein was eluted with 10 × 1 ml of buffer D450. Elution fractions containing purified PI-SceI were pooled and stored in storage buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol) at −20 °C. For some PI-SceI proteins, similar protocols were used to purify the enzyme from 1-liter cultures. The PI-SceI proteins were purified to greater than 95% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The affinity-tagged PI-SceI (Mr = 53,800) concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of 5.03 × 104/m/cm as determined by published methods (12Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein had the same specific activity as native PI-SceI. 2F. S. Gimble, unpublished results. To detect protein-DNA complexes in DNA mobility shift analyses, a 219-bp duplex DNA fragment containing a single PI-SceI recognition site was synthesized by PCR and labeled with [32P]ATP as described previously (4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured using a 189-bp duplex DNA fragment that was identical in all respects except that it lacked the PI-SceI recognition site. Each reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 fmol of 219-bp substrate (5′-32P-labeled at both ends), and PI-SceI as specified and was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis through a 7% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE at 210 V for 5 min and then at 120 V for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The amounts of bound and unbound substrate were determined using a PhosphorImager and FragmeNT Analysis software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel to film was used to visualize the unbound DNA and the PI-SceI-DNA complexes. The PI-SceI reaction pathway can be described by Scheme I (Fig. 2), where the free protein (Pf) and DNA (Df) interact to form the lower protein-DNA complex (PDLC) that involves PI-SceI contacts to region II of the substrate (4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PDLC is in equilibrium with the upper complex, PDUC, where PI-SceI contacts both regions I and II of the substrate. A second pathway for PDUC formation is possible involving a complex where PI-SceI contacts region I only (PDx), but this complex has not been observed. The PDUC complex binds Mg2+ and forms the putative pentavalent phosphate transition state that undergoes double-stranded scission. PI-SceI is proposed to remain tightly bound to the region II cleavage product following the reaction. The thermodynamic parameters K1 and K2 in Scheme I (Fig. 2) can be expressed as follows, K1=[Pf][Df][PDLC]Equation 1 K2=[PDLC][PDUC]Equation 2 where [Pf] = [PT] (the total protein concentration) − [PDLC] − [PDUC] and [Df] = [DT] − [PDLC] − [PDUC]. Under conditions where the total DNA concentration is much less than the total protein concentration ([DT] ≪ [PT]), [Pf] ≈ [PT], and K1 can be expressed as follows. K1=[PT]([DT]−[PDLC]−[PDUC])[PDLC]Equation 3 Substitution into Equation 3 with expressions for θLC, the fraction of DNA bound as PDLC (where θLC = [PDLC]/[DT]), and for θUC, the fraction of DNA bound as PDUC (where θUC = [PDUC]/[DT]), yields the following. K1=[PT](1−θLC−θUC)θLCEquation 4 Similarly, substitution into the expression forK2 with θLC and θUCyields the following. K2=θLCθUCEquation 5 Values for K1 and K2 were determined by nonlinear regression of the gel mobility shift data to Equations 4 and 5 using KaleidaGraph software (Abelbeck Software). Under the conditions of the assay, these equations are valid, because the total protein concentration [PT] is much greater than the total DNA concentration [DT]. In addition to wild-type PI-SceI, the R90A, R94A, T225A, R231A, D232A, Y328A, T338A, and H343A mutant proteins also formed PDLC and PDUC complexes, and binding could be represented by Scheme I (Fig. 2). Complete binding curves for the R90A and R94A proteins could not be generated due to the low level of binding. However, an estimate of theK1 × K2 value could be made, since K1× K2 = [PT] when θUB = θUC, where θUB is the fraction of total DNA that is unbound. The K301A, K301E, and H377A mutants only formed the PDLCcomplex even at high protein concentration. No equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for the D229A, K301R, K340A, and K369A proteins, since the PDUC complexes migrated faster than that of wild-type PI-SceI and could not be adequately resolved from the PDLC complex. In an initial characterization of the PI-SceI proteins, purified enzyme (50–150 nm) was incubated with XmnI-linearized pBS-PISce36 (7 nm) (4Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in 15 μl of cleavage buffer (100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mmMgCl2) for 30 min and 1 h at 37 °C. On the basis of these assays, mutant proteins that were determined to be partially or fully defective in cleavage activity were assayed with purified PI-SceI proteins (100 nm) under the same conditions for various lengths of time. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (w/v) Ficoll). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1 × TBE on a 0.9% agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The amounts of undigested plasmid DNA and the two cleavage products were determined using a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Cleavage rates were calculated from curve fitting of the linear portions of the reaction using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). To identify the amino acid residues that participate in substrate binding, we introduced amino acid substitutions into the domain II platform and loop regions and into the positively charged region of domain I that is predicted from the model to contact the DNA. In domain II, substitutions were made in β14, β15, and β16 in one of the two symmetry-related platforms and in β19, β20, β21, and β22 in the other (Table I). Substitutions were also made at the active site at Lys301 and Pro304, two highly conserved residues situated in block D, a conserved motif found in homing endonucleases and maturases (7Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In domain I, substitutions were introduced at amino acids Arg90, Arg91, Arg94, and Lys97, which comprise the cluster of positive charges thought to bind the DNA. In general, amino acid residues with side chains containing putative hydrogen bond donors or acceptors were targeted, since hydrogen bonds are frequently important components of protein-DNA interactions. Alanine substitutions were introduced, since this residue lacks hydrogen bond partners and it would be expected to exert minimal steric or electrostatic effects on structure. To investigate the effect of charge changes at Lys301, substitution was made at this position with arginine, which maintains the positive charge, and with glutamic acid, which introduces a negative charge.Table ILocation of PI-SceI mutants and preliminary DNA cleavage analysisPI-SceI allele1-aIndicates the positions where mutations were introduced into the PI-SceI sequence.

Open table in a new tab A total of 49 mutant PI-SceI derivatives were generated containing substitutions at four positions in domain I and 43 positions in domain II (Table I). Cultures of E. coli strains harboring plasmids that expressed the mutant proteins were grown and induced to overexpress PI-SceI. The levels of PI-SceI protein varied for each of the mutants following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and ranged from approximately 2% to greater than 10% of total cell protein. The only exception was the D371A derivative, which could not be purified in sufficient quantities to accurately study. However, a low level of activity was observed with this derivative. 3Z. He and F. S. Gimble, unpublished results. The PI-SceI proteins were purified by chromatography on a Co2+ metal affinity resin. All enzymes adhered to this column matrix and could be eluted using 300 mm imidazole, just as for the wild-type protein. After this column, the proteins were approximately 90% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.3 Following the affinity purification step, the proteins were further purified using chromatography on SP-Sepharose. All of the mutant proteins and wild-type PI-SceI bound to the SP-Sepharose column and could be eluted using buffer containing 450 mm KCl. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were judged to be >95% pure.3 The 48 mutant proteins that were successfully purified were tested for their ability to cleave a PI-SceI recognition site on linearized plasmid pBS-PISce36. In initial experiments designed to quickly identify mutant derivatives that were partially or completely defective in cleavage activity, an approximately 50–150 nm concentration of PI-SceI protein was incubated with a 7 nmconcentration of linearized substrate under standard reaction conditions in buffer containing MgCl2. Table I shows that 34 of 48 mutant proteins tested had at least 25% of the activity of wild-type PI-SceI. These results reveal that mutations can be made at numerous positions in the protein proximal to the active site with little or no effect on activity. Of the remaining mutants examined, 12 (R90A, R94A, D229A, R231A, D232A, K301R, Y328A, T338A, K340A, H343A, K369A, and H377A) were partially active (activity levels less than 25% of wild-type activity) and two displayed no activity (K301A and K301E). Surprisingly, one mutant protein (T225A) was at least 3 times more active than wild-type PI-SceI. More detailed rate experiments were performed for the partially or fully defective proteins and for the enhanced activity protein in reaction buffers containing either MgCl2 or MnCl2. These experiments were carried out under single turnover conditions (excess enzyme relative to substrate). Steady state conditions could not be achieved, since PI-SceI remains tightly bound to one of the two cleavage products (5Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), yielding a low turnover number. The amount of linearized substrate that was cleaved to form the two products was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the cleavage activities are shown in Table II. In the buffer containing Mg2+, 25% of the substrate was cleaved by wild-type PI-SceI in approximately 5 min. By contrast, for two of the mutant proteins (K301A and K301E), no cleavage activity was apparent after 4 h of incubation, and for two others (D229A and K340A), only trace amounts of cleavage products were detected. The reaction rates for these mutant proteins were too slow to measure accurately, and we estimate that their activities are at least 500 times lower than that of wild-type PI-SceI. Of the remaining 10 defective mutants, four were >20-fold less active than wild-type PI-SceI (R90A, R94A, Y328A, and H377A), and five were 4–20-fold less active (R231A, D232A, K301R, T338A, H343A, and K369A). The PI-SceI protein with enhanced activity, T225A, cleaved the DNA substrate over 3 times faster than the wild-type protein in the presence of Mg2+.Table IICleavage activity of wild-type and mutant PI-SceI proteinsMg2+Mn2+Activity × 10−32-aUnits are m DNA cleaved/min ×m enzyme.Relative activity2-bRelative activity is the ratio of the mutant to wild-type activities.Activity × 10−3Relative activityWild type3.9 ± 0.4133 ± 31R90A0.18 ± 0.010.0521 ± 10.6R94A0.042 ± 0.0050.0118 ± 10.6T225A13 ± 13ND2-cND, not determined.ND2-cND, not determined.D229A2-dAccurate measurements of activity could not be made because only trace levels of cleavage products were observed.

A 322-base pair cDNA fragment that was consistently induced by the synthetic androgen R1881 revealed 100% homology with the human phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2a isozyme very recently reported by Kai et al. (PAP-2a; Kai., M., Wada, I., Imai, S.-i., Sakane, F., and Kanoh, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 24572–24578). The fragment was used to clone the corresponding cDNA from a human prostate library. The deduced amino acid sequence confirmed the identity with human PAP-2a. The inducibility of PAP-2a mRNA by androgens was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization. The effect was time- and dose-dependent with a maximal stimulation (4-fold) after 24 h of treatment with 10−9m R1881. The steroid specificity of PAP-2a mRNA regulation was found to be in agreement with the aberrant ligand specificity of the mutated androgen receptor in LNCaP cells, supporting the involvement of the androgen receptor in the induction process. Furthermore, low basal levels of PAP-2a mRNA and absence of androgen inducibility were observed in the poorly differentiated and androgen receptor-negative cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. Induction of PAP-2a mRNA was not affected by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and was accompanied by a marked increase in PAP-2 activity as measured by the conversion of phosphatidic acid into diacylglycerol in membrane fractions of LNCaP. Comparison of the expression of PAP-2a mRNA in 50 different human tissues revealed ubiquitous expression. The highest levels, however, were observed in the prostate. Since PAP-2 plays a pivotal role in the control of signal transduction by lipid mediators such as phosphatidate, lysophosphatidate, and ceramide-1-phosphate, the ability of androgens to stimulate the expression and activity of this enzyme in prostatic cells may provide an important opportunity for cross-talk between signaling pathways involving lipid mediators and androgens.

The human prostate is a prototypical androgen-dependent organ. Androgens are required not only for its normal development and growth, but also for its structural and functional integrity (1Cunha G. Donjacour A. Cooke P. Mee S. Bigsby R. Higgins S. Sugimura Y. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 338-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 2Davies P. Eaton C.L. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 131: 5-17Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The prostate is also a main site for androgen-related pathology. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common proliferative disorder of any internal organ and prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Western males and the second leading cause of male cancer death (3Carter H.B. Coffey D.S. Prostate. 1990; 16: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4McConnell J.D. J. Androl. 1991; 12: 356-363PubMed Google Scholar). Androgens are undoubtedly involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases but their exact role remains elusive. In fact, the mechanisms by which androgens affect proliferation, differentiation, and function of the normal and diseased human prostate remain poorly understood. To get a more complete picture of the effects of androgens on human prostatic epithelial cells and to select novel candidate genes for detailed studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, our laboratory is exploring different strategies. An antiserum directed against the proteins in prostatic fluid has been used successfully to screen a prostate cDNA expression library for novel androgen-regulated secreted proteins (5Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, a differential display (6Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) approach has been adapted to permit a broader search for androgen-regulated mRNAs in the prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP. LNCaP cells are the only human prostatic epithelial cells which are routinely available and which remain androgen-responsive in vitro (7Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1980; 43: 1809-1818Google Scholar). Not only their proliferation (8Schuurmans A.L.G. Bolt J. Voorhorst M. Blankenstein R. Mulder E. Int. J.

Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4468-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) remain androgen responsive. LNCaP cells display the remarkable property that androgen regulation of cell proliferation follows a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve with optimal stimulation at 10−10m R1881 (a synthetic androgen) and less stimulation or even growth inhibition at higher concentrations (8Schuurmans A.L.G. Bolt J. Voorhorst M. Blankenstein R. Mulder E. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 42: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Kokontis J. Takakura K. Hay N. Liao S.

Parameters of differentiated function, however, such as the production of prostate-specific antigen follow a classical hyperbolic dose-response curve with a maximal response at high concentrations of androgens (10−8m R1881). Using a differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: DD-PCR, differential display polymerase chain reaction; CT-FCS, charcoal-treated fetal calf serum; FCS, fetal calf serum; PAP-2, phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2; bp, base pair(s). technique (6Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar), we try to identify genes that are differentially expressed at low and high concentrations of androgens. To this end, we “display” and compare the mRNA expression levels (by means of PCR fragments) in LNCaP cells that are treated with R1881 concentrations that optimally stimulate growth (10−10m) or differentiated function (10−8m). Up to now 126 primer combinations have been investigated resulting in the identification of 5 genes that are clearly regulated by androgens as confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Two of these genes are stimulated and two are inhibited at 10−8m R1881. One follows the bell-shaped dose-response curve of cell proliferation. 2W. Ulrix, J. V. Surinnen, W. Heyns, and G. Verhoeven, unpublished results. Here we report the isolation of one of the androgen-stimulated genes and its identification as a phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 (PAP-2). The sequence of the cDNA cloned from a human prostate library is identical to that of the human PAP-2a isozyme reported during the preparation of this manuscript (16Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-i.

Since PAP-2 plays an important role in the control of signal transduction by lipid mediators such as phosphatidate, lysophosphatidate, and ceramide 1-phosphate (16Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-i. Sakane F.

Human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in RPMI 1640 medium (LNCaP) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PC-3 and DU-145) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 3 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (all from Life Technologies Inc., Paisley, Scotland). To examine the effects of steroids, cells were cultured for 2 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FCS pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal (CT-FCS) as described previously (5Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Natural steroids and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma. R1881 (methyltrienolone) and mibolerone were obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Steroids were dissolved in absolute ethanol. Control cultures received similar amounts of ethanol only. Final ethanol concentrations did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). For DD-PCR and Northern hybridization, total RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells using a modified guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol extraction procedure (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Contaminating DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) in the presence of placental RNase Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). The RNA was phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. Quality and quantity of the RNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm and by Northern blot analysis. For dot-blot hybridizations, total RNA was prepared using a guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl ultracentrifugation method as described previously (5Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Northern and dot-blot hybridizations were carried out as described previously (5Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled PAP-2a cDNA probe was prepared as follows. The 322-bp DD-PCR fragment (cloned into pGEM-T plasmid; Promega, Madison, WI) was first amplified by PCR using pUC/M13 forward and reverse sequencing primers (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Approximately 20 ng of the PCR product was used in a radiolabeling reaction mixture (total volume: 12 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 15 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK), 50 μm each of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, 0.4 μm 10-mer primer 5′-TACAACGAGG-3′, 0.4 μm dT11GA primer, and 0.025 units/μlTaq DNA polymerase. PCR cycling conditions were as described for “Differential Display Analysis” (see below). A radiolabeled 18 S probe was prepared as described before (20Verhoeven G. Deboel L. Swinnen J. Rombauts L. Vanderhoydonc F. Rosseels J. Hoeben E. Heyns W. Int. J. Androl. 1995; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified using PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The mRNA DD-PCR was performed using a Differential Display Kit (Display Systems Tandill Ltd., Los Angeles, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications to the protocol. For reverse transcription, 150 ng of DNase I-treated total RNA, 2.5 μm primer (dT11MN; M,N = A, C, or G; supplied with the kit), 20 μm dNTPs, and 300 units of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) was mixed in a total volume of 32 μl and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2.5 μm downstream primer (dT11MN), 0.5 μm arbitrary 10-mer primer, 2 μm dNTPs, 2 μCi of [α-33P]dATP (Amersham Int.), 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1.1 μl of cDNA solution, and 0.5 unit of AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). PCR reactions were carried out in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer) with the following cycling parameters: one denaturation step of 3 min at 94 °C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 40 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and one extension step of 7 min at 72 °C. All DD-PCR reactions were performed at least twice under identical conditions, and loaded side by side on a 6% sequencing gel. Gels were dried and bands were visualized by autoradiography. cDNA fragments of interest were excised from the dried gel, eluted in 100 μl of boiling water, ethanol precipitated, and reamplified. The resulting PCR products were purified using a Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and were cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing of the cloned cDNA fragments was performed using Autoread sequencing kits (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and an A.L.F. automated sequencer (Pharmacia). The sequences of both strands were determined. Sequences were analyzed using the GCG Wisconsin package provided through the services of the Belgian Embnet Node (BEN). Comparison of DNA homology with the EMBL and the GenBank data bases was performed using BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipmann D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) and FASTA (22Pearson W.R. Lipmann D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) routines. An oligo(dT) and random primed cDNA library derived from prostatic tissue from a 25-year-old male (HL3111b;CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened for cDNA clones encoding PAP-2a essentially as described earlier (5Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plaque lifts with a total of 6 × 105 recombinant plaques were hybridized with a radiolabeled PAP-2a cDNA probe (0.5 × 106 cpm/ml). Positive plaques were identified by autoradiography and plaque-purified through a second round of screening. Clones were characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. Appropriate restriction fragments were subcloned into pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Microsomal fractions were prepared from LNCaP cells by resuspension of the cells in 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C the cell suspensions were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g (4 °C). Protein concentrations of the pellet fractions were measured by the BCA procedure (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For the determination of PAP activity, 1.5 μg of protein of LNCaP cell membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, in a solution containing 100 μm [14C]1-α-dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid (NEN Life Science Products), 50 mmHepes/NaOH (pH 7.0), and 3 mm Triton X-100, in a final volume of 100 μl as described by Hoër et al. (23Hoër A. Oberdisse E. Arch. Pharm. 1994; 349: 653-661Crossref Google Scholar). Equal results were obtained using 32P-labeled phosphatidic acid as substrate (23Hoër A. Oberdisse E. Arch. Pharm. 1994; 349: 653-661Crossref Google Scholar). To identify mRNAs that are regulated by androgens, DD-PCR was performed on total RNA derived from LNCaP cells treated with control medium or R1881. The synthetic androgen R1881 was selected for these studies to circumvent the rapid metabolization of natural androgens such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone and testosterone reported in LNCaP cells (24Negri-Sesi P. Motta M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10−10m R1881, a concentration that optimally stimulates growth, or with 10−8m R1881, a concentration that optimally promotes differentiation (15Esquenet M. Swinnen J.V. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Prostate. 1996; 28: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For DD-PCR reactions, 28 arbitrary 10-mer primers were combined with 9 oligo(dT) primers. Up to now, a total of 56 cDNA bands that were differentially expressed after R1881 treatment were excised, re-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. One of the DD-PCR bands that was reproducibly induced after treatment with 10−8m R1881 was a 322-bp cDNA fragment (Fig. 1). The fragment was seen after PCR with the 10-mer primer 5′-TACAACGAGG-3′ and the oligo(dT) primer dT11GA and sequencing revealed 76% nucleotide homology to both mouse (25Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-i.

To verify the androgen induction of PAP-2a expression, the cDNA fragment was used as a probe for RNA blots prepared from androgen-stimulated LNCaP cells. Only marginal effects were observed after treatment with 10−10m R1881 (data not shown), but treatment with 10−8m R1881 resulted in a 4-fold stimulation of mRNA expression (Figs. 3 and4). Moreover, the size of the PAP-2a mRNA transcript in LNCaP (about 1.8 kilobases) matched that reported for the corresponding mouse and human transcripts (16Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-i. Sakane F. Kanoh H.

Androgen receptor-positive LNCaP cells and androgen receptor-negative PC-3 and DU-145 cells were cultured for 3 days in CT-FCS. Medium was changed and cells were incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 10−8m R1881. After 3 days of treatment total RNA was prepared and 20-μg aliquots were subjected to Northern blot analysis using a radiolabeled 322-bp PAP-2a cDNA probe (top panel). The positions of PAP-2a transcripts, 18 S and 28 S rRNAs are indicated. After autoradiography the probe was removed and the blot was hybridized with an 18 S rRNA probe to demonstrate that equal amounts of RNA were present in all lanes (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain the full-length cDNA, a human prostate cDNA library was screened with the radiolabeled 322-bp cDNA clone. Seven positive clones, varying in length between 1.0 and 1.5 kilobases were isolated and sequenced. This resulted in a sequence of 1798 bp covering the entire mRNA except for a small fragment at its 3′-noncoding end. The 5′ sequence was confirmed to be complete by 5-′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (Life Technologies) on LNCaP mRNA. The entire sequence is available from EMBL, GenBank, and DDBJ data base (accession number Y14436). It encompasses a 937-bp fragment sequenced by Kai et al. (16Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-i. Sakane F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) departing from HepG2 cDNA and referred to by them as PAP-2a because of its homology with mouse PAP-2. This fragment which is 100% homologous with our sequence contains a 852-bp open reading frame for a PAP-2a protein with a calculated Mr of 32,155. The 322-bp DD-PCR cDNA fragment was found to be located at the 5′-end of this open reading frame (bp +102 to +423 departing from the ATG start codon). Comparison of the entire protein sequence with sequences in the EMBL/GenBank data bases using BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipmann D.J. J. Mol.

Gibbs, EMBL/GenBank accession number U79294. and theDrosophila germ cell guidance factor Wunen (28Zhang N. Zhang J. Purcell K.J. Cheng Y. Howard K. Nature. 1997; 358: 64-67Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Dose-response curves with R1881 confirmed that PAP-2a mRNA induction follows a classical hyperbolic dose-response curve. Maximal stimulation (approximately 4-fold) was observed from 10−9m R1881 on (Fig. 2 A). The time course of PAP-2a mRNA induction revealed some effect as early as 4–8 h after treatment. Maximal stimulation was obtained after 16–24 h. Thereafter the level of mRNA tended to decrease slightly (Fig. 2 B). The ligand specificity of the induction reflected the altered specificity of the mutated androgen receptor, characteristic of LNCaP cells (29Veldschote J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Optimal induction was observed with natural (5α-dihydrotestosterone and testosterone) and synthetic (R1881 and mibolerone) androgens. But progesterone and estradiol also displayed stimulatory effects. Glucocorticoids were inactive (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether newly synthesized proteins are required for the induction of PAP-2a mRNA expression, androgen induction was compared in the presence and absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 3). At 1 μg/ml, a concentration which clearly prevents stimulation of other androgen-regulated genes such as DBI/ACBP (5Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Rombauts W. Verhoeven G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), cycloheximide decreased the basal level of PAP-2a mRNA expression but did not prevent androgen induction. This suggests that newly synthesized proteins do not play a major role in the androgen induction of PAP-2a expression. The dependence of PAP-2a induction on the presence of a functional androgen receptor was further explored by comparison of PAP-2a mRNA expression in LNCaP cells and in two androgen receptor-negative prostatic tumor cell lines PC-3 (30Kaighn M. Narayan K. Ohnuki Y. Lechner J. Jones L. Invest. Urol. 1979; 17: 16-23PubMed Google Scholar) and DU-145 (31Stone K. Mickey D. Wunderli H. Mickey G. Paulson D. Int. J. Cancer. 1978; 21: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 4, Northern blot hybridization of RNA prepared from these cell lines revealed a single PAP-2a mRNA band comparable to the one observed in LNCaP. In PC-3 and DU-145, however, PAP-2a mRNA expression was very low and no stimulation was observed after treatment with 10−8mR1881. Northern and dot-blot hybridization was used to analyze the expression of PAP-2a mRNA in different human tissues. Northern hybridization yielded identical data to those reported by Kaiet al. (16Kai M. Wada I. Imai S.-i. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (not shown), including very high expression in the prostate. A broader screening was performed using dot-blot analysis (Fig. 5). Again expression turned out to be most pronounced in the prostate. Other tissues with high expression were: aorta > bladder > uterus > kidney > mammary gland > spinal cord > small intestine > adrenal gland > thyroid gland. To investigate whether the observed effects of androgens on PAP-2a mRNA levels were accompanied by changes in PAP activity, microsomal fractions were prepared from LNCaP cells after stimulation with 10−10m R1881 and 10−8m R1881. PAP-2 activity was determined by measuring the conversion of phosphatidic acid into diacylglycerol (23Hoër A. Oberdisse E. Arch. Pharm. 1994; 349: 653-661Crossref Google Scholar). These results showed a 2.7-fold increase of PAP-2 activity in microsomal fractions after induction with 10−10m R1881, and a 5.4-fold increase with 10−8m R1881 (Fig. 6). PAP-2 activity was independent of Mg2+, inhibited by propranolol (2-fold decrease at 10 mm), and insensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (data not shown). These characteristics are in accordance with those reported for PAP-2 in other species (17Brindley D. Waggoner D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Sozzani S. Agwu D.E. McCall C.E. O'Flaherty J.T. Schmitt J.D. Kent J.D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24572-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is universally accepted that androgens play a pivotal role in the control of growth and differentiation in the normal and diseased human prostate (1Cunha G. Donjacour A. Cooke P. Mee S. Bigsby R.

https://openalex.org/W2095368047,"A dimeric Dictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate kinase has been stabilized by the double mutation P100S-N150stop which targets residues involved in the trimer interface (Karlsson, A., Mesnildrey, S., Xu, Y., Moréra, S., Janin, J., and Veron, M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19928–19934). The reassociation of this dimeric form into a hexamer similar to the wild-type enzyme is induced by the presence of a nucleotide substrate. Equilibrium sedimentation and gel filtration experiments, as well as enzymatic activity measurements, show that reactivation of the enzyme closely parallels its reassociation. A phosphorylatable intermediate with low activity participates in the association pathway while the dimeric form is shown totally devoid of enzymatic activity. Our results support the hypothesis that different oligomeric species of nucleoside diphosphate kinase are involved in different cellular processes where the enzymatic activity is not required. A dimeric Dictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate kinase has been stabilized by the double mutation P100S-N150stop which targets residues involved in the trimer interface (Karlsson, A., Mesnildrey, S., Xu, Y., Moréra, S., Janin, J., and Veron, M.

Our results support the hypothesis that different oligomeric species of nucleoside diphosphate kinase are involved in different cellular processes where the enzymatic activity is not required. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; Kpn, Killer of Prune; NDPK-A, human NDP kinase A; NDPK-B, human NDP kinase B; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; Kpn, Killer of Prune; NDPK-A, human NDP kinase A; NDPK-B, human NDP kinase B; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. is an ubiquitous enzyme involved in the equilibration of NTP cellular pools. It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate in the presence of divalent cations, preferably Mg2+. The reaction involves the formation of a covalent intermediate where the enzyme is phosphorylated on the catalytic histidine. NDP kinase has broad specificity and can use indifferently ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides of purines or pyrimidines (1Parks R.E.J. Agarwal R.P. The Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar).Apart from its role in nucleotide metabolism, NDP kinase is reportedly involved in a variety of cellular functions. In human, four NDP kinase genes have been isolated (2Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E. J. Nat.

Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Mutations in nm23-H1 were shown to lack motility suppressive capacity and were shown associated with histidine-dependent protein phosphotransfer (7Freije J.M.P. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E.

Lacombe M.L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The NDPK-B, encoded by the gene nm23-H2, was shown to bind to the nuclease hypersensitive element of the c-myc promoter (10Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) as well as to single strand DNA and RNA sequences (11Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.-L. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This DNA binding activity is maintained in a catalytically inactive mutant (12Postel E.H. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli, also, there is indication that NDP kinase may be involved in signal transduction in phosphorylating and activating two different histidine kinases (13Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results indicate that NDP kinase is a multifunctional protein that carries other function(s) than its catalytic activity of nucleotide phosphotransfer. The molecular bases of these different functions are poorly understood.About 50 NDP kinase genes have been cloned, both from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. All NDP kinases are oligomeric proteins made of 17–20-kDa subunits with highly conserved sequences. The crystal structures of several NDP kinases have also been determined, including from the eukaryotes Dictyostelium discoideum (14Dumas C. Lascu I. Morera S. Glaser P. Fourme R. Wallet V.

Biol. 1993; 234: 1230-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The secondary structure and the fold of the subunit are highly conserved with the same βαββαβ motif found in all structures (19Morera S. Dumas C. Lascu I. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 373-390Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This homology extends to the association areas of the subunits within dimers, which are almost identical in all NDP kinases (19Morera S. Dumas C. Lascu I. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 373-390Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the oligomeric structures are different. While prokaryotic enzymes were found as tetramers, eukaryotic NDP kinases are hexamers. It is interesting to note that the subunit of prokaryotic enzymes from M. xanthus and E. coli, which form tetramers, are 5–7 residues shorter at the C terminus than the subunit from eukaryotic NDP kinases.In the Dictyostelium NDP kinase, as in all the hexameric NDP kinases, the dimer interface involves helices α1 and strands β2, which form an intersubunit antiparallel β-sheet between two monomers (14Dumas C. Lascu I. Morera S. Glaser P. Fourme R. Wallet V. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3203-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The trimer interface (Fig. 1) involves three main contacts between subunits: (a) hydrogen bonds between Pro-105 and water molecules at the 3-fold axis, (b) hydrogen bonds between Pro-100 and residues 110–113 in one subunit and Lys-35 in the other, and (c) a hydrogen bond between Asp-115 and the C-terminal Glu-155 of the neighbor subunit (19Morera S. Dumas C. Lascu I. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 373-390Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several of the amino acids participating in these contacts are contained in a large loop called the “Kpn loop” (residues 99–119).Using site-directed mutagenesis we have previously engineered mutantDictyostelium NDP kinases with a disrupted trimer interface. Thus, P105G mutant protein was shown to reversibly dissociate at 2m urea in contrast to the wild-type protein, which is stable up to 5 m urea (20Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Veron M. J. Biol.

The P100S and P100G mutant proteins as well as proteins carrying small deletions at the C terminus (including the N150Stop deleted of the 5 C-terminal amino acids) were also engineered (22Karlsson A.

These proteins are synthesized in recombinant bacteria as active hexamers but their stabilities toward temperature and urea denaturation are severely affected. However, the x-ray structures of the P105G (23Giartosio A. Erent M. Cervoni L. Morera S. Janin J. Konrad M. Lascu I. J. Biol.

The P100S substitution inDictyostelium NDP kinase, corresponding to the P97S mutation in Drosophila, has no effect on the catalytic activity but the protein becomes unstable, presumably due to the dissociation of the hexamer (22Karlsson A.

Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P97S mutation in Drosophila NDP kinase gene corresponds to the kpn mutation, which leads to a lethal phenotype in the absence of the prune gene product (25Sturtevant A.H. Genetics. 1956; 41: 118-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the P100S mutation and the deletion of the C terminus were combined in the double mutant P100S-N150stop, the recombinant protein was synthesized in bacteria as a stable dimer with a specific activity of less than 1% as compared with the wild-type enzyme (22Karlsson A. Mesnildrey S. Xu Y. Morera S. Janin J. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19928-19934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report the study of the oligomerization equilibrium of NDP kinase upon binding of its nucleotide ligands. The possible relevance of changes in the oligomerization state to biological process in the cell is discussed.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the dimeric P100S-N150stop mutant NDP kinase is able to reassociate into a hexameric enzyme and that recovery of enzymatic activity closely parallels reassociation. Both the dimeric and the hexameric species involved in this equilibrium are precisely defined. The P100S-N150stop mutant NDP kinase purified from recombinant bacteria is a well folded dimeric protein as shown by its fluorescence spectrum and equilibrium sedimentation. The reassociated enzyme obtained in the presence of substrate is hexameric as demonstrated by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and has the same turnover and substrate specificity as the wild-type enzyme. The transition from the dimer to the hexamer is concentration and time dependent. It is induced both by ADP and ATP, indicating that binding of the nucleotide is important rather than the phosphorylation of the catalytic histidine. No aggregate could be detected during the reassociation process in agreement with previous urea denaturation-renaturation experiments using the wild-type and the Pro-105 mutant NDP kinase (21Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (Correction (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20268–20275): 7046Google Scholar). The recovery of the fluorescence sensitivity to nucleotides in the reassociated hexamer can be explained either by local or indirect structural changes around the single Trp-137. In both cases, it indicates a structural change within the dimers upon assembly into hexamers. Although the reassociated enzyme solution has the maximal specific activity found for the wild-type NDP kinase (2000 units/mg), and its equilibrium sedimentation and fluorescence properties are identical to the native hexameric enzyme, the conversion of the dimer into hexamer is only partial when analyzed by FPLC (Fig. 6). This discrepancy is probably due to some dissociation of the reconstituted hexamer during the course of the FPLC column.The kinetic data of the reassociation obtained at two different protein concentrations indicate that the reaction is second-order rather than third-order as would be expected for the reassociation of three dimers into a single hexamer (see Fig. 2). In agreement with a bimolecular reactivation process, a possible reassembly scheme could involve two consecutive reactions with the formation of an intermediate. In such an assembly pathway, the first step is likely the association of two dimers into a tetrameric intermediate, while the second reaction, a rate-limiting bimolecular process, would restore the enzymatic activity upon association of the intermediate with another dimer. In agreement with this scheme, an intermediate is indeed observed on the oligomerization pathway (Fig. 5). We estimated directly its relative amount by measuring the area of the corresponding peak after elution from FPLC. The size of this new species is intermediate between that of the dimer and the hexamer, as estimated from its elution volume. This intermediate appears very rapidly. After 1 min in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, it represents more than 60% of the enzyme molecules (Fig. 6 e). However, the enzymatic activity is still low at this time, representing only 5% of the fully active enzyme (Fig. 2), strongly indicating that the specific activity of the intermediate is very low, although it is fully autophosphorylated (Fig. 5). These two observations are not contradictory: indeed, it should be noted that a low specific activity (e.g. 0.1% of wild-type) still results in the full phosphorylation of the catalytic histidine within less than 1 s, due to the high turnover of the enzyme.The surprising unability of the dimeric P100S-N150stop mutant NDP kinase to autophosphorylate on the catalytic histidine (Figs. 5 and 6) suggests that the dissociated enzyme is not able to bind properly the nucleotide substrate. We propose that the dimeric NDP kinase is in equilibrium between two conformations differing in their ability to bind a nucleotide, according to Scheme 1, D′⇄D⇄I⇄HScheme 1 where D (dimer), I (intermediate), and H (hexamer) bind ADP or ATP with a good affinity. The states D and I (possibly a tetramer) are competent for assembly while D′ does not bind nucleotides. At low concentration of protein and in the absence of nucleotide, the enzyme is likely to be in equilibrium between D and D′ with little [D]. ATP addition displaces this toward D, which rapidly associates in I and then more slowly into H. At high protein concentrations, the enzyme should be essentially under the H state.The close relationship between the ability of the dimeric mutant protein to bind the nucleotide and its ability to assemble into hexamers can be explained by some particular features of the NDP kinase subunit structure. Each nucleotide-binding site is only made of residues of one subunit. It involves residues belonging to the central β sheet and to the so-called Kpn loop (residues 99–119). The latter include Val-116, Asn-119, and Arg-109 contributing to the binding, respectively, of the base, the ribose, and the phosphate moieties of the nucleotide (32Morera S. Lascu I. Dumas C. LeBras G. Briozzo P. Veron M. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Considering that all the contacts of the trimer interface (noted A, B, and C in Fig. 1) require amino acids of the Kpn loop, the correlation between the nucleotide-binding site and assembly competence is likely to reside in the conformation of the Kpn loop. In the hexamer, the three Kpn loops come together at the center of one trimer. We propose that the formation of the trimeric interface induces the productive conformation of the nucleotide-binding site and reciprocally, that the binding of a nucleotide results in the restructuration of the Kpn loop so that stronger contacts within the interface can occur. In the P100S-N150stop mutant protein, the disruption of contacts B and C is likely to result in an improper conformation of the Kpn loop and an impaired binding of the nucleotide. Previous studies on NDP kinase mutated at Pro-105 (contact A) also reported an effect of ADP on subunit assembly during renaturation after urea treatment (21Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (Correction (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20268–20275): 7046Google Scholar, 23Giartosio A. Erent M. Cervoni L. Morera S. Janin J. Konrad M. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It thus appears that disruption of the trimer interface in contacts A, B, or C produces analogous structural changes for the enzyme.The question then arises whether the assembly pathway of the P100S-N150stop mutant NDP kinase described here is a model for both the wild-type Dictyostelium enzyme and for NDP kinases from other eukaryotes and whether there is a specific functional role for the different oligomeric forms of the protein. It is tempting to speculate that either the dimeric form of the enzyme and/or the intermediate could play a specific role in function(s) of NDP kinase not directly related to its catalytic activity to phosphorylate nucleosides diphosphate. First, the intermediate, which is able to autophosphorylate, could be involved in the phosphorylation of non-nucleotidic substrates due to an increased flexibility of its active site that could accommodate bulkier substrates. Thus, in the case of the Killer of prune (Kpn) mutantDrosophila, the lethal phenotype may be due to the ability of the mutant NDP kinase to phosphorylate an unknown compound that would specifically accumulate in the absence of the prunegene product and have toxic effects (33Timmons L. Shearn A. Adv. Genet. 1997; 35: 207-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). NDP kinase has also recently been shown to phosphorylate proteins in the presence of small amounts of urea (34Engel M. Veron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.-L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 234: 200-207Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the phospho-transfer from the catalytic histidine of human NDP kinase A to aspartate or glutamate residues of a 43-kDa protein was tentatively correlated with the suppression of tumor metastasis of some cell lines (35Wagner P. Steeg P. Vu N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The inspection of the crystal structure of hexameric NDP kinases makes unlikely the transfer from the active site phosphohistidine to protein substrates unless a major conformational change occurs. The intermediate in the oligomeric assembly described in this paper could provide a structural basis for the putative protein kinase activity of NDP kinase.A role for the oligomeric state of NDP kinase in its DNA binding activity is also emerging from recent studies. The DNA binding activity of human NDPK-B does not require its catalytic activity (12Postel E.H. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the amino acids involved in this process are localized near the symmetry axis of the dimer (36Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, an in vitro study showed an increased affinity of DNA oligonucleotides for the P100S-N150Stop mutant NDP kinase from Dictyostelium, as compared with the wild-type hexameric enzyme (37Mesnildrey S. Agou F. Veron M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 48: 53-57Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Future work is needed to determine the oligomeric state of the protein binding to DNA in vivo and to unravel the mechanism(s) by which it is controlled in the cell. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; Kpn, Killer of Prune; NDPK-A, human NDP kinase A; NDPK-B, human NDP kinase B; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; Kpn, Killer of Prune; NDPK-A, human NDP kinase A; NDPK-B, human NDP kinase B; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. is an ubiquitous enzyme involved in the equilibration of NTP cellular pools. It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate in the presence of divalent cations, preferably Mg2+. The reaction involves the formation of a covalent intermediate where the enzyme is phosphorylated on the catalytic histidine. NDP kinase has broad specificity and can use indifferently ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides of purines or pyrimidines (1Parks R.E.J. Agarwal R.P. The Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Apart from its role in nucleotide metabolism, NDP kinase is reportedly involved in a variety of cellular functions. In human, four NDP kinase genes have been isolated (2Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E. J. Nat.

Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Mutations in nm23-H1 were shown to lack motility suppressive capacity and were shown associated with histidine-dependent protein phosphotransfer (7Freije J.M.P. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A S120G mutation was found in Nm23-H1 in advanced neuroblastoma (8Chang C.L.

Nature. 1994; 370: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that could be related to a defect in protein folding (9Lascu I. Schaertl S. Wang C. Sarger C. Giartosio A. Briand G. Lacombe M.L. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15599-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The NDPK-B, encoded by the gene nm23-H2, was shown to bind to the nuclease hypersensitive element of the c-myc promoter (10Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) as well as to single strand DNA and RNA sequences (11Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.-L. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This DNA binding activity is maintained in a catalytically inactive mutant (12Postel E.H. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli, also, there is indication that NDP kinase may be involved in signal transduction in phosphorylating and activating two different histidine kinases (13Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results indicate that NDP kinase is a multifunctional protein that carries other function(s) than its catalytic activity of nucleotide phosphotransfer. The molecular bases of these different functions are poorly understood. About 50 NDP kinase genes have been cloned, both from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. All NDP kinases are oligomeric proteins made of 17–20-kDa subunits with highly conserved sequences. The crystal structures of several NDP kinases have also been determined, including from the eukaryotes Dictyostelium discoideum (14Dumas C. Lascu I. Morera S. Glaser P. Fourme R. Wallet V.

Biol. 1993; 234: 1230-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The secondary structure and the fold of the subunit are highly conserved with the same βαββαβ motif found in all structures (19Morera S. Dumas C. Lascu I. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 373-390Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This homology extends to the association areas of the subunits within dimers, which are almost identical in all NDP kinases (19Morera S. Dumas C. Lascu I. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 373-390Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the oligomeric structures are different. While prokaryotic enzymes were found as tetramers, eukaryotic NDP kinases are hexamers. It is interesting to note that the subunit of prokaryotic enzymes from M. xanthus and E. coli, which form tetramers, are 5–7 residues shorter at the C terminus than the subunit from eukaryotic NDP kinases. In the Dictyostelium NDP kinase, as in all the hexameric NDP kinases, the dimer interface involves helices α1 and strands β2, which form an intersubunit antiparallel β-sheet between two monomers (14Dumas C. Lascu I. Morera S. Glaser P. Fourme R. Wallet V. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3203-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The trimer interface (Fig. 1) involves three main contacts between subunits: (a) hydrogen bonds between Pro-105 and water molecules at the 3-fold axis, (b) hydrogen bonds between Pro-100 and residues 110–113 in one subunit and Lys-35 in the other, and (c) a hydrogen bond between Asp-115 and the C-terminal Glu-155 of the neighbor subunit (19Morera S. Dumas C. Lascu I. Lacombe M.-L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 373-390Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several of the amino acids participating in these contacts are contained in a large loop called the “Kpn loop” (residues 99–119). Using site-directed mutagenesis we have previously engineered mutantDictyostelium NDP kinases with a disrupted trimer interface. Thus, P105G mutant protein was shown to reversibly dissociate at 2m urea in contrast to the wild-type protein, which is stable up to 5 m urea (20Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Veron M. J. Biol.

The P100S and P100G mutant proteins as well as proteins carrying small deletions at the C terminus (including the N150Stop deleted of the 5 C-terminal amino acids) were also engineered (22Karlsson A.

A large body of evidence suggests that the helical domain of the α-subunits serves as an internal GAP by contributing a critical arginine residue to the GTP binding site (Arg-174 in α-transducin or Arg-178 in Giα). Covalent modification of this arginine by cholera toxin or mutations at this site lead to a constitutively active α-subunit that is incapable of hydrolyzing GTP (10Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A.

The x-ray crystallographic structures of α-subunits bound to GTPγS show that this arginine is coordinated with the γ-phosphate (α-transducin) or positioned nearby (Giα), indicating that this may be an essential catalytic residue involved in GTP hydrolysis (6Noel J.P.

Upon binding of AlF4− to the GDP-bound α-subunit, the G-protein adopts an activated conformation capable of signaling to downstream effectors.

Crystal structures of AlF4−-bound α-transducin and Giα show important structural differences from the corresponding GTPγS-bound forms. The unique coordination of the aluminum suggests that the AlF4− structure represents a transition state analog of the GTP-hydrolytic pathway. GTP hydrolysis proceeds through a penta-covalent intermediate in which the γ-phosphate acts as the general base, de-protonating the attacking water (18Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Robert K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The planar structure of AlF4− approximates the transition state structure of the γ-phosphate (7Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 256: 1405-1412Crossref Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 17Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Importantly, the catalytic arginine has a critical role in coordinating and stabilizing this transition state structure. Recently, Mittal et al. (14Mittal R. Ahmadian R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) made an important connection between the high and low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins by demonstrating AlF4−-mediated effects on Ras (14Mittal R. Ahmadian R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).2 Two GAPs, NF1 and RasGAP, form stable complexes with the GDP-bound form of Ras in the presence of aluminum fluoride, indicating that it also mimics the transition state of GTP hydrolysis in low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. This observation provides an important opening for investigation of the GTPase mechanism in Ras and other low molecular weight GTPases. In the study presented below, we demonstrate that AlF4− induces complex formation between the Rho family GTPase Cdc42Hs and the Cdc42-GAP, and we characterize this interaction using spectroscopic methods. Unlike Ras, we observe that AlF4− is able to induce GDP-bound Cdc42 to form stable complexes with effectors as well as GAPs, suggesting important differences in effector binding between the Ras and Rho subfamilies. As shown for heterotrimeric G-proteins, BeF3− behaves in a manner similar to AlF4− and is also capable of mediating complex formation; however, unlike AlF4−, the BeF3− clearly acts as a true GTP analog and is even more effective than AlF4−at mediating complex formation between Cdc42 and its target/effector proteins. Cdc42Hs was prepared as described previously with some modifications (19Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding Cdc42Hs (or the Cdc42Hs(Q61L) GTPase-defective mutant) was inserted into the pET15b expression vector immediately downstream of the hexa-histidine tag and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The bacteria were grown in 4-liter fermentors, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the cultures reached an OD595 of 4.0. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μm GDP, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme) and homogenized. 10 mg of DNase I and 5 ml of 1 mMgCl2 were added to degrade the chromosomal DNA. The lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation (30 min, 10,000 ×g) and affinity purified over a 25-ml imidodiacetic acid column (Sigma) charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mmNaN3), and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 20–250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The hexa-histidine tag was removed by incubating overnight with 100 μg of thrombin and dialyzed twice against 1 liter of HMA buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3). The clipped protein was applied to a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column equilibrated against HMA. Cdc42Hs does not bind to the Q-Sepharose column under these conditions, and the protein-containing flow-through was pooled and concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml using an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon). In the case of the constitutively active Cdc42Hs(Q61L) protein, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis confirmed that more than 90% of the purified, E. coli expressed protein was bound to GTP (20Darwish A.A. Prichard R.K. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 1511-1524Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentrated protein was stored at −20 °C after dialysis into HMA plus 40% glycerol. The carboxyl-terminal half of the Cdc42-GAP (residues 239–443; designated below as GAP), which is fully functional in stimulating the GTPase activity of Cdc42Hs (19Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was purified using essentially the same procedure described above for Cdc42Hs with a few modifications. GDP was omitted from the lysis step. The GAP was precipitated with 55% NH4(SO4)2after elution from the Ni2+ column. The precipitated protein was pelleted by ultracentrifugation (30 min, 10,000 ×g) and resuspended in 50 ml of HMA. Proteolytic digestion with thrombin and dialysis were performed as above. The GAP binds to the Q-Sepharose column and was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient (in HMA). The eluted protein was pooled and again subjected to NH4(SO4)2 precipitation. The pelleted protein was resuspended to a final concentration of ∼5 mg/ml in HMA and then dialyzed against HMA plus 40% glycerol for storage at −20 °C. The Cdc42Hs/Rac-binding domain of mPAK-3 was prepared essentially as described previously (21Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Creasy C. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 22Leonard D.A. Satoskar R.S. Wu W.J. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C as a ∼2 mg/ml stock. A Superdex 75 16/60 gel filtration column coupled to a Pharmacia fast performance liquid chromatography system was used to analyze complex formation between Cdc42Hs and the GAP. The column was run in buffer B (20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Purified samples of Cdc42 and GAP (0.5 ml at 5 mg/ml) were applied to the column, and elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption. Complexes between GAP and the GTPase-defective Cdc42Hs(Q61L) mutant were prepared by combining 2.5 mg of each protein. The sample was concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The sample was then analyzed as described above. To detect AlF4−-induced complex formation, 2.5 mg each of Cdc42Hs·GDP and the GAP were combined, and the mixture was brought to 60 μm AlCl3 and 25 mm NaF. Similar aluminum and fluoride mixtures contain a high proportion of the aluminofluoride species thought to be responsible for activating heterotrimeric G-proteins (designated below as AlF4−) (23Antonny B. Chabre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was again concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The gel filtration chromatography was preformed as described above with 60 μmAlCl3 and 25 mm NaF added to the column buffer. The elution fractions (2 ml) were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Samples for 19F NMR were prepared at a concentration of ∼0.5 mm total protein in 0.5 ml of HMA buffer plus 0.75 mm AlCl3, 5 mm NaF, and 5% D2O. 19F NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian VXR-400 spectrophotometer using the fluorine probe (resonance frequency for 19F = 376 MHz). N-Methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled nucleotides (mant-dGDP and mant-dGTP) were synthesized as described previously (24Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). 5′-Deoxynucleotides were used to obtain a single isomer of the mant-labeled nucleotide (the mant-moiety is covalently attached to the 3′-OH of the ribose ring). Cdc42Hs (or Cdc42Hs(Q61L)) was preloaded with mant-nucleotide by incubation with a 20-fold excess of purified mant-nucleotide and 25 mm EDTA in HMA at 4 °C for 1 h. The exchange reaction was quenched with 50 mmMgCl2. The reaction mixture was passed over a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated against HMA to remove unbound nucleotide. The protein was brought to a final concentration of ∼100 μm by filtration through a Centricon-10 (Amicon) membrane and then dialyzed against HMA plus 40% glycerol for storage at −20 °C. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed that more than 90% of the protein was loaded with mant-nucleotide after this procedure. Anisotropy measurements of complex formation were taken on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer operating in the T-format. Excitation of the mant-moiety was accomplished with a xenon-arc lamp monochromated to 350 nm with an 8-nm bandwidth. Excitation in the vertical orientation was used to obtain a correction value, and anisotropy measurements were taken with horizontally polarized excitation light. Vertically polarized emission was measured on channel A over a 16-nm band selected at 445 nm, using a momochromator, and horizontal emission was measured on channel B selected at 440 nm with a glass filter. An integration time of 10 s was used for all measurements, and data points represent the average of at least three measurements on the same sample. All titrations were carried out in 1 ml of HMN buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) in a quartz cuvette. To observe AlF4−-induced complex formation, the HMN buffer was brought to 60 μm AlCl3, and 25 mm NaF (for BeF3−experiments, 60 μm BeCl2 was used in place of the AlCl3). Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP (or Cdc42Hs(Q61L)·mant-dGTP) (1 μm) was titrated with either the GAP or PBD. Additions were made directly to the fluorescence cuvette from a concentrated stock (100–200 μm) and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min before anisotropy measurements were taken. The fluorescence anisotropy data were fit using a simple equilibrium model for the bimolecular interaction between Cdc42Hs and GAP. Cdc42·GAP↔Reaction 1 In the case of the AlF4−-induced complex formation, aluminum and fluoride were maintained in large excess so that the concentration of any intermediates could be ignored, and the binding equilibrium was assumed to follow Reaction 1. The dissociation constant (Kd) for this reaction is simply Kd=[Cdc42][GAP][C]Equation 1 where [C] is the unknown concentration of the Cdc42Hs·GAP complex. Equation 1 can be used to solve for the concentration of the complex in terms of known parameters, which in turn yields the quadratic equation shown below. [C]=(Kd+Cdc42t+GAPt)±(Kd+Cdc42t+GAPt)2−4(Cdc42t·GAPt)2Equation 2 where Cdc42t and GAPt represent the total amount of each of these proteins (complexed and free in solution). Only the positive root from Equation 2 is used in subsequent calculations. The observed anisotropy (Aobs) is then a weighted average of the anisotropy of the free (Af) and complexed (Ac) mant-labeled Cdc42Hs. Aobs=([C]Cdc42t)(Ac−Af)+AfEquation 3 Apparent Kd values for complex formation were obtained by fitting the titration data to Equation 3 using the iterative, nonlinear least squares fitting regime in the IGOR Pro software package (Wave Metrics). Fig. 1 compares elution profiles from the gel filtration analysis of AlF4−-induced complex formation between GDP-bound Cdc42Hs and GAP. Panels A and B show the elution profiles of native Cdc42Hs and GAP, respectively. The elution volume of these proteins was consistent with their monomeric molecular masses of 22 and 25 kDa. In the absence of AlF4−, a mixture of Cdc42Hs·GDP and GAP eluted as two peaks (Fig. 1 C) corresponding to their native molecular masses. When the same analysis was performed in the presence of AlF4− (Fig. 1 E), a new peak corresponding to an approximate molecular mass of 47 kDa appeared, which matched the expected size of a complex between Cdc42Hs and GAP. This result indicated that AlF4− induced stable complex formation between the GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs and the GAP and is in agreement with similar results recently reported by Ahmadian et al.(25Ahmadian R.M. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the GAP normally interacts with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42Hs. However, stable complexes between Cdc42Hs·GTP and GAP are not formed because of the rapid hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and the subsequent loss of affinity between the two proteins. Stable complexes between Cdc42Hs and the GAP can be obtained using nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs or GTPase-deficient mutants of the protein. For comparison with the AlF4−-induced complex, Fig. 1 D shows a gel filtration experiment where stable complexes were formed between GAP and the GTPase-deficient Cdc42Hs(Q61L) mutant. As expected, the appearance of a 47-kDa peak is observed, consistent with the formation of a Cdc42Hs·GAP complex. SDS-PAGE analysis of the column fractions confirmed that the high molecular mass peak induced by the addition of AlF4− was indeed a complex of Cdc42Hs·GDP and GAP. Fig. 2 shows SDS-PAGE analysis of the column fractions from the gel filtration experiment shown in Fig. 1 E. The high molecular mass peak (fractions 60–62 in Fig. 2) clearly contained both Cdc42Hs and GAP, indicating that these proteins were eluted from the gel filtration column as a stable complex of approximately 47 kDa. The two proteins appeared to be present in equivalent amounts which is in agreement with the 1:1 stoichiometry expected for this interaction. 19F NMR spectroscopy was performed to probe fluoride binding directly. This method was used successfully to study the interaction of AlF4− with α-transducin (16Higashijima T. Graziano M.P. Suga H. Kainosho M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free AlF4− shows a single peak at −10 ppm (Fig. 3 A). No change in the spectrum was observed for the 19F NMR spectrum of Cdc42Hs·GDP in the presence of AlF4−, suggesting that free Cdc42Hs did not bind to AlF4−(Fig. 3 B). The 19F NMR spectrum obtained for Cdc42Hs·GDP in the presence of equimolar GAP is shown in Fig. 3 D. The addition of GAP produced a new peak shifted up-field by approximately 22.5 ppm, indicating that fluoride was bound to the complex. Fig. 3 C shows the 19F NMR spectrum of an equimolar mixture of GAP and Cdc42Hs bound to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GppNHp. The spectrum was identical to that of free AlF4−, indicating that the bound peak observed in the spectrum of the AlF4−-induced Cdc42Hs·GDP·GAP complex was caused by the binding of fluoride in the position normally occupied by the γ-phosphate. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements can be used to monitor changes in the rotational life time mass of a fluorescently labeled protein. This technique provides a sensitive read-out for protein-protein interactions and was used to characterize the AlF4−-induced Cdc42Hs-GAP interaction in more detail. Addition of GAP to preparations of Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP in the presence of AlF4− caused dramatic changes in the anisotropy which were indicative of complex formation. Fig. 4 A shows a typical titration of 1 μm Cdc42 Hs ·mant-dGDP with increasing amounts of GAP in the presence of 60 μmAlCl3 and 25 mm NaF. The binding isotherm was well fit by a simple bimolecular equilibrium model for Cdc42Hs·GAP complex formation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and yielded an apparent Kd of 239 nm ± 79 (n = 10). Increasing the concentration of AlF4− did not lead to a significant change in the Kd value, suggesting that AlF4− is saturating under these conditions. Additionally, both aluminum and fluoride were required such that the addition of either compound alone was not sufficient to promote the interaction between Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP and GAP (data not shown). A significantly weaker affinity was observed between Cdc42Hs·GDP and GAP in the absence of AlF4−. Assuming an identical anisotropy value at saturation, a lower limit Kd of ∼50 μm can be assigned to this interaction. In the case of the heterotrimeric G-proteins, beryllium was found to be the only cation capable of replacing aluminum in the fluoride-induced activation response (15Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows the titration of Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP with increasing amounts of GAP in the presence of BeF3−. The best fit to this binding isotherm yielded an apparent Kd value of 388 nm ± 47 (n = 2), which was similar to that determined for the AlF4−-induced Cdc42Hs·GAP interaction. To compare carefully the Kd values for Cdc42Hs·GAP complex formation induced by AlF4− and BeF3− versus the values for GAP interactions with activated (GTPase-defective) Cdc42Hs, experiments were performed with the Cdc42(Q61L) mutant. Fig. 4 C shows the titration of 1 μm Cdc42Hs(Q61L)·mant-dGTP with increasing amounts of GAP. The titration profile was fit using the same bimolecular model as above and yielded an apparentKd of 279 nm ± 134 (n = 6). This value is not significantly different from that determined for the AlF4−- or BeF3−-induced complex formation. To pursue the hypothesis that AlF4− represents a transition state analog of the GTP-hydrolytic pathway, fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed with a GAP that was mutated at arginine 305 (according to the sequence in Refs. 13Ahmed S. Lee J. Wen L.P. Zhao Z. Ho J. Best A. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17642-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 26Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.-J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a residue that appears to be essential for catalysis. The R305A mutant of GAP, while binding to Cdc42Hs with wild type affinity, shows a significantly reduced ability to catalyze the GTPase reaction (i.e.25-fold lower GAP activity). 2D. A. Leonard, R. A. Cerione, and D. Manor, manuscript in preparation.Similar results have also been shown for the analogous mutations in a number of other GAPs (13Ahmed S. Lee J. Wen L.P. Zhao Z. Ho J. Best A. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17642-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows a titration of 1 μm Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP in the presence of AlF4− with increasing amounts of the GAP(R305A) mutant. The best fit to this titration profile yielded an apparent Kd of 2.15 μm, which represents a significantly weaker affinity than that measured for the interaction between GAP and the GTP-bound state of Cdc42Hs (see above). A similar loss of affinity for the BeF3−-induced complex was also observed (data not shown). The titration of GTP-bound Cdc42Hs with the GAP(R305A) mutant gives an apparent Kd value of 245 nm, i.e. an affinity nearly identical to that observed for the wild type GAP. The interaction between Ras and its effector Raf was shown to be unaffected by AlF4− (14Mittal R. Ahmadian R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility in the Rho subfamily, the effects of AlF4− on the binding of PBD were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. PBD is the binding domain of mPAK-3 (21Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Creasy C. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and contains the CRIB (Cdc42Hs-Rac-interactive binding) motif, originally shown to be a limit domain found on a number of proteins that bind Cdc42Hs or Rac (27Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows the binding isotherm for Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP titrated with increasing amounts of PBD in the presence and absence of AlF4−. An apparent Kd value of 461 nm was determined for the binding of PBD to Cdc42Hs·GDP in the presence of AlF4−. The affinity of PBD for this complex was significantly weaker than its apparent affinity for the GTP-bound (activated) Cdc42Hs (i.e. Kd ∼72 nm). Still, it is clear that the addition of AlF4− caused a significant enhancement in the affinity of PBD for the GDP-bound state of Cdc42Hs (i.e. in the absence of AlF4−, the Kd value for the interaction of GDP-bound Cdc42Hs with PBD has a lower limit of ∼70 μm). The addition of AlF4− also enhanced the affinity of GDP-bound Cdc42Hs for the limit binding domain of the IQGAP molecule, another putative target for Cdc42 (data not shown) (28McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interesting differences arose when Cdc42Hs·mant-dGDP was titrated with PBD in the presence of BeF3− as shown in Fig. 6 B. The affinity observed for the BeF3−-induced complex formation was significantly higher than that measured for AlF4−, yielding an apparentKd value of 45 nm. This value was similar to the Kd value determined for the binding of activated Cdc42Hs to PBD (∼72 nm) and suggests that BeF3− induces an activated conformation within Cdc42Hs which mimics the conformational state induced by GTP. We have demonstrated that AlF4−induces the formation of a stable complex between Cdc42Hs·GDP and GAP using a variety of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques. The Kd value measured for the AlF4−-induced complex formation was similar to that determined for the binding of activated (GTP-bound) Cdc42Hs to GAP. We have also found that beryllium was able to replace aluminum in mediating Cdc42Hs·GDP·GAP complex formation in the presence of fluoride, consistent with results that have been obtained for heterotrimeric G-proteins. Our results indicate that the aluminum fluoride-mediated complex formation reported between Ras and RasGAP is likely to be a general phenomenon observed between all low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins and their GAP molecules. The 19F NMR data are crucial to understanding the mechanism of the AlF4−-induced complex formation. There are two potential mechanisms by which AlF4− could promote the interactions between the GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs and its effectors. The first mechanism is analogous to that seen with the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, where the AlF4− binds directly to the GDP-bound Cdc42Hs, inducing an activated conformation capable of interacting with the GAP. Mittal et al. (14Mittal R. Ahmadian R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), however, proposed an alternative mechanism for the aluminum fluoride-induced complex formation between Ras and its GAPs. The first step in this mechanism is the formation of a weakly interacting complex between the Ras and RasGAP. The transient formation of this low affinity complex creates a pocket for the aluminum fluoride which then binds to stabilize the complex. The results of the 19F NMR spectroscopy with Cdc42Hs clearly implicate the second of these two mechanisms. The addition of the GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs to a solution containing AlF4− did not give rise to additional fluoride peaks in the NMR spectrum, indicating that AlF4− did not bind to Cdc42Hs uncomplexed. The addition of GAP produced an additional up-field peak not observed with Cdc42Hs alone. Thus, the GAP must contribute important residues to the active site, forming a binding pocket capable of stabilizing the transition state and thereby allowing AlF4− to bind. The chemical shift observed for the binding of AlF4− to the Cdc42Hs·GDP·GAP complex was similar to that observed for α-transducin, suggesting that the environment of the AlF4− binding pocket is similar in these two proteins. AlF4− did not bind to the Cdc42Hs·GppNHp·GAP complex indicating that AlF4− occupies the position that normally contains the γ-phosphate, as expected from studies on heterotrimeric G-proteins. GAPs for the Rho family GTPases make up a diverse family with highly divergent amino acid sequences. A few highly conserved residues have been isolated which are critical to the catalytic activity of these proteins; in particular, mutation of the universally conserved arginine (Arg-305 in Cdc42-GAP) severely compromises the catalytic activity of these proteins (13Ahmed S. Lee J. Wen L.P. Zhao Z. Ho J. Best A. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17642-17648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 The fluorescence titrations of Cdc42Hs with the GAP(R305A) mutant show a significantly weaker affinity for the AlF4−-induced complex relative to the affinity measured for the interactions of GAP(R305A) with the activated form of Cdc42Hs. The 50-fold lower affinity exhibited by GAP(R305A) for the Cdc42Hs·GDP complex in the presence of AlF4− is consistent with the loss of a salt bridge between Arg-305 and AlF4−, suggesting that the markedly depressed catalytic activity observed with this GAP mutant is caused by its inability to stabilize the transition state. Taken together with the 19F NMR data, this supports the conclusion drawn by Mittal et al. (14Mittal R. Ahmadian R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), arguing that GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis by introducing critical catalytic residues to the active site (14Mittal R. Ahmadian R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The recent x-ray crystallographic structures for the Ras·GDP·AIF3·RasGAP complex, as well as complexes between RhoGAP and Rho family GTPases in both the active (GppNHp-bound) and transition state (GDP·AlF4−-bound) conformations, show that GAPs contribute an arginine residue to the nucleotide binding site which specifically stabilizes the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (29Scheffzek K.

The results presented here as well as the observations of these crystallographic studies are summarized in Fig. 7 A, showing the catalytically important Arg-305 mediating the AlF4−-induced complex formation between Cdc42 and GAP. As stated in the Introduction, a great deal of biochemical and structural data has implicated AlF4− as a transition state analog for the GTPase reaction in heterotrimeric G-proteins. In the crystal structure of α-subunits complexed to AlF4−, the critical arginine residue, which is located within the large helical domain, interacts with the coordinating fluorides. Considering the data presented here in light of the work performed on heterotrimeric G-proteins and Ras, it seems likely that the GTP-hydrolytic mechanism is conserved across the families of both large and small G-proteins and that Arg-305 in Cdc42-GAP plays the critical role of stabilizing the transition state in the GTP-hydrolytic pathway, analogous to arginine 174 in α-transducin, arginine 178 in Giα, and arginine 789 in the RasGAP. We obtained interesting and rather unexpected results when examining the effects of AlF4− on the interactions between Cdc42Hs and its downstream target/effector molecules. Specifically, we found that AlF4− enhanced the affinity of the GDP-bound form of Cdc42Hs for its target/effector proteins. This was unexpected in light of the finding that AlF4− does not influence Ras-target interactions and suggests that the Ras and Rho subfamily G-proteins have distinctly different modes of effector binding. The19F NMR data clearly demonstrate the inability of AlF4− to bind to free Cdc42Hs, and thus the AlF4−-induced complex formation between Cdc42Hs and PBD must proceed in a manner similar to that proposed for the GAP where PBD must first form a transient complex with Cdc42Hs and thereby create a binding site for AlF4−. As appears to be the case for the GAP, the creation of the binding pocket for AlF4− apparently relies on the introduction of a specific residue by the effector molecule. The crystal structure of the Ras-related G-protein Rap in complex with the Ras-binding domain of Raf demonstrates that targets for Ras do not introduce such a residue into the GTP-hydrolytic site (32Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Unlike Raf, the PAKs and other Rho family target/effectors must introduce a residue into the active site, enabling AlF4− to bind and mediate complex formation. Another unique property of Rho family targets is their role as GTPase inhibitory proteins (GIPs) (33Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Such GIP activity is not observed for effectors of Ras (34Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). One interesting possibility is that the GIP activity of Rho family target/effectors is mediated by a residue introduced into the γ-phosphate binding pocket of the G-protein which stabilizes the GTP-bound state in a manner analogous to the stabilization of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis by the GAP, but with an opposite effect. This interpretation is supported further by the complex formation observed between Cdc42·GDP and PBD in the presence of BeF3− and is summarized in Fig. 7 B. Comparison of the crystal structures of myosin-ADP bound with either AlF4− or BeF3− has shown that although the AlF4− complex represents a distinct transition state conformation, BeF3− is a true ATP analog, inducing a conformation indistinguishable from the ATP-bound protein (35Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The affinity of PBD for Cdc42Hs·GDP in the presence of BeF3− is identical to that observed for the activated form of Cdc42Hs, whereas the affinity in the presence of AlF4− is significantly weaker than that measured for the GTP-bound state. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the fluoride-mediated interaction of Cdc42Hs with effectors relies on the GIP activity of these proteins which should stabilize a GTP analog (BeF3−) more effectively than a transition state analog (AlF4−). This implies a direct role for target/effector molecules in modulating the GTPase activity of Rho family G-proteins. In conclusion, it is clear that aluminum fluoride represents a transition state analog in the GTP-hydrolytic pathway of Cdc42Hs and is capable of inducing complex formation with the Cdc42·GAP. Moreover, we propose a role for BeF3− as a true GTP analog, capable of inducing high affinity complex formation between Cdc42Hs and target/effector molecules. Such fluoride-mediated complex formation is singular to the Rho subfamily of GTPases and is a direct result of the unique biochemistry of the G-protein-target interaction in this important family of signaling molecules.

A mammalian expression vector containing the rat S100A1 cDNA in the antisense orientation with respect to a cytomegalovirus promoter was constructed and transfected into PC12 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed decreased S100A1 protein levels in all three stable transfectants (pAntisense clones) that expressed exogenous S100A1 antisense mRNA. In response to nerve growth factor, pAntisense clones extended significantly more neurites than control cells (4.01 ± 0.16 versus 2.93 ± 0.16 neurites/cell). This increase in neurite number was accompanied by an increase in total α-tubulin levels in untreated (4.0 ± 0.6versus 1.76 ± 0.4 ng of α-tubulin/mg of total protein) and nerve growth factor-treated pAntisense clones (4.15 ± 0.4 versus 2.04 ± 0.5 ng of α-tubulin/mg of total protein) when compared with control cells. At high cell densities, pAntisense clones exhibited a significant decrease in anchorage-dependent growth. In soft agar, pAntisense clones formed significantly more colonies (153 ± 8%) than control cells (116 ± 5%). However, the pAntisense soft agar colonies were significantly smaller than those observed in control cells (40.6 ± 3.0 versus 59.5 ± 1.2 μm). These data suggest that cell density inhibits both anchorage-independent and -dependent growth of pAntisense clones. In summary, ablation of S100A1 expression in PC12 cells results in increased tubulin levels, altered neurite organization, and decreased cell growth. Thus, S100A1 may directly link the cytoskeleton and calcium signal transduction pathways to cell proliferation. As a first step in determining what cellular processes are regulated by the calcium-modulated protein S100A1 isoform in neurons, the effects of ablated S100A1 expression on neurite organization and microtubule/tubulin levels in PC12 cells were examined.

These data suggest that cell density inhibits both anchorage-independent and -dependent growth of pAntisense clones. In summary, ablation of S100A1 expression in PC12 cells results in increased tubulin levels, altered neurite organization, and decreased cell growth. Thus, S100A1 may directly link the cytoskeleton and calcium signal transduction pathways to cell proliferation. The S100 protein family is a group of calcium-binding proteins that exhibit a high degree of conservation in amino acid sequence, secondary structure, and genomic organization (1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 2Zimmer D.B. Chessher J.C. Song W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). To date, there are 18 members of the S100 family, 13 of which are clustered in region q21 of human chromosome 1 (see Refs. 4Wicki R. Schafer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 5Wicki R. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A new nomenclature that reflects the genomic organization of these proteins has recently been adopted, and S100α is now designated S100A1 and S100β is designated S100B (6Schafer B.W. Wicki R. Engelkamp D. Mattei M.G. Heizmann C.W. Genomics. 1995; 25: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). S100A1 and S100B were the original members of this family and have been implicated in a diverse group of cellular functions including cell-cell communication, cell growth, cell structure, energy metabolism, contraction, and intracellular calcium signal transduction (see Refs. 1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar and 3Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Because each S100 monomer contains two EF-hand high affinity calcium binding domains, they have been included in the S100-troponin-calmodulin superfamily of calcium-modulated proteins. These proteins have no known enzymatic activity and function by modulating the activity of other proteins termed target proteins. Calmodulin appears to be the “workhorse” in calcium signaling and to be responsible for generating the main events triggered by changes in intracellular calcium levels. This view is consistent with the observations that calmodulin is present in all cells; that it is highly conserved among species, phyla, and even kingdoms; that it is not a family of proteins; and that there is signal amplification in calmodulin-regulated events. In contrast, S100 proteins are excellent candidates for providing cell type specificity and acting as modulators, rather than instigators of calcium signal transduction. S100 proteins are not ubiquitously expressed and exhibit very specific patterns of expression, are a diverse multi-component family, are expressed at significantly lower levels than calmodulin, and often act stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. Although S100 modulation of some target proteins is calcium-dependent, other S100 effects are calcium-independent, suggesting that these proteins may have important functions at resting intracellular calcium levels. Analysis of intact cells in which the expression of S100 proteins has been ablated or up-regulated has been an extremely useful approach in identifying cellular processes that are regulated by S100 family members. Using an antisense RNA to inhibit S100B expression in C6 glioma cells, Selinfreund and co-workers (7Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Welsh M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) observed three phenotypic changes: 1) a more flattened morphology, 2) a more organized actin filament network, and 3) a slower growth rate. Lakshmi and co-workers (8Lakshmi M.S. Parker C. Sherbet G.V. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 299-304PubMed Google Scholar) used retinoic acid and melanocyte-stimulating hormones to alter S100A4 (originally designated mts1) expression in melanoma cells and observed a direct relationship between S100A4 and depolymerized tubulin levels. More recent studies by Takenaga and co-workers (9Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) using antisense RNA to down-regulate S100A4 expression in lung carcinoma cells demonstrated that reduced S100A4 expression is associated with suppression of metastatic potential. Masiakowski and Shooter (10Masiakowski P. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) used a sense expression vector to induce S100A6 (originally designated 42C) expression in PC12 cells and observed neurite extension without inhibition of cell proliferation in the absence of NGF. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; bp, base pair(s); ANOVA, analysis of variance; EB, Extraction Buffer; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. All of these effects were observed without manipulation of intracellular calcium levels and are consistent with the view that S100 proteins perform important functions at resting intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, these studies directly implicate S100 proteins in the regulation of cell growth and cytoskeletal organization. Previous studies have indirectly implicated another member of the S100 family, S100A1, in regulating cytoskeletal organization. Like S100A6, S100A1 expression is up-regulated in NGF-treated PC12 cells that are extending neurites (11Zimmer D.B. Landar A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of S100A1 target proteins are essential structural elements of the cytoskeleton including tubulin, τ protein, intermediate filaments, caldesmon, and myosin (see Ref. 1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several S100A1 target proteins are associated with the cytoskeleton including aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglucomutase (see Refs. 1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar and 11Zimmer D.B. Landar A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression of both S100A1 and the microtubule-associated τ protein in neuronal cells further suggests that S100A1 regulates microtubule assembly in neuronal cells. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) are an extensively used model system for studying neuronal cell differentiation and signal transduction. Furthermore, antisense/sense approaches have been used in PC12 cells to examine the in vivo functions of a wide variety of neuronal proteins including τ (12Esmaeli-Asad B. McCarty J.H. Feinstein S.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 869-879PubMed Google Scholar), GAP-43 or neuromodulin (13Gribkoff V.K. Hammang J.P. Baetge E.E. Mol.

Brain Res. 1995; 87: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (18Tashima K. Yamamoto H. Setoyama C. Ono T. Miyamoto E. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the plasma membrane calcium ATPase pump (20Brandt P.C. Sisken J.D. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine if S100A1 regulates cytoskeletal organization in neuronal cells, we have examined the effects of ablated S100A1 expression on α-tubulin levels in PC12 cells as well as the number and length of neurites extended by PC12 cells in response to NGF. We observed increases in α-tubulin levels in PC12 cells that do not express S100A1. Furthermore, PC12 cells that do not express S100A1 extended more neurites per cell in response to NGF. These cytoskeletal changes were accompanied by reductions in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth that were density-related. The fact that three members of the S100 protein family, S100B, S100A6, and now S100A1, modulate growth and cytoskeletal organization suggest that these proteins link the cytoskeleton and calcium signal transduction pathways to cell growth. To construct the pAntisense expression vector, a plasmid containing the rat S100A1 cDNA (21Zimmer D.B. Song W. Zimmer W.E. Brain Res. Bull. 1991; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using M13 reverse primer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and a gene-specific primer containing an engineered XbaI restriction enzyme site (5′-GGGTCTAGAGACCCTCATCAATGT-3′). After digestion with XbaI and HindIII and gel purification, the fragment was ligated into gel-purified XbaI-HindIII-digested pCMV expression vector (22Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting DNA construct (Fig. 1 A) was transformed into Escherichia coli, and ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened by restriction mapping and PCR analysis. DNA sequence analysis (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) of the 5′ region was performed to verify the orientation of the insert DNA. PC12 cells were the generous gift of Dr. Jonathan Scammell (University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL) and grown as described previously (11Zimmer D.B. Landar A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PC12 cells (1.7 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml) were transfected by electroporation at 400 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser™ apparatus (Bio-Rad), equipped with a 960-microfarad capacitor and 0.4-cm gap electrodes. A plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene under the control of an SV40 promoter (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA) was cotransfected with the S100A1 pAntisense plasmid or plasmid containing no insert DNA. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes, and 48 h later stable transfectants were selected by treatment with 1 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 3 weeks, single colonies were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates and expanded. Stable transfectants were screened for the presence of exogenous S100A1 antisense mRNA using reverse transcriptase and PCR analysis. Total RNA was prepared from PC12 cells using RNA-Stat60 (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX). First strand cDNA was prepared using a Perkin-Elmer (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ) Gene-Amp™ RNA PCR kit. A reaction mix containing 1 μg total RNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm each dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 μmoligo(dT)16, and 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 40–42 °C for 1 h, and 90–95 °C for 5 min, and then placed in ice. PCR amplification reactions consisted of 4 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.25 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm each dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide primers whose sequences correspond to the 3′ region of the S100A1 cDNA coding sequence (5′-CAGTTTGTAGCAGGTCTTTCAGCT-3′) and the human growth hormone termination signal of the pCMV vector (5′-CTGGAGTGGCAACTTCCAAG-3′) were used for detection of the pAntisense S100A1 mRNA. The integrity of all RT reactions was confirmed by amplification of a 541-bp β-actin fragment corresponding to nucleotides 144–685 of the β-actin cDNA using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′). The integrity of the PCR was confirmed by using purified plasmid DNA, rather than RT reactions as template. PC12 cells were grown on glass coverslips and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (11Zimmer D.B. Landar A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2727-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A commercial anti-S100A1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:20 dilution) (Sigma) was used as a primary antibody for S100A1 staining. Primary antibody binding was visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20 dilution) (Boehringer Mannheim). Slides were examined on a Leitz microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and fluorescein filters. Images were recorded on Tri-X film (ASA 1600) with a 40× neofluor objective. To allow for fluorescence intensity comparisons between images, coverslips for control and pAntisense clones were processed simultaneously in each experiment. In addition, all images were recorded using a standard exposure time of 45 s. Furthermore, in each experiment, all images were developed and printed simultaneously using identical settings. Three independent experiments were performed using cells plated on different days. Quadruplicate 35-mm plates were seeded at low density, and 48 h later two plates were fed with medium only and two plates with medium containing 10 ng/ml NGF (Collaborative Research, Inc., Waltham, MA). Forty-eight hours later, five random fields were photographed from each plate using a Leitz microscope equipped with phase optics and a 20× objective. Individual/discernible cells were scored for number of neurites and neurite length on study prints (final magnification, ×645). Individual processes were measured in millimeters and converted to micrometers during analysis, with processes 2 μm or greater in length scored as neurites. Between 9 and 20 different fields consisting of 120–200 cells were scored for each clone. Each experiment was repeated using cells plated on different days. The data were expressed as the mean ± the standard error of the mean. An ANOVA (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used to determine the statistical significance of measured differences. Anchorage-dependent growth was assessed by plating approximately 95,000 cells in triplicate 60-mm dishes and determining the cell number using a hemacytomer at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 192 h after plating. An ANOVA (GraphPad) was used to determine the statistical significance of measured differences. Anchorage-independent growth was assayed in 0.15% agarose with a 0.8% agarose underlay. Approximately 50,000 cells were plated in triplicate 60-mm dishes. Cells were fed 7 days later and photographed 14 days later on a Leitz microscope using a 10× objective. Colony number and colony size were measured on two randomly chosen photographs from each plate, and the average of all measurements was used as the colony number/colony size for that clone. Each experiment was repeated using cells plated on different days. Within each experiment, the number of colonies formed by the parental PC12 cells was set to 100% and the percent colonies formed by control and pAntisense clones expressed as the number of colonies/number of PC12 colonies × 100. The data were expressed as the mean colony size and colony number (percent) for the six determinations (three pAntisense clones × two experiments). An ANOVA (GraphPad) was used to determine the statistical significance of measured differences. Duplicate 100-mm plates were fed with media only or media containing 10 ng/ml NGF (Collaborative Research, Inc.). Forty-eight hours later, the plates were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and cell extracts prepared as described previously (24Drubin D.G. Feinstein S.C. Shooter E.M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1799-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). After rinsing in Extraction Buffer (EB) (0.1 m PIPES, 0.1 mmMgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) plates were incubated in 500 μl of EB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. After 8 min, the cells were mechanically removed and this cell homogenate used for determining total α-tubulin. A portion of the cell homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of EB. The supernatant was used for determining soluble α-tubulin levels and the pellet for polymerized α-tubulin levels. Quantitative analysis of cell extracts was performed as described by Hanemaaijer and Ginzberg (25Hanemaaijer R. Ginzberg I. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using serial dilutions of each sample and an α-tubulin standard (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Samples were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus. After blocking in Tris-buffered saline (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 10% nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1–333 dilution; Sigma) followed by an 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA). Bound radioactivity was determined using a Bio-Rad GS250 Molecular Imager and Phosphor Analyst Software. The nanograms of α-tubulin in each dot were determined by extrapolation from the α-tubulin standard curve. All dilutions within the linear range of the standard curve were averaged to determine the nanograms of α-tubulin in each sample, which was normalized to the milligrams of total protein (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). An ANOVA (GraphPad) was used to determine the statistical significance of measured differences. In generating the clones used in this study, approximately 200 stable transfectants were isolated. Of the 17 stable transfectants screened for expression of the exogenous pAntisense S100A1 mRNA, three clones (A1, A2, and A3) exhibited the predicted 265-bp PCR product (Fig. 1 B). Our inability to detect a PCR product in the remaining 14 clones was not due to technical problems with the RT or PCR reactions, as all clones exhibited a 500-bp fragment using primers for endogenous β-actin mRNA. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine if the three clones that expressed the exogenous S100A1 antisense mRNA also exhibited decreased S100A1 protein levels. Clones A1, A2, and A3 exhibited a S100A1 staining intensity indistinguishable from that of secondary antibody only and significantly less than that observed in parental PC12 cells or cells transfected with vector containing no insert DNA (Fig. 2). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the A1, A2, and A3 clones (pAntisense clones) have S100A1 protein levels that are significantly less than parental PC12 cells and are an appropriate model system for studying S100A1-regulated processes. Previous studies demonstrating that S100 proteins regulate microtubule assembly in vitro (see Ref. 1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) and increased S100A1 levels in PC12 cells treated with NGF (11Zimmer D.B. Landar A. J.

To test this hypothesis, phase contrast microscopy and morphometric techniques were used to examine the NGF-induced neurite extension in pAntisense clones. To maximize the length of neurites extended, the effects of NGF were assayed at low confluence. As shown in Fig. 3, the morphology of the three pAntisense clones was identical to that of control cells in the absence and presence of NGF. Furthermore, there was no difference in the NGF dose-response curve for the pAntisense clones and control cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that reduced S100A1 levels do not inhibit or promote NGF-induced neurite extension in PC12 cells. To determine if S100A1 regulates neurite organization, the number of neurites per cell and the average neurite length were determined in control and pAntisense clones. Although many investigators score only those extensions that are equal to or double the cell body width, we scored any extensions 2 μm or longer as neurites to ensure that subtle differences would be detected. In addition, cells were treated with saturating levels (10 ng/ml) of NGF. As shown in Fig. 4, the three pAntisense clones extended 4.01 ± 0.11 neurites/cell while control cells extended 2.93 ± 0.11 neurites/cell. However, the average neurite length in the pAntisense clones and control cells were not significantly different (23.17 ± 1.18 versus 27.53 ± 1.51 μm). In addition, the average neurite length that we observed in NGF-treated cells was almost identical to the previously reported average neurite lengths of 23.2 μm (27Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and approximately 20–30 μm (12Esmaeli-Asad B. McCarty J.H. Feinstein S.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 869-879PubMed Google Scholar) for NGF-treated PC12 cells. Altogether, these data demonstrate that decreased S100A1 levels are associated with an increase in the number, but not the length, of neurites extended in response to NGF. These results suggest that S100A1 regulates NGF-induced neurite organization in PC12 cells. The increased number of neurites in NGF-treated pAntisense clones suggests that S100A1 may regulate the level of polymerized/unpolymerized tubulin in PC12 cells. To test this hypothesis, an immunodot assay was used to quantitate α-tubulin levels in PC12 cell total homogenates as well as in fractions containing polymerized or unpolymerized tubulin. Western blot analysis of PC12 cell homogenates confirmed that the commercial antibody used for the immundot experiments recognized a single protein species (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 A, pAntisense clones contained significantly more α-tubulin protein (4.0 ± 0.6versus 1.76 ± 0.4 ng/mg of total protein) than control cells. Furthermore, NGF treatment did not significantly alter the α-tubulin levels in control or pAntisense clones. It should be noted that the total α-tubulin levels in this study are approximately 2-fold higher than those previously reported for PC12 cells (24Drubin D.G. Feinstein S.C. Shooter E.M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1799-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and this may account for the small processes that we observe in cells which are not treated with NGF, as well as the fact that we achieve maximal neurite extension in our cells after 48 h whereas other investigators routinely use 7 days. In summary, ablation of S100A1 expression in PC12 cells results in an NGF-independent increase in α-tubulin levels. Although the analysis of total α-tubulin protein levels did reveal an important difference between control cells and pAntisense cells, it did not allow us to determine if the increased number of neurites in NGF-treated pAntisense clones was accompanied by an increase in polymerized tubulin. To test this hypothesis, the α-tubulin content in polymerized and nonpolymerized microtubule fractions was determined using an immunodot assay. As shown in Fig. 5 B, untreated control cells had significantly more polymerized α-tubulin than unpolymerized α-tubulin (1.14 ± 0.15 versus2.10 ± 0.42 ng/mg of total protein). In untreated pAntisense clones, the unpolymerized α-tubulin levels were significantly higher than control cells (2.09 ± 0.39 versus 1.14 ± 0.15 ng/mg of total protein) while polymerized α-tubulin levels were indistinguishable. These results suggest that the increased α-tubulin levels observed in response to ablated S100A1 expression are due to increases in soluble and not polymerized tubulin. Next, the effects of NGF on soluble and polymerized α-tubulin were examined. As shown in Fig. 5 B, NGF treatment of control cells resulted in a slight decrease in polymerized α-tubulin levels that was not statistically significant and no change in soluble α-tubulin levels. These data suggest that neurite extension in the PC12 cells used in this study occurs via a reorganization of existing microtubules without an increase in α-tubulin levels or the level of polymerized α-tubulin. This is in contrast to previous studies, which have demonstrated increases in α-tubulin levels in PC12 cells in response to NGF (24Drubin D.G. Feinstein S.C. Shooter E.M. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1799-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The cells used in previous studies required up to 7 days of treatment to extend neurites, whereas the cells used in this study extend neurites within 48 h. One explanation for the significant reduction in time for neurite extension in our cells may be the fact that these cells already express sufficient levels of α-tubulin for neurite extension. pAntisense clones exhibited slight increases in soluble and polymerized α-tubulin levels, in response to NGF, that were not statistically significant. However, the level of soluble α-tubulin in NGF-treated pAntisense clones was significantly higher than those in NGF-treated control cells (2.93 ± 0.36versus 1.18 ± 0.18 ng/mg of total protein), as was the level of polymerized α-tubulin (2.52 ± 0.50 versus1.34 ± 0.22 ng/mg of total protein). The increased polymerized/unpolymerized α-tubulin levels observed in pAntisense clones is consistent with the increased number of neurites extended by pAntisense clones in response to NGF. However, because untreated and NGF-treated pAntisense clones have almost identical polymerized and unpolymerized α-tubulin levels, the increased number of neurites in NGF-treated pAntisense clones is most likely a result of the increased α-tubulin levels present before NGF treatment and not S100A1 effects on the NGF signaling pathway. Because changes in the cytoskeleton are often associated with altered growth properties and members of the S100 family have been shown to regulate cell growth, the anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth properties of the pAntisense clones were assayed. Although the growth properties of pAntisense clones at low densities were not different from control cells, at high densities pAntisense clones exhibited a significant decrease in anchorage-dependent growth (Fig. 6). Anchorage-independent growth was also altered in the pAntisense clones (Fig. 7). When all colonies larger than a single cell were scored, the three pAntisense clones formed significantly more colonies (153 ± 8%) in soft agar than control cells (116 ± 5%). Because cells were initially plated at equivalent numbers, this increase in colony number cannot be attributed to an increase in the number of cells plated. The increase in colony size cannot be attributed to experimental variability either, as the colony number in each experiment was normalized to the number of colonies formed by the parental PC12 cells which was set at 100%. These results demonstrate increased anchorage-independent growth in PC12 cells that do not express S100A1. Significant differences in colony size were also detected with the pAntisense clones forming colonies that were significantly smaller (40.6 ± 0.03 μm) than cells transfected with vector only and the parental PC12 cell line (59.5 ± 1.2 μm). Because control and pAntisense cells were similar in size, the smaller pAntisense colony size can be attributed to fewer cells in the colony. These results demonstrate that as cell density increases, anchorage-independent growth of pAntisense clones is reduced. Altogether, these results suggest that S100A1 modulation of cell growth is both complex and density-dependent.Figure 7Anchorage-independent growth properties of pAntisense clones. The number of colonies (left-hand panel) and the colony size (right-hand panel) of control cells transfected with vector containing no insert (white bars) and the three pAntisense clones (gray bars) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are expressed as the mean ± the standard error of the mean, and the asterisks denote p values < 0.05. The pAntisense clones exhibited a significant increase in colony number (p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in colony size (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This study reports the first information regarding the function of the calcium-binding protein S100A1 in intact cells. Decreased S100A1 levels in PC12 cells resulted in an increase in tubulin levels and the number of neurites extended in response to NGF. In theory, cells that are assembling more processes would have higher levels of structural components such as microtubules. In fact, PC12 cells that do not express S100A1 did have increased levels of α-tubulin. We also report that decreased S100A1 levels in PC12 cells alter cell growth in a density-dependent manner. Although the reductions in S100A1 initially increase anchorage-independent growth, as cells become more dense, the net result in both anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent growth is a reduction in cell number. These results suggest that S100A1 expression promotes cell growth and eliminates some aspect of contact-inhibited cell growth. One model that accounts for our results would be that S100A1 directly modulates tubulin/microtubule levels in PC12 cells and that the effects on cell growth and calcium homeostasis are indirect effects, which occur as a consequence of the changes in tubulin/microtubules. This model is consistent with previous studies, which have identified tubulin and tubulin-associated proteins as S100A1 target proteins (see Ref. 1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). However, S100A1 has been shown to regulate the activity of a number of growth regulatory proteins in vitro, including the tumor suppressor p53 (28Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that S100A1 interacts with multiple target proteins and directly regulates both tubulin/microtubule levels and cell growth. Additional experiments will be needed to determine if S100A1 directly or indirectly regulates various cellular processes. The results that we observed in PC12 cells are in accordance with previous in vitro studies on S100 target proteins. First, previous studies have reported that S100A1 proteins interact with numerous in vitro target proteins, suggesting that S100A1 will regulate multiple diverse processes in cells and that S100A1 regulation of these processes can be modulated at multiple sites. Consistent with these studies are our observations that S100A1 regulates multiple cellular processes in PC12 cells and that the effects of S100A1 on these processes can change under various conditions such as cell density. Second, the fact that S100A1 regulates most in vitro target proteins in a stoichiometric rather than catalytic fashion suggests that the effects of S100A1 on cellular process will be modulatory and not all-or-none. As predicted, in PC12 cells we observed modulatory rather than all-or-none effects. Third, the fact that some S100A1 target proteins are regulated in a calcium-independent manner suggests that altered S100A1 expression would have significant effects on cell phenotype even in the absence of agents that raise intracellular calcium levels. This view is supported not only by our observations with S100A1, but also by studies on S100B (7Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Welsh M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), S100A4 (8Lakshmi M.S. Parker C. Sherbet G.V. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 299-304PubMed Google Scholar), and S100A6 (10Masiakowski P. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because we have observed a small decrease in resting intracellular calcium levels in pAntisense cells, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the effects which we observed are calcium-dependent. 2D. B. Zimmer, E. H. Cornwall, P. D. Reynolds, and C. M. Donald, unpublished observation. Nonetheless, we can say that these processes are regulated by S100A1 in absence of the large changes in intracellular calcium usually associated with activation of the calcium signaling cascade. Additional studies will be needed before the target proteins involved in and calcium dependence of S100A1 regulation of tubulin/microtubule levels, neurite organization, and cell growth in PC12 cells can be ascertained. The results presented in this study also provide new insights into the relationship between S100 family members. First, all of the S100 proteins that have been studied in intact cells have been documented to regulate the cytoskeleton and cell growth (7Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Welsh M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Lakshmi M.S. Parker C. Sherbet G.V. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 299-304PubMed Google Scholar, 9Takenaga K. Nakamura Y.

These observations suggest that S100 family members have redundant functions. However, when one examines an individual cell type, each family member appears to regulate different aspects of these processes. For example, in PC12 cells, S100A6 initiates neurite extension in response to NGF (10Masiakowski P. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) whereas S100A1 determines how many neurites will be extended. Furthermore, S100A6 does not alter cell growth whereas S100A1 does. Additional studies on other S100 family members will be required before the universality of nonredundant function for S100 family members can be established. In summary, this study provides direct evidence that S100A1 regulates tubulin/microtubule levels, neurite organization, and cell growth in PC12 cells. In fact, S100A1 may be a molecule that directly links the cytoskeleton and cell growth. The observations that increases in microtubule stability can reverse neuronal cell death associated with Alzheimer's disease (29Burke W.J. Raghu G. Strong R. Life Sci. 1994; 16: 313-319Google Scholar) as well as neurotoxic agents such as acrylamide and carbon disulfide (30Gupta R.P. Abou-Donia M.B. Mol. Chem.

S100A1 antagonists may also be useful agents for the treatment of cancers such as renal carcinoma because these cancers express high levels of S100A1 (see Ref. 1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), and this study demonstrates that decreased S100A1 expression/function is associated with decreased growth rates.

To determine the importance of these contacts in the interaction between E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts, residues in EF-Ts at the interface of these two proteins were mutated. The binding constants governing the interaction of the resulting EF-Ts variants with E. coliEF-Tu were determined.

Mutations prepared in EF-Tu indicate that His-19 and Gln-114 but not Glu-348 in EF-Tu are moderately important for its interaction with EF-Ts. Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins play crucial roles in numerous cellular processes (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). These factors cycle through GDP- and GTP-bound states that reflect their active and inactive forms. Many of these proteins require a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to promote the conversion of the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form. One of the best studied of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins is elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). 1The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-Ts, elongation factor Ts (The proposed nomenclature for these factors is now EF1α and EF1β, respectively. The traditional nomenclature is being used here for the sake of continuity with the extensive literature on these two factors.); aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA. 1The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; EF-Ts, elongation factor Ts (The proposed nomenclature for these factors is now EF1α and EF1β, respectively. The traditional nomenclature is being used here for the sake of continuity with the extensive literature on these two factors.); aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA. During the process of polypeptide chain elongation in protein biosynthesis, EF-Tu promotes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the acceptor site (A-site) of the ribosome (2Ravel J.M. Shorey R.L. Garner C.W. Dawkins R.C. Shive W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1969; 34: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This binding reaction requires the formation of a ternary complex (EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA). The correct ternary complex is selected through codon-anticodon interactions at the A-site. EF-Tu then hydrolyzes the bound GTP and is released from the ribosome as an EF-Tu·GDP complex (3Bosch L. Kraal B. van der Meide P. van Noort J. Prog. Nucieic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 30: 91-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second elongation factor (EF-Ts) promotes the release of GDP forming an intermediate EF-Tu·Ts complex (4Miller D. Weissbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, GTP binds to the EF-Tu·Ts complex promoting the release of EF-Ts and the formation of an EF-Tu·GTP complex. This complex binds another aa-tRNA forming the ternary complex again and the cycle repeats. The three-dimensional structures of EF-Tu complexed to its ligands have been reported (5Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Analysis of these structures indicates that EF-Tu folds into three domains. Domain I encompasses the first 200 residues and includes the guanine nucleotide-binding site. Domains II and III are each about 100 residues in length. All three domains are required for binding the aa-tRNA (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). EF-Ts can be divided into four structural units as follows: the N-terminal domain (residues 1–54), the core domain (residues 55–179 and 229–263), the dimerization domain (residues 180–228), and the C-terminal module (residues 264–282). The core domain is divided into subdomain N (residues 55–140) and subdomain C (residues 141–179 and 229–263). The crystal structure indicates that there are extensive regions of contact between E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts (9Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, subdomain N, and the C-terminal module all interact with domain I of EF-Tu, whereas subdomain C interacts with domain III. Examination of the three-dimensional structure of the EF-Tu·Ts complex originally suggested that nucleotide exchange arises in part because the side chains of Asp-80 and Phe-81 of EF-Ts intrude into a site on EF-Tu near where the Mg2+ ion interacting with GDP is normally located (9Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The resulting disruption of the Mg2+ ion binding site was postulated to reduce the affinity of EF-Tu for GDP. However, mutation of Asp-80 or Phe-81 to Ala only results in a 2–3-fold reduction in the ability of EF-Ts to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange with EF-Tu·GDP (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutation of both Asp-80 and Phe-81 has a more deleterious effect (about 10-fold) on the activity of E. coli EF-Ts. These observations suggest that other regions of EF-Ts must be playing a role in promoting GDP exchange and/or in the binding of EF-Ts to EF-Tu. In the present work, we have prepared a number of mutations that alter resides at the interface between EF-Tu and EF-Ts. The effects of these mutations on the affinity of EF-Ts for EF-Tu and on its ability to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange have been analyzed. E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts genes were cloned into pET24c(+) (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis of individual residues was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-based “linker scanning” method (11Li X. Shapiro L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3745-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was also used to construct a derivative of EF-Ts carrying a deletion in helix h13 (residues 271–282). A His-tagged form of E. coli EF-Tu was expressed and purified as described previously (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A His-tagged form of E. coliEF-Ts was purified under two different conditions basically as described previously (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the first set of conditions, no GDP was present in the extraction buffers. This procedure was used to analyze the amount of EF-Tu co-purifying with EF-Ts or it mutated derivatives. In the second set of conditions, 10 μm GDP was included in the buffers as described previously (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This procedure was used to prepare EF-Ts or its variants free of EF-Tu. The equilibrium association constants for the binding of GDP to mutated forms of EF-Tu were determined as described previously (12Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The binding constants governing the interaction of various mutated forms of E. coli EF-Ts to EF-Tu were determined basically as described previously (13Zhang Y. Sun V. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21956-21963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The binding constants governing the interaction of various mutated forms ofE. coli EF-Tu to wild-type EF-Ts were determined in a similar manner (13Zhang Y. Sun V. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21956-21963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For these experiments, EF-Tu·GDP (0.5 μm, 50 pmol), [3H]GDP (500 cpm/pmol) (5 or 10 μm), and EF-Ts or its variants (1–3 μm, 100–300 pmol) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μL) at 20 °C for 30 min as described (13Zhang Y. Sun V. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21956-21963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amount of EF-Tu·GDP at equilibrium was measured by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (14Fox L. Erion J. Tarnowski J. Spremulli L. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6018-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kobs for Reaction 1 is shown below in Equation 1. EF­Tu·GDP+EF­Ts⇄EF­Tu·Ts+GDPReaction 1 Kobs=[EF­Tu·Ts][GDP][EF−Tu·GDP][EF−Ts]Equation 1 Kobs was calculated in each case and used to determine the binding constant (KTs) for Reaction 2 EF­Tu+EF­Ts⇄EF­Tu·TsReaction 2 using the relationship shown in Equation 2. KTs=Kobs·KTu·GDPEquation 2 Where KTu·GDP is the binding constant of EF-Tu to GDP (3.3 × 108m−1) (12Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This value forKTu·GDP was used for experiments using wild-type EF-Tu and for the H19A and E348A derivatives. KTu·GDP was determined to be 7.9 ± 2.1 × 107 for the Q114A variant of EF-Tu. The wild-type EF-Tu and the E348A derivative used for these experiments were about 50% active based on their abilities to bind GDP. The Q114A and the H19A variants of EF-Tu were estimated to be 20% active as estimated by their ability to bind GDP at saturating concentrations of the nucleotide. EF-Ts was estimated to be fully active based on the percentage that could bind to EF-Tu. The activities of EF-Ts and its variants in promoting GDP exchange with EF-Tu·GDP and in stimulating the activity of this factor in poly(U)-directed polymerization of phenylalanine were determined as described (14Fox L. Erion J. Tarnowski J. Spremulli L. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6018-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schwartzbach C. Farwell M. Liao H. Spremulli L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of EF-Ts makes a number of contacts with domain I of EF-Tu (Fig. 1 A). These interactions include Ala-5, Lys-9, Arg-12, Met-19, Met-20, and Arg-23 of EF-Ts. This area of the interface is bound on the edges by electrostatic and H bond contacts, whereas the interior of the surface is predominantly hydrophobic. This type of distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts on the surface of a protein-protein interaction site is quite common (16Tsai C. Lin S. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 127-152Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Xu D. Lin S. Nussinov R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To assess the relative importance of the interactions of these residues in EF-Ts with domain I of EF-Tu, four mutants of E. coliEF-Ts (K9AR12A, M19AM20A, M19EM20E, and K23A) were constructed and purified from E. coli as His-tagged proteins. When cell extracts are prepared in buffers containing Mg2+ but lacking GDP, small amounts of EF-Tu are present when wild-type EF-Ts is expressed (data not shown). This level of EF-Tu (about 1 mol of EF-Tu per 10–20 mol of EF-Ts) reflects the relative ability of EF-Ts to compete for binding to EF-Tu with the guanine nucleotides and aa-tRNA present in the cell extract. When cell extracts are prepared in buffers containing GDP, no EF-Tu is present in the preparations of the wild-type factor or of any of the mutated forms described below ((10) and data not shown). The first mutated form of EF-Ts to be tested was K9AR12A. Surprisingly, Lys-9 interacts with EF-Tu primarily through a hydrophobic contact between a side chain —CH2— and Leu-148 in domain I of EF-Tu. Arg-12 makes an electrostatic interaction with Glu-152 and a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Asp-109 in EF-Tu (Fig. 1 A). No EF-Tu co-purifies with the K9AR12A derivative of EF-Ts (data not shown). This observation suggests that one or both of these residues is important for the interaction of EF-Ts with EF-Tu. To assess the role of these two residues more fully, an attempt was made to measure the binding constant between EF-Tu and the K9AR12A derivative of EF-Ts. These measurements are made by determining the ability of EF-Ts to compete with GDP for binding to EF-Tu (12Miller D. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Sun V. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21956-21963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The interaction of wild-type EF-Ts with EF-Tu is characterized by a binding constant of about 9 × 108m−1 (Table I). The binding constant for the K9AR12A derivative is too weak to be measured in the competition assay used suggesting that there is at least a 100-fold reduction in this value. This mutated form of EF-Ts has no detectable activity in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange with EF-Tu (Fig. 2 A) or in stimulating the activity of this factor in poly(U)-directed polymerization of phenylalanine (Fig. 2 B).Table IKobs and KTs for E. coli EF-Ts and its mutated derivativesEF-TsKobsKTsm−1Wild type2.7 ± 0.48.9 ± 1.3 × 108K9AR12A<0.03<0.1 × 108M19AM20A0.37 ± 0.081.2 ± 0.3 × 108M19EM20E<0.03<0.1 × 108K23A2.0 ± 0.46.6 ± 1.3 × 108D80A1.2 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.3 × 108F81A0.41 ± 0.071.4 ± 0.2 × 108D80AF81A0.20 ± 0.030.66 ± 0.10 × 108H147A<0.03<0.1 × 108K166AH167A0.19 ± 0.050.63 ± 0.17 × 108V234AM235A1.0 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.7 × 108V234EM235E<0.03<0.1 × 108H13-del1.4 ± 0.34.6 ± 1.0 × 108 Open table in a new tab It is always possible that a mutation resulting in an inactive protein exerts its effect by preventing the normal folding of the polypeptide chain. To assess whether the lack of activity observed with the K9AR12A derivative is the result of the failure of the protein to fold, CD spectroscopy was carried out on wild-type EF-Ts and on the K9AR12A derivative. Spectra were collected from 178 to 260 nm allowing an assessment of the ability of the mutated protein to fold into the correct secondary structure. The CD spectra of this mutated protein is identical to that of the wild-type protein indicating that it has folded correctly (data not shown). The observations above indicate that Lys-9, Arg-12, or both of these residues make an essential contact with EF-Tu that is important for the strength of the interaction between these two factors and for the biological activity of EF-Ts. In assessing the relative importance of Lys-9 and Arg-12 in EF-Ts, it should be noted that the major contact between Lys-9 and domain I of EF-Tu is through the β-methylene group that is about 3.8 Å from the side chain of Leu-148. This contact is still available when Lys-9 is mutated to Ala. An examination of the conservation of this residue in EF-Ts from various organisms indicates that Lys-9 is generally a Lys residue in prokaryotes but is Met in mitochondrial EF-Ts. In contrast, Arg-12 is 100% conserved in the EF-Ts' that have been sequenced to date. All of these observations indicate that the lack of activity of the K9AR12A derivative is probably due to the mutation of Arg-12 suggesting that this residue plays a critical role in EF-Ts. The central core of the interactions between the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts and domain I of EF-Tu is formed by Met-19 and Met-20 which make hydrophobic contacts with Val-140, Leu-145, Leu-148, and Val-149 of EF-Tu (Fig. 1 A). They also make backbone hydrogen bonds with residues in domain I of EF-Tu. Although methionine is not universally present at positions 19 and 20 of EF-Ts, these residues are generally hydrophobic as would be expected. When a mutated derivative of these residues (M19AM20A) is prepared and purified from E. coli, a small amount of EF-Tu can be seen co-purifying with this protein. In contrast, no EF-Tu is observed in preparations of EF-Ts in which Met-19 and Met-20 have been mutated to glutamic acid. The binding constant between EF-Tu and the M19AM20A mutant of EF-Ts is reduced about 7-fold compared with the wild-type EF-Ts (Table I). No interaction can be detected between EF-Tu and the M10EM20E derivative. This observation is not surprising since the presence of Glu in these positions would completely disrupt the hydrophobic core formed by the interaction of the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts with domain I of EF-Tu. The M19AM20A derivative shows about a 3-fold lower activity in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange with EF-Tu and is about 2-fold less active in stimulating the activity of this factor in polymerization (Fig. 2). As expected, the M19EM20E mutant is completely inactive in these assays. Overall, these observations suggest that Met-19 and Met-20 play a modest role in facilitating the binding of EF-Ts to EF-Tu. Mutation of these residues to Ala creates two small holes in this portion of the interface between EF-Tu and EF-Ts. Loss of some of the hydrophobic binding energy provided by these residues does not have a profound effect on the interaction between these two proteins. However, it is clear that hydrophilic groups cannot be tolerated at this portion of the interface. The final residue in the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts making contact with EF-Tu is Lys-23. This residue forms an electrostatic contact with Asp-141 and contributes to the hydrophilic edge defining the surface of this region of contact (Fig. 1 A). Lys or occasionally Arg are found at this position in the EF-Ts found in various organisms. When a K23A derivative of EF-Ts is purified from E. coli, it co-purifies with about the same amount of EF-Tu observed in preparations of the wild-type factor (data not shown). This observation suggests that the K23A derivative of EF-Ts binds to EF-Tu essentially as well as does the wild-type factor. This observation was confirmed by measuring the binding constant of this mutated derivative which is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type factor (Table I). The K23A mutant promotes guanine nucleotide exchange with EF-Tu as effectively as the normal factor and is only about 2-fold less active in stimulating the activity of EF-Tu in polymerization (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that, despite the conservation of a basic residue at position 23, the electrostatic contacts here contribute little to the binding between EF-Tu and EF-Ts. Subdomain N of the core of EF-Ts makes several potentially important contacts with domain I of E. coli EF-Tu (Fig. 1 B). The side chains of Asp-80 and Phe-81 are inserted into domain I of EF-Tu near the site where the Mg2+ ion coordinated to GDP is normally located. Asp-80 and Phe-81 are conserved among all of the EF-Ts sequences determined to date suggesting that they play an important role in the activity of this protein. These two residues were mutated in a previous study (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The D80A and F81A mutants are 2- to 3-fold less active than wild-type EF-Ts in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange. The double mutant D81AF81A is about 10-fold less active. We have now examined the contributions of these two residues to the strength of the interaction between EF-Ts and EF-Tu. As indicated in Table I, the D80A derivative shows only a slightly lower (about 2-fold) binding constant for interaction with EF-Tu. The F81A mutant binds EF-Tu about 6-fold less tightly. The effects of mutation of both these residues are cumulative, and the double mutant (D80AF81A) shows about a 12-fold reduction in the binding constant for EF-Tu (Table I). These values are consistent with the relative abilities of the mutated derivatives to stimulate the activity of EF-Tu. An additional side chain in subdomain N of the core of EF-Ts (Lys-51) makes an electrostatic contact with Asp-21 in domain I of EF-Tu. This residue has not been as highly conserved as many others and is actually a Leu in the mitochondrial factors that are active in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange with E. coli EF-Tu (18Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Xin H. Leanza K. Spremulli L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 101-112Google Scholar). Hence, it is unlikely that Lys-51 plays an essential role in stabilizing the interaction of EF-Tu and EF-Ts. It was not mutated in the present study. Two contacts are made between backbone atoms in subdomain N of EF-Ts and side chains in domain I of EF-Tu. A hydrogen bond is found between the carbonyl oxygen of Ile-125 and the amine function of Gln-114. An additional hydrogen bond is found between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-126 and an imidazole nitrogen in His-19 (Fig. 1 B). To examine the roles of these contacts in the interaction between EF-Tu and EF-Ts, two E. coli EF-Tu mutants (H19A and Q114A) were created. The H19A derivative of EF-Tu has a binding constant for GDP similar to that of wild-type EF-Tu. This derivative shows a small reduction (about 3-fold) in its binding constant for wild-type EF-Ts (Table II). Wild-type E. coliEF-Ts is about 3-fold less active in stimulating GDP exchange with the H19A variant of EF-Tu (Fig. 3 A). These observations indicate that contact between the backbone carbonyl of residue Gly-126 in EF-Ts with the side chain of His-19 plays only a minor role in stabilizing the interaction between EF-Tu and EF-Ts.Table IIKobs and KTs for E. coli EF-Tu and its mutated derivativesEF-TuKobsKTsm−1Wild type2.7 ± 0.48.9 ± 1.3 × 108H19A1.0 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.3 × 108Q114A1.2 ± 0.10.95 ± 0.25 × 108E348A4.8 ± 1.016 ± 3 × 108 Open table in a new tab To assess the role of the contact between the backbone of Gly-126 of EF-Ts and Gln-114 of EF-Tu, a Q114A derivative of EF-Tu was prepared. This derivative has a somewhat weaker binding constant for GDP than the wild-type factor (about 8 × 107m−1 compared with 3.3 × 108m−1, data not shown). It also has a weaker binding constant for interaction with EF-Ts (about 0.95 × 108, Table II). The reductions in the affinities of this factor for GDP and EF-Ts offset each other to a significant extent. Thus, when wild-type E. coli EF-Ts is tested for its ability to stimulate GDP exchange with the Q114A derivative of EF-Tu, it is only 2-fold less active than with wild-type EF-Tu (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that the contact between Gln-114 in EF-Tu and subdomain N of EF-Ts is only modestly important in the interaction between these two proteins. Subdomain C of the core of EF-Ts makes a number of contacts with domain III of EF-Tu (Fig. 1 C). These include His-147, Ile-151, Lys-166, His-167, Met-170, Ala-174, Val-234, and Met-235. No analysis of the roles of Ile-151, Met-170, or Ala-174 was carried out in the present work since these residues are not as highly conserved as many others in EF-Ts. His-147 of EF-Ts interacts with Asp-354 through an ion pair and makes a van der Waals contact with Met-351 in domain III of EF-Tu. His-147 in EF-Ts was mutated to Ala, and the mutated protein was expressed and purified from E. coli in buffers lacking GDP. Under these conditions a small amount of EF-Tu co-purifies with wild-type EF-Ts. In contrast, no EF-Tu is detected in preparations of the H147A derivative of EF-Ts. This observation suggests that His-147 may play an important role in the interaction between these two proteins. This idea was confirmed when attempts were made to measure the binding constant for the interaction of the H147A derivative with EF-Tu. The interaction is too weak to be detected suggesting that there is at least a 100-fold decrease in the affinity between these two proteins. A small amount of activity in promoting GDP exchange and in stimulating poly(U)-dependent polymerization can be detected when the H147A derivative is tested (Fig. 4). This observation suggests that this derivative of EF-Ts does indeed have some activity but that its interaction with EF-Tu is significantly impaired. To assess whether the reduced activity observed is due to the failure of most of the molecules in the preparation to fold properly, the CD spectra of this derivative was obtained from 178 to 260 nm and compared with that of the wild-type factor. No differences in these spectra were apparent suggesting that the H147A variant folds like the normal protein (data not shown). Val-234 and Met-235 of EF-Ts form part of a hydrophobic core in the interaction between EF-Ts and domain III of EF-Tu (Fig. 1 C). These residues were mutated to Ala, and the double mutant was expressed and purified from E. coli. Significant amounts of EF-Tu co-purify with this variant of EF-Ts suggesting that it binds well. The binding constant between EF-Tu and the V234AM235A derivative is reduced about 3-fold compared with that of the wild-type EF-Ts (Table I). This derivative is also quite active in stimulating GDP exchange with EF-Tu and in promoting the activity of this factor in polymerization (Fig. 4). The replacement of Val and Met residues with Ala would be expected to cause a reduction in the strength of the hydrophobic interactions in this region of the interface between EF-Tu and EF-Ts. However, replacement of these residues with charged residues would be expected to cause a complete disruption of the interaction. This idea was tested by creating a V234EM235E variant. No detectable binding between it and EF-Tu can be detected (Table I). Finally, the V234EM235E derivative has no activity in stimulating GDP exchange or polymerization with EF-Tu. Taken together, these data argue that a hydrophobic interaction in this portion of the interface is important for allowing the close association of EF-Tu and EF-Ts, but the exact nature of the residues forming this interface is not crucial. The final region of contact tested between subdomain C of EF-Ts and domain III of EF-Tu is provided by Lys-166 and His-167 in EF-Ts (Fig. 1 C). Lys-166 forms an ion pair with Glu-348 of EF-Tu. His-167 makes contact with this same residue through a bridging water molecule. Lys-166 is generally a basic residue in the EF-Ts from prokaryotic organisms but is not conserved in the mitochondrial factors. His-167 is not a highly conserved residue. When a H166AK167A variant is purified from E. coli, less EF-Tu is observed co-purifying with the mutated protein than with the wild-type EF-Ts. Measurement of the binding constant between the H166AK167A variant and EF-Tu indicates that this derivative has about a 10-fold lower binding affinity for EF-Tu than the normal factor. This variant is 2–4-fold less active in promoting GDP exchange and polymerization with EF-Tu (Fig. 4). These observations indicate that one or both of these residues play a modest role in the interaction observed. To examine the role of these residues more completely, a complementary derivative of EF-Tu was prepared. This derivative has a mutation that converts Glu-348 in domain III to Ala. The E348A mutant of EF-Tu was purified from E. coli. This variant appears to be normal and binds GDP with approximately the same affinity as the wild-type factor (data not shown). Surprisingly, when the E348A mutant of EF-Tu is tested for its ability to bind EF-Ts, it actually has a somewhat higher binding constant than that observed with the wild-type factor (Table II). Wild-type EF-Ts can stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange with the E348A variant as well as with the normal EF-Tu (Fig. 5). This observation seems to be at odds with the reduction in binding constant in the H166AK167A variant of EF-Ts. One possible explanation for this difference may be a reflection of the role of hydrophilic residues at the interfaces of interacting proteins. These residues are often clustered around the outer rim of the interacting surface and serve to protect a series of hydrophobic residues in the core of the interacting surface from water. His-166 and Lys-167 in EF-Ts may serve this purpose. When both of these residues are mutated to Ala, a hole in the interacting surface may be formed that allows the entry of water molecules. The penetration of water may be sufficient to disrupt the interaction of the hydrophobic residues forming the core of the surface contacts between subdomain C of EF-Ts and domain III of EF-Tu. Mutation of the single residue Glu-348 on EF-Tu may not allow water to enter the hydrophobic core since the side chains of His-166 and Lys-167 may effectively prevent entry of water to this region. Thus, in this interpretation, His-166 and Lys-167 stabilize the interaction of EF-Tu and EF-Ts not through direct contacts but indirectly by protecting the hydrophobic interactions occurring in adjacent parts of the interacting surfaces. In the crystal structure of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex, the C-terminal α-helix of EF-Ts folds back across domain I of EF-Tu. This final helical segment is not present in the EF-Ts found in many species including the mitochondrial factors (18Xin H. Woriax V. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17243-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since mitochondrial EF-Ts can bind E. coli EF-Tu and stimulate the activity of this factor, it was of interest to test the importance of helix 13 in the interaction of E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Ts. A derivative ofE. coli EF-Ts (h13-del) was prepared that carries a deletion of the final helix. The binding constant of the deletion derivative to EF-Tu is only about 2-fold lower than the binding constant of wild-type EF-Ts (Table I). The activity of EF-Ts in which helix 13 has been deleted in promoting GDP exchange with E. coli EF-Tu is about the same as that of wild-type EF-Ts (Fig. 4 A). The activity of the deleted derivative in stimulating the activity of EF-Tu in polymerization is only slightly lower than that of wild-type EF-Ts (Fig. 4 B). These observations indicate that the final helical segment in E. coli EF-Ts does not play a crucial role in the interaction of this factor with EF-Tu. This observation is compatible with the absence of this sequence in many of the EF-Ts sequences that have been examined to date. The binding constants governing the interactions of the mutated variants of E. coli EF-Ts with EF-Tu indicate that the contributions of specific residues on the interface to the binding are very different. Whereas residues such as Lys-9/Arg-12, Met-19/Met-20, Phe-81, His-147, and Lys-166/His-167 are important for the interaction, other residues including Lys-23, Asp-80, and Val-234/Met-235 and helix 13 are not particularly important. More essential contacts appear to occur between the N-terminal domain and subdomain N of EF-Ts with domain I of EF-Tu than occur between subdomain C of EF-Ts and domain III of EF-Tu. Of the residues examined here, Arg-12 and His-147 appear to be the most crucial for the interaction between EF-Tu and EF-Ts. The structure of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex suggested that the mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange catalyzed by EF-Ts could be explained by the insertion of the side chains of Asp-80 and Phe-81 near the Mg2+ ion binding site in domain I of EF-Tu (9Kawashima T. Berthet-Colominas C. Wulff M. Cusack S. Leberman R. Nature. 1996; 379: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The loss of the Mg2+ ion which is essential for guanine nucleotide binding would cause the subsequent dissociation of the GDP moiety. However, mutation of these residues individually has only modest effects on the activity of EF-Ts (10Zhang Y. Li X. Spremulli L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The data reported here indicate that these effects are directly correlated with the moderate decreases in the affinities of these mutated forms for EF-Tu. Analysis of the relationship between the abilities of the mutated forms of EF-Ts to bind EF-Tu and the activities of these derivatives in promoting guanine nucleotide exchange indicates that there is a strong correlation between these values. A semilog plot ofKobs versus activity in guanine nucleotide exchange provides nearly a linear relationship when contacts between domain I of EF-Tu and EF-Ts are considered (Fig. 6). Changes in the contacts between domain III of EF-Tu and EF-Ts appear to be somewhat less serious. The correlation between the binding constant and the nucleotide exchange activity suggests that it may not be reasonable to classify certain residues in EF-Ts as being responsible for catalysis and other residues as being primarily involved in the binding interaction. Rather, the interaction of EF-Ts with EF-Tu is a more global event in which multiple small conformational changes arising from the interaction result in a significant cumulative rearrangement of the guanine nucleotide binding domain of EF-Tu promoting GDP release. Examination of the crystal structures of the EF-Tu·Ts complex and EF-Tu·GDP indicates that one function of EF-Ts is to increase the separation between domains I and III of EF-Tu (20Clark B. Nyborg J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This conformational alteration requires interactions of the N-terminal domain and subdomain N of the core of EF-Ts with domain I and EF-Tu and the interaction of subdomain C of EF-Ts with domain III of EF-Tu. The significant structural rearrangement occurring upon these interactions alters the conformations of a number of loops in domain I that participate in nucleotide binding. Thus, a widespread conformational change propagated through domains I and III of EF-Tu results in GDP release. In this view, any alteration that affects the ability of EF-Ts to interact with EF-Tu will have a subsequent effect on nucleotide release. In the studies reported here, no mutated derivatives of EF-Ts were observed that could bind EF-Tu but that were unable to catalyze GDP exchange. Thus, no single residue or cluster of residues in EF-Ts can be thought of as being responsible for the nucleotide exchange reaction. Residues in this factor important in binding EF-Tu are also important in the nucleotide exchange reaction. A similar situation is likely to be found in the variety of nucleotide exchange factors found in the GTPase superfamily of proteins. We thank Dr. T. Kawashima for providing the coordinates of the E. coli EF-Tu·Ts complex."

Mitochondria from S. cerevisiae and Candida utilis yeast cells were able to accumulate Ca2+ only slowly, even from unphysiologically high (mm) concentrations (11Balcavage W.X. Lloyd J.L. Mattoon J.R. Ohnishi T. Scarpa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that the uptake lacked physiological significance. In our laboratory, it was found that Endomyces magnusii yeast cells had mitochondria capable of accumulating Ca2+ from moderate concentrations. This yeast species has large (as implied by the name magnusii) polynucleated cells, with a fully competent oxidative phosphorylation system having three conservation sites in the respiratory chain like animal mitochondria and no alternative electron transfer pathways (12Zvyagilskaya R.A. Kotelnikova A.V. Functional Activity of Yeast Mitochondria Series in Biological Chemistry. 36. VINITI Publishers, Moscow1991Google Scholar). The affinity of the Ca2+-transporting system for Ca2+ ions was rather low, with an apparent Km value of 150–180 μm (13Zvjagilskaya R.A. Leikin Yu. N. Kozhokaru N.L. Kotelnikova A.V. Dokl. Acad. NAUK SSSR. 1983; 269: 1233-1240Google Scholar, 14Leikin Yu. N. Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biokhimiya. 1987; 52: 676-682Google Scholar). The Ca2+ uptake process was energy-dependent since it was strongly inhibited by omission of oxidizable substrate or by the presence of a respiratory inhibitor or uncoupler. Ca2+ uptake was associated with a transient depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, reversible oxidation of cytochrome b, and stimulation of respiration. This implies an uniport mechanism, in which Ca2+ uptake is driven electrophoretically by the membrane potential, negative on the matrix side. Evidence was subsequently presented that the affinity of the Ca2+ transport system was increased in the presence of low concentrations of polyamines below 25 μm spermine or 100 μm spermidine (15Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,16Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This prompted us to search more systematically for naturally occurring modulators of the Ca2+-transporting system in these mitochondria. Here we report that ADP, Ca2+ ions, and exogenous NADH also may serve as potent activators of the E. magnusii mitochondrial calcium transporter. Some of these data have been reported at meetings (17Zvyagilskaya R.A. Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Yu. I. Yeast. 1995; 11: S469Google Scholar, 18Zvyagilskaya R.A. Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Yu. I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 9: 193Google Scholar). E. magnusii yeast, strain VKM Y261, was cultivated in agitated Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C in batches of 100 ml in a medium (18Zvyagilskaya R.A. Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Yu. I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 9: 193Google Scholar) containing glycerol (0.6–1.0%, v/v) as the source of carbon and energy. Cells were harvested at the late exponential growth phase when the cell density corresponded to 10–13 g wet weight/liter. Mitochondria were isolated by the method designed in our laboratory. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 10 mmdithiothreitol, washed twice with distilled water, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 5.8–5.9, containing 1.2m sorbitol and 50 mg of helicase per g of original cell (wet weight), and incubated at 30 °C under mild stirring for 15–20 min to form spheroplasts. After centrifugation at 400 ×g for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with 1.2m sorbitol containing 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and pH was adjusted to 6.0. The pellet was further homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a medium containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 0.4 m mannitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.4% bovine serum albumin. The homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer, except that 0.4m mannitol was substituted for 0.6 m mannitol, centrifugated for 10 min at 1200 × g, and the supernatant centrifugated at 6000 × g for 18 min. The pellets from the second spin were gently resuspended in approximately 20 ml of washing medium (EDTA and EGTA were excluded), recentrifugated at 6000 × g for 18 min, and resuspended in a minimal volume of washing medium. The mitochondria thus obtained met all known criteria of physiological intactness, as inferred from high respiratory rates upon oxidation of pyruvate + malate with respiratory control values of 5–6 and ADP/O ratios close to their theoretically expected maxima, and were fully active for at least 7 h when kept on ice. Oxygen consumption was monitored polarographically in a medium containing 0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm Tris phosphate, 20 mm Tris pyruvate, 5 mm Tris malate, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. Ca2+ uptake was assayed with murexide as an Ca2+ metallochromic indicator by dual-wavelength photometry using the Hitachi spectrophotometer and the wavelength pair 504–570 nm (19Scarpa A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 24B: 343-351Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in the medium above at pH 7.4. Some key experiments were verified using the more sensitive metallochromic indicator Arsenazo III (20Scarpa A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56G: 301-338Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with the wavelength pair 665–685 nm. Its KD for Ca2+ in the sugar-based medium was found by a Scatchard plot to be 1.5 μm. The kinetic parameters were obtained by curve fitting by Easy Plot, version 2.22–5, using the Hill equation (21Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1985Google Scholar) Y = m/[1 + (k/x)n], where m =Vmax, k = [S] atV½, and n = the Hill coefficient. The protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Fig. 1 shows energy-dependent Ca2+ uptake by E. magnusii mitochondria respiring on pyruvate + malate. The addition of 100 μmCa2+ caused an abrupt decrease in absorbance, reflecting the formation of the Ca2+-murexide complex, followed by an increase in absorbance due to Ca2+ accumulation by mitochondria until a steady state for extramitochondrial free [Ca2+] was reestablished. The net efflux rate of Ca2+ even after accumulation of 300 μm of Ca2+ in the presence of inorganic phosphate or acetate on inhibition of uptake by anaerobiosis was very low, 17–18 nmol·min−1·mg−1, the efflux being inhibitable by addition of Mg2+, Mn2+, or La3+ (data not shown), indicating that changes in the initial rates of net Ca2+ uptake were due to changes in influx rates. All Ca2+ accumulated was released in response to addition of the specific Ca2+ ionophore A23187, indicating the intramitochondrial localization of the Ca2+accumulated. The Ca2+ accumulation by yeast mitochondria was enhanced by addition of 25 μm ADP (Fig. 1, tracesa and b, and Fig. 2 A). The effect of ADP was specific (other examined mono-, di-, and trinucleotides, including AMP, cAMP, GMP, GDP, IDP, ATP, or GTP, were inactive; data not shown), saturated at very low concentrations (with a half-maximal stimulation at 2–3 μm) (Fig. 3). Addition of 100 mm KCl slightly increased the affinity for ADP (data not shown). The ADP-enhanced Ca2+ uptake by yeast mitochondria was strongly prevented by low concentrations of atractyloside (Fig. 4), a specific inhibitor of adenine nucleotide translocator (23Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but not by CSA, a potent and seemingly specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-induced, phosphate-dependent permeabilization (MPT, pore) of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 4). These data appear to indicate that ADP acted from the matrix side and stimulated the electrogenic Ca2+ uptake mechanism itself. In the presence of ADP, the uptake kinetics were changed from sigmoidal to more hyperbolic (Fig. 2 A), the Hill coefficient being lowered from 2.59 to 2.11, and the Vmaxbeing substantially increased. ADP thus moderately improved the Ca2+-buffering capacity of mitochondria, i.e.their ability to maintain a low extramitochondrial [Ca2+] (Fig. 1, traces a and b; Fig. 2 B).Figure 3Dependence of the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake on ADP concentration.

The concentrations of Ca2+, atractyloside, and CSA added were 100, 33, and 0.25 μm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Normally, freshly isolated E. magnusii yeast mitochondria showed a rather low intramitochondrial NADH/NAD ratio, which, however, could be considerably increased by short term incubation with NADH (data not shown). Yeast mitochondria, unlike many animal mitochondria, readily oxidize exogenous NADH. The dehydrogenase responsible for its oxidation is located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane and donates electrons to the respiratory chain at the level of coenzyme Q, bypassing the site I of energy conservation (12Zvyagilskaya R.A. Kotelnikova A.V. Functional Activity of Yeast Mitochondria Series in Biological Chemistry. 36. VINITI Publishers, Moscow1991Google Scholar). In mitochondria from glycerol-grown E. magnusii cells, NADH along with glycerol 1-phosphate is the most rapidly oxidizable substrate “monopolizing” the respiratory chain and potently inducing reversed electron flow (24Zvyagilskaya R.A. Selenshchikova V.A. Uralskaya L.A. Kotelnikova A.V. Biokhimiya. 1981; 46: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zvyagilskaya R.A. Selenshchikova V.A. Burbaev D.Sh. Kotelnikova A.V. Dokl. Acad. NAUK SSSR. 1982; 263: 491-493Google Scholar). To have a higher NADH/NAD+ ratio in the matrix, the mitochondrial suspension was incubated with 4 mm NADH for 0.5 min (this is sufficient to effectively induce reversed electron flow; Ref. 25Zvyagilskaya R.A. Selenshchikova V.A. Burbaev D.Sh. Kotelnikova A.V. Dokl. Acad. NAUK SSSR. 1982; 263: 491-493Google Scholar) and then used a small aliquot of the suspension (50-fold dilution) to avoid external NADH serving as an additional respiratory substrate. Mitochondria treated in this way exhibited very high rates of Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 5 A) and a slightly improved Ca2+-buffering capacity (Fig. 5 B). The Ca2+ affinity of the transporter was increased, and half-maximal rate of uptake was obtained at 100 μm, while in the control 155 μm was required, but the Hill coefficient was not changed. The stimulatory effect of NADH was not due to ADP contamination in the NADH preparation used. Ca2+ ions themselves were found to modulate the yeast mitochondrial Ca2+ transporter. Moderate amounts of Ca2+, added sequentially, progressively increased the uptake rates and lowered the external steady state Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 6,A and B, left traces). Similarly, preincubation of mitochondria for 1 min with 20 μmCa2+ accelerated the uptake of moderate (50 and 100 μm) Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1, trace c, and Fig. 7 A), the [Ca2+] at V½ being lowered to 63 μm without changing the Hill coefficient. Remarkably, such a pretreatment of mitochondria enabled them to take up virtually all Ca2+ from the incubation medium, lowering the steady state [Ca2+] to a few micromolar at most (Fig. 1,trace c, and Fig. 7 B).Figure 7The effect of preincubation of yeast mitochondria with 20 μm Ca2+ on the initial rate of Ca2+ transport (A) and the steady state medium free [Ca2+] (B). Preincubation was carried out for 1 min in the incubation medium in the presence of substrate and 20 μm Ca2+ at room temperature with gentle stirring. Then varying amounts of Ca2+ were added and its uptake recorded. Closed circles, control;open triangles, after preincubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The stimulatory effect of ADP was further potentiated by 25 μm spermine (Fig. 1, traces a and b; Fig. 2, A and B). Added together, these two physiological modulators provided high rates of Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 2 A) and an improved Ca2+-buffering capacity (Fig. 2 B). Exceptionally high rates of Ca2+ uptake were obtained with a combination of all these modulators, i.e. ADP, spermine, NADH and Ca2+ (Fig. 8 A and9). The yeast mitochondria were then able, when exposed to 50–300 μm Ca2+, to maintain a constant steady state extramitochondrial [Ca2+] close to the detection limit of the murexide technique (1–3 μm; Fig. 8 B), and even that of Arsenazo III (Fig. 9), i.e. ∼0.2 μm. The level was maintained for 10–15 min, i.e. until the experiment was terminated (data not shown). It is noteworthy that yeast mitochondria supplemented with the physiological effectors preserved the improved kinetic properties of the Ca2+ transport system even in the presence of 0.5 mm Mg2+, 5 mm NaCl, and 100 mm KCl, mimicking the ionic composition of the cytosol (Fig. 8, A and B), the [Ca2+] at V½ being 110, 96 μm, and the Hill coefficients 2.15.Figure 9Effect of modulators on Ca2+uptake measured by Arsenazo III. The standard medium was supplemented with 25 μm Arsenazo III. The wavelength couple 665–685 nm was used to monitor [Ca2+]. Additions were made as indicated by the arrows in trace a; Ca2+, 100 μm; ADP, 20 μm; spermine 25 μm. In trace b, mitochondria were preincubated with 1 mm NADH and suspended in the standard medium containing 20 μm ADP and 25 μmspermine from the beginning of the experiment. The free [Ca2+] was calculated using a KD of 1.5 μm for the calcium-Arsenazo III complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The main finding in this study is a potent stimulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in E. magnusii by ADP, Ca2+ itself, and NADH in addition to the previously known stimulation by polyamines (15Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protective action of adenine nucleotides on mammalian mitochondria has long been known (26Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 27Toninello A. Siliprandi D. Siliprandi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The most likely explanation is that ADP counteracts the swelling induced by Ca2+,i.e. MPT (29Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Milgrom Y.M. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16274-16282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18931-18936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and the opening of the CSA-sensitive pore (32Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could not, however, find any evidence in favor of the existence of MPT in E. magnusii mitochondria. Therefore, it is unlikely that the effects of ADP and atractyloside are mediated by the modulation of pore opening, i.e. due to inhibition of Ca2+ efflux that is negligible, <20 nmol of Ca2+/min/mg of protein. Rather, these data indicate that the stimulatory effect of ADP on the rate of Ca2+accumulation was due to stimulation of the uptake mechanism itself. Rottenberg and Marbach (33Rottenberg H. Marbach M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 483-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Rottenberg H. Marbach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have interpreted the lowering of the steady state [Ca2+] by ADP in brain mitochondria as a stimulation of the uniporter via a conformation change of the adenine nucleotide translocator since the efflux rate for Ca2+ was low and CSA only slightly affected the steady state. The apparent lack of MPT in these yeast mitochondria would readily explain their ability to retain large amounts of Ca2+ and stay coupled for a comparatively long time. Yeast mitochondria offer a fertile field for evaluating Ca2+ transport as affected by gradual changes in the redox state of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. In animal mitochondria, the picture is complicated by MPT that is stimulated by oxidation of pyridine nucleotides, presumably because of interrelations between the redox states of pyridine nucleotides, glutathione, and pore vicinal SH groups (35Zoratti M. Szabó I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NADH modulates mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in E. magnusii yeast is unknown; NADH may influence the transport directly or via the redox state of glutathione and SH groups. Oxidation of added NADH followed by reversed electron flow could conceivably effect reduction of matrix NAD+ that could enhance the Ca2+ uptake mechanism. The Ca2+ uptake system ofE. magnusii yeast mitochondria displays striking similarities with the well characterized animal mitochondrial calcium uniporter. In both systems, the driving force is the transmembrane potential, negative on the matrix side. Both transport systems are stimulated by polyamines and by Ca2+ itself (36Kröner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Kröner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Saris N.-E.L. Kröner H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It may therefore be justified to call the E. magnusii yeast Ca2+ transporter a mitochondrial calcium uniporter as well. The concerted action of spermine, ADP, NADH, and small concentrations of Ca2+ ions may confer to these yeast mitochondria a similar role as for the animal uniporter (4McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), i.e. the short term regulation of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Yeast mitochondria may even be more important in the overall Ca2+ homeostasis than animal mitochondria. However, there is one striking difference in that the animal mitochondrial calcium uniporter is very sensitive to Ruthenium Red (39Moore C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), while theE. magnusii one is less sensitive, if at all, and in this respect resembles plant mitochondria (40Åkerman K.E.O. Moore A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Saccharomycesyeasts have a low activity, Ruthenium Red-sensitive cation transporter (41Manon S. Guérin M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 25: 671-678Google Scholar). We have even seen stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by Ruthenium Red in E. magnusii yeast mitochondria (42Bazhenova E.N. Saris N.-E. L. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, stimulation of the fast mode of Ca2+ uptake by very low levels of Ruthenium Red in liver mitochondria was reported (3Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that E. magnusii so far is the only yeast species in which an efficient mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake system has been demonstrated. One may speculate that there is a close correlation between the capacity of mitochondria for Ca2+transport and the structural organization of the respiratory chain,i.e. the functioning of complex I of the respiratory chain as a coupling site in oxidative phosphorylation, and the absence of alternative electron flow pathways bypassing this site (12Zvyagilskaya R.A. Kotelnikova A.V. Functional Activity of Yeast Mitochondria Series in Biological Chemistry. 36. VINITI Publishers, Moscow1991Google Scholar). These two features contribute to establishing a high matrix NADH/NAD+ratio. The sensitivity of the yeast mitochondrial Ca2+transporter to modulation by physiological effectors makes it a promising model in searching for other potential physiological modulators of Ca2+ transport. We are indebted to Kaija Niva for excellent technical assistance."

First, the phosphorylation of eIF4E correlates positively with the rate of translation in a large number of systems (1Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increases the protein's affinity for cap analogues by 3- to 4-fold (14Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Second, eIF4E availability is regulated by eIF4E-binding proteins, the phosphorylation of which, in response to insulin and other mitogens, releases them from eIF4E and permits eIF4E binding to eIF4G (13Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenborg N. Translation Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Third, eIF4E levels are regulated at the transcriptional level. eIF4E mRNA is increased by overexpression of c-Myc as well as transformation of cells by v-Src and v-Abl (15Rosenwald I.B. Rhoads D.B. Callanan L.D. Isselbacher K.J. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6175-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). eIF4E mRNA levels are also elevated in a variety of cells that have been oncogenically transformed by in vivo transfection, viral infection, or chemical mutagenesis (16Miyagi Y. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Okazaki T. Kuchino Y. Kerr J. Cancer Lett. 1995; 91: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Changes in the intracellular levels of eIF4E have a profound effect on cellular growth control. Ectopic overexpression of eIF4E leads to accelerated cell growth (17De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), transformation in culture and tumorigenesis in nude mice (18Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N.

Hellmann G.M. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a 1.4-kb fragment from the 5′-end of the eIF4E gene (36Jones R.M. Branda J. Johnston K.A. Polymenis M. Gadd M. Rustgi A. Callanan L. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To shed more light on the expression of eIF4E, especially at the transcriptional level, we have determined the entire gene structure for human eIF4E. Surprisingly two genes were found, one containing introns and the other not. Furthermore, both genes appear to be expressed in human cells, at least at the transcriptional level. Two human placental genomic libraries in bacteriophage λ vectors (EMBL3-SP6/T7 and λFIX II) were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively. Three human chromosome 4-specific genomic libraries in Charon 21 (LLO4NSO2 and LAO4NSO1) and Charon 40 (LAO4NLO1) and one chromosome 20-specific genomic library in Charon 21 (LL20NSO1) were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). Bacterial strains NM538 and LE392 were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction endonucleases and the DNA Cycle Sequencing System were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Radioisotopes (>5000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The Geneclean kit was purchased from BIO 101, Inc. (Vista, CA). Wish cells, derived from amnion tissue, Chang cells from conjunctiva, K562 cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia, and HeLa cells from epithelioid carcinoma of the cervix were purchased from the ATCC. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and harvested after 2–3 days. Recombinant phage were propagated in the host bacterial strains NM538 and LE392 using standard protocols (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plaques were screened by colony hybridization and/or PCR using primers that spanned intron/exon junctions. For screening by colony hybridization, a plasmid (pTCEEC) containing human eIF4E cDNA (38Hiremath L.S. Hiremath S.T. Rychlik W. Joshi S. Domier L.L. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1132-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PCR fragments derived from it were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation. Prehybridization was performed in 50% formamide at 42 °C for 2 h, radiolabeled probes were added, and hybridization was carried out for ≥16 h. Membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 30 min each and once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, where 1 × SSC is 0.15 m sodium chloride and 15 mm sodium citrate. The filters were exposed to Kodak x-ray film or analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For screening by PCR, the library phage lysates were divided into 50 pools (106 plaque-forming units/each), and 1 μl of phage lysate from each pool was used as a PCR template. The positive pools were plated and allowed to grow 8 h, and the agar was again subdivided into 50 pools and screened by PCR. This process was performed a total of three to four times until a single positive plaque was obtained. DNA from selected recombinant phage was prepared from bacterial lysates (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA inserts were mapped with restriction enzymes, and those containing exons were identified by Southern blotting. Exon-containing restriction fragments were excised from agarose gels, subcloned into pBluescript II (−) (Stratagene), and sequenced to identify exon/intron junctions. Screening of the EMBL3-SP6/T7 library using radiolabeled human eIF4E cDNA yielded positive plaques corresponding to an intronless form of the eIF4E gene, here named EIF4E2. Screening of the same library with a hybridization probe synthesized with primers 9 and 10 (Table I) yielded the recombinant phage λ4E1-A. Two human chromosome-specific genomic libraries in Charon 21 were screened using radiolabeled human eIF4E cDNA, one from chromosome 4 and one from chromosome 20. No positive plaques were obtained from the chromosome 20-specific library, but a number of positive plaques were obtained from the chromosome 4-specific genomic library and were termed λ4E1-B, λ4E1-C, and λ4E1-D. A second chromosome 4-specific Charon 21 library was screened with cDNA probes and yielded λ4E1-E. The LAO4NLO1 library was screened by PCR as described above using primers 3 and 7 and yielded λ4E1-F. The same strategy was applied to this library but with primers 11 and 12, leading to the isolation of λ4E1-G, and to the λFIX II library with primers 1 and 8 leading to λ4E1-H.Table IOligodeoxynucleotide primers used for PCR, RT-PCR, primer extension, ribonuclease protection, and S1 nuclease mappingPrimerPolarityNucleotide locations1-aThe numbering system for EIF4E1 and EIF4E2 genes is given under “Experimental Procedures.”Sequence (5′ → 3′)Source1Sense−1000 to −981GCATTTTCAAAGCCGGTTACRef. 36Jones R.M.

Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with 32P by nick translation. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as described above for colony hybridization. DNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II vectors, and sequences were determined by dideoxy chain termination (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) using SK and KS primers (Stratagene) as well as exon-specific oligonucleotide primers. For both EIF4E1 and EIF4E2, the numbering system is based on human eIF4E cDNA (35Rychlik W. Domier L.L. Gardner P.R. Hellmann G.M. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), i.e. the location of the first ATG in the coding region is designated +1, with upstream nucleotides having negative numbers and downstream nucleotides positive numbers. Nucleotides in introns are not numbered. Total RNA was prepared from either human placental tissue or human cell lines by the guanidine thiocyanate method (40Chomcynski P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 4.2.4-4.2.8Google Scholar). In the latter case, ∼107 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before homogenization. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to eIF4E mRNA were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primer (300,000 cpm) and total RNA (∼100 μg) were heated at 90 °C for 5 min in 30 μl of Hybridization Buffer (80% formamide, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and then incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. Hybrids were precipitated in ethanol and dissolved in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 800 units/ml RNasin. Extension was produced by 400 units/ml Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 42 °C. After ethanol precipitation, products were separated on sequencing gels. A single-stranded antisense DNA probe corresponding to the sequence between −1000 and +25 ofEIF4E1 was produced by asymmetric PCR (41Innis M.A. Myambo K.B. Gelfand D.H. Brown M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) from the recombinant phage λ4E1-H using primers 1 and 4 (Table I). The DNA was electrophoretically separated on 1.2% agarose gels, purified using a Geneclean kit, and then end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (∼100 μg) was hybridized with the probe (50,000–100,000 cpm) at 30 °C for 16 h in 30 μl of Hybridization Buffer and then digested with 150–200 units of S1 nuclease (Sigma) for 1 h at 30 °C. Protected DNA fragments were separated on 8% sequencing gels (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequence between −312 and +184 of EIF4E2 was amplified from phage λ4E2 by PCR using primers 2 and 3 (Table I). PCR was performed using the following program: after an initial heating step (95 °C, 10 min), 2 units ofTaq DNA polymerase were added to the 100-μl reaction, after which 35 cycles of PCR were carried out (95 °C, 30 s; 57 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min). The amplified PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by treatment with Geneclean and then subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). RNA was transcribed in vitro from pGEM-T linearized byEcoRI and radiolabeled with [32P]UTP with a riboprobe transcription system (Promega). A control RNA was transcribedin vitro from HindIII-linearized pTCEEC. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed as described previously (40Chomcynski P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 4.2.4-4.2.8Google Scholar). Total RNA from human placental tissue (100 μg) was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min. After inactivation of the DNase by heating at 70 °C for 15 min, the RNA was hybridized with primer 3 (Table I) in Hybridization Buffer at 30 °C overnight. Primer extension was performed as described above. RNA was removed by DNase-free RNase (Promega), and the remaining DNA from 1 μl of the primer extension reaction mixture was amplified by PCR as described above, except that the annealing temperature was 65 °C. Screening of human genomic libraries yielded two genes capable of encoding eIF4E, one of which (EIF4E1) contained introns and one of which (EIF4E2) did not (Fig. 1). Although a previous study reported eIF4E-like genes on chromosome 4 and 20 (42Pelletier J. Brook J.D. Housman D.E. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the fact that most of the fragments in Fig. 1 A were cloned from chromosome 4-specific libraries strongly argues that the EIF4E1 gene is on chromosome 4. The entire length of cloned DNA comprising theEIF4E1 gene was 50 kb. The EIF4E2 gene was flanked by three Alu sequences and two 14-bp direct repeats and contained a 3′-terminal poly(A) stretch (Fig. 2). All of these features are characteristic of retrotransposons (43Bhandari B. Roesler W.J. DeLisio K.D. Klemm D.J. Ross N.S. Miller R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional screening yielded DNA fragments representing intronless genes with more substantial differences from the cDNA and containing additional in-frame stop codons.Figure 2Alignment of the nucleotide sequences ofEIF4E1 and EIF4E2.

Results of mass spectrometry and x-ray diffraction suggested that amino acids 1–35 are disordered in the absence of other proteins. These are encoded by exons 1 and 2 (Table II) which may have been added after the evolution of a core cap-binding protein for the purpose of binding other proteins (see Introduction). Exon 3 encodes most of β strand 1 (S1), the 1–2 loop, β strand 2 (S2), and most of α helix 1 (H1). These structurally contiguous elements make up a region of the polypeptide chain that constitutes one side of the protein and include one of the two conserved Trp residues that “sandwich” the 7-methylguanine moiety, Trp-56.

TBP binds to the sequence TATAAAAG in the context of the yeast U6 gene (yU6 hybrid TATA) or the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) with different affinities demonstrating that the sequence context of a TATA element contributes to TBP binding. We also determined the cooperative free energies of formation of TBP·TFIIIB70·DNA complexes on the yU6 TATA element, the yU6 hybrid TATA element and a nonconsensus TATA element. The yU6 hybrid TATA displayed a moderate, less than 5-fold, increase in TBP affinity similar to the 3-fold increase observed for the AdMLP. In contrast, the nonconsensus and yU6 TATAs increased the affinity of TBP for DNA 12- and 17-fold, respectively. Since the TBP-TFIIIB70 cooperativity is greater on lower affinity TATA boxes and most polymerase III genes contain low affinity “TATA boxes,” we conclude that the cooperative binding of TFIIIB70 and TBP to DNA represents an important driving force in the assembly of polymerase III-specific transcription complexes. An effect of the sequences surrounding the TATA box was also observed on TBP-TFIIIB70 cooperativity. The mechanistic implications of the thermodynamic linkage between DNA sequence and binding cooperativity are discussed.

The TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter; is required for transcription by all three nuclear RNA polymerases (pols I, II, and III) (1Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). This universal role of TBP is achieved, in most organisms, through its sequestration into polymerase-specific complexes (e.g. SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB). Although sequence-specific binding of TBP to DNA is observed in two of these complexes (TFIID and TFIIIB), the efficient recruitment of each complex to the appropriate promoters in vivo is dependent upon additional interactions with other proteins termed “activating factors,” “coactivators,” and/or “initiators” (2Roberts S.

The recruitment of SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB to DNA has been studied extensively because of the fundamental importance of these steps in transcription by the respective polymerase and because of their regulatory significance. DNA binding by TBP or its complexes appears to be a rate-limiting step for transcription initiation at many promoters (7Klein C. Struhl K. Science. 1994; 266: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Garber M.E. Vilalta A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Rameau G. Puglia K. Crowe A. Sethy I. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Accordingly, many regulatory factors have been described that interact directly with TBP or its associated components (4Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem.

The interaction of TBP with the TATA element has been the subject of extensive genetic, biochemical and biophysical studies. These studies have shown that TBP binds to a wide variety of sequences and that it exhibits the highest affinities for sequences of the general form TATAa/tAa/t (10Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The crystal structures that have been solved ofArabidopsis thaliana TBP2 and the conserved C-terminal cores of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens TBP complexed with DNA containing different TATA boxes are strikingly similar and revealed a remarkable protein-DNA interaction and distortion of the DNA (11Chasman D.I.

TBP contacts the minor groove of DNA through a concave antiparallel β sheet that forms the underside of its “saddle-like” structure; extensive minor groove interactions are possible because the DNA is unwound, bent toward the major groove and kinked at the first and last base steps of the TATA box. Comparison of the structure of these complexes with the structures of the freeA. thaliana TBP2 and C-terminal core of S. cerevisiae TBP (11Chasman D.I. Flaherty K.M. Sharp P.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc.

Biol. 1994; 1: 638-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reveals no appreciable tertiary change but small, distinct quaternary rearrangements in the conserved C-terminal domains of the proteins upon DNA binding. The roles played by these macromolecular conformational changes in TATA element recognition and the subsequent assembly of RNA polymerase-specific transcription factors are key unanswered questions. Although the specificity of TBP for TATA element variants has been extensively investigated, there has not been to our knowledge a thermodynamic analysis of (i) TBP binding to the same TATA box in different sequence contexts or (ii) the effects of polymerase-specific factors on TBP binding to different TATA boxes. In this report we present a quantitative thermodynamic analysis of TBP binding to the TATA element of the pol III-transcribed yeast U6 gene. We compare the binding of TBP to U6 templates containing either the wild-type TATA box or the adenovirus major late TATA box, to the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) and a nonconsensus TATA element. Our results show an effect of both the TATA sequence and the sequence context on TBP's affinity for DNA. In addition, we have examined the binding of TBP to the same four templates in the presence of the TFIIB-related, pol III-specific transcription factor TFIIIB70. Effects of the TATA sequence and its context were also evident in the assembly of the TBP-TFIIIB70-DNA complex. This work together with other studies provides insights into the role of DNA structure in TBP binding and the assembly of polymerase-specific complexes. Recombinant S. cerevisiaeTBP and TFIIIB70 were prepared, quantitated, and stored as described previously (16Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A single preparation of TBP and TFIIIB70 was used for all experiments. Plasmid pM4 (yU6 TATA), contains the sequence from −119 to +73 relative to transcription start site of the yeast SNR6 gene and was constructed by cloning aClaI-EcoNI restriction fragment from p544-H6 (a gift from Dr. D. Brow) into BamHI-ClaI digested pSP72 following Klenow fill-in of the EcoN1 and BamHI ends. Plasmid pM5 (yU6 hybrid TATA) is identical to pM4 except for two nucleotide substitutions within the TATA element: The sequence 5′-TATAAATA-3′ was changed to 5′-TATAAAAG-3′ by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fragment labeling and purification was performed following published protocols (19Brenowitz M. Senear D. Jamison E. Dalma-Weiszhausz D. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 1-43Crossref Google Scholar). pM4 and pM5 DNA probes were single end-labeled following HindIII digestion and then cleaved with EcoRV. The probes are ∼200 base pairs in length and the TATA elements are located ∼150 base pairs from the labeled 3′ ends. The plasmid pML(C2AT) contains the AdMLP from −400 to +10 relative to the cap site (20Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). From this plasmid a 656-base pair probe labeled at one end of the template strand was obtained as described previously (17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nonconsensus TATA element is located 38 base pairs from the labeled 3′ end. DNase I footprint titration experiments were conducted as described previously (16Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 1-43Crossref Google Scholar). The concentration of 32P-labeled DNA in all experiments is significantly lower than theKd values of the protein-DNA interactions being analyzed. This allows the assumption that [protein]total≈ [protein]free in the analysis of the binding isotherms. Complex assembly was conducted at 30 °C for ∼45 min in 200-μl volumes of assay buffer (25 mm bis-Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml poly(dG·dC), 100 mm KCl, and 0.01% Brij-58 at pH 7.0). Samples were exposed to DNase I for 2 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 40 μl of 50 mm EDTA followed by precipitation solution (21Gaillard C. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 378Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and visualized using phosphor storage plates and a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to create digital images. Titration curves were obtained from these images following the protocols of Brenowitz et al. (19Brenowitz M. Senear D. Jamison E. Dalma-Weiszhausz D. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 1-43Crossref Google Scholar) using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) software (16Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the integrated densities of the bands corresponding to the TATA element were corrected for background, standardized for the total amount of DNA loaded in each lane, and matched with the corresponding TBP concentration. A plot of the change in the integrated densities versus [TBP] yields a transition curve describing the binding reaction. Nonlinear least squares analysis of the transition curves against the Langmuir binding polynomial (16Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the upper and lower limits yields the binding isotherm (defined as the change in fractional saturation, YTBP, as a function of TBP concentration) and the equilibrium association constant,Keq. The Gibbs free energy of binding ΔG° is related to the equilibrium association constant, Keq, by ΔG° = −RT ln Keq. In TBP titration experiments conducted in the presence of fixed concentrations of TFIIIB70, the total binding free energy (ΔG°total) includes contributions from both the intrinsic affinity of TBP for the TATA element and the cooperativity between the two proteins. This cooperativity is expressed as ΔΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70 = ΔG°total − ΔG°TBP for each TFIIIB70concentration analyzed. At high concentrations of TFIIIB70,YTBP becomes independent of [TFIIIB70]. Only at this limit is ΔΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70 ≅ ΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70, the microscopic cooperative free energy between the two proteins (17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,22Ackers G.K. Shea M.A. Smith F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 223-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TBP and TFIIIB70 display a moderate 3-fold cooperativity in their assembly onto the TATA element of the AdMLP (17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, the effect of the TATA sequence and its context on TBP-TFIIIB70 DNA binding cooperativity has been explored. Three substrates were employed in this analysis: (i) yU6 TATA, which contains the upstream promoter region of SNR6, a pol III-transcribed gene encoding U6 snRNA; (ii) yU6 hybrid TATA, which is identical to yU6 TATA except for two nucleotide substitutions (TATAAATA to TATAAAAG) which change the sequence of the TATA element to that found in the AdMLP; and (iii) a construct containing the nonconsensus TATA element, TATAGGTG. The binding of TBP to the yU6 TATA, the yU6 hybrid TATA and the nonconsensus TATA results in clear and specific protection under the experimental conditions used in these studies (Fig. 1, panels A and C and data not shown); nonspecific binding of TBP is not observed over the range of TBP concentrations investigated. Equilibrium titrations of these substrates with TBP are well described by the Langmuir binding polynomial, as was observed previously for the AdMLP and E4 TATA elements (16Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The TBP binding isotherms determined for each of these substrates are shown in Fig. 2 A. The values of ΔG°TBP determined from the global analysis of multiple independent TBP titrations of the three substrates are shown in Table I. The order of affinity of the TATA elements for TBP is TATAAAAG > TATAAATA > TATAGGTG. Interestingly, the context of the TATA element has a small but significant effect on TBP binding. The affinity of TBP for the yU6 hybrid TATA is 0.3 kcal/mol less negative than the previously reported TBP affinity for the AdMLP (Table I); this difference is statistically significant due to the high precision of the binding isotherms. Thus, the sequences surrounding the TATA box modulate TBP binding.Figure 2Equilibrium titration curves obtained for TBP binding.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the TBP-TFIIIB70 DNA binding cooperativity is linked to the sequence of the substrate DNA, TBP titrations were conducted in the presence of constant concentrations of TFIIIB70 on the yU6 TATA, the yU6 hybrid TATA and the nonconsensus TATA, as previously conducted with the AdMLP (17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As observed with the AdMLP, TFIIIB70 alone does not detectably bind to these DNA molecules (data not shown). However, unlike the AdMLP, the DNase I footprints observed on the yU6 and yU6 hybrid promoters show sites of DNase I protection both upstream and downstream of the TATA box (Fig. 1). Densitometric scans in the direction of electrophoresis across the yU6 TATA element are shown in Fig. 3 and define the footprint borders of the TBP-DNA and TFIIIB70-TBP-DNA complexes. As can be seen in Fig. 3 A, the TBP footprint on the yU6 TATA extends from −35 to −20 (15 base pairs), similar to the TBP footprint reported previously on this gene (23Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, slight protection around −50 was observed. Analysis of TFIIIB70-TBP-yU6 TATA complexes (Fig. 3 B) revealed protection from −35 to −20 and from −13 to +4 with a greater degree of protection around -50. A comparable region of DNase I protection at −50 within the complete TFIIIB-yU6 TATA complex was reported by Joazeiro et al. (23Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TFIIIB70-specific interactions upstream and downstream of the yU6 TATA box are consistent with these findings. The region between −20 and −13 is poorly cut by DNase I, therefore protein protection could not be evaluated for these base pairs. Since TFIIIB70 binding in the absence of TBP was not observed under the conditions employed, the cooperativity between TBP and TFIIIB70 was analyzed by determining the effect of increasing concentrations of TFIIIB70 upon the TBP binding isotherm. In the presence of TFIIIB70, protection of the TATA element commenced at lower TBP concentrations compared with the TBP titration alone for each DNA tested (Fig. 1; data not shown). This effect is clearly reflected in the binding isotherms; TFIIIB70 shifts the TBP binding isotherms to lower concentrations for each DNA substrate assayed (Fig. 2 B, data not shown). The increase in the observed affinity of TBP for these TATA sequences reveals the positive cooperative interaction between the two proteins. The intrinsic cooperativity for the simultaneous binding of the two proteins to each of the DNA substrates, ΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70, is determined at the plateau where ΔΔG° becomes independent of [TFIIIB70]; at this point, all of the binding cooperativity between the two proteins is partitioned into the TBP isotherms (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the yU6 TATA, the yU6 hybrid TATA and nonconsensus TATA probes, the results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4 as the energy difference (ΔΔG°) referenced to the “TBP alone” titrations. The values of ΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70 determined for each of the substrates are summarized in Table I. A clear result is that ΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70 is 1.0 kcal/mol more negative for the yU6 promoter compared with the AdMLP. The TBP-TFIIIB70 DNA binding cooperativity for the nonconsensus TATA is only slightly less than that of yU6. Thus, at 30 °C, the temperature of these assays, the TBP-TFIIIB70 cooperativity increases the affinity of TBP binding to the nonconsensus and yU6 TATAs 12-fold and 17-fold, respectively. Remarkably, much more moderate TBP-TFIIIB70 DNA binding cooperativity is observed on the yU6 hybrid TATA, which contains the AdMLP TATA element in the yU6 context (Table I). Interestingly, while the yU6 hybrid and the AdML promoters contain the same TATA sequence, the ΔG°TBP/TFIIIB70 for the yU6 hybrid promoter remains more negative than that of the AdMLP. Thus, the data demonstrate that both the sequence of the TATA element and its context contribute to the magnitude of the TBP-TFIIIB70cooperativity. The DNA sequence of the TATA element is a major determinant of the affinity of TBP for a DNA substrate (10Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 250: 434-446Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The relative TBP affinities from the present analysis are AdMLP (TATAAAAG) > yU6 hybrid TATA (TATAAAAG) > yU6 TATA (TATAAATA) > nonconsensus TATA (TATAGGTG) (Table I). This order of TATA element affinities is consistent with a broader analysis of TATA elements being conducted under identical experimental conditions 2A. K. M. Mollah, B. Gilden, V. Petri, E. Jamison, G. Patikoglou, S. K. Burley, and M. Brenowitz, unpublished data. ; these data indicate that there is a 1.0–1.5 kcal/mol “penalty” associated with a variety of deviations from the consensus sequence when at least one consensus “half-site” is maintained. Thus, the global conformation of the TBP-nonconsensus DNA complex is likely to be comparable to the other complexes studied. The AdMLP and yU6 hybrid TATA contain the same TATA element in a different sequence context. The thermodynamics of TBP binding to these substrates provides direct evidence for a small but statistically significant context effect on TATA element binding by TBP (Table I). Our direct measurements of TBP binding are consistent with the results of an in vitro selection study that found clear preferences for the flanking base pairs among 35 TATATAAG sequences selected for high affinity TBP binding (10Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The preferred bases at positions −4, −3, −2, −1, and +9 were A/G, G, A/G, G/C and G/C, respectively. The natural context of the AdMLP is a perfect match at these positions. Correspondingly, a bias against specific bases was observed at the above positions as well as at position +10. Three of these unfavored bases (T at −3, A at +9, and T at +10) are found in the normal context of the U6 TATA box. Thus, the difference in the affinity of TBP for the AdMLP and the yU6 hybrid TATA is in agreement with the previously proposed optimal TATA-flanking sequences. TATA element binding by TBP is characterized by slow association and dissociation kinetics. The association of S. cerevisiae TBP for TATA elements proceeds at rates significantly slower than diffusion-limited following simple second-order kinetics over several orders of magnitude of TBP concentration (16Petri V.

Stopped-flow fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies have demonstrated that the binding of TBP and the bending of the DNA occurs simultaneously at 30 °C, with no evidence of a diffusion-limited intermediate in the reaction pathway (18Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The available data support a kinetic mechanism in which TBP binding is limited by the probability that TBP-DNA “encounter complexes” overcome a high activation energy barrier and proceed down the reaction pathway (18Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 4TBP oligomerization plays no role in DNA binding under the experimental conditions of these studies (37Daugherty M.A. Brenowitz M. Fried M.G. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (Abstr. 2049): A1207Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that TBP samples the population of DNA conformations in solution and productively binds to only a small fraction of these (18Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since no contacts outside the 8 base pair TATA element have been observed in either structural or biochemical studies of TBP-DNA interactions, the effect of sequence context on TBP binding could possibly be indirect. For the few cases where it has been investigated, base pair substitutions within a TATA box reduce TBP binding affinity through an increase in the complex dissociation rate (25Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 250: 434-446Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar).3In contrast, the difference in TBP binding affinity between the AdMLP and yU6 hybrid promoters (Table I) is manifest in the rate of association of TBP with the DNA. 5A. K. M. Mollah, M. Librizzi, I. Willis, and M. Brenowitz, unpublished data. Thus, the observed context effect may be due to differences in the conformational distributions of the promoters, biasing the distribution either toward or away from conformations capable of forming a productive encounter complex with TBP. Increased DNA flexibility would broaden the conformational distribution and hence might decrease the rate of association. Alternatively, structurally constrained regions of DNA (such as the runs of poly(A) that flank the yU6 TATA element) might bias the conformational distribution unfavorably (10Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Numerous TATA elements have been shown to direct the assembly of pol II- and pol III-specific complexes under a variety of experimental conditions (for example see Refs. 24Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Wang Y. Jensen R.C. Stumph W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3100-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, and 29Huang W. Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanisms by which transcription preinitiation complexes form, the interaction of TBP and TFIIIB70 on different TATA elements and on the same TATA element in different contexts was quantitatively characterized. The binding of TFIIIB70 to DNA in the absence of TBP was not detectable in the DNase I footprinting assay, therefore the cooperativity between TBP and TFIIIB70 was quantitated by monitoring the effect of TFIIIB70 concentration on the TBP-promoter binding isotherms. Interestingly, the two lower affinity TATA elements (yU6 and nonconsensus, Table I) displayed substantially higher cooperativity than the higher affinity TATA elements (AdMLP and yU6 hybrid). This observation suggests that the TBP-TFIIIB70 cooperativity plays a more important role in the assembly of pol III transcription complexes than was apparent from our previous study using the AdMLP (17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With a few notable exceptions (e.g. metazoan type III genes and the yeast U6 gene (1Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar)), pol III genes are generally thought to be TATA-less. However, a recent analysis of the sequences upstream of tRNA genes in several organisms indicates that, in the majority of cases, TATA-like sequences are found 30–35 base pairs 5′ to the putative transcription start site (30Choisne N. Carneiro V.T.C. Pelletier G. Small I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, while the mechanism of the TATA element-mediated enhancement of TBP-TFIIIB70cooperativity is not yet clear, our findings show that an important role for TFIIIB70 involves its ability to drive preinitiation complex assembly by increasing significantly the affinity of the TBP-TFIIIB70 complex for DNA. Similar cooperativity has been observed for the formation of the TBP-TFIIB-DNA complex (31Imbalzano A.N. Zaret K.S. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8280-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Petri V. Brenowitz M. FASEB J. 1996; 10 (Abstr. 117): A1123Google Scholar). In addition to the dependence of the TBP-TFIIIB70cooperativity upon the sequence of the TATA element, the cooperativity is also dependent on the sequence context surrounding the TATA box. We reproducibly observed that the magnitude of the cooperativity on the U6 hybrid TATA was higher than on the AdMLP (Table I). Whereas the sequences flanking the TATA element in the AdMLP are optimal for TBP binding, the TATA sequence context in the yeast U6 gene is more favorable for TBP-TFIIIB70 cooperativity. Thus, a TATA element context optimal for TBP binding may be suboptimal for the cooperative interactions between TBP and other transcription factors. Several mechanistic interpretations are consistent with the observed TATA element and flanking sequence effects on TBP-TFIIIB70cooperativity. TFIIIB70 may make a specific contact(s) with a base(s) within the TATA element. Comparison of the AdMLP, yU6, and nonconsensus sequences shows that all three possess a TATA consensus half-site. The only other base that the yU6 and nonconsensus sequences have in common is a thymine in the 7th position substituting for adenine in the AdMLP (Table I). Substitution of just this base in the AdMLP sequence results in a 1.2 kcal/mol loss in TBP binding affinity, 6A. K. M. Mollah, B. Gilden, E. Jamison, G. Patikoglou, S. K. Burley, and M. Brenowitz, unpublished data. indicating that subtle structural changes within a TATA element can have large energetic effects. This nucleotide substitution is isosteric with regard to the presentation of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the minor groove to which TBP binds. However, an alternate hydrogen bond donor and acceptor pattern is presented in the major groove of the TATA element. At saturating concentrations of TBP and TFIIIB70we have observed additional DNase I protection of bases within the AdMLP TATA element in comparison to the protection provided by TBP alone (17Librizzi M. Moir R.D. Brenowitz M. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32695-32701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggested that TFIIIB70 is positioned on the underside of the TBP-induced DNA bend. Therefore it is possible that TFIIIB70 may interact with the T7 base pair in the major groove. For this hypothetical interaction to affect TBP-TFIIIB70 cooperativity and not merely the intrinsic binding of TFIIIB70, the interaction must indirectly affect TBP binding. Since the second DNA kink in TBP-DNA complexes is between positions 7 and 8, TFIIIB70 may stabilize the kinked conformation and thus facilitate TBP binding. An alternative mechanism is that TFIIIB70 interactions with TBP differentially affect the ability of TBP to form the specific ensemble of interactions present in TATA elements with T-Aversus A-G base steps at the 3′ kink. This possibility is appealing since genetic studies have implicated the amino-terminal H2 helix of TBP, which sits directly above the critical phenylalanine residues of TBP as a binding site for TFIIIB70 (33Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Science. 1993; 262: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The fact that the relative orientation of the two subdomains of TBP changes upon TATA element binding (free versus co-crystal structures) suggests that TBP conformational changes may play a role in the cooperative binding of TBP with other transcription factors. Sequence-specific interactions between TFIIIB70 and the flanking DNA could also play a role. Examination of the eukaryotic TFIIB-TBP-DNA co-crystal structure and the homologous archael TFB-TBP-DNA co-crystal structure in light of the extensive sequence homology between TFIIIB70, TFIIB, and TFB predicts interactions between TFIIIB70 and sequences adjacent to the TATA box (34Nikolov D.B.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6042-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In support of this possibility, a recent study has uncovered a sequence-specific interaction between human TFIIB and a guanosine at position −3 relative to the TATA box. 7T. Lagrange, A. Kapanidis, H. Tang, D. Reinberg, and R. Ebright, personal communication. In addition, a cryptic nonspecific DNA binding domain has been uncovered recently in the carboxyl-terminal 86 residues of TFIIIB70 (36Huet J. Conesa C. Carles C. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18341-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); this domain of TFIIIB70 is likely to contribute to complex stability. Protection of bases outside of the TATA box in the TBP-TFIIIB70 complex on the yU6 promoter represents further evidence that TFIIIB70-DNA interactions play a role in stabilizing the ternary complex (Fig. 3). Studies to examine each of these possible mechanisms are in progress. We thank Elizabeth Jamison for providing recombinant TBP."

We have previously shown that MARCKS purified from bovine brain is phosphorylated not only by protein kinase C but also by so-called proline-directed protein kinases in the well conserved N-terminal half of the molecule (Taniguchi, H., Manenti, S., Suzuki, M., and Titani, K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 18299–18302). Although the presence of other phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal peptide was also noticed, the ambiguity in the C-terminal domain of the bovine protein hampered a more detailed analysis. In the present study, we analyzed MARCKS purified from rat brain by electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometry. The results obtained revealed two additional novel phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region. Both phosphorylation sites (Ser291and Ser299) are immediately followed by proline, suggesting that these sites are also phosphorylated by the proline-directed protein kinase(s). Since Ser299 is within the C-terminal domain, which is well conserved among various species, the function of the domain, whatever it is, seems to be controlled by phosphorylation.

MARCKS, a major in vivo substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. has been characterized in various tissues and cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand 2Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Although its physiological function has yet to be elucidated, MARCKS has been implicated in playing an important role in brain function. It is enriched in the nerve terminals, and its expression is developmentally regulated. Furthermore, a recent gene knockout study showed that its deficiency in mice leads to abnormal brain development and perinatal death (3Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One of the most striking characteristics of the protein is its translocation from the membrane to cytosolic fractions upon extracellular stimuli. A highly conserved basic amphiphilic phosphorylation domain in the middle of the molecule, which contains all the four PKC phosphorylation sites, serves at the same time as the phospholipid-binding site (4Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since calmodulin shares the same binding site, and since the PKC-dependent phosphorylation abolishes the binding of both calmodulin and acidic phospholipids, MARCKS may play a key role as one of the cross-talk points in the signal transduction pathways (4Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kim J. Shishido T. Jiang X. Aderem A. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28214-28219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the same domain to sequester phosphatidylinositol-derived signaling molecules led to a suggestion that the MARCKS protein may control the activity of phospholipase C (6Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26187-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recent development in mass spectrometry made it possible to determine the molecular mass of large proteins with high precision and resolution (7Biemann K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 977-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 8Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The technique is now widely used to analyze various aspects of proteins including primary and tertiary structures (9Yates J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 271: 351-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have already shown that the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in which capillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography is connected on-line to the electrospray interface of a quadrupole mass spectrometer, is a powerful technique in elucidating post-translational modifications of proteins such as phosphorylation and acylation (10Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matsubara M. Kusubata M. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21108-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In fact, many hitherto unnoticed in vivophosphorylation sites were revealed in various proteins. Our mass spectrometric analysis on the in vivophosphorylation sites of MARCKS showed that it is phosphorylated also at sites other than those by PKC (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the phosphorylation sites found are followed by proline, suggesting that MARCKS is a physiological substrate of proline-directed protein kinase such as microtubule-associated protein kinase and Cdk5. These phosphorylation sites are distributed only in the N-terminal half of the molecule, where the homology among various species is high, suggesting that the functions of the domains in the N-terminal regions are regulated by protein phosphorylation. It should be stressed that PKC is not the only kinase which phosphorylates MARCKS, although MARCKS has been regarded as a specific marker of PKC activation (1Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, we found that bovine MARCKS contained additional phosphorylation sites in its large C-terminal peptide. However, the ambiguity of the sequence and the lack of residues suitable for proteolytic digestion in the bovine protein hampered a more detailed analysis. In the present study, we used MARCKS protein purified from rat brains, and studied the in vivo protein phosphorylation sites. The capability of an electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer to perform on-line LC/MS and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analyses was utilized to determine these sites. The two additional in vivo phosphorylation sites thus identified, Ser291 and Ser299, are followed by proline, suggesting that they are also phosphorylated by proline-directed protein kinase(s). Since the C termini of MARCKS surrounding these sites are well conserved among various species, the function of the C-terminal domain, too, seems to be regulated by protein phosphorylation. MARCKS was purified from membrane fractions of bovine brain as described previously (13Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22310-22315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same procedure was applied to purify MARCKS from membrane fractions of rat brain, except that all buffers contained 0.5 mm NaF and 125 mm β-glycerophosphate as phosphatase inhibitors. Microcystin-LR (Calbiochem, 1 μm) was also included in the homogenization buffer. All other chemicals and biochemicals used were of analytical grade. Purified protein (30 μg) was digested with 3 μg of Achromobacter lysyl endoprotease in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.9) in the presence of 2 m urea at 37 °C for 15 h (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After stopping the reaction by adding 1% trifluoroacetic acid, the peptide mixtures were directly injected into the LC/MS apparatus. The lysyl endoprotease peptides were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac 218TP52 column, 2.1 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of H2O-acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing the C-terminal peptide were combined and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. The peptide was dissolved with 25 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated with 0.2 μg of endoprotease Asp-N (Takara, Kusatsu, Japan) at 37 °C for 18 h. The resulting peptide mixture was directly analyzed by LC/MS and LC/MS/MS. The Asp-N endoprotease peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as above. The C-terminal peptide obtained was dissolved in 25 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and incubated with 1 μg of Glu-C endoprotease (Staphylococcus V8 protease, Boehringer Mannheim) at 25 °C for 14 h. After stopping the reaction by adding 0.1% final concentration of trifluoroacetic acid, the resulting peptide mixture was directly analyzed by LC/MS and LC/MS/MS. The inter-chain disulfide bond formed by oxidation during the treatments was cleaved by incubating with excess amounts of dithiothreitol before the mass analysis. LC/MS analysis was carried out with an electrospray ionization/quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex API-III) as described previously (10Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LC/MS and LC/MS/MS analyses were done with an electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan-MAT LCQ). A linear gradient of solvents at a flow rate of 200 μl/min produced with a conventional high performance liquid chromatography apparatus (ThermoQuest P3000) was split with a tee. A Monitor C18 column (1 × 150 mm, packed with 5-μm, 100-Å pore material) was connected to one outlet as a separation column. Another monitor C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm) was connected to the other outlet as a balancing column to make 1:4 split ratio. The elution was done with a linear gradient of H2O-acetonitrile in the presence of 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% acetic acid. The ion source voltage was set at 4.5 kV, and N2 gas was used as a nebulizer gas. The temperature of the heated capillary was set at 200 °C. The LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a data-dependent mode, in which the largest peak in each single scan obtained in the LC/MS mode was automatically subjected to the collision-induced dissociation. The isolation width of the precursor ions was set either at 2 (for the first run) or at 10 atomic mass units (for the phosphopeptide analysis during the second run), while the relative collision energy was 35%. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Blue binding (Bio-Rad). The gas phase Edman degradation was carried out with a 470A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Our previous LC/MS analysis, which covered more than 95% of the whole sequence, indicated some differences between the published cDNA and protein sequences (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two lysyl endoprotease peptides which showed masses different from the theoretical ones based on the cDNA sequence, one peptide corresponding to residues 241–258 (K24–25) was completely sequenced, and the corrected sequence gave a theoretical mass which is within experimental error of the observed mass (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal peptide, was partially sequenced, and we could identify a few amino acid differences. When these corrections are taken into account, the theoretical mass of the peptide would be 5,917.4 Da, which is slightly but significantly larger than the observed mass, 5,910.2 ± 1.5 Da (Fig. 1). The peptide was found accompanied with a peptide of 5990.2 ± 1.3 Da, which can be a singly phosphorylated peptide. To elucidate the cause of the mass difference, we first repeated the sequencing of the peptide isolated from the Lys-C endoprotease digest as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The gas phase sequencing gave a sequence, Ala-Glu-Glu-Ala-Gly-Val-Ser-Ala-Ala-Gly-Xaa-Glu-Ala-Pro-Ser-Ala-Ala-Gly-Pro-Gly-Val-Pro-Pro-Glu-Gln-Glu-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala, where Xaa was an unidentified amino acid. In addition to the missing Ala-Ala-Gly sequence in the protein sequence as noticed in our previous study (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the peptide sequence started to differ completely from the deduced sequence from the 20th cycle (Fig. 2). A part of the new sequence was found in the corresponding part of the rat, mouse, and chick sequences, suggesting that the published bovine sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence contains more errors in the C-terminal region. A sequencing study on the polymerase chain reaction products containing a part of the C-terminal region has been conducted with various species (14Herget T. Brooks S.F. Broad S. Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sequence obtained with bovine MARCKS in the study shows a complete agreement with our present peptide sequence. The incorporation of these corrections to the bovine sequence made a better homology among MARCKS proteins from various species (see Fig. 7). However, the C-terminal peptide based on the sequence would have a theoretical mass of 6024.4 Da, which is much larger than the observed value, 5910.2 Da. Since the removal of the C-terminal Glu would not account for the difference, the composite sequence shown in Fig. 2 should still differ from the protein sequence.Figure 2Comparison of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of bovine MARCKS reported in various studies. The amino acid sequence deduced from the published cDNA sequence (20Stumpo D.J. Graff J.M. Albert K.A. Greengard P. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Note that the phosphorylation site identified in the present study together with the surrounding amino acids is well conserved among various species (boxed).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because of the ambiguity of the C-terminal sequence and the lack of suitable amino acid residues for further proteolytic digestion in the bovine protein, we sought MARCKS protein from other species that would not pose these problems. Rat MARCKS was chosen because of the presence of a few well positioned Asp residues in the C-terminal peptide. MARCKS was purified from rat brain in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, and digested with lysyl endoprotease. The peptide mixtures obtained were analyzed directly by reverse-phase capillary liquid chromatography coupled on-line to an electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer. As has been described in a previous analysis on the bovine protein (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the peptides were identified by comparing the molecular masses observed with those predicted from the cDNA sequence. Furthermore, automatic switching to the LC/MS/MS mode was used to generate fragment ions produced by the collisionally activated dissociation. The partial sequences thus obtained were used to confirm the assignment. More than 90% of the whole sequence was confirmed. No significant difference between the theoretical and observed masses was found, suggesting that the published amino acid sequence deduced from the rat cDNA sequence is correct. In addition to the three major in vivophosphorylation sites by proline-directed protein kinase found in the bovine protein, i.e. peptides K3, K5, and K9 (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the C-terminal peptide K24 (residues 253–309) was also found phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Both singly and doubly phosphorylated peptides, which are larger than the parent peptide by 80 and 160 Da, respectively, were present. These results indicate that the in vivo phosphorylation sites by proline-directed protein kinase(s) are not species specific restricted to bovine MARCKS. Fractions containing the C-terminal K24 peptide from the reverse-phase column chromatography were combined and subjected to further digestion with Asp-N endoprotease to produce smaller peptides suitable for tandem mass analysis. The digest mixture was directly analyzed by LC/MS (Fig. 4 A,inset). Only peptide N4 (residues 280–309) containing the C terminus was found phosphorylated (Fig. 4 A). The presence of doubly phosphorylated species indicated that the peptide contained two phosphorylation sites. The two other peptides, N1 (residues 253–262) and N2–3 (residues 263–279), were not phosphorylated to a significant extent (data not shown). To identify the phosphorylation sites in the N4 peptide, the peptide was isolated by reverse-phase chromatography and subjected to further digestion with Glu-C endoprotease. The digestion yielded two peptides, DEPAASAAPSASPEPQPE (E1) and CSPEAPPAPVAE (E2–3), both of which were found singly phosphorylated, suggesting that each peptide contained one phosphorylation site (Fig. 4, B and C). The tandem mass spectra of the two peptides were obtained by LC/MS/MS analysis (Fig. 5). Although the N-terminal peptide, E1, contained three phosphorylatable residues (serines), the difference between y6 and y7 ions that corresponded to a phosphoserine clearly identified the third Ser in the peptide (Ser291) as the phosphorylation site (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the difference between y8 and y9 and that between y12and y13 corresponded to values expected for a normal Ser. The lack of phosphorylation at the other two Ser residues was also confirmed by b8,b9, and b11 ions. From these results we concluded that Ser291 is the sole phosphorylation site in the peptide. The C-terminal peptide, E2–3, contained only one phosphorylatable residue, Ser299. The tandem mass spectrum of the peptide confirmed the lack of phosphorylation between the Ser residue and the C terminus (Fig. 5 B). These results established that the two Ser residues within the Ser-Pro motif (Ser291 and Ser299) are the in vivo phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal domain. Although MARCKS is believed to be myristoylated at its N terminus, the modification has never been demonstrated directly. As has been reported previously (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the LC/MS analysis showed the presence of a peptide with a mass corresponding to the myristoylated N-terminal peptide K1. An MS/MS spectrum of the N-terminal peptide was obtained in the LC/MS/MS mode (Fig. 6). The data not only confirmed the N-terminal sequence of the protein, but also indicated clearly the Nα-amino group of the N-terminal glycine is modified by a group corresponding to a myristoyl group. In a previous study we reported that MARCKS is a physiological substrate of proline-directed protein kinases (11Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites were all contained in the half of the molecule N-terminal to the PKC-phosphorylation domain, where most of the sequence is well conserved. Here we added two novel sites to the list of the MARCKS phosphorylation sites. Considering the small size of the protein, the presence of altogether more than 10 in vivophosphorylation sites is rather surprising, and MARCKS can be considered to be hyperphosphorylated. MARCKS has interesting characteristics in its sequence. The whole protein lacks large hydrophobic amino acids and is very acidic except for the N-terminal myristoylation site and the highly basic amphiphilic domain which serves as the calmodulin-, PKC-, and acidic phospholipid-binding domain (15Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McIlroy B.K. Walters J.D. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. J. Biol.

As a whole, the N-terminal half including the PKC phosphorylation domain is well conserved among MARCKS from various species, while the C-terminal one is less conserved. The latter is rich in a few amino acids such as Ala, Pro, and Glu. Although the presence of many repeats consisting of these characteristic residues is noted, the presence of exact motifs at the exact positions seems to be not necessary for the function of the part of the molecule. This has been noticed previously with GAP-43, another PKC substrate protein and a relative of MARCKS (18LaBate M.E. Skene J.H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 299-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In both proteins, amino acid compositions are well conserved, but extensive sequence conservation is lacking. However, the C-terminal end consisting of about 15 amino acids is well conserved among MARCKS proteins from various species (Fig. 7). Thirteen amino acids are identical in human, bovine, mouse, and rat, and 8 amino acids are conserved also in chicken, suggesting that this region might constitute another functionally independent domain. It should be noted that one of the phosphorylated Ser found in the C-terminal domain is well conserved together with the surrounding residues, suggesting that the physiological function of the domain, whatever it is, is controlled by the protein phosphorylation at the site. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain is not conserved in F52, a short homologue of MARCKS that shares all the N-terminal conserved regions with MARCKS (19Blackshear P.J. Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13540-13546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the two proteins are both expressed in brain, they seem not to be able to compliment functions to each other; MARCKS knockout is lethal, suggesting that F52 cannot rescue the deficiency of MARCKS (3Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Since both MAP kinase and Cdk5, which are highly expressed in brain, failed to phosphorylate MARCKS at the C-terminal domain, 2E. Yamauchi and H. Taniguchi, manuscript in preparation. there should be an unknown MARCKS C-terminal kinase other than these known protein kinases. A search for the specific kinase, in turn, may elucidate the physiological function of the C-terminal domain of MARCKS itself. Finally, the present study demonstrates the advantage of using the ion trap mass spectrometer for the determination of covalent modification of proteins such as phosphorylation and fatty acylation. Both LC/MS and LC/MS/MS data can be obtained in a single chromatographic run, which facilitates the identification of peptides, especially those showing masses that are unaccountable from the theoretical values based on the known sequence. The MS/MS data obtained “on the fly” are good enough to read partial amino acid sequences including phosphoamino acids. As will be described elsewhere,2 the tandem spectrum of the N-terminal myristoylated peptide obtained with the ion trap mass analyzer was almost indistinguishable from that obtained in the low energy collision-induced dissociation in a triple-stage quadrupole instrument. A detailed study on the tandem mass analysis of various peptides would provide the nature of the fragmentation mechanisms of the collision-induced dissociation by resonance excitation performed in the ion trap mass analyzer, which should, in turn, give more clues in analyzing the sequence information of peptides."

Naturally occurring phosphonates are believed to be the legacy of reduced forms of phosphorus present on the earth prior to the formation of the present oxygen-based atmosphere (1Mastelerz P. Zulewski R.I. Skolik J.J. Natural Products Chemistry. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 171Google Scholar). The direct linkage of the carbon unit to phosphorus in phosphonates distinguishes them from the more prevalent phosphate esters. The stability of the carbon–phosphorus bond to both solution and enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis appears to be a key determinant in the diversity of biological activities displayed by natural and synthetic phosphonates (2Hilderbrand R.L. The Roles of Phosphonates in Living Systems. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar). While a wide variety of phosphonates have been detected in bacteria, fungi, and animals (ranging from protozoans to man) (2Hilderbrand R.L. The Roles of Phosphonates in Living Systems. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar), we are only beginning to learn about how they are acquired by the host organism (i.e. by synthesis or ingestion) and about the specific physiological roles that they play. The phosphonate metabolites fosfomycin, bialaphos (Fig. 1), and K-26 (the tripeptide Ile-Tyr-(1-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylphosphonic acid) secreted by certain strains of bacteria display biological activities (antibiotic, antifungal, and herbicidal) toxic to certain organisms, suggesting a possible function of the phosphonate in natural chemical warfare (2Hilderbrand R.L. The Roles of Phosphonates in Living Systems. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar).

(Fig. 1) conjugates of glycan, lipid, and peptide macromolecules, found in a wide variety of parasitic organisms, seem to be connected with the ability of the parasite to infect the host organism and/or to avoid destruction by the host once it has been infected.

On the other hand, the cellular membrane phosphonolipids of rumen Protozoa (5Kennedy K.E. Thompson G.A. Science. 1970; 168: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the aquatic invertebrate parasiteTetrahymena pyriformis (a ciliated protozoan) (6White R.W. Kemp P. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem.

Acta. 1977; 922: 78-86Google Scholar) appear to enhance membrane stability in the phosphatase/lipase-rich host environment and thus promote parasite longevity. In marine invertebrates (e.g. snail, sea hare, cuttlefish, clam, mussel, squid, and octopus), AEP-macromolecule conjugates are prevalent (2Hilderbrand R.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9939-9943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest a possible neurological function that, in light of the discovery of AEP in human brain (11Alhadeff J.A. Daves G.D. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4866-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), may be far-reaching. AEP and AEP conjugates are also found in certain insects (12Kilby P.M. Radda G.K. Naturwissenschaften. 1991; 78: 514-517Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 13Hard K. Van Doorn J.M. Thomas-Oats J.E. Kamerling J.P. Van der Horst D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For instance, AEP is the main phosphorous compound in locust hemolymph; inLocusta migratoria, it represents 60% of the total phosphorus (12Kilby P.M. Radda G.K. Naturwissenschaften. 1991; 78: 514-517Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The function of “free AEP” and that of the two isoforms hemolymph apolipoprotein III, a glycoprotein containing AEP as a substituent on the carbohydrate unit (13Hard K. Van Doorn J.M. Thomas-Oats J.E. Kamerling J.P. Van der Horst D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), are yet unknown. In parallel with the ongoing investigation of phosphonate structure and function, the chemical pathways leading to phosphonate natural products have been actively pursued. The pathways leading to the commercially important antibiotic fosfomycin (16Kahan F.M. Kahan J.S. Cassidy P.J. Kropp H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and herbicide bialaphos (17Ogawa Y. Tsuruoka T. Inouye S. Niida T. Sci. Rep. Meiji Seika Kaisha. 1973; 13: 42-48Google Scholar) have been elucidated (14Hidaka T. Goda M. Kuzuyama T. Takei N. Makoto H. Seto H. Mol. Gen.

Commun. 1988; 153: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). An important finding emerging from these studies is that the carbon–phosphorus bond-forming reaction of all three pathways is the rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphonopyruvate (19Bowman E. McQueney M. Barry R.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 5575-5576Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar,31Seidel H.M. Freeman S. Seto H. Knowles J.R.

(Tokyo). 1989; 42: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) catalyzed by the enzyme PEP mutase. The bialaphos pathway also contains a second, very similar carbon–phosphorus bond-forming reaction, the rearrangement (and decarboxylation) of carboxyphosphoenolpyruvate to phosphinopyruvate (20Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8012-8013Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The two carbon–phosphorus bond-forming enzymes PEP mutase and carboxy-PEP mutase are structurally related (21Seidel M.H. Pompliano D.L. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Given that natural phosphonates share a common origin in the PEP to phosphonopyruvate step, it then follows that phosphonate producers may be identified on the basis of indigenous PEP mutase. Indeed, a PEP mutase screen has been successfully applied in the identification of phosphonate-producing soil bacteria (22Nakashita H. Shimazu A. Seto H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2825-2829Google Scholar). Our plan was to extend this idea further to higher organisms known to contain phosphonates for the purpose of distinguishing between ingestion, biosynthesis by faculative gut microbes, and active biosynthesis by the primary organism as possible modes of phosphonate acquisition. Saltwater mussels were reported to contain significant quantities of AEP (2Hilderbrand R.L. The Roles of Phosphonates in Living Systems. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1983Google Scholar), and so, prompted by their availability at local food stores, our search for PEP mutase in a “higher organism” started with the mussel Mytilus edulis. To ensure that the enzyme was indeed produced by the mussel and not by the microbes residing in its digestive track, we first demonstrated that the PEP mutase activity is highest (double) in the foot tissue. We then proceeded with the purification of the enzyme, which is reported in this paper along with the characterization of its physical and kinetic properties. Three-hundred grams of fresh tissue were blended (three 15-s intervals) in 100-g batches with 150 ml of lysis buffer (50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamide HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgSO4, and 200 mm thiamine pyrophosphate in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at 0 °C) in a Waring blender. The blended tissue was then homogenized using a Con-Torque motor (Eberbach Corp.)-driven homogenizer (Potter-Elvehjem Tissue Grinder). Following centrifugation (17,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was made 50% saturated in ammonium sulfate with gentle stirring at 0 °C. The protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and then the ammonium sulfate in the supernatant was increased to 80%. The protein was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 5 volumes of TEA buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and chromatographed at 4 °C on a 4.8 × 40-cm hydroxylapatite column pre-equilibrated with TEA buffer, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with 500 ml of 0.05 m NaH2PO4 in TEA buffer, pH 7.5, followed by a 2-liter linear gradient of NaH2PO4 (0.05–0.50 m) in TEA buffer, pH 7.5. The PEP mutase-containing fractions, identified (using the spectrophotometric coupled assay solution containing 0.1 mm phosphonopyruvate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ADP, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) at ∼0.4m phosphate, were pooled and made 20% saturated with ammonium sulfate (gentle stirring at 0 °C). The resulting solution was chromatographed on a 3.7 × 40-cm phenyl-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 10% ammonium sulfate in TEA buffer, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with 250 ml of the equilibration buffer followed by a 2-liter linear gradient of 10 to 0% ammonium sulfate in TEA buffer, pH 7.5. The PEP mutase-containing fractions (eluted at ∼0% ammonium sulfate) were pooled; concentrated to 20 ml with an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus; diluted 10-fold with TEA buffer, pH 7.5; and then concentrated once again. Following two more cycles of dilution and concentration, the 3-ml enzyme sample was chromatographed on a 1 × 50-cm DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The column was eluted with 200 ml of TEA buffer, pH 7.5, followed by a 400-ml linear gradient of KCl (0–0.2 m) in the same buffer. The PEP mutase-containing fractions (eluting at ∼0.1 m KCl) were pooled and then concentrated to 10 ml with an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus. The sample was diluted 20-fold with TEA buffer, pH 7.5, and then concentrated again. This cycle was repeated twice more before concentrating to a final volume of 2 ml for chromatography on a 0.5 × 10-cm Mono Q HR 5/5 prepacked fast protein liquid chromatography column. The column was eluted with a 24-ml linear gradient of 0.02–0.2 m KCl in TEA buffer, pH 7.5. The PEP mutase-containing fractions (eluting at ∼0.1 m KCl) were stored at −80 °C. The mussel PEP mutase subunit size was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (12% separating gel and 3% stacking gel) using the following molecular mass standards: phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). A linear semilog plot of log molecular mass versus distance traveled on the gel was constructed. The subunit size of mussel PEP mutase was determined from the measured distance traveled on the gel by extrapolation from the plot. The molecular size of native mussel PEP mutase was determined using a 1.5 × 81-cm Sephacryl S-200 column that had been equilibrated with TEA buffer, pH 7.5, and calibrated using the Pharmacia gel filtration calibration kit (ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa)) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatographies were carried out at 4 °C using TEA buffer, pH 7.5, as eluant and a peristaltic pump to maintain a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The elution volume was measured for mussel PEP mutase in two independent trials, and the molecular mass of the mutase was extrapolated from the linear semilog plot of protein molecular massversus observed elution volume. Purified PEP mutase was chromatographed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transfer-blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Hoefer Semiphor transfer blotter. Following membrane destaining and drying, the protein was excised and sequenced using Edman degradation techniques (Applied Biosystems Model 470 gas-phase sequenator). Staphylococcus aureus strain protease V8 (0.03 mg) digestion was carried out with 0.15 mg of PEP mutase preincubated in 30 μl of H2O, 8 μl of mercaptoethanol, and 16 μl of 10% SDS at 20 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated (after 2–80 min of incubation) by mixing a 6-μl aliquot with 4 μl of SDS loading buffer (60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.5% mercaptoethanol). Following heating at 100 °C for 4 min, the sample was chromatographed on a precast 16% Tricine gel (Novex). The peptide fragments were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. One major peptide, identified by Coomassie Blue staining, was sequenced as described above. The kcat and Km values were determined from initial velocity data. The rate of PEP formation in reactions containing ∼2 milliunits/ml PEP mutase, 5 mm MgCl2, 1–100 μmphosphonopyruvate, 50 mm Hepes, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (at 25 °C), and the coupling system (1 mm ADP, 0.2 mm NADH, 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase) was monitored by measuring the decrease in solution absorbance at 340 nm (Δε = 6.2 mm−1 cm−1). The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the Fortran HYPERL program of Cleland (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar), vo=Vm[E][S]/Km+[S]Equation 1 where vo is the initial velocity,Vm is the maximum velocity, [E] is the total enzyme concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate. The kcat was calculated by dividing theVm value by the concentration of PEP mutase (based on protein determination using the Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar)) used to catalyze the reactions. The Vm and Vm/Km values were determined from initial velocity data measured (as described above) as a function of reaction pH. The reaction solutions were buffered at the following pH ranges: pH 6.0–6.5 with 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0–7.5 with 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0–8.5 with 50 mm Tricine, and pH 9.0–10.0 with 50 mm CAPSO. The data were analyzed using Equations 2 and 3and the Fortran BELL and HABELL programs of Cleland (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar), logY=log(c/(1+[H]/K1+K2/[H]))Equation 2 logY=log(c/(1+[H]/K1))Equation 3 where Y = Vm orVm/Km, c is the pH-independent value of Y, [H] is the hydrogen ion concentration, and K1 and K2 are dissociation constants of groups that ionize. The velocity of PEP formation in reaction solutions containing ∼2 milliunits/ml PEP mutase, 100 μmphosphonopyruvate, and varying amounts of MgCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, ZnCl2, NiCl2, or CaCl2 in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (at 25 °C), was monitored at 233 nm (Δε = 1.5 mm−1 cm−1). The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the Fortran HYPERL program of Cleland (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). PEP mutase was purified from homogenized mussel tissue by initial ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cellular extract followed by hydroxylapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and Mono Q column chromatography. The results of the purification steps are summarized in Table I. The homogeneous enzyme (analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), having a specific activity of 90 units/mg, was obtained in a yield of 0.2 mg/300 g of tissue.

The N-terminal sequence of the protein and the sequence of a high pressure liquid chromatography-purified V8 proteolytic peptide are shown in Fig. 2 and are aligned with the corresponding regions of the Streptomyces hygroscopicus (24Hidaka T.

The turnover rate for Mg2+-activated PEP mutase was measured in the thermodynamically favored direction of the reaction, phosphonopyruvate to PEP. At 25 °C and pH 7.5, kcat = 34 s−1, and phosphonopyruvate Km = 3.3 ± 0.3 μm.

Thus far, PEP mutase has been shown to function in three different biosynthetic pathways: one leading to fosfomycin, another to bialaphos, and the third to AEP (Fig. 1). The fosfomycin pathway PEP mutase-encoding gene from S. wedmorensis (14Hidaka T. Goda M. Kuzuyama T. Takei N. Makoto H. Seto H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has been sequenced, and the enzyme has been purified/characterized from a probable fosfomycin-producing strain, Pseudomonas gladioli(25Nakashita H. Shimazu A. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6857-6861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bialaphos pathway PEP mutase-encoding gene from S. hygroscopicus (24Hidaka T. Hidaka M. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1992; 45: 1977-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has been sequenced, but because of its instability, the S. hygroscopicus enzyme has only been partially purified (19Bowman E. McQueney M. Barry R.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 5575-5576Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, PEP mutase has been purified/characterized from the AEP producers T. pyriformis(26Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and M. edulis, and the encoding gene from T. pyriformis (21Seidel M.H. Pompliano D.L. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has been sequenced. Here, we compare the physical and kinetic properties of mussel PEP mutase with those reported for the microbial enzymes. The comparison made between the two stretches of mussel PEP mutase sequence (obtained by automated amino acid sequencing) and matching regions found in the full sequences of the bialaphos pathway PEP mutase from S. hygroscopicus, the fosfomycin pathway PEP mutase from S. wedmorensis, and the AEP pathway PEP mutase fromT. pyriformis (Fig. 2) indicates that the match may be closest with the T. pyriformis enzyme. The sequence identity existing between (full sequence) pairs of the microbial mutases ranges from 32 to 34%, whereas the sequence identity between the stretches of mussel and T. pyriformis PEP mutases falls in the 50–60% range. The subunit sizes of the PEP mutases and their kinetic constants are summarized in Table III. The two fosfomycin pathway PEP mutases, at 48 and 61 kDa, are considerably larger than the 33–34-kDa AEP and bialaphos pathway mutases. The quarternary structure of the PEP mutase is dimeric in the case of theT. pyriformis enzyme and tetrameric in the cases of theP. gladioli and M. edulis PEP mutases.Table IIISummary of the properties of known PEP mutasesSource (Ref.)PathwaySubunitNativekcatKmkDas−1μmM. edulisAEP343-aDetermined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the denatured protein.Tetramer34 (25 °C)3T. pyriformis (21Seidel M.H.

Open table in a new tab Overall, the steady-state kinetic constants measured for the mutases (Table III) are reasonably close. The turnover rates of the T. pyriformis and M. edulis enzymes are equal, as are theKm values. The kcat of theP. gladioli PEP mutase appears comparatively higher (∼9-fold) and the Km value lower (∼5-fold); however, these constants were measured under conditions different from those used with the other two enzymes (including a 5 °C higher temperature), which may significantly affect the values measured. In previous studies of the T. pyriformis PEP mutase (26Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it was shown that substrate and metal cofactor binding is rapid equilibrium-ordered, with metal ion binding following substrate binding. We do not yet know what role the metal ion plays in catalysis; however, preliminary results from EPR studies suggest that it binds to phosphate bridge oxygen and carboxylate oxygen of the PEP substrate ligand bound in the central complex. For all three PEP mutases examined (Table II), the Vm values (measured under conditions of saturating phosphonopyruvate and metal ion) are remarkably close for Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ serving in the capacity of activator. The metal ionKm value, which is equivalent to the dissociation constant for metal binding to the enzyme-pyruvate-metal complex, shows distinctly more variation with metal cofactor used in the case of theM. edulis and P. gladioli PEP mutases than it does with the T. pyriformis enzyme (Table II). Whereas theKm values measured for Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ are all in the 2–7 μm range in the case of the T. pyriformismutase (26Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), in the case of the M. edulis and P. gladioli mutases (25Nakashita H. Shimazu A. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6857-6861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the softer metal ions bind at least an order of magnitude tighter than does Mg2+. The Vm and Vm/Km pH profiles reported previously for the T. pyriformis mutase (26Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) can now be compared with those measured for the M. edulis enzyme (Fig. 3). The Vm profile for the T. pyriformisPEP mutase was found to be flat over the pH range of 6–10, thus providing no information about catalytic groups in the enzyme-pyruvate-Mg2+ complex. The Vm/Km profile, on the other hand, was found to be bell-shaped, defining apparent ionization constants (for the free enzyme) of pK1 = 6.2 ± 0.1 and pK2 = 8.4 ± 0.1. These ionizations may have been missed in the Vm pH profile because of shifted pKa values or because they are important only for substrate binding. Both the Vm and Vm/Km pH profiles measured for the M. edulis PEP mutase reveal ionizations of essential groups. The Vm pH profile shows a “break” at pH 9.5 (Fig. 3), indicating loss of catalytic activity at higher pH. Because of an insufficient number of data points beyond pH 9.5, we did not attempt to fit the curve to define the apparent pKa of the group ionizing at high pH. Instead, the data between pH 6 and 9 were fit to define the ionization of a group within the enzyme-pyruvate-Mg2+ complex having an apparent pKa of 6.5 ± 0.1. Protonation of this group results in loss of catalytic activity. The Vm/Km pH profile measured for theM. edulis PEP mutase resembles that of the T. pyriformis enzyme and defines ionizations of catalytic groups in the free enzyme with pK1 = 7.7 ± 0.2 and pK2 = 8.3 ± 0.2. In conclusion, the isolation of PEP mutase from M. edulisdemonstrates that active phosphonate synthesis takes place in higher organisms. The primary phosphonate of mollusks is AEP, and therefore, it is highly likely that the PEP mutase isolated serves as the carbon–phosphorus bond-forming enzyme of the M. edulis AEP biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the known properties of theM. edulis and T. pyriformis PEP mutases indicates very homologous structures with similar but not identical catalytic properties. The bacterial (fosfomycin and bialaphos pathway) PEP mutases are also related to the mussel enzyme, but perhaps not as closely."
https://openalex.org/W1997321849,"The reactive center loop of native α1-proteinase inhibitor has been reported to be in a helical conformation and in a β-strand conformation by two different studies. In the β-strand loop structure the P5glutamic acid plays a unique role by stabilizing the loop in the predicted optimal conformation for the interaction with target proteinases and insertion into β-sheet A. We hypothesize here that disrupting the interactions that stabilize the β-strand conformation of the loop would result in changes in the inhibitory properties of the serpin. In addition, our earlier studies on reactive center loop mutants of α1-proteinase inhibitor suggested that the P5 residue was important in stabilizing the α1-proteinase inhibitor-proteinase complexes. To address these issues we made mutants of α1-proteinase inhibitor with glycine, glutamine, or lysine at the P5 position and measured the rates and stoichiometries of inhibition with trypsin and human neutrophil elastase and the stabilities of the resulting complexes. In most cases the rate of inhibition was reduced by about half and the stoichiometry increased between 2- and 4-fold. The only exception was for trypsin with the lysine variant where the P5 was now the favored site of cleavage. These data show that the P5 Glu is important in maintaining the reactive center loop in a conformation optimal for interaction with the proteinase and for a fast rate of loop insertion. The complexes formed with trypsin and the variant serpins were less stable than that formed with wild-type serpin and resulted in up to 33% regeneration of trypsin activity over a period of 6 days, compared with 17% with wild type. Thus, the P5 residue of α1-proteinase inhibitor is important in all steps of the inhibitory mechanism in a manner consistent with the structural role played by this residue in the β-strand loop structure of native α1-proteinase inhibitor.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the reactive center loop, which contains the scissile P1-P1′ bond, 2Using the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (7Schechter I.

Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 9Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the other, more detailed, structure of native α1-PI (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) it was found that the reactive center loop is in an extended β-strand conformation similar to the canonical conformation found for other classes of protein inhibitors of serine proteinases (10Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In this structure the P5 glutamic acid residue plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the β-strand conformation of the reactive center loop by forming hydrogen bonds with Arg-196 and the backbone amide of Met-226. These residues, along with Arg-223, Lys-243, and Arg-281, are part of a basic pocket. It was concluded that these interactions fixed the loop in the optimal conformation for the interaction with proteinases and for rapid loop insertion (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); therefore this structurally important residue also has important mechanistic implications. In this study we disrupted the stabilizing bonds present in native wild-type α1-PI by making P5 Glu to Gly, Gln, and Lys mutations. This allowed us to test the hypothesis regarding the implications of the β-strand conformation of the reactive center loop of α1-PI on the inhibition mechanism. We assessed the effect of these mutations on the rates and stoichiometries of inhibition with trypsin and human neutrophil elastase. We showed previously that α1-PI mutants containing the P6-P2 or the P12-P2residues of ovalbumin formed complexes with trypsin which had less stability compared with wild-type α1-PI, as measured by the regeneration of trypsin activity from complexes (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these two mutants the P5 Glu was changed to Gly. We suggested that in complexes with wild-type α1-PI either the P5Glu or the P3 Ile were in direct contact with the trypsin and formed an important bond involved in the stabilization of the complex, or that they interacted with adjacent residues in strand 5A, or the loop connecting helix F with strand 3A, to stabilize the cleaved loop inserted form of the serpin in the complex. As part of this present study we addressed this hypothesis by testing the long term stability of complexes formed with the previously discussed P5 variants. We found that the variants had reduced rates of enzyme inhibition and increased stoichiometries of inhibition (2–3-fold) showing that mutations of the P5 residue influenced steps both before, and after, the branch point in the mechanism, i.e. rates of proteinase interaction and of loop insertion. This is in agreement with the hypothesis of the importance of the reactive center loop conformation on serpin inhibitory activity as predicted from the β-strand loop structure (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We also found that complexes between the variants and trypsin showed regeneration of trypsin faster than with wild-type α1-PI, in agreement with our hypothesis. Thus, we have identified that the P5 Glu is an important residue in the mechanism of proteinase inhibition of α1-PI, in a predictable manner consistent with its important stabilizing role known from the β-strand structure of native α1-PI. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., oligonucleotides were synthesized by DNA Agency (Malvern, PA), Sequenase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp., the pET16b vector was from Novagen (Madison, WI), the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, Ca), human neutrophil elastase (HNE) was from Athens Research (Athens, GA), methoxysuccinyl-(Ala)2-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma, and S-2222 was from Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). β-Trypsin was purified froml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose as reported previously (12Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The wild-type α1-PI cDNA with deletion of the first five codons was contained in a NcoI-XbaI fragment in the pET16b vector (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the P5 residue from glutamic acid to glutamine, glycine, or lysine was performed using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotides were 19 bases in length and spanned the P8 residue codon to the first base of the P2 codon. The codon for glutamic acid was GAG and the mutated codons were CAG, GGG, and AAG, respectively. The recombinant proteins (wild-type and mutants) were produced as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The recovery of the active proteins from the inclusion bodies was done as described previously (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified monomeric proteins were stored at −70 °C; however, the process of freezing and thawing can induce some aggregation of the monomers. Consequently the samples used for the studies described here were analyzed to determine the percentage of active monomer in each thawed sample. This was assessed after separation on a Mono Q column using a linear gradient of 0–0.2m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were detected using a Shimadzu RF 535 fluorescence detector (with λex = 280 nm and λem = 340 nm). The samples were quantified according to their fluorescence intensity and the percentage of active monomer determined. Such an analysis is possible due to the different elution of monomeric and polymeric α1-PI on Mono Q (13Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1247: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The percentages of active monomers in the thawed aliquots were as follows: wild-type α1-PI, 92%; P5G-α1-PI, 67%; P5Q-α1-PI, 68%; and P5K-α1-PI, 94%. Stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) values for the inhibition of trypsin were determined by incubating different concentrations of wild-type and the P5 variants of α1-PI for 2 h or 5 h at 25 °C, with 8 nm trypsin in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% PEG 8000. The residual amidolytic activity was determined by the addition of 100 μm S-2222. Linear regression analysis of the decrease in proteinase activity with increasing concentration of α1-PI yielded the estimates for the stoichiometry of inhibition as the intercept on the abscissa. SI values for the inhibition of HNE were determined in a similar fashion by incubating different concentrations of wild-type and the P5 variants of α1-PI for 30 min or 1 h at 25 °C, with 5 nm HNE in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.5m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000. The residual amidolytic activity was determined by the addition of 200 μmmethoxysuccinyl-(Ala)2-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide. The obtained values for SI were adjusted by a correcting factor corresponding to the percentage of monomeric species present for the α1-PI species tested. The rate of inhibition of trypsin by recombinant α1-PI was determined at 25 °C by use of a discontinuous assay procedure. Under pseudo-first order conditions, 150 or 200 nm wild-type α1-PI, 300 nmor 1 μm P5G-α1-PI, 600 nm or 1.54 μmP5Q-α1-PI, and 735 nm or 1.12 μm P5K-α1-PI were incubated with 12.5 nm trypsin in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000. The residual trypsin activity was determined at various time by diluting the reaction mixture into the assay buffer containing 100 μm S-2222. The pseudo-first order constant,kobs for the reaction was obtained from the slope of a semi-log plot of the residual trypsin activity against time, and the second order rate constant, kapp, was determined by kobs/[I0], where [I0] is the initial serpin concentration. The rate of HNE inhibition by recombinant α1-PI was determined at 25 °C by use of a continuous assay procedure. Under pseudo-first order conditions, 0.5 nm HNE was incubated with 2.5 or 5 nm wild-type α1-PI, 15 nm P5G-α1-PI, 15 nmP5Q-α1-PI, or 5 nmP5K-α1-PI in the presence of 200 μmmethoxysuccinyl-(Ala)2-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000. The reaction was continuously recorded at 405 nm. The rate constant for the reaction was obtained after fitting the reaction curve to the equation kapp = (ka·I0)/(1 + [S0/Km]), where Km is the value for HNE with the substrate. The rate constant kapp determined by both the discontinuous and continuous assays is defined askapp = (k2/Ks) × (k4/k4 +k3). This term is dependent on the amount of partitioning between the noninhibitory substrate pathway and the inhibitory pathway as indicated by the (k4/k4 +k3) term. The SI is defined as (k4 +k3/k4), therefore multiplying kapp by the SI will give the rate constant k′app, which represents the rate of formation of [EI] (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austix, TX1996Google Scholar). If the proteinase also cleaves within the reactive center at a site other than the P1-P1′ bond, this analysis cannot be used, as it is not possible to separate this inactivation of the serpin from the inactivation by cleavage at the P1-P1′ bond (k3). For all of the α1-PI variants, cleavage was done using HNE and trypsin, and characterization of the cleavage site was performed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the cleavage reaction mixture after stopping the reaction by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 5 mm and freezing until analysis. Automated Edman degradation was carried out in an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer, by the protein sequencing facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Illinois-Chicago. All α1-PI variants and wild-type α1-PI were cleaved by HNE (4.5:1 ratio) in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000 for 10 min at 25 °C. All α1-PI variants and wild-type α1-PI were cleaved by trypsin (4:1 ratio) in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000 for 15 min at 25 °C. 16 nm wild-type α1-PI, 33.5 nm P5G-α1-PI, 43.5 nmP5Q-α1-PI, or 161 nmP5K-α1-PI were incubated with 12.5 nm trypsin in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% PEG 8000 at 25 and 37 °C. The residual trypsin activity was determined at various time by diluting the reaction mixture into the assay buffer containing 100 μm S-2222. Note that the amount of α1-PI in the incubations corresponds to active protein determined as described above by correcting for the amount of inactive polymer in each sample. To standardize all incubations so that the same amount of functional serpin was in each, the concentration of trypsin (12.5 nm) was multiplied by the SI for the reaction to determine the concentration of active serpin that would give complete inhibition. This value was then multiplied by 1.3 to give a small excess of serpin to ensure that the condition of complete inhibition could be met. The aims of this study were 2-fold. First, to test the effect of disrupting the native conformation of the reactive center loop on the inhibitory activity of α1-PI. From the two known native structures of α1-PI, the one describing a β-strand conformation predicted it would have direct mechanistic implications. We disrupted this optimal conformation by introducing changes at P5, the crucial residue for stabilization (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The second aim was to test whether these same changes impair the stability of the resulting complexes with trypsin. Thus, variants of α1-PI with changes at the P5 residue from glutamic acid to glutamine, glycine, or lysine were expressed in E. coli. Glutamine was chosen to remove the charge but keep the same size residue, glycine was chosen, as this residue is present in ovalbumin and the α1-PI-ovalbumin chimeras studied previously (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and lysine was chosen to introduce a positive charge at this position. The rates and SI values of trypsin and HNE by the α1-PI-P5 variants were measured (Table I). Amino-terminal sequencing of reaction mixtures of the variants with HNE showed that the only detectable cleavage site was at the P1-P1′ bond. Therefore multiplication of kapp by SI givesk′app, which corresponds to the rate of formation of [EI], i.e. the steps prior to the branch point (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austix, TX1996Google Scholar). In all cases k′app was reduced by about half. Therefore, the P5 residue can affect the initial interaction with the proteinase as judged by the reduction ink′app and the steps after the branch point, namely loop insertion, as judged by the increase in SI. In the case of trypsin with P5K-α1-PI, the SI appeared to be close to 10. However, amino-terminal sequencing of this reaction mixture revealed that the predominant site of cleavage was not at the P1-P1′ bond but at the P5-P4 bond, consequentlyk′app could not be determined. Amino-terminal sequencing of reaction mixtures with both trypsin and HNE showed that in all other cases the only cleavage site was the P1-P1′ bond. Overall, the data show that it is the loss of the glutamic acid that is critical rather than the gain of an unfavorable amino acid. This supports the idea that the P5 Glu is necessary for stabilizing the canonical β-strand conformation of the reactive center loop through interactions with the basic pocket (see Introduction) and that loss of these interactions alters the conformation of the loop to one that is no longer optimal for interaction with the proteinase and for loop insertion.Table ISI values and apparent second order rate constants (kapp and k′app) for inhibition of trypsin and HNE by α1-PI and α1-PI-P5 variantsProteinaseα1-PI variantskappSIk′appRelative valuesm−1s−1m−1s−1%HNEWild-type9.78 × 1061.11.08 × 107100P5G-α1-PI1.18 × 1063.84.47 × 10641.4P5Q-α1-PI1.51 × 1064.26.41 × 10659.3P5K-α1-PI2.74 × 1062.05.40 × 10650TrypsinWild-type1.84 × 1051.01.86 × 105100P5G-α1-PI3.43 × 1042.17.24 × 10438.9P5Q-α1-PI3.28 × 1042.78.82 × 10448.5P5K-α1-PI3.37 × 1049.9ND1-aFor this mutant, the analysis ofk′app was not performed since trypsin cleaves at a site other than P1-P1′ bond (i.e.preferentially at P5-P4 bond), thus it is not possible to separate the inactivation of the serpin from the inactivation by cleavage at P1-P1′ bond.ND1-aFor this mutant, the analysis ofk′app was not performed since trypsin cleaves at a site other than P1-P1′ bond (i.e.preferentially at P5-P4 bond), thus it is not possible to separate the inactivation of the serpin from the inactivation by cleavage at P1-P1′ bond.1-a For this mutant, the analysis ofk′app was not performed since trypsin cleaves at a site other than P1-P1′ bond (i.e.preferentially at P5-P4 bond), thus it is not possible to separate the inactivation of the serpin from the inactivation by cleavage at P1-P1′ bond. Open table in a new tab The results of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the reactions were consistent with the kinetic and SI data (Fig. 2). A shows the reaction with HNE. With wild-type α1-PI and P5K-α1-PI bands of complex are clearly seen. In the case of P5G-α1-PI and P5Q-α1-PI most of the complex is in a cleaved form. Cleavage of complex by free proteinase is a normal phenomenon (see below and Fig. 1). The reason this can be seen is that for P5G-α1-PI and P5Q-α1-PI the SI values for the reaction are 3.8 and 4.2, respectively, hence the proteinase remains active for longer and can cleave the complex. In support of this, active proteinase can be seen in lanes 7 and 8. This is not a problem for the kinetic assays which are carried out with significant serpin excess. With wild-type α1-PI and P5K-α1-PI the SI values are lower and this additional reaction does not have time to occur. B shows the reactions with trypsin. In the case of the reaction with P5K-α1-PI the predominant band is of cleaved serpin. This reflects that this variant is readily cleaved at the P5-P4 bond. To test the second hypothesis that P5 Glu is important in the kinetic stabilization of α1-PI-proteinase complexes, we investigated the long term stability of complexes formed by trypsin with the variants. Wild-type or variant α1-PI were incubated with trypsin at a 1.3-fold excess of inhibitor over the SI. In this way each incubation had the same amount of functional serpin. The reaction mixtures were incubated at either 25 or 37 °C for up to 6 days and aliquots assayed for enzyme activity throughout this time period. Control experiments under identical conditions showed that trypsin in the absence of serpin remained fully active throughout the time course. At 37 °C the complex with wild-type α1-PI was stable at 21 h, whereas the complexes with the glycine, glutamine, and lysine variants were reactivating with 4, 8, and 12.5% of the trypsin activity being regenerated, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The complex with wild-type α1-PI started to reactivate at 24 h. Reactivation reached a plateau at 43 h for the variants and at 72 h for the wild-type. The maximum reactivation was 17% for wild-type α1-PI, 24% for P5G-α1-PI, 31% for P5Q-α1-PI, and 33% for P5K-α1-PI. At 25 °C the reactivation was slower, reaching a plateau for all the α1-PI species after 120 h of incubation (Fig. 3 A). In an earlier study (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) we found that the reactivation of the complex of trypsin with an α1-PI mutant containing the P6-P2 residues of ovalbumin (which includes a glycine at P5) was much faster and occurred to a greater extent (75% reactivation in 48 h). This suggests that the P5 residue is only partially responsible for the decrease in complex stability and that other residues in this region also play a role. In contrast, preliminary studies showed that complexes with HNE were much more stable than those with trypsin (not shown). The longer term stability of the α1-PI-HNE complex compared with the α1-PI-trypsin complex are consistent with earlier observations (15Beatty K. Matheson N. Travis J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Oda K. Laskowski Sr., M. Kress L.F. Kowalski D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Part of the reason for this difference might be because human α1-PI and bovine trypsin are not a naturally occurring pair, whereas human α1-PI and HNE are. In the latter case the inhibitor and the enzyme would have co-evolved to give optimum interactions, whereas in the former case there would be no requirement for this to occur. The P5 Glu makes important structural contacts in both the intact β-strand conformation and in the cleaved form of α1-PI (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was likely that mutating this residue would lead to changes in the inhibitory properties of the serpin. From the similar decrease in kapp and k′app for all three variants with both proteinases it can be concluded that removal of the glutamic acid (rather than addition of positive charge in the case of the lysine variant) reduced the rate at which trypsin and HNE interacted with the serpin. With this residue changed, the interactions that stabilize the canonical conformation of the loop can no longer occur, hence the loop probably adopts a different conformation, such as a helical one, as this might now be the most stable conformation for the loop to adopt in this context (18Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 373: 87-92Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This conformation is no longer optimal for binding to the proteinase, hence k′app is reduced. The results are in agreement with the predictions made from the native structure of α1-PI describing the loop in a canonical conformation (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). According to Fig. 1, the serpin and the enzyme first form a reversible Michaelis complex and then a reaction takes place to give the intermediate [EI]. This latter step involves the formation of optimal subsite interactions between the serpin and the enzyme, such as through the P1′ and S1′ subsites (19Olson S.T. Stephens A.W. Hirs C.H.W. Bock P.E. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9717-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as well as the initiation of loop insertion (20Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21O'Malley K.M. Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, by changing the conformation of the reactive center loop by loss of the glutamic acid at P5, both steps might be reduced. The increase in SI represents a reduction in the rate of loop insertion into β-sheet A. The basic pocket surrounding P5 in the native molecule is critical for stabilizing the canonical structure of the loop with the hinge region ready to insert as strand 4 of β-sheet A. Part of the driving force for loop insertion might come from the disruption of this basic pocket, which occurs during the serpin conformational change (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the case of the variants this driving force would be lost as the interaction with the basic pocket probably does not occur. Presumably then, the rate of loop insertion would be slowed down enough to have an influence on the SI. One of the unresolved issues for serpins is the structure of the serpin-proteinase complex. Although it is likely that full, or at least partial, loop insertion accompanies complex formation (12Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.-I. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the interactions stabilizing the complex are unknown. The active site of the proteinase in the complex is disrupted such that it cannot catalyze the deacylation reaction (24Plotnick M.I. Mayne L. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7586-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is also possible that in the complex deacylation might be prevented by exclusion of the water, which acts as a nucleophile during this step, from the active site of the proteinase. In addition, there are conformational changes away from the active site that make the proteinase susceptible to cleavage by free proteinase (25Kaslik G. Kardos J. Szabó E. Szilágyi L. Závodsky P. Westerler W.M. Markley J.L. Graf L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5455-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Stavridi E.S. O'Malley K. Lukacs C.M. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. Christianson D.W. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10608-10615Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This cleavage probably fully inactivates the proteinase thereby preventing even residual catalyzed deacylation from taking place and preventing further complex dissociation (27Cooperman B.S. Stavridi E. Nickbarg E. Rescorla E. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1993; 268: 23616-23625Google Scholar). The results on the dissociation of the complexes formed with trypsin (Fig. 3) are entirely consistent with these studies. The plateau reached in the reactivation is explained by the released proteinase cleaving the proteinase in the complex to prevent further dissociation. The complexes with all three P5 mutants showed regeneration at a faster rate, and from an earlier time, than with wild-type, consistent with our hypothesis that the P5 residue is involved in the stabilization of the complex with trypsin. The interactions that take place at the interface between the serpin and the proteinase are very critical to the stability of the complex. The area of contact between enzyme and inhibitor in complexes of known structure (such as trypsin-soybean trypsin inhibitor and elastase-ovomucoid) is about 700 square Å on each protein. This contact area involves about 10–15 residues in the inhibitor and about 17–29 residues in the proteinase (28Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the amino acids in this interface region, in general 55% are nonpolar, 25% are polar, and 20% are charged. The structure of a serpin-enzyme complex is not known, but it might be expected that similar values will apply. Therefore, changing only one residue in the serpin is unlikely to have a profound effect on complex stability, but nevertheless if, as we predicted, the P5 is an important residue any effect might be detectable. This was the case for complexes with trypsin. These results show that the P5 Glu plays a role in complex stabilization; however we do not know what this role is. In our original hypothesis (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) we proposed that P5 either interacts directly with the proteinase across the interface, or that it interacts with adjacent serpin residues, such as residues in strand 5A or residues in the loop connecting helix F to strand 3A, which somehow helps to stabilize the complex. The details of the serpin-proteinase interface and the residues involved remain to be investigated, but we do know that, in addition to the P5 residue, the P1 and other residues in the reactive center can also affect stability of serpin-proteinase complexes (11Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Rubin H. Plotnick M.R. Wang Z.M. Liu X. Zhong Q. Schechter N.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 888-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data we report here can be interpreted in terms of the structural information available for α1-PI, which describes the β-strand conformation of the reactive center loop (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). First, changing the P5 residue affected both the interaction with the proteinase and subsequent loop insertion, through disruption of the canonical conformation of the loop in the native state and loss of one of the driving forces for loop insertion. Second, the reduced stability of complexes with trypsin is consistent with the proposal that the P5 residue makes important intramolecular contacts that help to stabilize the loop-inserted form or intermolecular contacts with the proteinase that assist in the distortion of the catalytic triad. With no currently available structure of a serpin-proteinase complex, future studies with reactive center loop mutants will help our understanding of the mechanism of complex stability.

It is likely that the benzothiazepine ring of diltiazem is a structure on which various side groups can be inserted, which may change the position of the ring in binding and subsequent inhibition of the Ca 2+channel. For example, the hydrophobic 4-methoxyphenyl group as well as the acetoxy and 2-(dimethyamino)ethyl groups, probably confer specific activities of diltiazem and other BTZs. In contrast, the calcium antagonist activity of semotiadil depends, in part, on the long side chain of Ar–O–CH2CH2CH2–N(Me)–CH2CH2–O–Ar at the C-3 position of the 1,4-benzothiazine. This idea is supported by the comparison of the three-dimensional structures between semotiadil and diltiazem based on their conformational analyses by x-ray crystallography and spectroscopy in solution (7Kojic-Prodic B. Ruzic-Toros Z. Sunjic V. Decorte E. Moimas F. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1984; 67: 916-925Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Ota A. Kawashima Y. Ohishi H. Ishida T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 41: 1681-1685Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There is no apparent similarity in the orientation of the side chains as well as in the common methoxyphenyl group between two drugs, when the phenyl ring of the benzothiazepine and 1,4-benzothiazine are overlaid by the computer. The hypothesis that the long side chain at the C-3 position of the 1,4-benzothiazine ring is a part of the pharmacophore for calcium antagonist activity (13Nakayama K. Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 1996; 14: 97-134Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) is supported by the fact that a similar structural component: Ar–C(R1R2)–CH2CH2CH2–N(Me)–CH2CH2–Ar exists in verapamil and other PAAs. It is apparent that the 1,4-benzothiazine ring of semotiadil plays an additional role that contributes to the enhanced potency.For example, in considering the pharmacological characteristics as a Ca2+ antagonist, semotiadil is longer-lasting than diltiazem and nifedipine and shows a higher selectivity for blood vessels compared with cardiac tissues than diltiazem but lower selectivity than nifedipine (9Miyazaki N. Furuta T. Shigei T. Yamauchi H. Iso T. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Mori T. Ishigai Y. Fukuzawa A. Chiba K. Shibano T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, semotiadil increases the dissociation rate of [3H](+)PN200–110, [3H]diltiazem and [3H]verapamil binding sites (11Nakayama K. Morimoto K. Nozawa Y. Tanaka Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1992; 20: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Nakayama K. Nozawa Y. Fukuta Y. J. Cardiovasc.

These results suggest that semotiadil has a strong allosteric interaction with the three classes of Ca2+antagonists, as exemplified by differential displacement of [3H]PN200–110, [3H]diltiazem, and [3H]verapamil from their specific sites on the Ca2+ channels (11Nakayama K. Morimoto K. Nozawa Y. Tanaka Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1992; 20: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Nakayama K. Nozawa Y. Fukuta Y. J. Cardiovasc.

Drug Rev. 1996; 14: 97-134Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Localization of the semotiadil binding site would provide information about a putative new class of Ca2+ antagonists but more importantly might uncover overlapping binding region(s), if any, with conventional Ca2+ antagonists. The binding sites for DHP, PAA, and BTZ have been localized by photoaffinity labeling of Ca2+ channels followed by defined proteolysis and antibody mapping using sequence-directed antibodies (14Nakayama H.

As an initial work to identify the binding site for semotiadil, we employed techniques of photoaffinity labeling of Ca2+channels isolated from rabbit skeletal muscles with [3H]D51–4700, an azidophenyl derivative of [3H]semotiadil (29Watanabe Y.

Ca2+ antagonists bind with high affinity to L-type Ca2+ channels and block the entry of extracellular Ca2+. Three specific classes of Ca2+antagonists have been identified and include 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHP), 1The abbreviations used are: DHP, 1,4-dihydropyridine; BTZ, benzothiazepine; dpm, disintegrations per minute; [3H]D51–4700, (+)-(R)3,4-dihydro-2-[5-methoxyl-2-[3-[N-[3H]methyl-N-[2-(3-azidophenoxy)ethyl]amino]propoxyl]phenyl]-4-methyl-3-oxo-2H-1,4-benzothiazine; Glu-C, endoprotease Glu-C; Lys-C, endoprotease Lys-C; PAA, phenylalkylamine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TPCK,N-p-toluenesulfonyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: DHP, 1,4-dihydropyridine; BTZ, benzothiazepine; dpm, disintegrations per minute; [3H]D51–4700, (+)-(R)3,4-dihydro-2-[5-methoxyl-2-[3-[N-[3H]methyl-N-[2-(3-azidophenoxy)ethyl]amino]propoxyl]phenyl]-4-methyl-3-oxo-2H-1,4-benzothiazine; Glu-C, endoprotease Glu-C; Lys-C, endoprotease Lys-C; PAA, phenylalkylamine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TPCK,N-p-toluenesulfonyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. phenylalkylamines (PAA), and benzothiazepines (BTZ), which are represented by the parent compounds, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, respectively. These drugs bind to different sites on the α1 subunit of Ca2+ channels (1Varadi G. Mori Y. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and logically explain the well known allosteric interactions with one another (2Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using photoaffinity labeling and antibody mapping techniques, all three drugs have been shown to bind to different regions in more than one motif. Several other Ca2+ antagonists have different chemical structures and somewhat different pharmacological actions than DHP, PAA, and BTZ (3Fujita M. Ito S. Ota A. Kato N. Yamamoto K. Kawashima Y.

Kawashima Y. Yamauchi H. Iwao J. J. Med. Chem. 1990; 33: 1898-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The benzothiadine ring is homologous to the benzothiazepine ring of diltiazem whereas the ring components of the two drugs might contribute different properties in the action on Ca2+ channels. Studies on structure-function relationships of diltiazem (reviewed in Ref. 6Nagao T. Saito M. Nakajima H. Kiyomoto A. Chem. Pharm.

Previous studies revealed that PGPS is the most highly regulated enzyme in cardiolipin biosynthesis in bothSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In this work, we report the purification to homogeneity of PGPS from S. pombe. The enzyme was solubilized from the mitochondrial membrane of S. pombe with Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme, together with the associated detergent and intrinsic lipids, had a molecular mass of 120 kDa, as determined by gel filtration. The enzyme was further purified using salt-induced phase separation, gel filtration, and ionic exchange, hydroxylapatite, and affinity chromatographies. The procedure yielded a homogeneous protein preparation, evidenced by both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and agarose isoelectric focusing under nondenaturing conditions. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme showed a strong dependence on lipid cofactors for activity in vitro. While both phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol appeared to be activators, the most significant activation was observed with cardiolipin.

In S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, PGPS is regulated by the phospholipid precursors inositol and choline (11Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kelly B.L. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6132-6138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, this enzyme is also regulated by factors which affect mitochondrial development, such as carbon source, growth phase, and the presence of a mitochondrial genome (13Gaynor P. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that regulation of PGPS has been conserved in two yeasts that are only distantly related evolutionarily indicates that this enzyme plays a key role in the regulation of CL biosynthesis. Therefore, to further understand how CL is synthesized, we purified PGPS from the yeast S. pombe and characterized its enzymological properties.A major obstacle to the purification of membrane-associated enzymes is that, following solubilization, the enzyme molecules usually exist in heterogeneous protein-detergent-lipid micellar complexes, which render many classical purification techniques ineffective. A second problem is that membrane enzymes frequently require the association of intrinsic phospholipids for either stability or activity, while extensive purification procedures result in removal of lipids from the enzyme, leading to loss of enzyme activity. We were able to circumvent these problems using a variety of approaches. The enzyme was solubilized with the mild nonionic detergent Triton X-100, which did not interfere with ion exchange chromatography. Furthermore, identification of phospholipid cofactors in experiments with partially purified enzyme was useful in overcoming the loss of activity. In addition, salt-induced phase separation followed by gel filtration greatly enriched and concentrated the enzyme without significant loss of activity. Finally, we utilized CDP-DG affinity chromatography (14Larson T.J. Hirabayashi T. Dowhan W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which has been effectively used in the purification of PGP synthase from Bacillus licheniformis (14Larson T.J.

In this paper, we report details of the purification of S. pombe PGPS to homogeneity, and describe its kinetic and enzymological properties.RESULTSPurification of PGPSA summary of the purification of PGPS is shown in Table I. The overall purification of the enzyme over the KCl-washed mitochondria was 1577-fold, with an activity yield of 2%. However, although the CDP-DG affinity chromatography purified PGPS to homogeneity, the enzyme had no detectable activity under standard assay conditions without lipid activator, and was also significantly denatured. Therefore, the specific activity determinations of purified enzyme could not accurately reflect the purification fold.Table IPurification of PGP synthase from S. pombeStepTotal unitsTotal protein1-aProtein concentration was measured by Bradford assay.

Open table in a new tab The purified PGPS was subjected to SDS-PAGE. A single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 60 kDa was visualized by silver stain (Fig. 1 A). Efforts to reconstitute enzyme activity after SDS-PAGE and Western blot in the presence of phospholipid cofactors were unsuccessful, probably due to irreversible denaturation by SDS. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was carried out using both Triton X-100 and CHAPS systems as described (31Warlow R.S. Bernard C.C.A. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In both cases, although PGPS activity was steadily recovered after electrophoresis for 30 h, the proteins formed precipitates in the stacking gel and thus could not be resolved. While the reason for this was not clear, hydrophobic interactions between protein/micelle and gel matrix were possibly involved. To solve this problem, we employed agarose-isoelectrofocusing (IEF) as described (32Aledo J.C. Gomez B.S. Segura J.A. Molina M. Nunez D.C.I. Marquez J. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using a 0.8% horizontal agarose gel. A pH gradient was formed using Bio-Lyte 3/10 carrier Ampholyte (Bio-Rad). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the sample migrated as a single spot which, in the presence of CL, was associated with PGPS activity (Fig. 1 C).Properties of PGPSThe purified PGPS was analyzed, together with either a partially purified sample or crude mitochondrial membrane when necessary, to elucidate the properties of this enzyme. The partially purified enzyme was obtained by incorporating Triton X-100 solubilization, hydroxylapatite and ionic exchange chromatographies. The preparation retained substantial PGPS activity without the addition of lipid activators. To assay the purified enzyme, CL was added to the reaction mixture.Effect of pH, Divalent Cations, Detergents, and Temperature on PGPS ActivityPGPS activity was measured at pH 6.5–7.5 using 200 mm Tris maleate buffer, and at pH 7.5–9.5 using 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer. All other components in the reaction mixture were kept constant, and assays were performed using standard conditions as described above. Results are shown in Fig. 2. The optimal pH for crude mitochondrial extract was 8.0, and activity decreased slowly as the pH was raised or lowered. The partially purified sample had an optimal pH of 7.5. In contrast, the purified enzyme had an optimal pH of 7.0, and a very narrow pH range of activity. It is possible that the sensitivity to pH change was due to removal of intrinsic lipids from the enzyme.Figure 2Effect of pH on PGPS activity. PGPS activity of the purified (○) and partially purified (•) enzyme, and the mitochondrial crude extract (□) were measured at the indicated pH values with 200 mm Tris malate buffer (pH 6.5–7.5) or 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5–9.5). Activity is normalized relative to those obtained at the optimal pH values (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activity was measured as a function of the divalent cations magnesium and manganese. Manganese was inhibitory to the enzyme. Unlike theE. coli enzyme (15Hirabayashi T. Larson T.J. Dowhan W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5205-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), S. pombe PGPS had no absolute magnesium requirement, although a slightly higher activity was observed at a concentration of 0.1 mm (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effect of divalent cations on PGPS activity.

Activity is relative to that obtained in the absence of cations (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The presence of detergents SDS, sodium deoxycholate, and octyl glucoside led to denaturation of the enzyme. However, PGPS remained active in the presence of mild detergents such as Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, and Tween 20. The effect of Triton X-100 was further studied, because it is the most commonly used detergent in studies of membrane proteins, and also was the most effective detergent for purification of PGPS. As shown in Fig. 4, the enzyme had maximal activity in 0.6 mm Triton X-100. At a higher concentration, Triton X-100 quickly became inhibitory, indicating that substrate dilution kinetics was followed (34Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The optimal assay temperature of PGPS was 30 °C under standard assay conditions.Figure 4Effect of Triton X-100 on PGPS activity.Partially purified PGPS (1170 units/mg) was measured at the indicated concentrations of Triton X-100. Activity is relative to that obtained at the optimal [Triton X-100] (100%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Enzyme KineticsPurified and partially purified PGPS exhibited typical saturation kinetics when glycerol 3-phosphate concentrations were varied at fixed concentrations of CDP-DG (data not shown). The same saturation kinetics were observed in crude mitochondrial membrane (11Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kelly B.L. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6132-6138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of PGPS kinetics with respect to CDP-DG, a mixed micelle system with Triton X-100 was used. PGPS activity was measured as a function of the surface concentration of CDP-DG in the micelle. The bulk CDP-DG concentration was held constant at 0.2 mm. The molar ratio of CDP-DG in the micelle was varied by changing the concentration of Triton X-100. The results are shown in Figs. 5 and6 B. When the molar ratio of CDP-DG was varied at fixed concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate, the kinetic curve of the purified and the partially purified enzyme was sigmoidal and appeared positively cooperative, in contrast to the typical saturation kinetics observed in crude mitochondrial membrane (11Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kelly B.L. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6132-6138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the purified enzyme reached its maximal velocity at a higher molar concentration of CDP-DG in comparison with the partially purified sample (Fig. 6 B).Figure 5CDP-DG dependence of partially purified PGPS in Triton X-100/CDP-DG mixed micelles. PGPS activity of the partially purified sample was measured as a function of the mole % CDP-DG in the micelles at fixed concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate.

B, re-plot of PGPS activityversus the CDP-DG concentrations on a larger scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Phospholipids on PGPS Activity in VitroThe sigmoidal nature of the kinetic curve for CDP-DG dependence suggested that PGPS activity is affected by phospholipids. We therefore investigated the effect of individual phospholipids on the purified and partially purified enzymes.Among the phospholipids tested (PG, PE, PI, PC, PS and CL), CL and PI demonstrated the most significant effects on partially purified PGPS. The effects of CL and PI with respect to CDP-DG surface concentration are shown in Fig. 7. The bulk concentration of CDP-DG was held constant at 0.2 mm; the molar ratio was changed by varying the concentrations of Triton X-100, CL, or PI. The addition of CL to the assay shifted the CDP-DG dependence curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. Further kinetic analysis revealed that, in the presence of CL, the partially purified PGPS exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the surface concentration of CDP-DG was varied at fixed concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate, while the Vmax appeared to increase and the apparent Km for CDP-DG appeared to decrease (data not shown).Figure 7Effect of CL and PI on CDP-DG dependence of partially purified PGPS. PGPS activity was measured in a partially purified sample as a function of mole % CDP-DG in the mixed micelles at fixed concentration of glycerol 3-phosphate. The bulk concentration of CDP-DG was maintained at 0.2 mm; concentrations of Triton X-100, CL, or PI were varied. Δ, 2% CL; ▪, 4% CL; ○, 0% CL, PI; •, 2% PI; □, 4% PI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Some phospholipids inhibited PGPS activity in vitro (Fig. 7). PI was the most effective inhibitor of the partially purified enzyme. It appeared to increase the amount of CDP-DG required for activation of PGPS activity (Fig. 7). Inhibition was also observed in the presence of high concentrations of CL (data not shown). In contrast, PI did not inhibit the purified PGPS (Fig. 8). It is possible that inhibition involved other intrinsic lipids present in the partially purified sample and, very likely, still associated with the enzyme. This is consistent with changes in the character of the enzyme during the purification process, such as the observed difference in optimal pH (Fig. 3).Figure 8Effect of phospholipids or lipid precursors on PGPS activity. PGPS activity of the affinity purified sample was measured as a function of the mole % of lipids in the mixed micelles. The bulk concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate and CDP-DG were fixed. Lipids were incorporated into the mixed micelles by sonication, and the total micelle concentration was maintained constant by varying the concentration of Triton X-100. •, E. coli CL; ○, bovine CL; ×, PA; ▵, PI; ▴, PS; □, DG; ▪, PG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The purified PGPS had no detectable activity under the standard assay conditions. However, the enzyme was activated by substantially increasing the surface concentration of CDP-DG or by incorporating CL into the mixed micelles. In the presence of 12 mol % CL, the purified enzyme was activated and exhibited normal saturation kinetics with respect to CDP-DG (Fig. 6 A). In contrast with the partially purified enzyme, which was half-maximally activated by 3 mol % CDP-DG, the purified PGPS required a much higher concentration of CDP-DG for half-maximal activation (Fig. 6 B). The effects of different phospholipids or lipid precursors on the purified PGPS are shown in Fig. 8. The concentrations of CDP-DG and glycerol 3-phosphate were fixed, while the concentrations of phospholipids or lipid precursors incorporated into the mixed micelles by sonication varied. In contrast to the partially purified enzyme, the purified PGPS was not inhibited by PI. The most significant effect was activation by PA and CL. PGPS activity was greatly boosted by CL from E. coli or bovine heart, until the surface concentration of CL reached approximately 12 mol %, after which the activation effect decreased. All other phospholipids and lipid precursors tested, including PG, PE, PI, PC, PS, and DG, had no significant effect on the enzyme.DISCUSSIONIn this report we describe the first purification to homogeneity of a eucaryotic PGPS. The S. pombe protein has a molecular mass of 60 kDa, and its activity is strongly affected by phospholipids.Purification of PGPSBy incorporating salt-induced phase separation into our protocol (25Parish C.R. Classon B.J. Tsagaratos J. Walker I.D. Kirszbaum L. McKenzie I.F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we enriched and concentrated the enzyme without significant loss of activity. It has been observed that, during phase separation, some membrane proteins fail to enter the lipid phase, while some soluble proteins do (25Parish C.R. Classon B.J. Tsagaratos J. Walker I.D. Kirszbaum L. McKenzie I.F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Snow P.M. Keizer G. Coligan J.E. Terhorst C. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2058-2066PubMed Google Scholar). In our procedure, the majority of PGPS activity remained in the aqueous solution during the first phase separation. This was advantageous since many hydrophobic proteins were removed, together with most detergent and membrane lipids, avoiding further interference with the purification. A portion of the PGPS activity (about 30%) entered the lipid layer, possibly due to the heterogeneous nature of the crude solubilization mixture. Since a high concentration of AS tends to stabilize most enzymes, AS-induced phase separation followed by gel filtration may be useful as a general procedure in membrane protein purification.CDP-DG affinity chromatography played an important role in our purification scheme. While the resin has been implemented successfully to purify several membrane enzymes which utilize CDP-DG (14Larson T.J. Hirabayashi T. Dowhan W.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14563-14570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pitfalls often accompany this procedure. We have determined that the α- and β-subunits of yeast F1-ATPase bind specifically to the affinity resin under similar conditions employed for PGPS binding (data not shown). Further investigation revealed that CDP-DG is capable of binding F1-ATPase and activating its activityin vitro (data not shown). Since specific association with lipids is common for many membrane bound proteins, it is likely that other proteins may also bind CDP-DG in vitro. Extensively enriching the target enzyme before affinity chromatography can help to alleviate the problem of nonspecific binding.Reconstitution of enzyme activity after gel electrophoresis can play a key role in enzyme identification. SDS-PAGE is the most frequently used gel electrophoresis in protein purification, due to its high resolving power. To reconstitute enzyme activity, residual SDS in the proteins can be removed by addition of mild nonionic detergents after SDS-PAGE (36Converse C.A. Papermaster D.S. Science. 1975; 189: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Ames G.F.-L. Nikaido K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). While there are many reports of successful reconstitution of membrane enzymes after denaturing gel electrophoresis, it is certainly not always possible. Very often, especially for hydrophobic membrane proteins or enzymes with complex higher structure, SDS-PAGE denatures the protein irreversibly, possibly by changing the conformation of the enzyme and/or by depleting bound cofactors (such as phospholipids). Renaturation of membrane enzymes after SDS-PAGE by blotting the proteins in the presence of phospholipid cofactors can be effective. The shortcoming of this approach is that it requires identification of the cofactors, which is usually available only for well characterized enzymes. We failed to reconstitute PGPS activity after SDS-PAGE and blotting, even in the presence of CL, an effective activator of the enzyme. PGPS activity was successfully reconstituted, however, following electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. For membrane proteins, mild detergents such as Triton X-100 and CHAPS can be used to keep the proteins from aggregating (31Warlow R.S. Bernard C.C.A. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32Aledo J.C. Gomez B.S. Segura J.A. Molina M. Nunez D.C.I. Marquez J. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, precipitation can be a serious problem, especially when a discontinuous system is used. In our purification, the PGPS/lipids/Triton X-100 mixed micelles had a size of 120 kDa, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. But the proteins failed to enter the resolving gel in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, either in the presence of Triton X-100 or CHAPS. Eliminating the stacking gel resulted in a smear near the top of the gel (data not shown). This problem was circumvented using an agarose gel. Due to its large pore size and inert nature, an agarose gel of 0.8% (w/v) allows a large micellar complex to move freely inside the matrix and to focus in a pH gradient. Running the gel on a hori"

After its in vitro synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, it can also be efficiently imported into isolated rat liver mitochondria, where it is processed to its native form by removal of the N-terminal presequence. The homologous cytosolic isoenzyme (cAAT) is not imported into mitochondria, even after fusion of the mitochondrial presequence from pmAAT to its N-terminal end. Substitution of the 30-residue N-terminal peptide of the mature portion of pmAAT with the corresponding sequence from the homologous, import-incompetent cytosolic isozyme (pcmAAT) does not prevent import but reduces substantially its processing in the matrix. A detectable amount of the pcmAAT chimera is found associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Single and double substitution mutants of Trp-5 and Trp-6 at the N-terminal end of the mature protein are imported into mitochondria with efficiency similar to that of wild type. However, replacement of Trp-5 with proline, or of both tryptophans with either alanine (W5A/W6A mutant) or valine and alanine (W5V/W6A mutant), allows import but interferes with the correct processing of the imported protein despite the presence of an intact cleavage site for the processing peptidase. Similar cleavage results were obtained using newly synthesized proteins and mitochondrial matrix extracts. These results indicate that translocation and processing for a precursor are independent events and that sequences C-terminal to the cleavage site are indeed important for the correct maturation of pmAAT in the matrix, probably because of their contribution to the conformation and flexibility of the peptide region surrounding the cleavage site required for efficient processing.

Wienhues U. Neupert W. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 403-412PubMed Google Scholar), the presequences of which are very heterogeneous in sequence although they share some general properties such as the presence of hydroxylated and positively charged amino acids as well as the ability to form amphiphilic α-helices in hydrophobic environments (20Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). While these properties are known to be important for the targeting function of the presequences (21Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the structural features responsible for the specific cleavage of the presequence within mitochondria at the exact junction with the N terminus of the mature protein are much less clear. Several cleavage motifs have been suggested, based on mutagenesis analyses and comparison of large numbers of sequences from extension peptides (22Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,23Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).The contribution of sequences C-terminal to the cleavage site (i.e. N-terminal end of mature protein) to the import and correct processing of mitochondrial precursors is still under debate. Whereas manipulations of sequences 5 residues downstream of the normal processing site of mitochondrial pre-ornithine carbamyltransferase were reported to affect neither import nor correct processing (24Nguyen M. Argan C. Sheffield W.P. Bell A.W. Shields D. Shore G.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1987; 104: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), deletion of mature sequences 17 residues down from the maturation site was found to mainly prevent processing of the F1-ATPase β-subunit within mitochondria (25Vassarotti A. Chen W.-J. Smagula C. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies using either synthetic peptides (26Ogishima T. Niidome T.

The lack of apparent consensus among the sequences at the processing sites of mitochondrial precursors has led to the proposal that the conformation of the presequence peptide and the chain flexibility in the region surrounding the cleavage site may be important for the recognition and maturation of precursors in the matrix (29Niidome T.

In addition, it is not known whether the overall conformational state of the imported protein or its interaction with molecular chaperones in the matrix might also contribute to the specificity of the cleavage.Aspartate aminotransferase exists in animal cells in two homologous (over 50% sequence similarity) molecular forms, one located exclusively in the cytosol (cAAT) and the other in the mitochondrial matrix (mAAT). Both are encoded in the nuclear genome and synthesized in the cytosol, yet only the mitochondrial form is competent for translocation into mitochondria. mAAT is synthesized as a precursor with a cleavable extension at its N-terminal end (pmAAT). This N-terminal segment also contains one of the regions of greater dissimilarities between the two AAT isozymes. The presequence of pmAAT from rat liver is 29 residues long and contains two arginine residues, one of them located in position −2 from the maturation site (33Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). pmAAT therefore belongs to the R-2 class of mitochondrial precursors containing the RX1↓X2S cleavage motif (22Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 32Waltner M. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26311-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), where X1 is Ala and X2 is Ser for pmAAT. As we show here, processing of imported pmAAT appears to occur in a single step and is dependent on a metalloprotease activity. In this work, we focus on the analysis of the effect of alterations introduced at the N-terminal end of the mature portion of AAT on the processing of the imported protein as well as on the full translocation of the protein to the matrix compartment.RESULTSSequence comparisons between the N-terminal end of mature mAAT isolated from rat liver (40Huynh Q.K. Sakakibara R. Watanabe T. Wada H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the complete cDNA of rat precursor pmAAT (33Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) indicate that processing of pmAAT in vivo occurs by cleavage between Ala-29 and Ser-30 of the precursor polypeptide (Fig. 1). The sequence of the cleavage site and its immediate flanking region is identical in pmAATs from other animal sources (41Obaru K. Nomiyama H. Shimada K. Nagashima F. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16976-16983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Jaussi R. Cotton B. Juretic N. Christen P. Schumperli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16060-16063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but differs from those found in other mitochondrial matrix proteins (23Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To analyze the contribution of sequences downstream from the cleavage site to both efficient import and correct processing of rat liver pmAAT, we prepared various fusion protein constructs (Fig. 1) and substitution mutants (Table I). One of the fusion constructs, pcAAT, encodes the presequence of pmAAT fused in frame to the entire cDNA of the homologous cytosolic AAT isozyme, which differs substantially from mAAT in its N-terminal segment (34Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26320-26327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other, pcmAAT, codes both the mitochondrial presequence and 33 amino acids from the N terminus of the cytosolic cAAT fused to the cDNA for residues 34–401 of the mitochondrial mAAT (35Lain B. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Moreno J.I. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24732-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, a set of single and double substitution mutants was prepared targeting the initial part of the N-terminal segment of the mature form of the protein, which is known to be critical for proper protein folding and stability of AAT. Thus, either or both of the tryptophan residues found in positions 5 and 6 of the mAAT N-terminal peptide (third and fourth residue downstream from the cleavage site) were replaced with a variety of hydrophobic, hydroxylated, or even charged residues (Table I). Nevertheless, these mutants retained the wild type Ala-Ser cleavage site.Table IProcessing of single and double substitution mutants at positions 5 and 6 in the carboxyl side (mature side) of the processing siteProteinImport1-aFraction of mature protein associated with trypsin-treated mitochondria relative to the amount of precursor plus mature protein recovered in the complete import reaction.Folding in matrix1-bFraction of imported protein that is resistant to trypsin in the presence of triton.Processing: size/efficiency1-cFraction of imported protein having mature or intermediate size.%%%Trp-5/Trp-6 (wild type)7065Mature/100Single substitutions W5P7050Mature/30–40 W5A, W5V, W5S, W5T, W5R65–7055–60Mature/100 W6A, W6V7055Mature/100Double substitutions W5F, W5A, W5V, W5I/W6F65–7055–60Mature/100 W5F/W6V, W6I, W6A65–7030Mature/100 W5V, W5A/W6A7015–20Intermediate/1001-a Fraction of mature protein associated with trypsin-treated mitochondria relative to the amount of precursor plus mature protein recovered in the complete import reaction.1-b Fraction of imported protein that is resistant to trypsin in the presence of triton.1-c Fraction of imported protein having mature or intermediate size. Open table in a new tab Import and Processing of Wild Type pmAAT and pcmAAT into Isolated MitochondriaSDS-PAGE electrophoretic patterns of import reactions of pmAAT and pcmAAT are shown in Fig. 2. As reported previously (43Altieri F. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F., J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), freshly synthesized pmAAT was efficiently imported into isolated rat liver mitochondria and processed to a mature-size form. The small amount of precursor-size protein recovered with mitochondria (Fig. 2, lane 3) appears to be adsorbed unfolded material as it was degraded by trypsin, whereas most of the processed mature protein remained intact (Fig. 2, lane 4). The intensity of the radiolabeled mature size protein in the pelleted mitochondria treated with trypsin relative to that of the precursor plus mature bands observed in the complete import reaction was used to calculate the percentage of precursor protein imported (ranging from 60% to 70%). Treatment with trypsin in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, which disrupts the mitochondrial membranes and thereby allows access of the protease to the internalized protein, showed that about 60–65% of the imported protein was properly folded (Fig. 2, lane 5). This test for folding relies on the well known extreme resistance displayed by folded (native) mAAT toward proteolysis (44Iriarte A. Hubert E. Kraft K. Martinez-Carrion M. Chemical and Biological Aspects of Vitamin B6Catalysis. Alan R. Liss, Inc, New York1984: 269-276Google Scholar). The precursor form pmAAT is also able to fold in to a conformation extremely similar to the known structure of the mature protein (4Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Altieri F. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F., J. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Wu T. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4782-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); only the presequence peptide is susceptible to hydrolysis by low concentrations of trypsin (4Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which cleaves after Arg at positions −22 and −2 in the presequence peptide (45Martinez-Carrion M. Altieri F. Iriarte A.J. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Wu T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 585: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a hybrid protein (pcAAT) consisting of the pmAAT presequence fused to the N terminus of the cytosolic isozyme, which can fold rapidly even in RRL (34Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26320-26327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not only was not imported into isolated mitochondria, it did not even bind to the organelle (data not shown).Figure 2Import of pmAAT and pcmAAT into isolated mitochondria. 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized in RRL for 20 min at 30 °C. Import of the translation products was performed by incubation with isolated rat liver mitochondria for 30 min at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and left untreated (lane 3), or treated with TPCK-trypsin (20 μg/ml) either in the absence (lane 4) or in the presence (lane 5) of 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the radioactive protein bands visualized in a PhosphorImager. The sequences of the processing regions are shown below their respective panels, including the expected cleavage sites, which are indicated by an arrow. TP, translation product, 10% of the amount used in the import reaction; IR, unfractionated import reaction; p, precursor; m, mature processed form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Different behavior was observed for pcmAAT, a chimera in which only the distinctive N-terminal segment of cAAT has been introduced into the N-terminal sequence of pmAAT (Fig. 1). Upon incubation with isolated mitochondria, a substantial amount of precursor-sized protein was recovered bound to mitochondria (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). A fraction of this material (40–50%) was resistant to externally added trypsin (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), which contrasts with the complete digestion of the precursor-size wild type protein associated with mitochondria. This indicates that pcmAAT has been translocated to a protease-inaccessible location, but most of it remains unprocessed. The small amount of mature-like species associated with mitochondria varied between experiments but usually represented about 20–30% of the protease-resistant imported protein (mature band in Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Treatment of mitochondria with trypsin in the presence of detergent indicates that only about 20% of the imported pcmAAT was properly folded, significantly less than for the wild type (Fig. 2, compare lanes 5 inA and B). Since in the folded precursor only the presequence is susceptible to trypsin (4Mattingly Jr., J.R. Youssef J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3925-3937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the small amount of trypsin-resistant chimera detected under these conditions appears as a mature size band due to the loss of the presequence to trypsin hydrolysis.Translocation of pmAAT Trp-5 and Trp-6 Mutants into Isolated MitochondriaThe results presented above indicate that alterations introduced C-terminal to the peptide bond cleaved by the mitochondrial processing peptidase in pmAAT, i.e. in the N-terminal region of the mature protein, might be important for precise processing. However, the sequence alterations introduced in pcmAAT extend from residue +33 to the amino acid in the +1 position (Met for Ser, Fig. 1). Although methionine residues have been found at both the −1 and + 1 positions of maturation sites of mitochondrial precursors (23Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), it is not clear which of the modifications in the sequence downstream from the processing site in pcmAAT is responsible for the inhibition of processing. To begin to address this question more specifically, we prepared a family of mutants containing the wild type cleavage site sequence, but with single or double substitutions in positions 5 and 6 of the N-terminal peptide of mature mAAT that correspond to residues +3 and +4 C-terminal from the processing site in pmAAT (in the numbering of AAT, the N terminus of mature mAAT is numbered as residue number 3 to maximize sequence alignments with the cytosolic isozyme of various species, which contains two additional residues at the N-terminal end; Ref. 46Pave-Preux M. Ferry N. Bouguet J. Hanoune J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17459-17466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two tryptophan residues are particularly intriguing because they are conserved in all mitochondrial mAATs for which sequences are available, whereas the equivalent positions in the cytosolic forms contain either phenylalanine or other hydrophobic residue but not tryptophan (33Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 46Pave-Preux M. Ferry N. Bouguet J.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 173-185Google Scholar). They are also known to contribute to the stability of the dimeric structure of the native protein.The identity of each mutant (listed in Table I) was confirmed by sequencing the cDNA in the region of the mutation. The SDS-PAGE electrophoretic mobilities of the mutant proteins prepared by in vitro transcription/translation of the corresponding cDNAs were identical to that of the wild type protein. The amount of protein synthesized was also essentially comparable to the wild type (data not shown). Several additional faint bands migrating as mature or smaller size species were often observed in the translation reactions of these mutants (Fig. 3, TP lanes). They are also present in the translation reaction of wild type pmAAT (Fig. 2, lane 1), and they probably originate from initiation of translation at internal methionine residues. When these mutant proteins were incubated in RRL with isolated rat liver mitochondria immediately after completing translation, all of them were imported with approximately the same efficiency as judged from the amount of trypsin-resistant protein that appears associated with the mitochondrial pellet (Table I). However, not all of them were properly processed upon import into mitochondria. Particularly, introduction of proline in position 5 (W5P-pmAAT) results in the appearance of a measurable amount of unprocessed precursor associated with mitochondria and resistant to digestion by trypsin (Fig. 3 A). However, the amount of mature-size protein was higher than for pcmAAT and oscillated between 35% and 45% of the protease-resistant (imported) protein associated with mitochondria. The difference in electrophoretic mobilities between the precursor and processed material is identical to that found with the precursor and mature forms of the wild type protein suggesting that the inefficient processing of the W5P mutant probably occurs at the Ala-Ser cleavage site.Figure 3Import of single and double substitution mutants of pmAAT.

Until recently, it has not been visible in electron density maps from x-ray crystallography studies, but the presence of several well conserved basic residues suggest that this part of the molecule is of structural importance for the factor to function properly. In this study, two lysines at positions 4 and 9 were mutated separately to alanine or glutamate. The resulting four point mutants were expressed and purified using the pGEX system. The untagged products were characterized with regard to guanine-nucleotide interaction, intrinsic GTPase activity, and binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA). The results show that Lys9 is especially strongly involved in the association with guanine nucleotides and the binding of aa-tRNA. Also Lys4 plays a role in the association of GDP and GTP and is also of some importance in aa-tRNA binding. Our results are discussed in structural terms with the conclusion that a complex network of interactions across the interface between domains 1 and 2 with Lys9 being a key residue seems to be important for the fine tuning of the dimensions of the cleft accommodating the acceptor end of aa-tRNA as well as delineating the structure of the effector region.

Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) 1The abbreviations used are: EF-Tu, elongation factor Tu; aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA; GDPNP, guanine 5′-(β,γ-imidotriphosphate). is engaged in the elongation step of protein biosynthesis with the main function of transporting aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A site of the mRNA-programmed ribosome. EF-Tu is a G-binding protein capable of binding either GTP or GDP. EF-Tu must be in its GTP-bound form to bind aa-tRNA. When proper codon-anticodon interaction is established at the A site, EF-Tu hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP, whereby a conformational change is induced in EF-Tu. Thus EF-Tu looses its affinity for aa-tRNA and the ribosome and dissociates, whereas aa-tRNA remains bound, allowing the attached amino acid to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. The elongation factor Ts is responsible for the reactivation of EF-Tu because it acts as a nucleotide exchange factor (for a review see Ref. 1Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). EF-Tu is well characterized both biochemically and structurally. During recent years the structures of the following forms of EF-Tu have been solved using x-ray crystallography: EF-Tu·GDP (2Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol.

These structures show that the EF-Tu molecule is composed of three structural domains, of which domain 1 binds the guanine nucleotide. Both intra- and inter-domain rearrangements during the elongation cycle of EF-Tu are responsible for the allosteric behavior of the elongation factor. Despite the wealth of information about EF-Tu, the role of the N-terminal region of elongation factor Tu remains unknown. This region of EF-Tu, comprising the first 10 amino acids of the protein, contains several conserved basic residues. The lysines at positions 2 and 4 are semi-conserved among prokaryotes. Arginine 7 is more than 98% conserved among prokaryotes, whereas the eukaryotic counterpart of EF-Tu, EF-1α, has a 100% conserved lysine at this position. Finally, lysine 9 is fully conserved among all known EF-Tu and EF-1α species. Moreover, electron density maps of the EF-Tu·GDP and the EF-Tu·EF-Ts complexes have a very low resolution in this part of the crystal structures, indicating that the N-terminal region is a flexible part of the molecule. The conservation of these residues along with the ability of aa-tRNA to protect the residues against chemical modification (9Antonsson B. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) made them likely candidates to bind the negatively charged phosphate backbone of tRNA. This idea was supported by comparing the structures of the GDP and GTP forms of EF-Tu. This revealed that a positively charged cleft with the size of an RNA helix was created between domains 1 and 2 in the neighborhood of the N-terminal upon binding of GTP (10Sprinzl M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Now the structure of the ternary complex has been solved (Fig. 1) (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 11Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and it confirms the accommodation of the acceptor stem of tRNA by the cleft. We decided to study the role of the basic residues of the N-terminal region in more detail using a protein engineering approach. The residues, Lys4 and Lys9, were changed into alanine or glutamate by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting four recombinant proteins, K4E, K4A, K9A, and K9E, were expressed, purified, and characterized in various assays to increase our knowledge about this baffling part of the elongation factor. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Sculptor™ in vitro mutagenesis system from Amersham Life Science, which is based on the Eckstein procedure (12Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The template used was M13mp11tufA containing the tufA gene fromEscherichia coli encoding EF-Tu positioned downstream of a stretch of nucleotides encoding the recognition site of the serine protease factor Xa (13Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Degn B. Wiborg O. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar). The primers 5′-GTTCTAAAGAAGCATTTGAACG-3′, 5′-GTTCTAAAGAAGAATTTGAACG-3′, 5′-GAACGTACAGCACCGCACGTTA-3′, and 5′-GAACGTACAGAACCGCACGTTA-3′ gave rise to the mutants K4A, K4E, K9A, and K9E, respectively. Clones containing the mutations of interest were identified by Sanger sequencing of single-stranded DNA (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52743) Google Scholar). BamHI fragments containing the mutated tufA genes and the nucleotides encoding the factor Xa recognition site were subcloned into the pGEX1 expression vector (15Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The continued presence of the mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing of double-stranded DNA (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.3-13.6Google Scholar). The mutanttufA genes were expressed in the E. coli strain JM109 according to Ref. 13Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Degn B. Wiborg O. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar with the exception that the temperature was 37 °C at the point of innoculation and later lowered to 28 °C upon induction. Protein purification was carried out as described (13Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Degn B. Wiborg O. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of active protein capable of binding guanine nucleotides was determined as described by Miller and Weissbach (17Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The stability of the mutants were evaluated by following their irreversible heat denaturation. 0.5 μm EF-Tu was mixed with 10 μm[3H]GDP (1100 dpm/pmol) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 4 °C, 100 mmNH4Cl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 90 min on ice. Hereafter, aliquots were incubated at different temperatures between 0 and 60 °C for 20 min. 75-μl samples were filtered through cellulose-acetate filters. The filters were washed three times with 1-ml aliquots of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 4 °C, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NH4Cl), and the amount of bound nucleotide was measured in a scintillation counter. The assay was also performed with GTP in which case EF-Tu was activated with [3H]GTP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase as described below. The apparent dissociation rate constants, k−1, for GDP and GTP were determined as described (18Knudsen C.R. Kjaersgard I.V. Wiborg O. Clark B.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the exception that the dissociation of [3H]GTP was followed by isotopic dilution with 100-fold excess of unlabeled GDP over [3H]GTP in GTPase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 4 °C, 60 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Nucleotide-free EF-Tu was prepared using the charcoal method essentially as described previously (19Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F.C. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The exact concentration of active EF-Tu in the resulting supernatant was measured using the nucleotide binding assay. The efficiency of the charcoal method was confirmed using EF-Tu·[3H]GDP as a substrate. The apparent association rate constant, k+1, for the reaction between nucleotide-free EF-Tu and GDP/GTP was determined as follows. 0.016 μm nucleotide-free EF-Tu was mixed with 0.04–0.08 μm [3H]GDP (5100 dpm/pmol) or 0.12–0.4 μm [3H]GTP (8650 dpm/pmol) in GTPase buffer. Samples containing 1.6 pmol EF-Tu were withdrawn, spotted on cellulose-acetate filters (which were washed with 3 ml of ice-cold wash buffer), and counted. Second-order kinetics was assumed in the following data processing. The [3H]GTP was pretreated with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase prior to the assay to rephosphorylate traces of spontaneously hydrolyzed GTP. The tRNA was charged as follows: 40 μm yeast tRNAPhe, 5 mm ATP, and 200 μm [14C]Phe (120 dpm/pmol) in charging buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.24 mm CTP, 2.8 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) was incubated with an adequate amount (empirically determined) of crude synthetase extract from bakers' yeast (20von der Haar F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 59: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 13 min. A charging degree exceeding 50% is suitable for subsequent assays. The RNaseA protection assay was performed by mixing 0.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 μmGTP, 2 μm EF-Tu·GDP in buffer F (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 40 mmNH4Cl, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) and incubating the mixture at 4 °C for 1 h. An equal volume of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe (0.6 μm) in buffer F was added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min allowing the ternary complex, EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe, to form. RNaseA was added to a concentration of 10 μg/μl, and the ternary complex degradation was followed on ice by successive withdrawal of samples containing 25 pmol of EF-Tu into ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 10 min, samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters, which were then washed with 3 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and counted. First-order kinetics was assumed, and the apparent dissociation rate constant,k−1, was determined as the slope of a plot of −ln(Ct/C0) versusreaction time. Ct and C0denote the concentration of ternary complex at time t and time 0, respectively. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis assay was carried out essentially as described by Andersen and Wiborg (21Andersen C. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The half-life,t½, of the aminoacyl bond was determined as ln(2)/slope of a representation of −ln(Ct/C0) versustime. The intrinsic GTPase activity was examined by determination of Km and kcat for the one-round reaction as described by Parmeggiani and Sander (22Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, EF-Tu·GDP was converted to EF-Tu·GTP by incubation with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. The assay was carried out at 30 °C. The concentration of EF-Tu was fixed at 0.3 μm, and the concentraion of [γ-32P]GTP (500–1500 dpm/pmol) was varied within the range of 1–25 μm. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were determined from the resulting data set presented in a Hanes plot. Michaelis-Menten kinetics are assumed. The yields of the different purified EF-Tu species were 1 ± 0.2 mg/g wet cell paste. The amount of active protein was 60–80% of the total protein concentration estimated after the Bradford procedure (23Sedmark J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar). The temperature at which the amount of active EF-Tu·GDP is reduced to 50%, φ, is 53 °C for wild-type EF-Tu and all of the mutants (data not shown). φ for EF-Tu·GTP is 45 °C for the wild type and the mutant K4E and 40 °C for the mutants K4A, K9A, and K9E. The following assays were therefore performed at 30 °C or below. The apparent dissociation rate constants, k−1, for the EF-Tu·GDP complexes of the mutants do not differ significantly from those of the wild-type EF-Tu complex. Slight increases are observed fork−1(GTP) with the largest deviance observed for the mutant K9E (Table I).Table IDissociation and association rate constants determined at 0 °CGDPGTPk−1 (×103)k+1(×10−4)Kdk−1(×103)k+1(×10−4)Kds−1M−1s−1nMs−1M−1s−1nMWild-type EF-Tu0.38 ± 0.02630 ± 1.51.33.8 ± 0.878.4 ± 0.05745K4A EF-Tu0.33 ± 0.008715 ± 0.712.29.2 ± 2.56.2 ± 1.1148K4E EF-Tu0.40 ± 0.04125 ± 7.01.66.4 ± 0.916.1 ± 4.9105K9A EF-Tu0.35 ± 0.01211 ± 0.0793.27.6 ± 1.63.2 ± 0.51238K9E EF-Tu0.33 ± 0.0120.86 ± 0.143815 ± 2.30.44 ± 0.0263400 Open table in a new tab The apparent association rate constants, k+1, of the binary complexes with both GDP and GTP are lowered for all of the mutants, but the decreases are most pronounced for the Lys9mutants (Table I). The introduction of a glutamate causes the largest effect at position 9, whereas the identity of the introduced amino acid is of no importance at position 4. The dissociation constants, Kd, summarizing the overall effect of the mutations on the nucleotide affinities were calculated as k−1/k+1(Table I). The most dramatic effect is observed for the mutant K9E, for which the affinity for GDP and GTP has been reduced 30- and 75-fold, respectively. The apparent dissociation rate constant,k−1, for dissociation of the ternary complex was determined using the RNase digestion assay, in which the protective effect of EF-Tu on the aminoacyl bond of aa-tRNA was measured (Fig. 2 and Table II). The mutant K9E offers no protection of the aa-tRNA at all, whereas K4A protects with the same efficiency as wild-type EF-Tu. The two other mutants, K4E and K9A, fall in between these two extremities.Table IIParameters characterizing the interaction between EF-Tu and Phe-tRNAPheApparent k−1 (× 103)Half-life of amino acyl bonds−1minWild-type EF-Tu4.6 ± 0.652240 ± 300K4A EF-Tu4.4 ± 0.38900 ± 36K4E EF-Tu6.3 ± 0.78540 ± 26K9A EF-Tu7.9 ± 0.66410 ± 7.8K9E EF-Tu25 ± 3.853 ± 2.0Unprotected aa-tRNA32 ± 4.232.4 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab The half-lives for the spontaneous hydrolysis of the aminoacyl bond are calculated from Fig. 3 and given in Table II. The results resemble those of the RNaseA protection assay, but in this case the mutants K4E and K9A resemble the wild type more than in the RNaseA protection assay. This is seen most clearly in Figs. 2 and3, which more readily enable an evaluation of the results within the frame of the limits of each assay. The span of the nonenzymatic hydrolysis assay is seen to be wider (the ratio between the wild type and the blank is 70) than that of the RNaseA protection assay (the corresponding ratio is only 8). A 2-fold difference in the RNaseA protection assay, as observed for the mutant K9A, is thus comparable with a 18-fold difference in the nonenzymatic hydrolysis assay. The parameters characterizing the intrinsic GTPase activity, Km and kcat, were determined from Hanes plots. The results are summarized in Table III. The Michaelis-Menten constants, Km, are slightly increased for the mutants K4A and K4E and further increased for mutants K9E and K9A, indicating that the stability of the substrate complexes, EF-Tu·GTP, are lowered for the mutants. Minor increases are also observed for the rate constants of product formation,kcat. The kcat/Km value, the apparent second-order rate constant of substrate complex formation, is not affected by the mutations. Overall, the observed kinetic parameters of the intrinsic GTPase activity for the mutants are not significantly changed compared with the wild type.Table IIIKinetic parameters, Km and kcat, characterizing the intrinsic GTPase activities of the different EF-Tu species at 30 °CKmkcat (× 106)kcat (× 106)/KmμMs−1μM−1 · s−1Wild-type EF-Tu3.9 ± 0.0711350 ± 330346K4A EF-Tu6.8 ± 0.143020 ± 710444K4E EF-Tu4.8 ± 1.61870 ± 230390K9A EF-Tu9.0 ± 1.32590 ± 560288K9E EF-Tu9.1 ± 2.62230 ± 410245 Open table in a new tab We have investigated the function of the N-terminal region of elongation factor Tu by production and characterization of the four point mutants, K4A, K4E, K9A, and K9E. The recombinant proteins behave like the wild-type protein with respect to temperature stability in the EF-Tu·GDP conformation, whereas slight destabilizations are seen for mutants K4A, K9A, and K9E in the EF-Tu·GTP conformation. Overall, the structures of the mutants can be considered to be maintained in both conformations excluding any long range effects caused by the substitutions. This is supported by the finding that the GTPase activity and k−1(GDP) are not changed significantly by any of the mutations. The enzymatic hydrolysis protection assay and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis protection assay revealed that aa-tRNA binding is severely impaired for K9E. Also the mutants K4E and K9A have a reduced ability to protect aa-tRNA. K4A, on the other hand, does not show a noteworthy change compared with the wild type in its capacity to protect the aminoacyl bond. Thus it appears that both Lys4 and Lys9 are involved in the binding of aa-tRNA, although Lys9 seems to play the more important role. The crystal structure of the ternary complex, EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA, composed of EF-Tu from Thermus aquaticus and Phe-tRNAPhe from yeast has been solved recently (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 11Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), allowing a structural evaluation of our biochemical data. In the following, the corresponding E. coli EF-Tu residues will be given in parentheses when different. The structure of the ternary complex reveals that none of the basic residues of the N-terminal region are in direct contact with the aa-tRNA (Fig. 1). Glu4 (Lys4) is solvent exposed, whereas the side chain of Lys9 is part of a tight network of interactions (Fig. 4). Lys9 forms a salt bridge to Glu71(Asp70) and a hydrogen bond to the main chain oxygen of Thr72 (Thr71). Glu71 and Thr72 are situated centrally in domain 1 in the loop connecting β-strands b and c. The side chain of Thr72 is associated with helix F via the side chain of Asp207(Asp196), which is furthermore in contact with the side chain of Tyr77 (Tyr76). In another direction, the Thr72 main chain nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with Asn39 at the beginning of the effector region (residues 39–65 (38–64)). The amino acids 1–10 constitute a coiled structure protruding from domain 1 and contacting the surface of domain 2. The major binding to domain 2 takes place via a double salt bridge formed between the side chains of Arg7 and Asp284(Glu272). In this way, the effector region is connected to domain 2 via the C-terminal of β-strand b and the extreme N-terminal region. In another study (24Mansilla F. Knudsen C.R. Laurberg M. Clark B.F.C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we have shown that Arg7 is important for the stabilization of the GTP conformation of EF-Tu and essential for the concomitant binding of aa-tRNA. Lys9 is not essential but is important for fine tuning the dimensions of the cleft into which the aminoacyl end of aa-tRNA is docked via the intricate network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds described above. Also Phe5 may play a role in stabilizing the interaction between domains 1 and 2. This phenylalanine points inward and establishes a hydrophobic cluster with His76(His75), Met272 (Met260), His273 (Phe261), and Lys275(Lys263). Of these, the last three residues are situated in domain 2, whereas the first is part of domain 1. In addition, Lys275 (Lys263) makes a salt bridge with Glu69 (Glu68), thereby enhancing the interaction further. All of the mentioned residues are well conserved, emphasizing the importance of the connection between the two domains established via the N-terminal region. K4E and K9A are impaired more strongly with respect to their ability to protect against hydrolysis by RNaseA than with respect to their ability to protect against nonenzymatic hydrolysis (compare Figs. 2 and 3). On the other hand, K9E, is affected almost equally in both assays. The K9E mutation is dramatic in terms of charge, showing that when the connection between domain 2 and the effector region is not only interrupted but kept apart by force (repulsion), EF-Tu becomes unable to protect aa-tRNA. Less drastic mutations like K4E and K9A affect the protection pattern in a more delicate manner, showing that the roles of these residues are to adjust the binding of aa-tRNA rather than a direct involvement in the binding of aa-tRNA as in the case of Arg7. The 3′-CCA-Phe end is docked into the cleft between domains 1 and 2. The amino acid is positioned in a pocket formed by the side chains of Phe229 (Phe218), Asp227 (Asp216), Glu226(Glu215), and Thr239 (Thr228). The amino group can form a hydrogen bond to the main chain CO of Asn285 (Asn272) and the main chain NH of His273 (Phe261), whereas the carbonyl group of the aminoester can form a hydrogen bond with the main chain NH of Arg274 (Arg262), the side chain of which interacts with the phosphate of A76 of the tRNA. Thus the amino group of the aminoacyl bond interacts with EF-Tu at the residue neighboring the interaction partner of Arg7. The phosphates of C74 and C75, which are the positions attacked by RNaseA, are in ionic contact with Lys52(Asn51) in the effector region. In addition, Asn64 (Asn63) of the effector region is in contact with C74 via a hydrogen bond to the O4′. All of the mutants except K9E protect the aminoacyl bond to some extent. Only when a direct repulsion is introduced, does the aa-tRNA-binding site collapse. Nevertheless, the mutations K4E and K9A also affect the binding of the tRNA, in particular the part of tRNA attacked by RNaseA. This phenomenon could well be caused by a misfolding of the effector regions of the mutants. Lys2 and Lys4 have been found to be protected against chemical modification by ethyl acetimidate when EF-Tu·GTP is in complex with aminoacyl-tRNA (9Antonsson B. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is not in accord with either the structure of the ternary complex (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) or our results (Ref. 24Mansilla F. Knudsen C.R. Laurberg M. Clark B.F.C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and this study). These lysines are located in an environment, which changes dramatically depending upon the functional state of EF-Tu. Apparently, it is these conformational changes rather than a shielding by aa-tRNA that is reflected in the modification study, illustrating the danger of interpreting chemical reactivity studies without structural information. The Lys9 mutants are affected with respect to association of guanine nucleotides. A glutamate at position 9 strongly decreasesk+1 of both GDP and GTP. A smaller effect is obtained upon introduction of an alanine. These results indicate that Lys9 either plays a role in the stabilization of the nucleotide-free form of EF-Tu or is involved in part of the structural rearrangements taking place upon nucleotide binding. The stabilizing role of Lys9 is apparently dependent upon an electrostatic interaction. The structures of the N-terminal regions of EF-Tu in complex with either GDPNP alone or GDPNP·Phe-tRNA are equivalent within the limitations of the method of x-ray crystallography. All of the interactions described for the ternary complex apply to the active form as well. Therefore, the effect observed on association with GTP is likely to be caused by the disruption of the salt bridge between Lys9 and Glu71 (Asp70). In contrast, k+1(GDP) of K4E is equal to the wild-type value, whereas that of K4A is halved, suggesting that the residue is exposed to the solvent and that the hydrophilic character of the side chain is more important than the actual property of the charge. In T. aquaticus, this residue is a glutamate supporting this assumption. The mutations to alanine or glutamate at position 4 do not affect association of the EF-Tu·GTP complex. Our data suggest that Lys9 is involved in a late rearrangement step taking place upon binding of a nucleotide. If the N-terminal region were involved in an earlier stage of nucleotide binding, then the stability and the GTPase activity of the mutants would probably have been impaired, too. The structural interpretation of our results on nucleotide interaction is unfortunately incomplete due to the absence of the N-terminal region in the structures of EF-Tu in complex with GDP and EF-Ts. The connection between domains 1 and 2 would be impossible in the GDP form, whereas the contact between the N-terminal region and the effector region via Glu71 (Asp70) might be present. It is, however, difficult to interpret exactly how the connection to the effector region is formed in E. coli EF-Tu·GDP as the only structure available of intact EF-Tu in its inactive form is of EF-Tu from T. aquaticus. The EF-Tu molecules from these two sources have no homology in the beginning of their effector regions. The structure of the effector region is strongly dependent upon the identity of the bound nucleotide (3Polekhina G. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Lippmann C. Nyborg J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The effector region and β-strand b describe a curve starting at Asp39(Thr39) and ending at Thr72(Thr71). The curve is “held together” by a hydrogen bond formed between its two extremities. The effects of the Lys9 mutants on nucleotide binding could be caused by an inability of the effector region to adjust its structure properly when its anchorage to the N-terminal is lost. The effects of the Lys4 mutations on GDP/GTP binding are very small. However, it seems likely that the function of the residues 1–4 is to ensure that the residues 5–9 are in the correct conformation for entering into the network of interactions described above. This conclusion is supported by a study of mutants of the solvent-exposed Lys2 (24Mansilla F. Knudsen C.R. Laurberg M. Clark B.F.C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which are affected in their formation of the GTP complex, but to a lower extent than the similar Lys4 mutations. In summary, we draw the following conclusions on the basis of the results presented herein. Lys4 plays a role in the association of GDP and GTP probably by influencing the conformations of Arg7 and Lys9. The residue is also of some importance in aa-tRNA binding. A connection from the effector region of domain 1 to domain 2 is established through Arg7 and Lys9 of the N-terminal region, which thereby acts as a molecular “hasp” locking domains 1 and 2 together probably in a late step of nucleotide association. The presence of the hasp is important for the binding of guanine nucleotides and aa-tRNA. The complex network of interactions across the interface between domains 1 and 2 with Lys9 being a key residue thus seems to be important for the fine tuning of the dimensions of the cleft accommodating the acceptor end of aa-tRNA as well as delineating the structure of the effector region. This work illustrates satisfyingly the interrelation of structural and biochemical studies for the exploration of the biological activity of a macromolecule.

https://openalex.org/W2151889161,"Dictyostelium discoideum (Amoebidae) secretes cell-lysing enzymes: esterases, amidases, and glycosylases, many of which degrade soil bacteria to provide a source of nutrients. Two of these enzymes, fatty-acyl amidases FAA I and FAA II, act sequentially on the N-linked long chain acyl groups of lipid A, the lipid anchor of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. FAA I selectively hydrolyzes the 3-hydroxymyristoyl group N-linked to the proximal glucosamine residue of de-O-acylated lipid A. Substrate specificity for FAA II is less selective, but does require prior de-N-acylation of the proximal sugar, i.e. bis-N-acylated lipid A is not a substrate. We have synthesized a 14C-labeled substrate analog for FAA II and used this in a novel assay to monitor its purification. Inhibitory studies indicate that FAA II is not a serine protease, but may have a catalytic mechanism similar to metalloprotein de-N-acetylases such as LpxC. Interestingly, rhizobial Nod factor signal oligosaccharides that induce root nodules on leguminous plants have many of the structural requirements for substrate recognition by FAA II. In vitro evidence indicates that Rhizobium fredii Nod factors are selectively de-N-acylated by purified FAA II, suggesting that the enzyme may reduce the N2-fixing efficiency ofRhizobium-legume symbioses. In contrast,N-methylated Nod factors from transgenic R. fredii carrying the rhizobial nodS gene were resistant to FAA II, suggesting a mechanism by which Nod factors may be protected from enzymatic de-N-acylation. Since FAA II and Nod factors are both secreted, and Nod factors that lack theN-acyl group are unable to induce nodules, dictyostelial FAA II may decrease the efficiency of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the environment by reducing the available biologically active nodule inducer signal. Dictyostelium discoideum (Amoebidae) secretes cell-lysing enzymes: esterases, amidases, and glycosylases, many of which degrade soil bacteria to provide a source of nutrients. Two of these enzymes, fatty-acyl amidases FAA I and FAA II, act sequentially on the N-linked long chain acyl groups of lipid A, the lipid anchor of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. FAA I selectively hydrolyzes the 3-hydroxymyristoyl group N-linked to the proximal glucosamine residue of de-O-acylated lipid A. Substrate specificity for FAA II is less selective, but does require prior de-N-acylation of the proximal sugar, i.e. bis-N-acylated lipid A is not a substrate. We have synthesized a 14C-labeled substrate analog for FAA II and used this in a novel assay to monitor its purification. Inhibitory studies indicate that FAA II is not a serine protease, but may have a catalytic mechanism similar to metalloprotein de-N-acetylases such as LpxC. Interestingly, rhizobial Nod factor signal oligosaccharides that induce root nodules on leguminous plants have many of the structural requirements for substrate recognition by FAA II. In vitro evidence indicates that Rhizobium fredii Nod factors are selectively de-N-acylated by purified FAA II, suggesting that the enzyme may reduce the N2-fixing efficiency ofRhizobium-legume symbioses. In contrast,N-methylated Nod factors from transgenic R. fredii carrying the rhizobial nodS gene were resistant to FAA II, suggesting a mechanism by which Nod factors may be protected from enzymatic de-N-acylation. Since FAA II and Nod factors are both secreted, and Nod factors that lack theN-acyl group are unable to induce nodules, dictyostelial FAA II may decrease the efficiency of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the environment by reducing the available biologically active nodule inducer signal. Dictyostelium discoideum secretes hydrolytic enzymes that degrade bacterial cell walls, enabling it to utilize soil-borne bacteria as a source of nutrition. Many of these enzymes have been implicated in the degradation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which is found exclusively in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria (1Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10228-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10222-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two enzymes, fatty-acyl amidases FAA 1The abbreviations used are: FAA, fatty-acyl amidase; GlcN-C16,N-palmitoyl[1-14C]glucosamine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RMM, rhizobial minimal medium. I and FAA II, are of particular interest and play a concerted role in the deacylation of lipid A (3Rosner M.R. Verret C.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5926-5933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a molecule that anchors lipopolysaccharide to the bacterial outer membrane (Fig. 1). FAA I is highly specific in its substrate requirements and selectively hydrolyzes N-linked fatty acids attached to the proximal sugar of de-O-acylated lipid A (1Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10228-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This monodeacylated lipid A is then further hydrolyzed by the action of FAA II, releasing fully deacylated lipid A oligosaccharide (1Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10228-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rosner M.R. Verret C.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5926-5933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FAA II is less specific than FAA I, but requires that the lipid A substrate is mono-N-acylated only on the distal sugar and that the fatty acid is longer than three carbons and 2-N-linked to a glucosaminyl residue. There is no requirement for the fatty acid to be 3-hydroxylated (as it is in lipid A) or for the glucosaminyl moiety to be phosphorylated or glycosidically linked (1Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10228-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the minimum structures for substrate recognition by FAA II are 2-N-acylamino-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranoses. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium secrete Nod factor signal molecules that induce symbiotic root nodules on certain leguminous plants (4Carlson R.W. Price N.P.J. Stacey G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 684-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Significantly, these Nod factor lipochito-oligosaccharides have many of the structural requirements for substrate recognition by FAA II (see Fig. 3). The long chain fatty acid moiety (typically C16–C18) is 2-N-linked to the distal glucosamine residue of Nod factors and, unlike bis-N-acylated lipid A, is not blocked by further acylation of the oligosaccharide core. Nod factor formation proceeds by NodC-catalyzed biosynthesis of chito-oligosaccharides, which are subsequently modified by the presence of host-specificity nodulation functions. The N-acyl chain is a common feature of all Nod factor structures described to date and is essential for their biological activity (5Atkinson E.M. Palcic M.M. Hindsgaul O. Long S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8418-8422Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Rohrig H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Kondorosi A. Barlier I. Schell J. John M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3122-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, certain Nod factor structures are modified at the N-acylated terminus by conjugated double bonds (7Delmont N. Debelle F. Aurelle H. Dénarié J. Promé J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20134-20142PubMed Google Scholar, 8Spaink H.P. Sheeley D.M. van Brussel A.A.N. Glushka J. York W.S. Tak T. Geiger O. Kennedy E.P.

Res. 1996; 289: 115-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This N-methylation is catalyzed by NodS protein that is present in Rhizobium sp. NGR234,Rhizobium etli, and certain Bradyrhizobiumspecies, but not in Rhizobium fredii USDA257 (13Krishnan H.B. Lewin A. Fellay R. Broughton W.J. Pueppke S.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3321-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Potentially, N-methylation or the presence of conjugated polyunsaturation may stabilize the acyl amide bond and therefore protect Nod factors against degradation by FAA II. We have synthesizedN-palmitoyl[1-14C]glucosamine (GlcN-C16) as a synthetic substrate and found it to be readily de-N-acylated by the action of FAA II. This has been utilized in a novel assay for FAA II and used to purify the protein to homogeneity from the culture medium of a Dictyostelium nagAknockout (14Graham T. Zassenhaus H.P. Kaplin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16823-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Susceptibility to various inhibitors suggests that FAA II has mechanistic similarities to zinc-containing acetamidases, such as the 3-O-acyl-GlcNAc de-N-acetylase LpxC (15Hyland S.A. Eveland S.S. Anderson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rather than to serine proteases. The activity of purified FAA II has also been assessed on metabolically radiolabeled Nod factors fromR. fredii USDA257, and the results indicate that these also become de-N-acylated. Since Nod factors lacking theN-acyl chain are biologically inactive, the presence of FAA II in soil may reduce the ability of Rhizobium to nodulate host leguminous plants. Interestingly, Nod factors from a transconjugate of USDA257 expressing the nodS N-methyltransferase gene from Rhizobium sp. NGR234 are found to be more resistant to FAA II, suggesting thatN-methylation may protect Nod factors against deacylation byDictyostelium in soil. D. discoideum strain Ax-3 (ATCC 28368) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The nagA-deleted strain (HL101) was obtained from William Loomis (University of California, San Diego, CA). Rhizobium strains were obtained from Steve Pueppke (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO). Radiolabeled d-[1-14C]glucosamine (specific activity of 45–60 mCi/mmol) and sodium [2-14C]acetate (540 mCi/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Serine protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma, as were buffers, chemicals, and chromatography supplies. Kodak X-Omat AR-5 was purchased from S & W X-Ray (Syracuse, NY). Buffer A contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) plus 0.1 mm EDTA, and Buffer B contained 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0). [1-14C]Glucosamine (0.5 μl, 50 nCi) was spotted at the origin on a normal-phase Silica Gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plate, dried under a stream of warm air, and overspotted with palmitoyl chloride (2 μl). After an 18-h reaction at room temperature, the plate was developed with chloroform, methanol, and aqueous ammonium hydroxide (50:40:5 by volume). Untreated [1-14C]glucosamine was run in a control lane. The plate was dried until free of solvent and autoradiographed for 2 days. Radiolabeled N-palmitoylglucosamine was recovered from the plates by extraction with methanol. Following scintillation counting, aliquots were evaporated to dryness in Eppendorf tubes and stored at −20 °C. Culture supernatant (14 liters) from D. discoideum strain Ax-3 was concentrated by passage through a 30-kDa cutoff Amicon filter, and the concentrated supernatant (1 liter) was stirred overnight with DEAE-cellulose (50 g, 4 °C). The ion exchanger was recovered by filtration through a cotton pad, washed with NaCl (150 mm) in cold Buffer A (125 ml), and eluted with NaCl (1 m) in Buffer A (187 ml). Following precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70%), and centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), the protein pellet was redissolved in Buffer B (3 ml) and dialyzed overnight against Buffer B. It was further fractionated on a DEAE-cellulose column (20 × 1 cm) as follows: 1) washed with Buffer B (5 bed volumes) and 2) eluted with a gradient of NaCl (150–500 mm) in Buffer B. Fractions were assayed for protein using the BCA assay (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar) and for FAA II activity as described below. Active fractions were stored at −20 °C prior to purification by high performance liquid chromatography. The HPLC system consisted of two Waters 512 pumps, a Waters 486 UV detector, and a U6K injector. Reverse-phase chromatography was achieved on a Brownlee Spheri-5 RP-18 column (250 mm, 5-μm particle size) in series with a Waters RP-18 column (150 mm, 5-μm particle size). A gradient from 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in 10% aqueous acetonitrile to 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% acetonitrile was run for 30 min at 0.6 ml/min. Gel-filtration HPLC was done on a Phenomenex Biosep-Sec-S-3000 column (300 × 7.8 mm) protected by a Phenomenex Biosep-Sec-S guard column (7.5 × 7.8 mm) using a mobile phase of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8; 1 ml/min). In either case, detection was achieved by absorbance at 210 nm. A standard protein ladder was run as a molecular mass marker. Fractions were collected from the columns and assayed for protein and FAA II activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run as per Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays consisted ofN-palmitoyl[U-14C]glucosamine (a minimum of 10 nCi/assay) and protein (1–10 mg/ml) in 0.2% Triton X-100 in Buffer B at a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed to completion (18 h, 26 °C), after which it was stopped by the addition of aqueous NaCl (10% (w/v), 100 μl). Unreacted substrate was extracted by partitioning with ethyl acetate/hexane (90:10 (v/v), 300 μl). Following microcentrifugation, radioactivity was assessed in the upper solvent layer (200 μl) and lower aqueous layer (100 μl) by scintillation counting. A minimum of three replications was analyzed per assay. Controls were identical, but lacked protein exudate. Stock solutions of the inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 mm) and EDTA (1 m) were prepared in acetonitrile and Buffer B, respectively, and, when used, were added prior to the protein addition. The FAA II assay was modified for testing on Nod factors so that activity could be monitored by TLC/autoradiography. Metabolically radiolabeled Nod factors (typically 30 nCi) were incubated with FAA II (10 mg/ml, 18 h, 30 °C) in Buffer B (30 μl) containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Control reactions lacked the enzyme. The reaction was stopped by the addition of methanol (50 μl), and the precipitated protein was pelleted by brief centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 15 min). Aliquots of the methanolic supernatant (30 μl) were separated on silica TLC plates eluted with butanol/ethanol/water (5:3:2 by volume). Plates were air-dried and exposed to x-ray film for 6 days. Rhizobia were grown aerobically at 30 °C on rhizobial minimal medium (RMM) in the presence of succinate (12 mm) and glutamate (6 mm) as described previously (11Price N.P.J. Relic B. Talmont F. Lewin A. Promé D. Pueppke S.G. Maillet F. Dénarié J. Promé J.-C. Broughton W.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3575-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cultures (10 ml) were radiolabeled by the inclusion of [1-14C]glucosamine (40–60 mCi/mmol, 1 μCi/ml) at the start of the growth period. After 4 h of growth (A550 = 0.3), the nod genes were induced by the addition of the species-specific flavonoid apigenin (5 × 10−4m). After 18 h, the bacteria were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C), and radiolabeled Nod factors were recovered from the culture supernatant by solid-phase extraction with C18-functionalized silica (Waters) (18Price N.P.J. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After washing with water (5 ml), radiolabeled metabolites were eluted with methanol and evaporated to dryness. Alternatively, Nod factors were metabolically labeled from precursor [14C]acetate. Cultures (10 ml) were grown to logarithmic phase (A550 = 1.0) as described above and divided, and one-half was induced with apigenin (5 × 10−4m). After diluting to 10 ml with fresh RMM and an additional 2 h of growth, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once, and resuspended in 1 ml of RMM without the carbon source. Cells were incubated for 10 min with sodium [2-14C]acetate (54 mCi/ml, 10 μCi) and then diluted to 50 ml with RMM containing succinate (12 mm) and glutamate (6 mm). After 2 days further growth, the radiolabeled Nod factors were isolated as described above. We prepared and purified, by thin-layer chromatography with autoradiographic detection (Fig. 2), a radiolabeled synthetic substrate for FAA II,N-palmitoyl[1-14C]glucosamine (Fig. 3). Conditions were optimized for two-phase partitioning ofN-palmitoyl[1-14C]glucosamine from the free sugar [1-14C]glucosamine, making use of ethyl acetate/hexane (90:10, v/v) and aqueous sodium chloride (10%, w/v). This allowed selective recovery of the radiolabeled monosaccharide in the aqueous layer. Thus, after treatment ofN-palmitoyl[1-14C]glucosamine with FAA II in aqueous Buffer B and the addition of sodium chloride (to 10%, w/v), selective counting of the aqueous and organic phases is an indication of the reaction progress. The salt also served the dual purpose of stopping the reaction. Solvent extraction of radiolabeled GlcN-C16 was optimized such that 98% of the radioactivity from the enzyme-free control partitioned into the solvent phase (Table I). Following treatment with FAA II (10 mg/ml, 18 h, 30 °C), 35.4% of the counts remained in the aqueous buffer as deacylated [1-14C]glucosamine. The degree of activity in secreted dictyostelial extracts was monitored, allowing for complete purification and a mechanistic study of FAA II.Table IFAA II activity on [1-14C]GlcN-C16Reaction conditionsDistribution of radiolabelAqueous/ (aqueous + solvent)Solvent phaseAqueous phasecpm%Control10,2902202.1FAA II5790317035.4FAA II + EDTA (50 mm)5830268031.5FAA II + PMSF1-aPMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

Open table in a new tab Purification was undertaken on a secreted fraction from the culture supernatant ofDictyostelium strain Ax-3 after passage through a 30-kDa cutoff filter. Activity was monitored by the two-phase partitioning assay. Enzyme assays were typically run at 10 mg/ml total protein, giving a 56.3% decrease in counts in the organic phase relative to controls after a 18-h reaction time. A concomitant increase in counts was recorded in the aqueous extraction buffer. Lower concentrations of FAA II or shorter reaction times resulted in decreased activity. Final purity of the enzyme was ascertained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 4). Verret et al. (2Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10222-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were unable to fully purify FAA II free from acetylhexosaminidase A (NagA), but estimated its relative mass to be in the range of 60–80 kDa. Here the molecular mass of FAA II was determined by gel electrophoresis and gel-filtration HPLC. The protein eluted on gels with a molecular mass of 66,000 (Fig. 4). By gel filtration, the same purified fraction eluted as a single peak, but in this case, the relative molecular mass was estimated at 32,985 Da. FAA II may be mechanistically similar to serine proteases or metalloproteases in that amide bonds are being hydrolyzed. To examine this, we assayed purified FAA II in the presence of two known protease inhibitors (Table I). Stock solutions of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were prepared at 50 mm in either methanol or acetonitrile and used at the concentrations shown in Table I. EDTA was prepared in Buffer B (292 mg/ml) and used at a final concentration of 50 mm. As Table I indicates, these inhibitors had no significant effect on the activity of FAA II under the conditions tested, and results were within ±4.1% of the non-inhibited FAA II reaction. Rhizobial Nod factors were radiolabeled metabolically by culturing rhizobial strains on minimal medium in the presence of precursor [1-14C]glucosamine and apigenin, an appropriate flavonoidnod gene inducer (18Price N.P.J. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Alternatively, optimal incorporation of radiolabel from acetate was attained by incubation with sodium [2-14C]acetate as the sole carbon source prior to chasing with succinate (12 mm) and glutamate (6 mm). The secreted hydrophobic fractions containing the Nod factors were separated from excess radiolabeled precursor and other labeled polar metabolites on a reverse-phase cartridge. The induction of Nod factors, as assessed by TLC/autoradiography, was clearly dependent on the presence of apigenin (Fig. 5). Inducible Nod factor bands of similar RF were revealed by acetate labeling, which, when overspotted, coeluted with the inducible [14C]glucosamine-labeled band. The FAA II assay was modified so that activity on Nod factors could be monitored by TLC/autoradiography. Hydrophobic extracts of the conditioned culture medium from apigenin-induced or -uninduced R. fredii cultures were treated in parallel with FAA II prior to chromatographic separation (Fig. 5). Comparable reactions lacking the FAA II enzyme served as controls. Treatment of [14C]acetate-labeled Nod factors with FAA II for 18 h resulted in an attenuation of the labeling (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that either the hydrolyzed acyl group or the unhydrolyzed Nod factor was sequestered with the amidase. This was confirmed by the presence of radioactivity in the protein pellet. Extracts from uninduced cultures were unaffected by this treatment. Similar experiments on [14C]glucosamine-labeled Nod factors resulted in a chromatographic mobility shift, but without attenuation of intensity (Fig. 5 C). These data are consistent with metabolic incorporation of [14C]acetate into the Nod factor acyl chain and of [14C]glucosamine into the oligosaccharide backbone. Following deacylation, radiolabel is lost from [14C]acetate-labeled Nod factors or retained but chromatographically shifted for [14C]glucosamine-labeled Nod factors. Wild-type R. fredii USDA257 produces fucosylated and N-vaccenoylated penta-, tetra-, and trisaccharide Nod factors that induce nodules on soybean (19Bec-Ferté M.-P. Krishnan H.B. Promé D. Savagnac A. Pueppke S.G. Promé J.-C. Biochemistry. 1995; 33: 11782-11788Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Other Rhizobiumspecies produce N-vaccenoylated Nod factors on which the acylated nitrogen is also N-methylated, such that the terminal nonreducing residue isN-vaccenoyl-N-methyl-2-deoxy-d-glucosamine. The presence of the N-methyl group has been attributed to the activity of a rhizobial inducible N-methyltransferase (NodS) (20Jabbouri S. Fellay R. Talmont F. Kamalaprija P. Burger U. Relic B. Promé J.-C. Broughton W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22968-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To assess the susceptibility of N-methylated Nod factors to FAA II, we isolated a metabolically labeled Nod factor fraction from a USDA257 transconjugate expressing the nodSregion from Rhizobium sp. NGR234. The Nod factors from this strain were shown to be N-methylated by the extension of the symbiotic host range to include the tropical legumeLeucaena, which is selectively responsive toN-methylated Nod factors (13Krishnan H.B. Lewin A. Fellay R. Broughton W.J. Pueppke S.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3321-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and by the flavonoid-inducible incorporation of metabolic label from [methyl-14C]methionine. 2A. E. Tobin and N. P. J. Price, manuscript in preparation. Apigenin-inducible, [14C]glucosamine-labeled Nod factors were obtained from this strain as observed by TLC/autoradiography (Fig. 6). However, unlike the wild-typeR. fredii Nod factor, the majority of theN-methylated factor was unaffected by the FAA II treatment and was observed on plates to co-migrate with the untreated control (Fig. 6). Fatty-acyl amidases play a concerted role in the deacylation of bacterial lipid A (Fig. 1) by selective removal of theN-linked fatty acid chains. The presumed natural substrate for FAA II is generated by degradation of de-O-acylated lipid IVA by FAA I to form 4-phosphoryl-N-β-hydroxymyristoyl-d-glucosaminyl-β-1,6-glucosamine 1-phosphate. Removal of the O-acyl chains and the 2-deoxyketooctulosonic acid residues is presumed to occur prior to this due to the action of other secreted hydrolases (3Rosner M.R. Verret C.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5926-5933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither amidase requires the C-1 or C-4′ phosphate group for substrate recognition, and although FAA II requires a deacylated proximal sugar, the positive charge on the free 2-amino group is not obligatory since 2-N-formylation does not significantly inhibit FAA II (1Verret C.R. Rosner M.R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10228-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For many natural endotoxins, the distal fatty acid amide is β-3-hydroxylated, although the 3-hydroxy group is also unnecessary for substrate recognition by FAA II. Furthermore, the β-1,6-glycosidic linkage is also nonessential, indicating thatN-acyl-d-glucosaminyl monosaccharides are appropriate as alternate substrates. Based on this information, we synthesizedN-palmitoyl-d-[1-14C]glucosamine as a radiolabeled substrate for FAA II. This was prepared by selective acylation of d-[1-14C]glucosamine HCl with palmitoyl chloride and was subsequently used in a novel radioenzyme assay to purify FAA II to homogeneity. The radiolabeled substrate and the depalmitoylated product were effectively separated by solvent partitioning (Table I). Using this enzyme assay, a five-step purification procedure afforded purified FAA II. Partially purified fractions also contained secreted β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, the product of the nagA gene. Because β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A might degrade β-1,4-glucosidic linkages, such as are found in Nod factors, it was important that this activity was removed, particularly since the NagA protein co-migrated with FAA II both on reverse-phase HPLC columns and by SDS gel electrophoresis. To circumvent these problems, we made use of a nagA-deleted strain of Dictyostelium strain Ax-3, HL101 (14Graham T. Zassenhaus H.P. Kaplin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16823-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such that subsequent protein purifications were made from the culture medium of this knockout strain. Consequently and in addition to earlier work, we were able to purify FAA II to homogeneity free from β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A. Interestingly, a large discrepancy was found for the relative molecular mass of FAA II as obtained by SDS gel electrophoresis (66 kDa) or size-exclusion HPLC (33 kDa). This may be attributed to post-translational modification of FAA II particularly if polyanionic groups such as sulfate or methyl phosphate predominate, as has been found for other secreted dictyostelial proteins (21Freeze H.H. Wolgast D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Freeze H.H. Yeh R. Miller A.L. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14874-14879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme mechanism of FAA II has not been studied previously, although the activity is suggestive of either a serine (or cysteine) protease or a zinc-containing metalloprotein. Serine proteases have a bimolecular mechanism that proceeds via a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Thus, for FAA II, this would suggest a two-step displacement involving the sugar moiety followed by the acyl group. By contrast, a one-step metalloprotein mechanism, such as for carboxypeptidase A, would initially give rise to a noncovalent zinc-acyl transition state in which the acyl carbonyl oxygen is coordinated to the zinc atom. Significantly, the protease activity of carboxypeptidase A is selective for the N-linked terminal amino acid, analogous to the sugar moiety of GlcN-C16, but is nonselective with regard to the peptide chain. To test these mechanisms, we assayed FAA II in the presence of various protease inhibitors. FAA II was unaffected by either a serine protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or a sequestering agent (EDTA). The latter was surprising in view of previous work involving the bacterial lipopolysaccharide deacetylase LpxC (15Hyland S.A. Eveland S.S. Anderson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LpxC is a lipid A biosynthetic enzyme that de-N-acetylates the substrate UDP-3-O-acyl-GlcNAc in a reaction analogous to FAA II amide hydrolysis. LpxC is a zinc-containing metalloprotein and has been assigned to a unique class of metalloamidases. Although LpxC fromPseudomonas aeruginosa is sensitive to inhibition by EDTA, the analogous protein from Escherichia coli is unaffected presumably because the zinc atom is buried within the protein (15Hyland S.A. Eveland S.S. Anderson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FAA II is an extracellular protein that most probably requires additional stability to maintain a folded conformation. It too may have an inaccessible buried metallo-center so that enzymatic activity is retained in soil. We have shown that Nod factors are selectively de-N-acylated by the action of the fatty-acyl amidase FAA II. Since non-acylated Nod factors lack nodule-promoting biological activity, deacylation may well have an effect upon the ability of rhizobia to nodulate host plants. Moreover, we propose that Nod factors that are modified by the presence of conjugated double bonds (such as those from Rhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum) or byN-methylation of the nonreducing residue (such as, for example, Rhizobium NGR234) may be altered in their sensitivity to enzymatic de-N-acylation by FAA II. Consequently, these modifications may protect Nod factors against degradation by D. discoideum in soil. Truchet et al. (23Truchet G. Roche P. Lerouge P. Vasse J. Camut S. DeBilly F. Promé J.-C. Denarie J. Nature. 1991; 351: 670-673Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar) have shown that nodulation efficiency is concentration-dependent and that nodule induction does not occur below a threshold Nod factor concentration of ∼10−7m, even though a legume root hair deformation response is observed at far lower concentrations. FAA II de-N-acylation of Nod factors may therefore reduce the efficiency of legume nodulation by reducing the concentration of available biologically active Nod factors. Since Nod factors and FAA II are both secreted by soil-dwelling Rhizobium and Dictyostelium species, respectively, Nod factor degradation may also occur in soils by this mechanism, decreasing the efficiency of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium-legume symbioses. We thank Margreet de Boer and Steve Pueppke for rhizobial strains, William Loomis for nagA-deletedDictyostelium, and Sharon Long and Matt Anderson for criticism and discussion."
