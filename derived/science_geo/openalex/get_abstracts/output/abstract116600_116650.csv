The PPARα subtype mediates the pleiotropic effects of these activators in liver and regulates several target genes involved in fatty acid catabolism. In primary hepatocytes cultured in vitro, the PPARα gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by glucocorticoids. We investigated if this hormonal regulation also occurs in the whole animal in physiological situations leading to increased plasma corticosterone levels in rats. We show here that an immobilization stress is a potent and rapid stimulator of PPARα expression in liver but not in hippocampus. The injection of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone into adult rats produces a similar increase in PPARα expression in liver, whereas the administration of the antiglucocorticoid RU 486 inhibits the stress-dependent stimulation. We conclude that glucocorticoids are major mediators of the stress response. Consistent with this hormonal regulation, hepatic PPARα mRNA and protein levels follow a diurnal rhythm, which parallels that of circulating corticosterone. To test the effects of variations in PPARα expression on PPARα target gene activity, high glucocorticoid-dependent PPARα expression was mimicked in cultured primary hepatocytes. Under these conditions, hormonal stimulation of receptor expression synergizes with receptor activation by WY-14,643 to induce the expression of the PPARα target gene acyl-CoA oxidase. Together, these results show that regulation of the PPARα expression levels efficiently modulates PPAR activator signaling and thus may affect downstream metabolic pathways involved in lipid homeostasis.

The hormonal regulation of the ob gene could affect adiposity. To investigate this point, the effect of insulin on ob gene expression was examined in cells of the 3T3-F442A preadipocyte clonal line. ob mRNA is absent from exponentially growing, undifferentiated cells as well as from confluent preadipose cells. Terminal differentiation of preadipose to adipose cells leads to the expression of ob mRNA detected by a sensitive and quantitative ribonuclease protection assay. In adipose cells, the level of ob mRNA is sensitive to insulin in the nanomolar range of concentrations with an increase from an average of 1 copy to 5-10 copies/cell. The effect of insulin was fully reversible and takes place primarily at a transcriptional level. The ob mRNA shows a rapid turnover, with a half-life of approximately 2 h in the absence or presence of insulin. The level of secreted Ob protein is also regulated by insulin. These results indicate that the ob gene is expressed in mature fat cells only and support the possibility that insulin is an important regulator of ob gene expression.

The majority of IGF-I-stimulated migration in both cell types was due to chemotaxis. MCF-7 cells failed to migrate on membranes coated with gelatin or fibronectin and migrated only in small numbers on laminin. In contrast, when vitronectin- or type IV collagen-coated membranes were used, the MCF-7 cells migrated in large numbers specifically in response to IGF-I but not to 10% fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, or platelet derived growth factor-BB. An IGF-I receptor-blocking antibody inhibited IGF-I-stimulated migration in both cell types. In addition, a blocking antibody to the αvβ5 integrin (a vitronectin receptor) inhibited migration of MCF-7 cells in response to IGF-I through vitronectin but not through type IV collagen. Similarly, blocking antibodies specific for α2 and β1 integrins significantly inhibited migration of both cell types through type IV collagen-coated membranes but not through vitronectin-coated membranes. We conclude that: 1) IGF-I stimulates migration of these two cell types through the IGF-I receptor; 2) interaction of vitronectin with the αvβ5 integrin or collagen with the α2β1 integrin is necessary for the complete IGF-I response in MCF-7 cells, and 3) because migration represents an in vitro model for metastatic spread, integrins, extracellular matrix proteins, and IGF-I may play coordinated roles in the metastasis of breast cancer in vivo.

As a step toward understanding the induction mechanisms, we isolated the human ATF3 gene and analyzed its genome organization and 5′-flanking region. We found that the human ATF3 mRNA is derived from four exons distributed over 15 kilobases. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region revealed a consensus TATA box and a number of transcription factor binding sites including the AP-1, ATF/CRE, NF-κB, E2F, and Myc/Max binding sites. As another approach to understanding the mechanisms by which the ATF3 gene is induced by stress signals, we studied the regulation of the ATF3 gene in tissue culture cells by anisomycin, an approach that has been used to study the stress responses in tissue culture cells. We showed that anisomycin at a low concentration activates the ATF3 promoter and stabilizes the ATF3 mRNA. Significantly, co-transfection of DNAs expressing ATF2 and c-Jun activates the ATF3 promoter. A possible mechanism implicating the C-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) stress-inducible signaling pathway in the induction of the ATF3 gene is discussed.

A., and Montminy, M. R.(1989) Cell 59, 675-680). Ser-133 phosphorylation enhances CREB activity by promoting interaction with a 265-kDa CREB binding protein referred to as CBP (Arias, J., Alberts, A., Brindle, P., Claret, F., Smeal, T., Karin, M., Feramisco, J., and Montminy, M.(1994) Nature 370, 226-228; Chrivia, J.

The mechanism by which CBP in turn mediates induction of cAMP-responsive genes is unknown but is thought to involve recruitment of basal transcription factors to the promoter. Here we demonstrate that CBP associates specifically with RNA polymerase II in HeLa nuclear extracts. This association in turn permits RNA polymerase II to be recruited to CREB in a phospho-(Ser-133)-dependent manner.

INTRODUCTIONA number of hormones and growth factors stimulate the expression of target genes by inducing the reversible phosphorylation of specific transcription factors(4.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation has been shown to regulate a number of nuclear factors by inducing their nuclear targeting or DNA binding activities, the cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB belongs to a group whose transactivation potential is affected(1.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 5.Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this regard, Chrivia et al.(3.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) have characterized a nuclear CREB binding protein, termed CBP, which binds to CREB in a phospho-(Ser-133)-dependent manner. The requirement for CBP in mediating cAMP-dependent transcription has been demonstrated by cellular microinjection experiments in which CBP antisera blocked transcriptional induction by cAMP (2.Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and by transient transfection experiments in which overexpression of CBP could potentiate CREB activity in response to agonist(2.Arias J.

Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Here we examine the mechanism by which CBP interacts with the transcriptional apparatus to induce target gene expression in response to hormonal stimulation. Our results suggest that CBP is constitutively associated with specific components of the transcriptional apparatus and that this association in turn permits recruitment of certain basal factors to promoters of cAMP-responsive genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Nuclear Extracts and in Vitro Transcription AssaysNuclear extract preparations and in vitro transcription assays were carried out as described previously(5.Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of PKA ( 1The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase ACREcAMP-responsive elementaaamino acidsGSTglutathione S-transferaseKIDkinase-inducible domain.) on in vitro transcription reactions, purified recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (1 μg) (kindly provided by S. Taylor) was added to HeLa nuclear extracts during transcription reactions. CREB activity was monitored with an adenovirus major late promoter template containing three cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) from the rat somatostatin promoter (−56 to −32). Affinity-purified antisera were added to in vitro transcription assays as reported(5.Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation AssaysFor immunoprecipitation assays, HeLa nuclear extract (100 μg) was precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4°C. Precleared extract was incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 4°C. To detect α RNA polymerase II, a monoclonal antiserum, raised against a C-terminal domain polypeptide of the large subunit (Promega), was used. Antibody complexes were recovered by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with buffer (B100) containing 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in 2 × SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Glutathione-Sepharose ChromatographyA CREB cDNA fragment encoding the kinase-inducible domain (aa 88-160) was fused in-frame to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) cDNA in the pGEX-2T plasmid (Promega). GST•KID fusion protein was expressed, and purification from BL21 Escherichia coli was carried out as described previously(3.Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). GST•KID fusion protein was phosphorylated at Ser-133 using purified PKA catalytic subunit as described previously(7.Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). For GST affinity chromatography, HeLa extracts (100 μg) were added to glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) containing GST•KID or GST phospho-(Ser-133)•KID polypeptides and co-incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with B100 buffer (see above) and then evaluated by Western blot analysis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPreliminary evidence suggesting that CBP migrates as a high molecular mass complex of 2000 kDa during gel filtration chromatography (not shown) prompted us to examine whether CBP might stimulate cAMP-responsive genes by virtue of its association with specific basal transcription factors. When purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by phosphocellulose chromatography (Fig. 1, top), CBP was detected predominantly in the 0.3 M KCl “B” fraction, which also contained RNA polymerase II. Following subsequent fractionation over a Mono-S ion exchange resin (Fig. 1, bottom), CBP again eluted with peak fractions of RNA polymerase II. In contrast to the relatively sharp elution profile for CBP, however, RNA polymerase II appeared to be more broadly distributed, indicating that only a fraction of RNA polymerase II may be associated with CBP. By contrast with RNA polymerase II, CBP did not co-elute from the Mono-S column with TFIIB, a basal factor that has been reported to interact with CBP in GST pull-down assays(6.Kwok R. Lundblad J. Chrivia J. Richards J. Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar).To test whether CBP in fact associates with RNA polymerase II, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies with two distinct anti-CBP antisera directed against aa 1-100(5729) and aa 455-679(5614) of the protein (Fig. 2A). Although neither antiserum was capable of recognizing purified RNA polymerase II directly by Western blot or immunoprecipitation assay (not shown), the large subunit of RNA polymerase II was detected in immunoprecipitates of HeLa extracts with both antisera under non-denaturing conditions. In agreement with the broad elution profile of RNA polymerase II following Mono-S chromatography, only a limited fraction (10-20%) of the RNA polymerase II large subunit appeared to be associated with CBP in HeLa extracts. By contrast with RNA polymerase II, other basal transcription factors such as TBP and TFIIB did not appear to associate detectably with CBP in co-fractionation or co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1), indicating that the CBP-RNA polymerase II interaction was indeed specific. In this regard, RNA polymerase II was found to co-precipitate with CBP even at high concentrations of KCl (0.8 M), suggesting that this complex was also stable.Figure 2:CBP is associated with RNA polymerase II in HeLa nuclear extracts.

Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether CBP mediates the PKA-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II to this region (Fig. 2B). Following affinity chromatography of crude HeLa nuclear extracts over glutathione-Sepharose resin containing either GST•KID or GST-phospho-(Ser-133)•KID fusion proteins, CBP was specifically bound to phospho-(Ser-133)•KID resin. Similarly, RNA polymerase II was detected on resins containing phospho-(Ser-133)•KID but not unphosphorylated KID peptide. As purified RNA polymerase II was unable to bind to phospho-(Ser-133)•KID directly (not shown), these results indicate that RNA polymerase II is recruited to phospho-(Ser-133)•KID via CBP.To test whether PKA simulates formation of a heteromeric complex consisting of phospho-(Ser-133) CREB•CBP•RNA polymerase II, as predicted by GST affinity chromatography experiments, we performed immunoprecipitation assays on crude HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). Using a CREB antiserum (253) that can recognize the CREB•CBP complex(8.Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we detected CBP in immunoprecipitates from PKA-treated but not untreated HeLa nuclear extracts. Similarly, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II was recovered specifically from immunoprecipitates of PKA-treated HeLa extracts, demonstrating that PKA induces formation of a phospho(Ser-133) CREB•CBP•RNA polymerase II complex.Figure 3:PKA stimulates formation of a phospho-(Ser-133) CREB-CBP-RNA polymerase II (POLII) heteromeric complex in HeLa nuclear extracts.

Addition of PKA to nuclear extracts induced transcription from a cAMP-responsive template containing three consensus cAMP-responsive elements (3 × CRE) approximately 4-fold. But PKA treatment had no effect on an internal control adenovirus major late promoter template lacking CRE sites. Addition of affinity-purified CBP antiserum, which blocks recruitment of the CBP•RNA polymerase II complex to CREB(2.Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), specifically inhibited PKA-inducible transcription from the 3 × CRE template. Unrelated antiserum (anti-corticotropin-releasing factor binding protein) had no effect on PKA induction of the 3 × CRE template, however, demonstrating that the inhibition by anti-CBP antiserum was indeed specific.Figure 4:The CBP-RNA polymerase II complex is required for transcriptional induction by PKA in vitro.

Maldonado and D. Reinberg, personal communication.) suggesting that CBP is contained within purified preparations of a mammalian RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. In contrast to results of Kwok et al.(6.Kwok R. Lundblad J. Chrivia J. Richards J. Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), TFIIB did not appear to associate detectably with CBP in HeLa extracts. These results would suggest that TFIIB may interact with CBP only after being recruited to the promoter.Our results do not address whether CBP interacts directly with RNA polymerase II. In preliminary GST pull-down assays, purified recombinant CBP polypeptides are unable to associate directly with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, ( 3B. L. Kee and M. Montminy, unpublished observations.) suggesting that the interaction between CBP and RNA polymerase II may either require post-translational modification (i.e. phosphorylation) or may involve other proteins within the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex.In a previous study, we found that the activity of purified phospho-(Ser-133) CREB in cell-free transcription assays was indistinguishable from that of unphosphorylated CREB(9.Alberts A. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M. Feramisco J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7623-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we found the addition of PKA to HeLa nuclear extracts during the transcription reaction was critical for Ser-133 phosphorylation-dependent activity. These results are consistent with recent findings that other PKA-dependent events in addition to CREB phosphorylation are required for transcriptional induction by cAMP in vivo(8.Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this regard, CBP contains a consensus PKA phosphorylation site at Ser-1772, and it is tempting to speculate that the interaction between CBP and RNA polymerase II may itself be regulated by CBP phosphorylation. In yeast, interaction between an upstream activator (GAL4) and a component of the yeast RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (GAL11) is sufficient for transcriptional induction(10.Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The importance of CBP in mediating not only cAMP but also mitogen-inducible transcription (2.Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) indicates that CBP may similarly provide contact points for recruitment of mammalian RNA polymerase II holoenzyme by multiple signal-dependent activators. INTRODUCTIONA number of hormones and growth factors stimulate the expression of target genes by inducing the reversible phosphorylation of specific transcription factors(4.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation has been shown to regulate a number of nuclear factors by inducing their nuclear targeting or DNA binding activities, the cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB belongs to a group whose transactivation potential is affected(1.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 5.Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) have characterized a nuclear CREB binding protein, termed CBP, which binds to CREB in a phospho-(Ser-133)-dependent manner. The requirement for CBP in mediating cAMP-dependent transcription has been demonstrated by cellular microinjection experiments in which CBP antisera blocked transcriptional induction by cAMP (2.Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and by transient transfection experiments in which overexpression of CBP could potentiate CREB activity in response to agonist(2.Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 6.Kwok R. Lundblad J. Chrivia J. Richards J. Bachinger H. Brennan R. Roberts S. Green M. Goodman R. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Here we examine the mechanism by which CBP interacts with the transcriptional apparatus to induce target gene expression in response to hormonal stimulation. Our results suggest that CBP is constitutively associated with specific components of the transcriptional apparatus and that this association in turn permits recruitment of certain basal factors to promoters of cAMP-responsive genes."

Growing evidence that cadherins and catenins are subjected to genetic alterations in carcinogenesis makes it especially important to understand protein-protein interactions within the cadherin-catenin complex. Here we report the identification and analysis of the α-catenin binding site in plakoglobin (γ-catenin). Using N- and C-terminal truncations of plakoglobin, we identified a domain of 29 amino acids necessary and sufficient for binding α-catenin. The α-catenin binding site is fully encoded within exon 3 of plakoglobin but only partially represented in Armadillo repeat 1. This suggests that exons rather than individual Arm repeats encode functional domains of plakoglobin. Site-directed mutagenesis identified residues in the α-catenin binding site indispensable for binding in vitro. Analogous mutations in β-catenin and Armadillo had identical effects. Our results indicate that single amino acid mutations in the α-catenin binding site of homologs of Armadillo could prevent a stable association with α-catenin, thus affecting cadherin-mediated adhesion.

https://openalex.org/W2052478584,"We have identified an open reading frame on chromosome XI of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as encoding a protein with phospholipase D (PLD) activity. We have named this open reading frame, PLD1, and show that yeast bearing a disruption in this gene are unable to catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. PLD1 encodes a hypothetical protein of 1683 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 195 kDa. Yeast bearing disruptions at the PLD1 locus are morphologically normal and grow vegetatively like wild-type cells. In contrast, homozygous Δpld1 diploid cells are unable to sporulate and do not produce asci under conditions that induce meiosis and sporulation in wild-type cells.

Phospholipase D activity has been identified in a wide variety of cell types and organisms from bacteria(1.Hodgsom A.L.M. Bird P. Nisbet I.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1256-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yeast(2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), plants(3.Wang X.

PLD acts to catalyze the hydrolysis of certain phospholipids, i.e. catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineARFADP-ribosylation factorC6-NBD-PC1-palmitoyl-2-[6-N-(7-nitrobenzo-2-o-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-phosphatidylcholineORFopen reading framePAphosphatidic acidPCphosphatidylcholinePIphosphoinositidePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePLDphospholipase Dkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s).) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline.

Two distinct activation requirements for mammalian PLD have been described: one type of enzymatic activity is GTP- and ARF-dependent, while another is oleate-dependent(13.Massenburg D. Han J-S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, both types of enzymatic activities can be stimulated by PIP2(13.Massenburg D. Han J-S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 14.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies have shown that PIP2 biosynthesis, itself, is a direct prerequisite for PLD activation(15.Pertile P. Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5130-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which suggests that PIP2 is a co-factor of PLD. Recent work has implicated the activation of both phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism and ARF as necessary steps for the intracellular trafficking of membrane-bound compartments (reviewed in (16.Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 1045-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 17.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C.

Since PLD activity in mammals may be activated by either ARF or PIP2, it is intriguing to think that PLD could play an important role in mediating membrane trafficking. Yet, despite the wealth of information concerning the biochemical properties of PLD, little is known about the structural and molecular properties of the enzyme(s), while even less is known about its biological role. To date, the only published sequence for a protein from eukaryotes having PC-specific PLD activity is from plants(3.Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its role in either cell signaling or membrane trafficking remains virtually unknown. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a gene encoding a PLD from yeast. We show that the yeast enzyme is homologous to plant PLD and shares some homology with a bacterial phosphatidyltransferase. Disruption of the PLD1 gene in yeast has no effects upon cell growth and morphology during vegetative growth but is likely to be required for meiosis and sporulation. PIP2 was obtained from Sigma. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[6-N-(7-nitrobenzo-2-o-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-phosphatidylcholine (C6-NBD-PC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. DNA restriction endonucleases, Taq polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were used as recommended by the suppliers (Boehringer Mannheim, MBI Fermentas). Molecular cloning techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast were maintained on standard growth media containing 2% glucose as a carbon source. Amino acid-rich medium (YPD (yeast extract and Bactopeptone containing 2% dextrose)) and YP (yeast extract and Bactopeptone), synthetic minimal medium (SC), and SC drop-out medium, lacking an essential amino acid or nucleotide base, were used. Drop-out medium was used to maintain plasmid selection. Media were prepared according to Rose et al.(20.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). SC complete and drop-out media consisted of 0.7% yeast nitrogen base supplemented with the appropriate auxotrophic requirements. Other growth media included: YPA (YP containing 0.05% glucose and 2% potassium acetate); YPEG (YP containing 2% ethanol and 2% glycerol); and YPG (YP containing 3.5% galactose). Standard methods were used for the introduction of DNA into the various yeast strains, the preparation of genomic DNA, and for tetrad dissection (20.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain XL-1 blue was used for plasmid transformations and plasmid DNA preparations. Disruptions of PLD1 were made in wild-type strains JC1 (Matα ade8 can1 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3) (21.Field J. Vojtek A. Ballester R. Bolger G. Colicelli J. Ferguson K. Gerst J. Kataoka T. Michaeli T. Powers S. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Wieland I. Wheland B. Wigler M. Cell. 1990; 61: 319-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and JC2 (Mata ade8 can1 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3). Δpld1 strains created included: PLDΔ-1 (Matα ade8 can1 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 Δpld1::HIS3); PLDΔ-2 (Mata ade8 can1 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 Δpld1::HIS3); PLDΔFS-1 (Matα ade8 can1 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 Δpld1::HIS3); and PLDΔFS-2 (Mata ade8 can1 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 Δpld1::HIS3). Cosmid pEKGO13, which contains a genomic fragment from chromosome XI in vector pWE15, was a gift from A. Urrestarazu (Universite Libre de Bruxelles). This cosmid contains ∼36 kb, which maps to the small arm of chromosome XI and encompasses mapped genes spo14 and tif1. Disruption constructs for PLD1 were created by subcloning a 5.1-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment containing the coding region of PLD1 beginning at bp 837 and ending at bp +912 downstream of the termination codon into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pUC118 to yield pPLD837-5964. This plasmid was then digested with the SalI endonuclease to release an 1153-bp fragment (bp 3237-4390), which is thought to encode part of the catalytic domain of Pld1 (see Fig. 1, homology boxes 6 and 7) and was blunt-ended using standard techniques. A blunt-ended BamHI-cut 1.7-kb fragment encoding the HIS3 auxotrophic marker was then subcloned in to yield plasmid pPLD::HIS3. To create a frameshift mutation near the initiation codon of Pld1, plasmid pΔPLD::HIS3 was digested with SacI (bp 871), filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and religated to yield a frameshift disruption plasmid, pΔPLDFS::HIS3. All plasmids were verified by restriction mapping. To create disruptions of PLD1 in yeast, plasmids pΔPLD::HIS3 and pΔPLDFS::HIS3 were digested with EcoRI and SphI to release fragments containing the disrupted PLD1 gene. These were transformed into yeast cells using standard procedures to create the strains described above. All disruptions were verified by Southern analysis. Total cell lysates from yeast grown at log phase were prepared as described previously(22.Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the lysis buffer contained 35 mM HEPES pH 7.0, with no added detergent. Lysates were cleared by low speed centrifugation (16,000 × g for 0.25 min) to remove nuclei and cell wall debris. Cell lysates were flash frozen and stored at −70°C. The hydrolysis of C6-NBD-PC in lysates was monitored by the production of PA, essentially as described by Danin et al. (23.Danin M. Chalifa V. Mohn H. Schmidt U-S. Liscovitch M. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 118: 14-24Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 0.3 mg/ml protein, 35 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM C6-NBD-PC, and 4 mol % PIP2. Reaction volume was 120 μl, and the reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Transphosphatidylation assays contained between 0 and 500 mM primary alcohol as substrate. The assays were terminated by chloroform/methanol/HCl extraction (100:100;0.6), and the phospholipid products were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), as described(23.Danin M. Chalifa V. Mohn H. Schmidt U-S. Liscovitch M. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 118: 14-24Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fluorescent phospholipids were visualized by UV illumination, scraped from TLC plates, methanol-extracted, and counted in a fluorimeter (excitation at 468 nm; emission at 520 nm). Results are expressed as the average of two duplicate samples measured in arbitrary fluorescence units. Recent identification of a PC-specific PLD from plants allowed us to screen the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base for sequences having direct homology. Interestingly, an ORF from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a hypothetical protein of 1683 amino acids was found to have significant homology to certain regions of plant PLD when searched using the BLAST algorithmic program (24.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). This ORF was identified by the yeast genome sequencing project (ORF YKR031c) and maps to the short arm of chromosome XI by the GCN3-DAL80 intergenic region and near the previously mapped spo14 and tif1 genes. Sequence comparison between the proteins showed that they had low overall homology. However, at least eight specific regions of 11-42 amino acids in length were found to be highly homologous, ranging from 50 to 76% (Fig. 1). The percentage of shared residues in these regions varied between 20 and 62% (Fig. 1). One region, in particular, was also identified as having homology to a phosphatidylserine synthase from bacteria (Fig. 1, homology box 7). Thus, ORF YKR031c seemed a likely candidate for a yeast protein having PLD activity and was tentatively renamed PLD1. In order to verify that this ORF encodes a yeast PLD homolog, we constructed haploid and diploid yeast strains lacking PLD1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Yeast-bearing disruptions in PLD1 were found to be morphologically normal and grew at rates similar to wild-type cells grown under vegetative conditions (data not shown). Moreover, these Δpld1 cells were found to be temperature-resistant like wild-type cells (data not shown). In order to verify that Δpld1 cells lack PLD activity, we performed PLD assays in vitro on yeast cell lysates, using the fluorescent PC analog, C6-NBD-PC, as substrate. Wild-type cells of either mating type were found to have significant levels of PLD activity, as judged by PA production (Fig. 2). In contrast, Δpld1 cells were found to have no detectable PLD activity, indicating that the disruption of PLD1 destroys the protein responsible for PLD function. Thus, the PLD1 gene product (Pld1) is likely to confer PLD-like activity. A previous study has characterized biochemically PLD activity in yeast(2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This activity localizes primarily to membrane fractions and was found to be both PC-specific and capable of utilizing short chain alcohols in the transphosphatidylation reaction(2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rank order of straight and branched chain alcohols in the transphosphatidylation reaction was similar to that already described for mammalian cell PLDs. Finally, it was shown that maximal PLD activity in yeast could be induced in a cycloheximide-independent manner by shifting cells to sporulation-inducing medium, which contains acetate(2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To verify that the activity of the PLD1 gene product is similar to that described previously, we have characterized PLD activity in wild-type and Δpld1 cells (Fig. 3). We first examined the effect of primary alcohol addition upon PA production and alcohol transphosphatidylation in haploid cells. We found that an increase in alcohol chain length resulted in a decrease in the overall activity of the enzyme, which was characterized by both a decrease in PA formation and an increase in phosphatidyl alcohol production (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined the effect of various agents and carbon sources upon PLD activity. The addition of chelators of divalent metal cations or oleate resulted in a significant decrease in PLD activity (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the omission of PIP2 led to a substantial decrease (>65%) in activity (Fig. 3A). Thus, the PLD activity examined here is highly similar to that described previously (2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and is similar to the oleate-independent PLD from mammals(13.Massenburg D. Han J-S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast, growing cells in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources, such as acetate and ethanol/glycerol, or in the presence of galactose resulted in an increase in PLD activity over cells maintained continually in glucose. Thus, the yeast enzyme may be under partial glucose-repressible control (Fig. 3B). Since yeast PLD is stimulated in the presence of acetate-containing medium (this study and (2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), we examined whether PLD activity is increased in homozygous Δpld1::HIS3/Δpld1::HIS3 and heterozygous Δpld1::HIS3/PLD1 cells shifted from glucose-containing medium to acetate-containing medium (sporulation conditions). Cells bearing homozygous disruptions in PLD1 showed little basal activity when grown in glucose-containing medium or when shifted to acetate-containing medium. In contrast, heterozygous Δpld1::HIS3/PLD1 diploid cells showed a strong time-dependent induction of PLD activity that peaked within 2 h of shifting the cells to acetate-containing medium (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Thus, PLD activity is induced under sporulation conditions in a PLD1-dependent fashion. The stimulation of PLD activity upon transfer to acetate-containing medium suggested to us that a functional PLD might be required for sporulation in yeast. Indeed, diploid yeast bearing homozygous disruptions of PLD1 (Δpld1::HIS3/ Δpld1::HIS3) were found to be unable to undergo sporulation to yield asci under conditions by which wild-type cells are known to sporulate (data not shown). Thus, there appears to be a requirement for PLD1 in the sporulation of yeast cells. We have identified a yeast protein that confers PLD activity to yeast cell lysates. The gene encoding this activity, PLD1, localizes to the GCN3-DAL80 intergenic region of the short arm of chromosome XI and is the region that the spo14 sporulation mutation maps to. Our results indicate that PLD1 encodes a PC-hydrolyzing PLD that confers the significant, if not total proportion, of PLD catalytic activity in yeast cells. Moreover, this activity is stimulated during sporulation conditions and is similar in requirements to that described previously by Ella et al. (2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that yeast Pld1 is stimulated by PIP2 like mammalian PLD(14.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the true role of PLD1 is not yet known, strong evidence links PLD function to meiosis and sporulation in yeast cells. First, PLD1 activity is stimulated during the shift to sporulation-inducing medium (this study and (2.Ella K.M. Dolan J.W. Meier K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Second, Δpld1 cells fail to undergo sporulation. Third, while this manuscript was in preparation, the sequence of SPO14 was deposited into the NCBI data base (accession number L46807) and although it was not identified as having PLD activity, we and others have now identified it as being allelic to PLD1. ( 2This study and J. Engebrecht, personal communication.) Thus, PLD activity appears necessary for yeast cells to complete the meiotic cycle. When diploid yeast are deprived of nitrogen and fermentable carbon sources they enter a meiotic cycle that leads to the development of four haploid nuclei. These nuclei are later enveloped by a membranous spore wall that arises from the coalescence of vesicles at the spindle pole (reviewed in (25.Byers B. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 59-96Google Scholar)). The spore wall consists of four layers, including at least two spore-specific layers that are induced only during the meiotic cycle. SPO14 was previously identified as a sporulation-specific gene that is required for the commitment to meiotic development as well as for meiotic segregation and spore formation(26.Honigsberg S.M. Conicella C. Esposito R.E. Genetics. 1992; 130: 703-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells bearing the spo14 mutation are defective in sporulation but can return to mitotic division even from the late stages (i.e. tetraploid stage) of meiotic development(27.Honigsberg S.M. Esposito R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6559-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In all likelihood, then, Spo14/Pld1 may be a critical component of the final stage of the meiotic cycle, spore wall assembly. Converging lines of evidence have implicated PLD function with PI metabolism and membrane trafficking in mammals(17.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Activation of PLD by ARF, which itself acts to recruit cytosolic coat proteins to newly forming vesicles in the Golgi (reviewed in (18.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar)), may be an important mechanism for generating PA and altering the lipid environment on membranes destined to undergo fusion(17.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, PLD activation may also lead to PIP2 production(17.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which could have profound effects upon both PI metabolism and signaling via PI-mediated signaling cascades, in addition to affecting the lipid environment of membranes. Although this work is still in its infancy, yeast may prove to be an ideal system in which to assay the role of PLD upon PI metabolism, as well as in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. Interestingly, our work already demonstrates that Pld1 activity is not necessary for vegetative cell growth, which implies that membrane trafficking processes like secretion are not prominently affected. Thus, we predict that Pld1 function is not likely to be required for the anterograde trafficking of secreted essential proteins, although it could play a role in other trafficking steps.

https://openalex.org/W2064693369,"We have investigated the role of N-myristoylation in the activation of bovine ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). We previously showed that myristoylation allows some spontaneous GDP-to-GTP exchange to occur on ARF1 at physiological Mg2+ levels in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (Franco, M., Chardin, P., Chabre, M., and Paris, S.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1337-1341). Here, we report that this basal nucleotide exchange can be accelerated (by up to 5-fold) by addition of a soluble fraction obtained from bovine retinas. This acceleration is totally abolished by brefeldin A (IC50 = 2 μM) and by trypsin treatment of the retinal extract, as expected for an ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. To accelerate GDP release from ARF1, this soluble exchange factor absolutely requires myristoylation of ARF1 and the presence of phospholipid vesicles. The retinal extract also stimulates guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) release from ARF1 in the presence of phospholipids, but in this case myristoylation of ARF is not required. These observations, together with our previous findings that both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated forms of ARFGTPγS but only the myristoylated form of ARFGDP bind to membrane phospholipids, suggest that (i) the retinal exchange factor acts only on membrane-bound ARF, (ii) the myristate is not involved in the protein-protein interaction between ARF1 and the exchange factor, and (iii) N-myristoylation facilitates both spontaneous and catalyzed GDP-to-GTP exchange on ARF1 simply by facilitating the binding of ARFGDP to membrane phospholipids. We have investigated the role of N-myristoylation in the activation of bovine ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). We previously showed that myristoylation allows some spontaneous GDP-to-GTP exchange to occur on ARF1 at physiological Mg2+ levels in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (Franco, M., Chardin, P., Chabre, M., and Paris, S.(1995) J.

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) 1The abbreviations used are: ARFADP-ribosylation factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGTPγS5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateBFAbrefeldin AROSrod outer segmentsRIEretinal isotonic extract. are a family of small (∼20 kDa) guanine nucleotide binding proteins, originally identified as cofactors of cholera toxin and more recently recognized as essential participants in intracellular vesicular transport(1.Moss J.

All ARFs contain the amino-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence and are believed to be myristoylated in vivo(5.Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The functions of ARFs in membrane traffic are linked to their guanine nucleotide-dependent interactions with membranes. Myristoylation is also crucial for these interactions, but the precise mechanism for the attachment of ARF to membranes is still unclear. According to the model initially proposed by Serafini et al.(6.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and at present most commonly accepted, the GDP-bound form of ARF is cytosolic; upon interaction with a specific nucleotide exchange protein, described as membrane-bound by some authors(7.Donaldson J.G.

A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), ARFGDP is converted to ARFGTP. This conversion would promote a conformational change of the amino terminus, allowing exposure of the myristoyl group and its insertion into membranes. This model, referred to as “myristoyl-GTP switch” by analogy with the Ca2+-myristoyl switch model proposed for recoverin(12.Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), therefore implies that myristoylation of ARF is not necessary for its interaction with the nucleotide exchange enzyme (9.Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but is required after the exchange reaction for the stable association of ARFGTP with membranes. Our recent observations do not support this model. First, we found that nonmyristoylated ARFGTPγS strongly binds to phospholipid vesicles(14.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that a protein-lipid interaction must also be involved in the association of ARFGTP with membranes rather than just a simple lipid-lipid interaction. Second, by comparing the properties of nonmyristoylated ARF1 (rARF1) to those of myristoylated ARF1 (myr-rARF1) both produced in Escherichia coli, we found that myr-ARFGDP partially binds to phospholipid membranes while rARFGDP is totally water soluble(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We therefore proposed that myr-ARFGDP is loosely attached to membranes by the myristate chain, whereas myr-ARFGTP is strongly bound to phospholipids via both the fatty acid and hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions between a protein domain and the membrane bilayer. In other words, we propose that nucleotide exchange increases the affinity of ARF for phospholipids through a “protein switch” rather than a “myristoyl switch.” ADP-ribosylation factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate brefeldin A rod outer segments retinal isotonic extract. Moreover, we have reported that interaction of myr-ARFGDP with phospholipids allows a significant spontaneous nucleotide exchange at physiological (mM) levels of Mg2+, conditions under which GDP release from rARFGDP is undetectable(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here, we report that a soluble ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange activity can be obtained from bovine retinas and that stimulation of GDP release from ARF1 by this activity also requires myristoylation of ARF1 and the presence of phospholipids. In addition, we present evidence that the myristate is not necessary for the protein-protein interaction between ARF and the exchange factor but simply facilitates the binding of ARFGDP to the phospholipids, where it can interact with the exchange factor. Nucleotides were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Azolectin, brefeldin A, trypsin (type XIII), and lima bean trypsin inhibitor (type II-1) were obtained from Sigma. [35S]GTPγS was from DuPont NEN, and [3H]GDP was from Amersham. Bovine rARF1 was expressed in E. coli and purified by a single QAE-Sepharose chromatography as described previously(14.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). myr-rARF1 was prepared from bacteria coexpressing yeast N-myristoyltransferase (16.Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) by a different procedure including a precipitation at 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate and sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and MonoS columns(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As judged by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE, both ARF preparations were >95% pure, and the contamination of myr-rARF1 by the nonmyristoylated species was <20%. Both rARF1 and myr-rARF1 were obtained in a GDP-bound form, as demonstrated by nucleotide analysis. Bovine retinal ROS were prepared under dim red light as described by Kühn (17.Kühn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and stored as pellets at −80°C. After thawing, a pellet of ROS was resuspended under dim red light in isotonic buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) at a concentration of 40 μM rhodopsin and homogenized in a Teflon glass tissue grinder, yielding an homogeneous suspension of permeabilized ROS fragments. Half of this suspension was used as “total ROS.” The other half was diluted to 10 μM rhodopsin in the same buffer and centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (5 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM MgCl2) at 10 μM rhodopsin, resedimented, and washed again once with hypotonic buffer and once with isotonic buffer. The last pellet was resuspended at 40 μM rhodopsin in isotonic buffer and was used as “washed ROS membranes.” The following operations were performed under room light. rARF1GDP or myr-rARF1GDP (3 μM) was incubated with total ROS or washed ROS membranes (35 μM rhodopsin) at 1 mM Mg2+ in the presence of 100 μM GDP or GTPγS. After 1 h at 30°C, the membranes were sedimented and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. In method I, thawed pellets of ROS were resuspended at 25 μM rhodopsin in an isotonic buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM iodoacetamide, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 mM β-glycerophosphate). The suspension was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 20 min and concentrated 25-30-fold on a Centricon-10 (Amicon), to a final protein concentration of ∼3 mg/ml. This preparation was kept at 4°C. In method II, bovine retinas were shaken in a buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 45% (w/v) sucrose and centrifuged at 20,000 × g as described for the preparation of bovine ROS(18.Bigay J. Chabre M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The floating ROS were harvested, diluted 2.5-fold in the same buffer without sucrose, and sedimented at 6,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was saved, diluted 3-fold in an isotonic buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) to further dilute the residual sucrose, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was precipitated at 40% saturation of ammonium sulfate and centrifuged again at 14,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same isotonic buffer, dialyzed against this buffer, and clarified by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The final supernatant (2-3 mg of protein/ml) was divided into small aliquots and stored at −70°C. RIE, prepared by method I above, was incubated with 100 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 37°C, followed by 1 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min at 37°C. Mock treatment was performed by adding trypsin and trypsin inhibitor to the same concentrations from a mixture of the two that had been incubated for 10 min at 37°C and then incubating the RIE sample for 25 min at 37°C. Large unilamellar vesicles of azolectin (soybean lipids) were prepared as described (14.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rARF1GDP or myr-rARF1GDP (1-2 μM) was incubated at 37°C in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM [35S]GTPγS (∼1000 cpm/pmol), 1 mM ATP (to prevent the degradation of GTPγS by RIE), and 1.5 mg/ml phospholipid vesicles, with RIE at a final concentration of 0.6 mg of protein/ml or an equal volume of the corresponding isotonic buffer, and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mM free Mg2+. Samples of 50 μl were diluted into 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and filtered on 25-mm BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of the same buffer, dried, and counted. rARF1GDP or myr-rARF1GDP (∼1 μM) was first incubated with 10 μM [3H]GDP (∼1000 dpm/pmol) or 10 μM [35S]GTPγS (∼1000 cpm/pmol) in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, with or without 1.5 mg/ml phospholipid vesicles, and MgCl2± EDTA as indicated. When maximal loading was attained, the concentration of free Mg2+ was raised to 1 mM, and nucleotide dissociation was monitored as a loss of protein-bound radiolabel following addition of 1 mM GDP or GTPγS and RIE (0.4-0.6 mg of protein/ml) or the corresponding buffer. All concentrations are given as final in the dissociation medium. Our recent studies of the interaction between ARF1 and transducin subunits on retinal ROS membranes (19.Franco M. Paris S. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) led us to examine the binding of myr-rARF1 to ROS membranes in the presence of an excess of GDP or GTPγS. Fig. 1A shows that the binding of myr-rARF1 to ROS membranes was enhanced in the presence of GTPγS, as expected if some myr-rARF1GTPγS was formed during the incubation and if the GTPγS-bound form of myr-rARF1 interacted more strongly with ROS membranes than the GDP-bound form, as was observed with artificial phospholipid vesicles(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the GTPγS-dependent binding of myr-rARF1 to ROS membranes was found to be greater when a suspension of freeze-thawed ROS fragments (“total ROS”) was used rather than thoroughly washed ROS membranes (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the binding of myr-rARF1GDP did not decrease upon washing of the membranes (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Under the same conditions (1 mM Mg2+), nonmyristoylated rARF1 did not bind significantly to ROS membranes in the presence of either GDP or GTPγS, whether the membranes were washed or not (Fig. 1A, lanes 5-8), suggesting that no nucleotide exchange occurred on rARF1 in either condition. It was possible to restore a strong binding of myr-rARF1 to washed ROS membranes in the presence of GTPγS by addition of the soluble fraction resulting from the first isotonic wash (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3), while reconstitution with the subsequent hypotonic washes did not enhance myr-rARF1 binding (not shown). The simplest interpretation of these data is that washing of ROS membranes eliminates a soluble factor required for optimal GTPγS-dependent binding of myr-rARF1 to ROS membranes. This factor is mostly recovered in the first isotonic wash, referred to as RIE. Since an increased GTPγS-dependent binding of myr-ARF1 to ROS membranes is probably caused by an accelerated GDP-to-GTPγS exchange, we directly investigated the effect of RIE on the time course of [35S]GTPγS binding to rARF1 and myr-rARF1 in the presence of phospholipid vesicles and at 1 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 2). As previously reported(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), myr-rARF1 slowly took up GTPγS under these conditions, with a t1/2∼30 min, but the exchange was markedly accelerated (∼5-fold) in the presence of RIE, which by itself bound only a small amount of nucleotide (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the retinal extract had no stimulatory effect on the binding of GTPγS to nonmyristoylated ARF1 (Fig. 2B). In fact, the binding of GTPγS to rARF1 was very low and was even not additive with the binding to RIE when the two components were incubated together, which indicates that no significant nucleotide exchange occurred on rARF1, whether RIE was present or not. Thus, the retinal extract appears to accelerate the nucleotide exchange selectively on the myristoylated protein. Addition of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) did not affect the spontaneous phospholipid-dependent GTPγS binding to myr-rARF1 but totally abolished the RIE-catalyzed exchange, with half-maximal inhibition at 2 μM BFA (Fig. 3A). BFA is known to inhibit a wide variety of membrane traffic pathways (20.Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar) and has been reported to inhibit an ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange activity present in Golgi membranes (7.Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8.Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 9.Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in brain cytosol(10.Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10820-10825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact target of BFA is not yet known. It was proposed to be not the exchange factor itself but rather an associated protein because the sensitivity to BFA of the soluble exchange activity from bovine brain was lost after partial purification(11.Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism notwithstanding, the complete inhibition by BFA strongly suggests that the retinal extract contains an ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Moreover, this factor is protease sensitive, since trypsin treatment of RIE totally abolished its stimulatory effect on the activation of myr-rARF1 (Fig. 3B). Trypsin sensitivity was also demonstrated for the Golgi membrane-bound exchange activity(7.Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8.Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 9.Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This trypsin control is important in light of the recent report (21.Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that acid phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can greatly increase the rate of GDP dissociation from ARF1. In fact, two additional observations further argue against a possible role for acid phospholipids in our RIE effects: (i) the exchange activity remained soluble after a centrifugation at 400,000 × g, which excludes the presence in RIE of membrane vesicles, and (ii) inclusion of 20% (w/w) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in azolectin vesicles had only a marginal (<2-fold) stimulatory effect on the GDP dissociation rate from myr-ARF1 at μM levels of Mg2+ and no effect at all at mM levels of Mg2+ (data not shown), consistent with the prediction that under the latter conditions most of the negative charges of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate should be masked(22.Toner M. Vaio G. McLaughlin A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7435-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the most straightforward interpretation for our data is that a soluble protein is responsible for the RIE-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange on myr-rARF1. It should be noted, however, that this protein does not necessarily derive from the outer segments of rod cells. Indeed, the exchange activity was found to be more abundant in a soluble fraction prepared from a crude ROS suspension just separated from the rest of the retina by flotation on high density sucrose (see method II for RIE preparation as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, it is very likely that while the exchange activity is released upon shearing of the outer segments, it in fact comes from the inner segments, known to be rich in BFA-sensitive transport vesicles(23.Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The preparations obtained by method I (washing of freeze-thawed ROS fragments) and method II (collection of the soluble fraction resulting from crude ROS sedimentation) had a similar specific activity and were therefore both designated as RIE. The yield of method II, however, was higher. From the same number of retinas, the total exchange activity recovered by method II was ∼10-fold higher than by method I. It is noteworthy that the protein pattern (analyzed by SDS-PAGE) of the two preparations was completely different (Fig. 1C), which suggests that, in both preparations, the exchange activity is due to a very minor component. The finding that the retinal nucleotide exchange factor is soluble while myr-rARF1GDP is loosely attached to membranes (15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) raises the question as to whether the interaction between the two proteins occurs in solution or on the membrane. This question cannot be answered by measuring GDP-to-[35S]GTPγS exchange because phospholipids are absolutely necessary to stabilize the GTPγS-bound form at mM Mg2+ levels(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, it is possible to measure GDP dissociation via the [3H]GDP-to-GDP exchange, a reaction that can be monitored with or without phospholipids. We therefore investigated [3H]GDP dissociation from rARF1 and myr-rARF1 in a medium containing a large excess of unlabeled GDP in the presence or absence of retinal extract (Fig. 4). In the presence of phospholipids, very similar results were obtained for [3H]GDP dissociation (Fig. 4A) and [35S]GTPγS binding (Fig. 2). No dissociation of GDP could be detected from rARF1, with or without RIE, whereas the dissociation rate from myr-rARF1 was increased ∼5-fold by the retinal exchange protein. In the absence of phospholipids (Fig. 4B), there was still no measurable dissociation of [3H]GDP from unmyristoylated ARF1 with or without RIE, but most importantly, there was also no acceleration of GDP release from myr-rARF1 in the presence of RIE. In fact, the rate of [3H]GDP dissociation was even decreased (by 2-fold) by addition of the retinal extract, but the same effect was obtained with bovine serum albumin, which points to a nonspecific stabilizing effect of RIE proteins. Moreover, addition of BFA to the release medium did not affect the inhibitory effect of RIE in Fig. 4B, while it totally abolished its stimulatory effect in Fig. 4A (not shown). Altogether, these data indicate that the retinal exchange factor can recognize ARFGDP only if ARF is myristoylated and if phospholipid vesicles are present. In other words, the catalyzed exchange reaction occurs on the membrane and not in solution. Even though the physiological role of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor is to promote release of bound GDP and replacement with GTP, it has been reported for several Ras-specific exchange factors such as the yeast SCD25 (24.Créchet J.-B. Poullet P. Mistou M.-Y. Parmeggiani A. Camonis J. Boy-Marcotte E. Damak F. Jacquet M. Science. 1990; 248: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or CDC25 (25.Lai C.-C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) gene products and the mammalian Sos1 gene product (26.Liu B.X. Wei W. Broek D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3081-3084PubMed Google Scholar) that the release of GTP is also significantly stimulated by the exchange factor in vitro. This prompted us to examine the effect of RIE on [35S]GTPγS release from both myr-rARF1 and rARF1 in an attempt to determine whether once membrane-bound (since both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated ARFGTPγS bind to phospholipids) the two proteins are still recognized differently by the exchange factor. In the experiment described in Fig. 5, myr-rARF1 and rARF1 were preloaded with [35S]GTPγS in the presence of phospholipids, and a large excess of unlabeled GTPγS was added, at 1 mM Mg2+, to initiate the release assay. In the absence of RIE, spontaneous [35S]GTPγS dissociation was very slow for myr-rARF1 (Fig. 5A) but notably faster for rARF1 (Fig. 5B) at the same concentration of phospholipid vesicles. This difference reflects the different affinity of the two proteins for phospholipids. Indeed, increasing the concentration of phospholipids 3-fold reduced the GTPγS dissociation rate from rARF1 by 2-fold and also increased (up to 80% at equilibrium) the fraction of rARF1 bound to [35S]GTPγS in the preloading step (data not shown). This is consistent with the view that phospholipids are absolutely required for stabilizing ARFGTPγS, whether myristoylated or not, but with a different concentration dependence for the two proteins because the myristate increases the affinity of ARFGTPγS for lipids (by at least 10-fold, as judged by sedimentation experiments, not shown). Addition of RIE caused a marked acceleration of [35S]GTPγS release from both myr-rARF1 and rARF1 (Fig. 5, A and B). This indicates that (i) like Ras-specific exchange factors mentioned above, RIE can also recognize the GTP-bound form of its target protein and catalyze a GTP release, albeit to a much lesser extent than the GDP release (compare the dissociation rates of GDP and GTPγS from myr-rARF1 in the presence of RIE in Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A), and (ii) the retinal exchange factor can recognize nonmyristoylated about as well as myristoylated membrane-bound ARFGTPγS. Therefore, this result strongly suggests that in RIE-catalyzed GDP release (Fig. 4), the myristate was required for binding ARFGDP to the phospholipids rather than directly involved in the interaction of ARFGDP with the exchange factor. It is noteworthy that RIE-catalyzed GTPγS release from both ARFs was only partly inhibited by BFA, even at 300 μM (Fig. 5, A and B), whether BFA was preincubated with RIE or with ARF and phospholipids. The significance of this result is unclear since the exact mechanism of action of BFA is not known. The fact that the spontaneous release of GTPγS was unchanged in the presence of BFA confirms that BFA does not affect the interaction of ARFGTPγS with phospholipids. It remains possible that this lipophilic drug somehow hinders the attachment of the exchange factor to the lipids, the inhibition being less pronounced when the target protein (ARFGTPγS) is itself solidly membrane-bound. Importantly, very similar results were obtained when GTPγS-to-[35S]GTPγS exchange was measured (Fig. 6) instead of [35S]GTPγS-to-GTPγS exchange (Fig. 5). Again, the spontaneous exchange was faster for nonmyristoylated ARF1 (Fig. 6B), RIE markedly accelerated the exchange on both ARFs, and BFA caused a partial inhibition (Fig. 6, A and B). Together, the results of Figure 5:, Figure 6: unambiguously demonstrate that RIE promotes GTPγS-GTPγS exchange on both ARFs, but it should be noted that measure of both GTPγS release (Fig. 5) and GTPγS loading (Fig. 6) was necessary to eliminate all possible artifacts. Indeed, as GTPγS release is tightly correlated with the dissociation of ARFGTPγS from phospholipids, RIE-stimulated GTPγS release in Fig. 5 could have been due in part to a displacement of ARFGTPγS from the lipids, possibly by proteins of RIE unrelated to the exchange activity. On the other hand, RIE-catalyzed GTPγS binding in Fig. 6 could have been due to some residual ARFGDP, at least in the case of myr-rARF1. The symmetry of the data obtained by the two methods definitely rules out all of these possibilities. In this study, we have analyzed the role of N-myristoylation of bovine ARF1 in its activation in vitro by a soluble, brefeldin A-sensitive guanine-nucleotide exchange activity obtained from bovine retinas. We demonstrate that stimulation by the retinal extract of GDP release from ARF1 strictly requires myristoylation of ARF1 and the presence of phospholipids. The retinal extract also stimulates to a lesser extent the release of GTPγS from ARFGTPγS in the presence of phospholipids but, in that case, myristoylation of ARF is not required. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the retinal exchange factor acts only on membrane-bound ARF. Its interaction with ARFGDP requires myristoylation of ARF because only myr-ARFGDP can significantly bind to phospholipids. In contrast, its interaction with ARFGTPγS does not require myristoylation of ARF because both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated ARFGTPγS strongly bind to phospholipids. In other words, the myristate is not directly involved in the interaction of ARF with the exchange factor; it is simply required to bring ARFGDP to the membrane where the catalyzed exchange reaction occurs. A similar role of the myristate in facilitating membrane binding has been ascribed to several other myristoylated proteins(27.McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). How could one explain that an apparently soluble exchange factor interacts only with membrane-bound ARF? At least two possibilities can be entertained. First, it can be questioned whether the exchange protein is totally cytosolic in the cell. Indeed, it is rather puzzling that in rat liver Golgi membranes the BFA-sensitive nucleotide exchange activity was described as tightly bound to membranes, being resistant to salt extraction but not to alkali extraction(8.Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). While it is of course possible that the Golgi-bound exchange activity is completely different from the soluble enzyme present in our retinal extract, it may well be also that the two enzymes are related peripheral proteins more or less tightly bound to membranes depending on the tissue. Thus, the retinal exchange factor might in fact loosely bind to membranes like myr-ARFGDP, possibly also through a lipid modification or via a positively charged structure such as a pleckstrin homology domain frequently found in small G protein-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (28.Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and thought to be involved in interactions with membrane phospholipids(29.Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the probability of interaction between myr-rARFGDP and the exchange factor would be enhanced on the membrane surface as a result of an increased local concentration of the two proteins. A similar mechanism has been recently proposed to explain the lipid-dependent interactions of transducin α and βγ subunits(30.Bigay J. Faurobert E. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, another possibility is that the insertion of the myristate chain into the lipid bilayer might induce a conformational change of the ARF protein, which would properly expose the interaction domain with the exchange factor. Indeed, support for a membrane-dependent conformational change of myr-ARFGDP comes from our observation that the rate of GDP release is increased by phospholipids(15.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The amphipathic amino-terminal α-helix most likely participates in this conformational change. This helix has been shown to be held by hydrophobic forces in a cleft of the GDP-bound unmyristoylated form of ARF1(31.Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), but its fate upon binding of the myristoyl group to the membrane is not known. It seems reasonable to predict that the helix could be displaced out of the cleft and come in contact with the phospholipid bilayer. The interaction with the exchange factor could somehow accentuate the conformational change and further open the nucleotide binding site. These two possible mechanisms are in fact not exclusive. Both an increased local concentration and a correct orientation of myr-ARFGDP and the exchange enzyme might well facilitate their interaction. Our finding that only myristoylated ARF can be activated (by GDP-to-GTP exchange) by the retinal exchange factor contradicts the conclusions of two previous studies on Golgi membranes (9.Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but provides a reasonable explanation for the observation that myristoylation is required for many ARF activities(32.Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melançon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33.Balch W.E. Kahn R.A. Schwaninger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13053-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be stressed that only the GDP-to-GTP exchange has a functional meaning. Our observation that in vitro release of GTPγS was stimulated by the retinal extract provides insight into the role of myristoylation but is of questionable physiological relevance. It is very likely that in vivo ARFGTP will not remain bound to its exchange factor because of the presence of effectors with higher affinity. We have observed that brefeldin A totally inhibits the retinal extract-stimulated GDP release from myr-ARF with an IC50 of 2 μM, whereas it inhibits only partially the stimulated GTPγS release. The significance of this result is difficult to assess as long as the molecular basis for brefeldin inhibition is unknown. The exact target of BFA is still not found, and we cannot exclude that the nucleotide exchange activity of our retinal extract involves in fact several proteins. Thus, in addition to the exchange factor itself, an adaptor protein serving as a membrane anchor might be required, which could be the receptor for BFA. This would be consistent with the observation that the sensitivity to BFA is lost during purification of the exchange protein(11.Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Obviously, the exact mechanism underlying ARF activation is far from being understood, but if the process proves to involve several components, it may help to first describe the characteristics of a crude preparation before trying to reconstitute the system with purified elements. -We thank Bruno Antonny and Minh Vuong for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript, Isabelle Lenoir for skillful technical assistance, and Gabrielle Imbs for expert secretarial assistance."

INTRODUCTIONPrion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of human beings and animals characterized by dementia, ataxia, myoclonus, and spongiform deterioration of the brain and spinal cord(1.Gajdusek D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1990: 2289-2323Google Scholar, 2.Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A unique feature of these disorders is their manifestation as infectious, genetic, and sporadic forms. Infectious cases, including kuru, experimental scrapie, and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 1The abbreviations used are: CJDCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseCHOChinese hamster ovaryFFIfatal familial insomniaGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolGSSGerstmann-Sträussler syndromemoPrPmouse prion proteinPIPLCbacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CPrPprion proteinPrPccellular isoform of the prion proteinPrPScscrapie isoform of the prion proteinMEMminimal essential mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisEcLenhanced chemiluminescence. are thought to be caused by prions (3.Prusiner S.B.

Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Cell. 1984; 38: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), a posttranslationally modified isoform of a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of the host called PrPc(5.Oesch B.

Familial prion diseases, including Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and about 10% of the cases of CJD, display an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with nearly complete penetrance and are linked to insertional and point mutations in the chromosomal gene that encodes PrPc(6.Prusiner S.B. Hsiao K.K. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Both infectious and inherited forms of prion disease are characterized by accumulation in the central nervous system of protease-resistant PrPSc that is capable of transmitting the disease to laboratory animals(2.Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is uncertain, however, whether the cellular mechanisms underlying production of PrPSc are the same in the two disease states. This uncertainty is due, in part, to the absence of a cell culture model of familial prion diseases, analogous to the ones that have been developed for analysis of scrapie infection (7.Butler D.A. Scott M.R.D. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Race R.E. Caughey B. Graham K. Ernst D.

Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), but it is possible that distinct cellular compartments and molecular components are involved in inherited and infectious forms. To resolve this issue, it will be necessary to employ cultured cell models in addition to transgenic mice (15.Prusiner S.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and cell-free systems(16.Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Landsbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar).To develop such a model, we have constructed stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express murine homologues of mutant PrPs associated with human prion diseases. We previously reported that one of these mutants, a Creutzfeldt-Jakob homologue containing an insertion of six additional octapeptide repeats, displays an abnormal mode of attachment to the plasma membrane(17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type PrP, this protein remains tightly bound to the cell surface, even after enzymatic cleavage of its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In the present work, we have analyzed CHO cells expressing mutant PrPs related to all three inherited prion diseases of humans, in order to determine whether these proteins acquire biochemical properties of infectious PrPSc. In addition, we have investigated whether PrPSc synthesized in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells has a membrane attachment similar to that of the mutant PrPs.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrP Constructs and Cell LinesCHO cell lines expressing PG11 moPrP have been described previously(17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Point mutations in moPrP were introduced using recombinant polymerase chain reaction(18.Higuchi R. Erlich H.R. PCR Technology.

All cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pBC12/CMV and were stably transfected into CHO cells, as described(17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The data shown here were obtained from a single subcloned line expressing each construct, although similar results have been obtained from additional clones and from pools of transiently transfected cells (data not shown).Scrapie-infected N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Byron Caughey (Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT) and were grown as described(19.Caughey B.

Cells were then lysed at 4°C in a buffer that contained 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), plus protease inhibitors (pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM; EDTA, 2 mM). Lysates were centrifuged at 4°C, first at 16,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and then at 265,000 × g in the TLA 100.3 rotor of a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge. Immunoprecipitation of moPrP in pellet and supernatant fractions was performed using antibody P45-66 (17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as described previously(21.Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.-L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), with the modification that immunocomplexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose. Lysates were treated with N-glycosidase F (0.01 units/ml) for 16 h at 37°C prior to immunoprecipitation to produce a single band of deglycosylated PrP that could be more easily quantitated(22.Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Assay of Protease ResistanceMethanol-precipitated proteins from metabolically labeled or surface-biotinylated CHO or N2a cells were digested with proteinase K and resuspended in detergent-lipid-protein complexes for immunoprecipitation of PrP, all as described(23.Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioactive gels quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Immunoprecipitations employed anti-ME7 antibody (from Dr. Rick Kascsak, Institute for Basic Research, Staten Island, NY), which was raised against PrP 27-30 from scrapie-infected mouse brain. Although this antibody reacts with both mouse and hamster PrP, CHO cells do not synthesize detectable levels of endogenous hamster PrP (not shown), so that only recombinant moPrP is detected in this cell type.Assays of Phospholipase SensitivityThe procedure of Lehmann and Harris (17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was used to test the ability of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) to release moPrP from the surface of intact CHO or N2a cells. Briefly, surface-biotinylated cells were treated with PIPLC (1 unit/ml) for 2 h at 4°C, and moPrP in incubation media and cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with P45-66 antibody. To test the protease sensitivity of moPrP in media and cell lysates, methanol-precipitated proteins were treated with proteinase K, and moPrP immunoprecipitated with anti-ME7, as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and biotinylated moPrP visualized by developing blots of the gels with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and ECL.To assess the decrease in electrophoretic mobility of moPrPs after cleavage of the GPI anchor, CHO cells were labeled for 20 min with Tran35S-label and chased for 3 h in Opti-MEM. Cell lysates were incubated first with N-glycosidase F as described above and then with 1 unit/ml of PIPLC for 1 h at 37°C, following which moPrP was immunoprecipitated using antibody P45-66 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe mutant moPrP constructs employed here are listed in Table 1, along with their human homologues and the phenotypes with which they are associated. M128V moPrP was analyzed as a negative control, because a Met → Val substitution at codon 129 is a nonpathogenic polymorphism in the human population(26.Owen F. Poulter M. Collinge J. Crow T.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 1215-1216PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE 1 Open table in a new tab To test the detergent solubility of the moPrPs, lysates of metabolically labeled CHO cells expressing each protein were centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 40 min, a protocol that sediments PrPSc but not PrPc(19.Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that significantly more PG11, P101L, D177N, and E199K moPrPs than wild-type moPrP sedimented (Fig. 1, A and B). We noted that E199K moPrP was more soluble than the other mutants (60% versus 80-90% in the pellet). Importantly, very little M128V moPrP sedimented, indicating that the effect on detergent solubility was specific for disease-related mutations.To assess the protease resistance of the moPrPs, lysates of metabolically labeled cells were treated for 10 min with 3.3 μg/ml of proteinase K, conditions similar to those that have been used for digestion of PrPSc derived from some scrapie strains(32.Bessen R.A.

We observed that PG11, P101L, D177N, and E199K moPrPs were cleaved by the protease to yield fragments that migrated between 27 and 30 kDa, the same size as the protease-resistant core of PrPSc(4.Prusiner S.B.

In contrast, wild-type moPrP, as well as M128V moPrP, were completely degraded under these conditions (Fig. 1, C and D). In a separate study, we have shown that proteinase K truncates the PG11 protein within a segment of ∼20 amino acids following the octapeptide repeats, the same region within which cleavage of infectious PrPSc occurs. 2S. Lehmann and D. A. Harris, submitted for publication. More than half of each of the mutant PrPs is present on the cell surface at steady state, as determined by susceptibility to externally applied trypsin (data not shown). To test whether the proteins can be released from the surface by cleavage of their GPI anchors, cells were biotinylated with a membrane-impermeant reagent and incubated with the bacterial enzyme PIPLC, which cleaves the diacylglycerol portion of the anchor. We found that ∼5% of PG11, P101L, and D177N moPrPs were released by PIPLC, compared with ∼90% for wild-type and M128V moPrPs (Fig. 2, A and B). An intermediate amount (∼50%) of E199K moPrP was released, which correlates with the higher solubility of this protein compared to the other disease-related mutants (Fig. 1B). Confirming that the GPI anchor on each protein had been cleaved, we observed a characteristic decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein after PIPLC treatment(17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34.Rosenberry T.L. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 1133-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The structural features that account for lack of PIPLC release are also likely to confer protease resistance on mutant PrP molecules, since we found that the pool of E199K protein that was retained on the cell surface after PIPLC treatment was protease-resistant (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 8), while the released pool was completely digested (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 7). Several possible explanations may account for retention of mutant PrPs on the cell surface following GPI anchor cleavage, including integration of the PrP polypeptide chain into the lipid bilayer, tight association with other membrane components, or aggregation(17.Lehmann S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Figure 2:MoPrPs carrying disease-related mutations are retained on the cell surface after cleavage of their GPI anchors. A, surface-biotinylated CHO cells expressing each protein were treated with PIPLC (1 unit/ml) for 2 h at 4°C prior to lysis. MoPrP in the PIPLC incubation media (M lanes) and cell lysates (C lanes) was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by developing blots of the gel with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and ECL. B, PrP bands from the ECL film shown in A, and from two additional experiments, were quantitated by densitometry, and the amount of PrP released by PIPLC was plotted as a percentage of the total amount of PrP (medium + cell lysate). Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. Values that are significantly different from wild-type moPrP by t test are indicated by single (p < 0.01) and double (p < 0.001) asterisks. C, lysates of metabolically labeled cells expressing each protein were incubated with (+ lanes) or without (- lanes) PIPLC. MoPrP was then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PrP-specific bands (arrowheads) are reduced in electrophoretic mobility after PIPLC treatment. D, CHO cells expressing wild-type and E199K moPrPs were surface-biotinylated and treated with PIPLC as described in the legend of A. Proteins in the PIPLC incubation media (M lanes) and cell lysates (C lanes) were then either digested at 37°C for 10 min with 3.3 μg/ml of proteinase K (PK) (+ lanes) or were left untreated (- lanes), prior to recovery of moPrP by immunoprecipitation. Biotinylated moPrP was then visualized as described in the legend of A. Five times as many cell equivalents were loaded in the + lanes as in the - lanes. Only the fraction of E199K moPrP not released by PIPLC (lane 4) generates a protease-resistant fragment (bracket, lane 8).

First, the protease-resistant fragments of the D177N and E199K proteins consistently migrated 1-2 kDa more slowly than the fragments of the other mutant proteins (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the cleavage site may not be identical for all of the mutants. Second, the glycosylation patterns of the mutants were different from each other, although all of the disease-related mutants displayed a higher proportion of lower molecular mass glycoforms than wild-type PrP (Fig. 2A). Third, E199K moPrP was more detergent-soluble and PIPLC-releasable than the other mutants (Fig. 1B and 2B). These observations raise the possibility that mutant PrPs possess “strain-specific” molecular properties that account for the different clinical and neuropathological phenotypes with which they are associated(32.Bessen R.A.

Scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells have been used extensively to analyze the biochemical mechanisms underlying prion generation, since these cells produce PrPSc that is both protease-resistant and infectious (Fig. 3A; Refs. 7, 8, 19, and 23). To determine whether infectious PrPSc, like mutant PrPSc, remains membrane-bound after PIPLC treatment, we surface-biotinylated scrapie-infected and uninfected neuroblastoma cells and incubated them with the phospholipase. In agreement with previous studies(43.Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A.

In contrast, protease-resistant PrPSc was retained on the surface of infected cells after PIPLC treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8). This behavior is similar to that of the mutant PrPs and suggests an important similarity between the membrane topologies of mutant and infectious molecules. The fact that PrPSc can be biotinylated in these cells indicates that at least some must be present on the plasma membrane and must therefore be accessible to externally applied PIPLC, a result consistent with previous reports(20.Caughey B.

First, the mutant PrPs synthesized in this system display all of the major biochemical properties of authentic PrPSc, including detergent insolubility, protease resistance, abnormal attachment to the plasma membrane, and, as shown in a separate study,2 metabolic stability. Second, these PrPSc-like biochemical properties are detected in four different moPrP mutants whose human homologues are associated with each of the known forms of inherited prion disorder (familial CJD, GSS, and FFI). Third, a mutation in moPrP (M128V) whose human homologue represents a nonpathogenic polymorphism fails to induce PrPSc properties. Fourth, there are variations among the disease-related mutants in their biochemical properties, consistent with the concept that structurally distinct PrP “strains” are associated with different disease phenotypes(32.Bessen R.A.

Virol. 1978; 39: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).It might be argued that there is a difference between our cell culture system and the brains of patients afflicted with inherited prion diseases in the time course and extent of PrPSc production. The human disorders evolve slowly, not manifesting themselves clinically until adulthood, and even in the terminal stages only a small proportion of the available PrPc is converted to PrPSc(6.Prusiner S.B. Hsiao K.K. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that CHO cells convert a substantial fraction of mutant PrP they express into PrPSc within a matter of hours.2 Possible explanations for this discrepancy are that cell- and tissue-specific factors influence the efficiency of the conversion reaction and that PrPSc accumulates in the brain for a period of time before pathological damage and clinical symptoms ensue.We now plan to test whether mutant moPrPs expressed in CHO cells are infectious, as are PrP molecules from the brains of some patients with familial prion diseases. It has been observed, however, that inherited prion diseases as a group display lower rates of transmission to rodents and primates than do cases having an infectious or sporadic etiology(47.Brown P. Gibbs C.J. Rodgers J.P. Asher D.M. Sulima M.P. Bacote A. Goldfarb L.G. Gajdusek D.C. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This result may simply reflect variations in titer among brain regions from which inocula are derived, or it may imply that some forms of PrPSc can produce neurological damage without being infectious. If it should turn out that the mutant PrPs produced in our system are not infectious, we would hypothesize that CHO cells are capable of carrying out the initial steps in biochemical conversion of PrPc to PrPSc, but that additional processes are necessary for the generation of finished prion particles.Although infectious prion diseases arise by a species-specific interaction between exogenous PrPSc and endogenous PrPc(48.Prusiner S.B.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the results obtained with our in vitro system provide compelling evidence that the two kinds of diseases share key molecular features. We have shown here that mutant and infectious PrPSc molecules have remarkably similar biochemical properties, including an unusually tight attachment to the plasma membrane that had not been previously appreciated. In addition, acquisition of at least some of these properties occurs posttranslationally, as demonstrated by pulse-chase labeling studies of mutant2 and infectious PrPs (20.Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J.

It remains to be determined whether this transition occurs along the same cellular pathways in all forms of the disease and whether the same set of molecular intermediates and accessory proteins is involved. Further analysis of PrPSc production in infected cell lines and in cultured cells expressing mutant PrPs will make it possible to resolve these issues and for the first time to directly compare the cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying two major etiologies of prion disease. INTRODUCTIONPrion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of human beings and animals characterized by dementia, ataxia, myoclonus, and spongiform deterioration of the brain and spinal cord(1.Gajdusek D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1990: 2289-2323Google Scholar, 2.Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A unique feature of these disorders is their manifestation as infectious, genetic, and sporadic forms. Infectious cases, including kuru, experimental scrapie, and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 1The abbreviations used are: CJDCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseCHOChinese hamster ovaryFFIfatal familial insomniaGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolGSSGerstmann-Sträussler syndromemoPrPmouse prion proteinPIPLCbacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CPrPprion proteinPrPccellular isoform of the prion proteinPrPScscrapie isoform of the prion proteinMEMminimal essential mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisEcLenhanced chemiluminescence. are thought to be caused by prions (3.Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar). These particles contain little or no nucleic acid and are composed primarily of PrPSc(4.Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Cell. 1984; 38: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), a posttranslationally modified isoform of a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of the host called PrPc(5.Oesch B.

Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Familial prion diseases, including Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (GSS), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and about 10% of the cases of CJD, display an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with nearly complete penetrance and are linked to insertional and point mutations in the chromosomal gene that encodes PrPc(6.Prusiner S.B. Hsiao K.K. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Both infectious and inherited forms of prion disease are characterized by accumulation in the central nervous system of protease-resistant PrPSc that is capable of transmitting the disease to laboratory animals(2.Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is uncertain, however, whether the cellular mechanisms underlying production of PrPSc are the same in the two disease states. This uncertainty is due, in part, to the absence of a cell culture model of familial prion diseases, analogous to the ones that have been developed for analysis of scrapie infection (7.Butler D.A. Scott M.R.D. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Race R.E. Caughey B. Graham K. Ernst D.

To resolve this issue, it will be necessary to employ cultured cell models in addition to transgenic mice (15.Prusiner S.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and cell-free systems(16.Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Landsbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar).To develop such a model, we have constructed stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express murine homologues of mutant PrPs associated with human prion diseases. We previously reported that one of these mutants, a Creutzfeldt-Jakob homologue containing an insertion of six additional octapeptide repeats, displays an abnormal mode of attachment to the plasma membrane(17.Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type PrP, this protein remains tightly bound to the cell surface, even after enzymatic cleavage of its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In the present work, we have analyzed CHO cells expressing mutant PrPs related to all three inherited prion diseases of humans, in order to determine whether these proteins acquire biochemical properties of infectious PrPSc. In addition, we have investigated whether PrPSc synthesized in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells has a membrane attachment similar to that of the mutant PrPs."
https://openalex.org/W2008742882,"Chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by the oxidation of the methyl group on the ring B of the tetrapyrrole ring to the formyl group. Previously, we reported that chlorophyllide b could be converted to chlorophyll a in isolated cucumber etioplasts indicating the conversion of chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. To identify the intermediate molecule, we used barley etioplasts instead of cucumber. Chlorophyll a and an additional pigment were found after incubation of chlorophyllide b with isolated barley etioplasts. The pigment has the same retention time and absorption spectrum as 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll, which has the hydroxymethyl group on ring B instead of the formyl group of chlorophyll b. Authentic 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll was prepared by reduction of chlorophyll b by NaBH4. Chlorophyll a accumulated during the incubation of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyllide with etioplasts. These findings indicate that chlorophyll b is converted to chlorophyll a via 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll. Chlorophyll b and 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll accumulated within a short period of incubation of chlorophyllide b with etioplasts. However, chlorophyll a accumulated with a concomitant decrease of chlorophyll b and 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll. These observations also suggest that chlorophyll b is converted to 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll and then to chlorophyll a. Both steps required ATP."

Molecular cloning, immunopurification, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that an endogenous L-cell Kvβ2.1 subunit assembled with transfected hKv1.5 protein. In contrast, both mRNA and protein analysis failed to detect a β subunit in the HEK 293 cells, suggesting that functional differences observed between these two systems are due to endogenous L-cell Kvβ2.1 expression. In the absence of Kvβ2.1, midpoints for activation and inactivation of hKv1.5 in HEK 293 cells were −0.2 ± 2.0 and −9.6 ± 1.8 mV, respectively. In the presence of Kvβ2.1 these values were −14.1 ± 1.8 and −22.1 ± 3.7 mV, respectively. The β subunit also caused a 1.5-fold increase in the extent of slow inactivation at 50 mV, thus completely reconstituting the L-cell current phenotype in the HEK 293 cells. These results indicate that 1) the Kvβ2.1 subunit can alter Kv1.5 α subunit function, 2) β subunits are not required for α subunit expression, and 3) endogenous β subunits are expressed in heterologous expression systems used to study K+ channel function.

Ras-induced apoptosis can be blocked by the proto-oncogene bcl-2, but the biochemical or functional nature of Bcl-2 regulation of Ras-induced apoptosis is not understood. We demonstrate that Bcl-2 and p21Ras molecules can be co-immunoprecipitated in Jurkat cells. The level of this association is enhanced when an apoptotic stimulus (inhibition of PKC activity) is delivered. Bcl-2/p21Ras association is coincident with new phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 protein.

In addition to its involvement in transducing or promoting cell proliferation or differentiation signals, p21Ras is also thought to be necessary for mediating cell cycle progression, including G0 to G1, and G2 to M, transitions (11.Howe P.H.

Recently, it has been reported that Ras may be involved in apoptosis mediated by FAS and tumor necrosis factor receptors(13.Fernandez A. Fosdick L.J. Marin M.C. Diaz C. Mcdonnell T.J.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Ras-generated signals lead not only toward cell growth, but also can initiate apoptosis, depending upon the state of other cellular signaling mediators, such as Bcl-2 and PKC. This Ras-induced apoptosis is triggered after suppression of cellular PKC activity and can be blocked by Bcl-2, a cell survival-promoting factor(15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). A proto-oncogene product, Bcl-2, can protect cells from apoptosis induced by certain biological or chemical reagents(16.Hockenbery D.M.

Bcl-2 has been reported to bind to a human Ras-related protein, p23R-Ras(19.Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), as well as to a downstream effector protein kinase, Raf-1(20.Wang H.-G. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Sato T. Torigoe T. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Hovey L. Troppmair J. Rapp U. Reed J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2751-2756PubMed Google Scholar). Since the structure of p23R-Ras is highly homologous to p21Ras(19.Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20.Wang H.-G.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2751-2756PubMed Google Scholar) and because p23 can bind to Bcl-2, we have examined the interactions of these proteins in Jurkat cells co-expressing the proto-oncogene bcl-2 and v-Ha-ras (PH1/bcl-2 cells). It is shown here that overexpressed, activated p21Ras can be co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed Bcl-2 in PH1/bcl-2 cells, under normal growth conditions. The association of these two molecules becomes more obvious after delivery of an apoptotic signal (down-regulation of PKC) and may be related to a post-translational modification of Bcl-2, phosphorylation, which occurs simultaneously. Cell fractionation experiments suggest that the binding of these molecules may take place in the cell membrane. The interaction of Bcl-2 and p21Ras may be likely to be of physiological and biochemical relevance in the regulation of the Ras-induced apoptosis. Jurkat cells were stably co-transfected with v-Ha-ras expression vector and a vector containing a selectable marker conferring resistance to Geneticin by electroporation as described previously(21.Koka P. van de Mark K.A. Faller D.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2417-2425PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, these cells (designated PH1) were carried in growth medium plus 0.7 mg of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) per ml. The bcl-2 retroviral expression vector was used to infect either Jurkat or PH1 cells in the presence of Polybrene (Sigma) at 8 μg/ml, as described previously (21.Koka P. van de Mark K.A. Faller D.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2417-2425PubMed Google Scholar). After infection, cells which had stably integrated the vectors were selected in the growth medium containing 200 μg of hygromycin/ml. Cells (20 × 106), with or without PMA (500 nM) treatment for 24 h, were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed in 1% Triton X-114 lysis buffer(22.Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The lysate was adjusted to 0.4 M NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). For each sample, a duplicate cell lysate preparation was made for reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Two hundred μg of cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation by using either anti-Ras antibody (Signal Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY) or anti-human-Bcl-2 antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. p21Ras or Bcl-2 proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies and developed with an anti-mouse Ig alkaline phosphatase reagent (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). Cells (20 × 106), under normal growth conditions or after down-regulation of PKC activity, were permeabilized with 1 ml of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [32P]ATP for 10 min at 37°C, as described (23.Rake J.B. Quinones M.A. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5348-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For inhibition experiments, 0.1 μM staurosporine or 200 μM genistein was added to the kinase buffer. Cells were lysed with Triton X-114 lysis buffer(22.Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Protein extraction and immunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 were performed as described above. After electrophoreses, gels were subjected either to autoradiography directly or to immunoblot analysis and subsequently to autoradiography. Cells (20 × 106), after high dose (500 nM) PMA treatment for 24 h, were resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 0°C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and the pellet, resuspended in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer (membrane fraction), were immunoprecipitated by an anti-human-Bcl-2 antibody and immunoblotted by an anti-Ras antibody. Bcl-2 has been reported to interact physically with R-Ras, which has 55% identity to p21Ha-Ras, or with Raf, which can bind to p21Ras and regulate growth signals(19.Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20.Wang H.-G. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Sato T. Torigoe T. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Hovey L. Troppmair J. Rapp U. Reed J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2751-2756PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the functional significance, if any, of these interactions. Since the predicted effector domain of p23R-Ras is similar in amino acid sequence to the corresponding region in p21Ha-Ras, the human bcl-2 gene was introduced into Jurkat cells (designated as Jurkat/bcl-2 cells) and PH1 cells (Jurkat cells containing v-Ha-ras, designated as PH1/bcl-2 cells) to explore possible biological and physical interactions between p21Ras and Bcl-2. Specific antibodies were used to determine if these proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated, under normal growth conditions or after delivery of a Ras-induced apoptotic signal (down-regulation of PKC activity, by chronic treatment with the phorbol ester PMA)(25.Nishizuka T. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar, 26.Connolly T.M. Lawing J.F. Majerus P.W.

Valge-Archer V.E. Sinskey A.J. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have confirmed elsewhere that this treatment, 24 h of exposure to a high dose (500 nM) of PMA, down-regulates PKC activity in these cells(15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins co-immunoprecipitating with the anti-p21Ras antibody from transfected or control cell lysates, untreated or after PMA treatment, were immunoblotted for Bcl-2 protein using an anti-human Bcl-2 antibody (Fig. 1A). A 26-kDa protein, Bcl-2, was detected in anti-p21Ras immunoprecipitates in lysates from PH1/bcl-2 cells, but was not observed in lysates from cells expressing only one of the two transfected genes, or in the control cells. In reciprocal experiments, where the initial immunoprecipitation was carried out with an anti-Bcl-2 antibody, immunoblotting with an anti-p21Ras antibody detected a protein of 21 kDa which was co-precipitated in PH1/bcl-2 cells, both under normal growth conditions and after down-regulation of PKC activity (Fig. 1B). The amount of the co-precipitating protein after down-regulation of PKC activity by PMA treatment for 24 h was increased in both cases (a 2.3-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein associating with p21Ras and a 1.8-fold increase in p21Ras associating with Bcl-2, as measured by densitometry). As a control, an unrelated IgG isotype mouse monoclonal antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Ras to exclude nonspecific binding. There was no co-immunoprecipitation of either Bcl-2 or p21Ras with this irrelevant, isotype-matched IgG control antibody (data not shown). To further confirm the specificity of the association of Bcl-2 and activated p21Ras, immunoprecipitation with anti-human Bcl-2 antibody was performed after [35S]methionine/cysteine metabolic labeling of transfected and control Jurkat cells, following down-regulation of PKC activity. 26-kDa (Bcl-2) and 21-kDa (p21Ras) species were co-precipitated by the anti-Bcl-2 antibody from the lysates of PH1/bcl-2 cells, but not from the control Jurkat cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, only the 26-kDa Bcl-2 protein was precipitated from lysates of Jurkat/bcl-2 cells. These results confirmed that activated p21Ras and Bcl-2 are able to associate physically in vitro and perhaps in vivo. The quantitative increase in association of the two molecules after down-regulation of PKC was not due to changes in the levels of the Bcl-2 protein. The 26-kDa Bcl-2 protein was detected readily by immunoblotting lysates from the cells transfected with the bcl-2 gene, both under normal growth conditions and after down-regulation of PKC, and there was no significant change in Bcl-2 levels under either circumstance (Fig. 1D). In other studies, we have found that delivery of a different signal for apoptosis, stimulation through FAS/APO-1, also results in dramatic enhancement of the association of Bcl-2 and p21Ras. ( 2C.-Y. Chen and D. V. Faller, manuscript in preparation.) It has been suggested that the Bcl-2 protein requires post-translational modification, specifically phosphorylation, for function(29.Allsop T.E. Wyatt S. Pateson H.F. Davies A.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 30.Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Ternandes T.F. Crece C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased binding of Bcl-2 to p21Ras following suppression of PKC activity might be related to a modification of Bcl-2, the phosphorylation state of Bcl-2 protein in vitro was studied. New phosphorylation of the 26-kDa Bcl-2 protein at increased levels was detected after down-regulation of PKC activity in PH1/bcl-2 cells which had been preloaded with [32P]ATP (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Bcl-2 was not newly phosphorylated in Jurkat/bcl-2 cells under these same conditions. In normal lymphocytes and cell lines like Jurkat, down-regulation of PKC activity can comprise a normal physiologic signal to inhibit cell growth, rather than inducing apoptosis(25.Nishizuka T. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar, 26.Connolly T.M. Lawing J.F. Majerus P.W.

Like parental Jurkat cells, Jurkat/bcl-2 cells only arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle after down-regulation of PKC and re-enter the cell cycle when this inhibition is relieved(15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Bcl-2 appears to occur only in cells for which inhibition of PKC would invoke a cell death program (i.e. cells containing activated p21Ras, PH1). In similar studies, using metabolic labeling of cells with [32P]PO4, Bcl-2 was again found to be phosphorylated exclusively in PH1/bcl-2 cells and only during stimulation of Ras-induced apoptosis by inhibition of PKC activity(15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation using an anti-Bcl-2 antibody after [32P]ATP labeling, followed by simultaneous autoradiography and immunoblotting, was performed to confirm the identity of the phosphorylated 26-kDa band as Bcl-2. The labeled 26-kDa protein was immunoreactive with the Bcl-2 antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3). Another newly kinased protein species of approximately 20 kDa, which co-precipitated with Bcl-2, was also detected, and may possibly represent the Bcl-2 partner, Bax, although its identity has not yet been confirmed. Phosphorylation of both of these proteins was inhibited by the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, which suggested the involvement of a serine/threonine kinase in Bcl-2 phosphorylation during stimulation of Ras-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the tyrosine-protein kinase inhibitor genistein had no effect on the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in this permeabilized cell system (data not shown). If phosphorylation of Bcl-2 were required for protection from Ras-induced apoptosis, serine/threonine kinase inhibitors would be expected to abrogate this protective effect. Inhibition of cellular PKC activity by chronic treatment with PMA or by treatment with staurosporine led to apoptosis in cells containing activated p21Ras, as expected (Table 1), but protection by Bcl-2 (PH1/bcl-2 cells), as seen in cells treated with PMA, did not occur in the presence of staurosporine, which also blocks the coincident phosphorylation of Bcl-2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab It is possible that this post-translational modification of Bcl-2 (phosphorylation) occurs only when cells are facing a stress or death challenge. Whether this phosphorylation of Bcl-2 regulates its survival-promoting activity, and whether this modification is the direct result of down-regulation of PKC, or instead is the result of the activation of a rescue pathway in the face of impending apoptosis remains is not yet clear(15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). In support of a role for phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in promoting survival in these cells is our finding that, whereas overexpressed Bcl-2 protects PH1 cells from undergoing apoptosis during down-regulation of PKC, it does not protect these same cells from apoptosis during inhibition of PKC by staurosporine, a general serine/threonine kinase inhibitor. We have demonstrated herein that the serine/threonine kinase responsible for phosphorylating Bcl-2 under these conditions is sensitive to staurosporine, suggesting a requirement for this post-translational modification of Bcl-2 for its protective function. When a more specific inhibitor of PKC, chelerythrine, was utilized in parallel experiments, chelerythrine was also found to activate apoptosis in PH1 cells and with faster kinetics than did down-regulation of PKC by chronic exposure to PMA, as might be expected from the more rapid action of chelerythrine on inhibition of PKC activity. Yet, protection from Ras apoptosis by Bcl-2 was maintained, in contrast to the findings with staurosporine, and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in response to apoptotic stimuli was not inhibited(15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that p21Ras and Bcl-2 can interact within cells, under conditions where the bcl-2 gene is overexpressed, and this binding becomes prominent in response to activation of the Ras-induced apoptosis program. To determine whether the formation of this complex occurred in whole cells, or after lysis of the cells, a GST-Ras fusion protein bound to agarose was added to the cell lysates, and the precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-human Bcl-2 and anti-p21Ras antibodies. A 26-kDa Bcl-2 band was detected only in lysates from Jurkat/bcl-2 cells (Fig. 3A). Thus, a direct interaction of p21Ras and Bcl-2 could be demonstrated in vitro. In the PH1/bcl-2 cells, however, no such interaction could be detected. This suggests that the complex of endogenous p21Ras and Bcl-2 is formed before lysis of the cells, and, that once formed in vivo, the association of these two molecules could not readily be competed by addition of exogenous GST-Ras to the cell lysates for 2 h. In the absence of activated p21Ras, inhibition of PKC activity itself does not cause apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Table 1 and (15.Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar)), and no new phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein, even when overexpressed, was detectable (Fig. 2). The inability of GST-Ras to compete for Bcl-2 in the PH1/bcl-2 cell lysates over 2 h may therefore reflect a higher affinity of phosphorylated Bcl-2 for p21Ras in general, or for activated p21Ras in particular. To demonstrate that competition for Bcl-2 could occur as a function of time or concentration of the competitor (GST-Ras), the length of time of incubation or the concentration of GST-Ras in the competition experiment was varied. A 26-kDa Bcl-2 band could be seen associating with the GST-Ras beads after a 12-h competition incubation with PH1/bcl-2 cell extracts. The quantity of bound Bcl-2 did not increase with increasing concentrations of GST-Ras (4 μg), suggesting that the GST-Ras was already in excess relative to the Bcl-2 protein at 2 μg (Fig. 3B). These competition results provide further evidence that the endogenous Bcl-2/p21Ras complex formed in vitro is quite stable. p21Ras and Bcl-2 are both known to be anchored on the cytosolic face of cytosolic membranes in the cell(30.Alnemri E.S.

To determine if the association of these two molecules or the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 might alter the subcellular localization of Bcl-2/p21Ras protein complex, subcellular fractions were examined after down-regulation of PKC. Proteins from either cytosol or cytosolic membranes were immunoprecipitated with anti-human Bcl-2 antibody and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-p21Ras antibody, as described above. A protein of 21 kDa was detected only in membrane fractions from PH1/bcl-2 cells, with none found in the cytosol (Fig. 3C). These data show that activated p21Ras may physically interact with Bcl-2, and that interactions between these two molecules may become greater when PKC activity is suppressed. Co-precipitation of Bcl-2 with a small GTP-binding protein p23R-Ras has been reported previously in the yeast two-hybrid system(19.Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but associations with p21Ras were not observed. There are several differences between the two experimental systems employed which may be significant in this respect. In our studies, p21Ras is in a constitutively activated (GTP-bound) state. The p21Ras/Bcl-2 association was most prominent under conditions favoring apoptosis in v-ras-expressing cells. Finally, the associations we demonstrate may require post-translational modification of Bcl-2 and Ras(30.Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Ternandes T.F. Crece C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Membrane localization or a kinase-induced conformational change of Bcl-2 may quantitatively or qualitatively influence the interaction of this molecule with p21Ras. p21Ras has been implicated as a mediator of diverse inducers of apoptosis(13.Fernandez A.

Because trace amounts of oligomers in Fab and single-chain antibody variable domain (scFv) preparations resulted in biphasic binding profiles that were difficult to analyze, all kinetic measurements were performed on purified monomeric fragments and, for certain mutant scFv, dimeric forms. Results obtained with monomeric forms indicated that the relatively low affinity of the antibody was due to rapid dissociation (koff≈ 0.25 s-1).

The relatively weak affinities that characterize protein-carbohydrate interactions make understanding how biological processes are mediated by oligosaccharides difficult. However, it is becoming evident, particularly for certain plant and animal lectins, that specificity is achieved by a combination of multivalence and the geometry of the subunit arrangement. There is now a considerable amount of data available on structural and energetic aspects of protein-carbohydrate interactions(1.Bundle D.R. Young N.M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

General structural features are the stacking of aromatic side-chains against the sugar rings, the presence of hydrogen bond networks in which the sugar OH groups act as both acceptors and donors, and the coordination of multiple hydrogen bonds by water molecules(1.Bundle D.R. Young N.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 666-673Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As for their energetics, titration microcalorimetry has indicated that these interactions are usually enthalpy-driven and that water reorganization, especially desolvation, is a key feature of complexation(2.Toone E.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 719-728Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Kinetics of the interactions are less well known but are obviously important in understanding the subtleties of carbohydrate-mediated biological events. Without consideration of the time factor, analysis of these interactions from a biological standpoint is difficult. The development of surface plasmon resonance techniques has provided an opportunity to explore biomolecular interaction in real time.

It was observed that mutants that existed largely in the dimeric state displayed classical association kinetics, which in turn led to the realization that the wild-type biphasic association kinetics were the result of trace amounts of scFv dimer in the preparations.

Unreacted moieties on the surface were blocked with ethanolamine. The serogroup B O-polysaccharide is comprised of up to 25 tetrasaccharide repeating units, and the carbohydrate content of the BSA-conjugates indicated that on average each BSA molecule was coupled to four polysaccharide chains. ( 2E. Altman, unpublished results.) In view of the high degree of polymerization of the polysaccharide, the neoglycoprotein should be quite homogeneous with respect to carbohydrate presentation. Conjugate concentrations of 20 μg/ml and contact times of 5 min at a flow rate of 3 μl/min gave approximately 200 RU of immobilized material, where one RU corresponds to an immobilized protein concentration of ∼1 pg/mm2(12.Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Control BSA surfaces were prepared in an analogous manner. All measurements were carried out in HEPES-buffered saline that contained 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P-20 (Pharmacia Biosensor). Analyses were performed at 25°C and at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. Surfaces were regenerated with 13 μl of 10 mM HCl at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. When purified monomers and dimers were assayed, they were prepared using a Superdex 75 column equilibrated with HEPES-buffered saline and were analyzed by SPR immediately after isolation. For the calculation of association rate constants, samples were appropriately diluted in HEPES-buffered saline and analyzed at several antibody concentrations. Samples which gave a significant buffer-related RU change on injection were also analyzed on a blank BSA surface. For the calculation of dissociation rate constants, relatively high concentrations of antibody were used, and the kinject command was used to inject 10 μl of 100 μM free trisaccharide, α-D-Gal(1→2)[α-D-Abe(1→3)]α-D-Man, over the sensor chip surface immediately following the sample injection. Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data (13.O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) using the BIAevaluation 2.0 software (Pharmacia Biosensor). The dissociation rate constant is derived using the equation Rt=Rt0e−koff(t−t0)(Eq. 1) where Rt is the response at time t, Rt0 is the amplitude of the response, and koff is the dissociation rate constant. Dissociation of two components can be treated as the sum two independent events where each is described by an equation of the above form. The association rate constant can then be derived using the equation Rt=konCRmax(1−e−(konC+koff)t)konC+koff(Eq. 2) where Rt is the response at time t, Rmax is the maximum response, C is the concentration of ligate in solution, kon is the association rate constant, and koff is the dissociation rate constant. A two component association is treated as the sum of two independent events, each described by an equation of the above form. Rate constants were also calculated by using linear transformations of the sensorgram data and the equation ks=konC+koff(Eq. 3) where Ks is the slope of a dRU/dt versus RU plot. A range of concentrations are analyzed, and a plot of Ksversus C has a slope of kon and a Y-intercept of koff. Affinities were calculated from rate constants and from analysis of equilibrium binding. By measuring equilibrium resonance units as a function of ligand concentration, binding data can be analyzed by Scatchard plots using the equation ReqC=KaRmax−KaReq(Eq. 4) where Req is the equilibrium resonance units, Rmax is the resonance signal at saturation, C is the concentration of free protein, and Ka is the association constant. A plot of Req/C versus C has a slope of -Ka. Size exclusion HPLC showed that although the wild-type scFv product was almost exclusively monomeric, many of the better binding mutants isolated by phage display from partially randomized libraries (9.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Brousseau R. Lowary T.L. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two amino acid substitutions in the heavy chain (M34I and G109S in mutant B5-1) gave a product that was almost entirely dimer. Dimers were of the type in which the light chain variable domain of one scFv interacts with the heavy chain variable domain of a second scFv(9.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Brousseau R.

Trace amounts of dimers or higher oligomers in antibody fragment preparations were observed to dramatically affect the sensorgram profiles obtained with BSA-O-polysaccharide surfaces. Prior to size-exclusion HPLC, the wild-type scFv gave distinctly biphasic association and dissociation kinetics (Fig. 1A), whereas analysis of monomeric fractions obtained by HPLC showed rapid association and dissociation kinetics with little evidence of biphasic behavior (Fig. 1B). With purified monomer, much higher concentrations were required to achieve the levels of binding obtained with unfractionated scFv containing dimer. Fab preparations also contained traces of aggregates that caused biphasic association patterns if not removed by HPLC. Mutant scFv that existed primarily as dimers, such as B5-1 (Fig. 1C), showed monophasic association phases. Contamination of dimer preparations with trace amounts of monomer did not compromise the results because at identical concentrations, dimer response was approximately 100-fold higher than of its monomeric equivalent. In selecting representative scFv mutants, isolated from phage libraries(8.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Michniewicz J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol.

Obtaining suitable monomeric preparations was more problematic because of the need to eliminate all dimer. The dissociation kinetics of wild-type Fab and scFv as well as several mutant scFv isolated from phage display libraries (8.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Michniewicz J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R.

In all instances, the dissociation data were collected in the presence of free trisaccharide because this significantly increased the rate of release of both monomeric and dimeric scFv from immobilized BSA-O-polysaccharide, even at higher antibody concentrations, which should have minimized rebinding (Fig. 2, A and B). The dissociation phases of monomeric Fab and several monomeric scFv preparations showed good curve fitting to the monoexponential decay model (Fig. 3). The koff values obtained for all wild-type and mutant forms fell in a narrow range around 0.25 s-1 (Table 1).Figure 3:Curve fitting of monomeric wild-type scFv dissociation phase to the BIA evaluation single-component model.

This was also true for dimer (mutant B5-1) dissociation (Fig. 4, C and D) and is thought to result from both monovalent and bivalent attachment of the dimers to the surface. The availability and accessibility of sites on the repeating epitope antigen would always lead to some monovalent attachment, particularly at antibody concentrations that give binding approaching Rmax. In each instance, the faster of the two off-rates was quite similar to the rates obtained with pure monomers, although the short linker scFv (SLA-1), IgG, and B4-3 had somewhat slower rates (Table 1). The extremely fast off-rates associated with Fab and scFv monomer binding resulted in association phases that had very narrow analysis windows at the antibody concentrations required to obtain adequate signals. Nevertheless, in most instances, nonlinear analysis of appropriate parts of sensorgrams gave good curve fitting to the monoexponential association model (Fig. 5A). The narrow analysis windows made linear analysis of the association data more difficult, but rates were obtained for the Fab and two of the scFv mutants (Table 1). The values obtained, by both methods, for the Fab and scFv fell in a relatively narrow range around 4 × 104M-1 s-1 (Table 1). The association profiles of monomeric scFv containing trace amounts of dimer fit well to the biexponential interaction model (Fig. 5B), but analyses of this type did not yield useful information. The initial rapid binding part of the sensorgram, attributed to monomer, was difficult to analyze because of the time factor, and analysis of the second phase, attributed to dimer, was not feasible due to the uncertainties in estimating the dimer concentration. The binding profiles obtained with IgG and scFv preparations that were predominantly dimer were more amenable to on-rate analysis. Using the nonlinear analysis method, the plotted residuals indicated that the association data fit well to the single exponential function (Fig. 5C). Association rate constants were approximately 2 × 105M-1 s-1 for the three scFv dimers that were examined (Table 1). Interestingly, Se155-4 IgG was observed to have an association rate constant that was 3-5 times slower than the dimeric scFv (Table 1). On-rates determined by linear transformation of the data and the concentration dependence of binding were in excellent agreement with those obtained by nonlinear fitting of the primary data (Table 1, Fig. 6). Binding affinities of Se155-4 Fab, monomeric and dimeric scFv, and IgG were also determined by equilibrium binding and Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 7). The Kd values thus obtained for Fab and monomeric scFv binding were all very similar (approximately 6 × 10-6M). Curved Scatchard plots, typical of bivalent interactions(15.Pellequer J.L. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 955-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were obtained for IgG and dimeric scFv. In such instances, the slope at lower site occupancy was used to derive an affinity for bivalent binding. Unfortunately, the slope at higher occupancy did not give an accurate affinity for monovalent binding because there is still a considerable amount of bivalent binding in this part of the plot. The much sharper break in the dimeric scFv plot relative to the IgG plot is in agreement with the on-rate differences given in Table 1. Dimeric scFv exhibited affinities that were about 100-fold higher, whereas the affinity of IgG was only 25-fold higher than that of the monovalent fragments (Table 2). Thus, equilibrium binding analysis can provide an alternative means of determining on-rates from the Kd values derived from Scatchard plots and off-rates measured in the presence of free trisaccharide (Table 2). This may be the most accurate method of determining kon for monovalent fragments that rapidly reach Req at the analyte concentrations required for adequate binding.TABLE 2 Open table in a new tab A comparison of affinities determined by SPR methods and titration microcalorimetry is given in Table 3. Derivation of affinities from kinetic constants and equilibrium binding gave comparable results. For monovalent fragments, the BSA-O-polysaccharide binding affinities were also in reasonably good agreement with those obtained for solution binding of the trisaccharide epitope by titration microcalorimetry. If the IgG Kd was calculated using the monovalent off-rate (kofffast), SPR and titration microcalorimetry gave similar affinities, 2.6 × 10-6M and 4.8 × 10-6M, respectively. However, the B5-1 dimer affinity calculated using the fast off-rate was over 10-fold higher than that measured by calorimetry.TABLE 3 Open table in a new tab The kinetics of complex association and dissociation is an aspect of carbohydrate recognition by proteins that has been virtually inaccessible, but it is only when this component is also considered that a complete picture will emerge as to how carbohydrates exert their biological activity. It is possible to obtain rate constants for protein-carbohydrate interactions by fluorescence (16.Maeda H. Schmidt-Kessen A. Engel J. Jaton J.-C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4086-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and NMR (17.Brewer C.F. Sternlicht H. Marcus D.M. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4448-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) methods, but these approaches are not generally applicable. Shinohara et al.(18.Shinohara Y. Kim F. Shimizu M. Goto M. Tosu M. Hasegawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SPR could be used to study the specificities of different lectins for various glycopeptides but did not attempt to analyze the contribution of lectin valence to observed rate constants. The present investigation represents the first comprehensive effort to derive kinetic constants for a protein-carbohydrate interaction by means of SPR and is another demonstration that SPR is a very useful tool in the study of low affinity interactions. Other examples are peptide/major histocompatibility complex binding to T-cell receptors (19.Corr M. Slanetz A.E. Boyd L.F. Jelonek M.T. Khilko S. Al-Ramadi B. Kim Y.S. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Margulies D.H. Science. 1994; 265: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20.Matsui K. Boniface J.J. Steffner P. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12862-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and transient cellular interactions involving cell adhesion molecules (21.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that extreme care must be exercised in the interpretation of SPR data for protein-sugar interactions, largely because of the repetitive nature of most carbohydrate ligands. Failure to recognize bivalent and multivalent interactions can lead to misinterpretation of results and overestimations of the intrinsic affinities of these systems. Others have also cautioned that multimeric interactions may be a common source of incorrect results when measuring low affinity interactions by SPR(21.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Another important precaution is that samples be run on control surfaces, because at the protein concentrations required for analysis of low affinity binding, the amounts of free protein entering the dextran matrix of the sensor chip are sufficient to give a substantial increase in RUs. When properly collected, the SPR data yielded affinity measurements that were in good agreement with those obtained by titration microcalorimetry. Using equilibrium binding data obtained by SPR, the Kdvalues of Se155-4 Fab and wild-type scFv were estimated to be 6.5 μM and 6.8 μM, respectively, for interaction with O-polysaccharide, compared with microcalorimetry values of 4.8 μM for Fab and 7.7 μM for scFv, with trisaccharide ligand. The observation that the biphasic association profiles obtained with some scFv preparations are characteristic of monovalent fragments containing trace amounts amounts of dimer or higher oligomer necessitates some reinterpretation of earlier results for Se155-4 binding(8.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Michniewicz J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9533-9538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T.

It is now clear that previous analyses of biphasic association profiles were conducted on the part of the sensorgram resulting from binding of the minor dimeric component. Although the faster on-rates exhibited by dimers partially compensated for the overestimation of binding analyte concentrations, the reported on-rates for the wild-type Se155-4 scFv were, nonetheless, somewhat lower than the actual monomer values. The results presented here address the question of how much of an affinity gain is conferred by the presence of a second combining site. Crothers and Metzger (22.Crothers D.M. Metzger H. Immunochemistry. 1972; 9: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) proposed that the observed affinity of a molecule such as IgG is the product of two binding constants, the first being that of a monovalent fragment of the antibody and the second being the dimensionless constant for the second site, once the first site is occupied. A gain is only obtained if the antigen is multivalent or attached to a surface. However, Jencks (23.Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) has pointed out that the binding energy of a dimeric molecule contains an interaction energy term and is not simply the sum of the two component binding energies. A comparison of monomeric and dimeric Se155-4 scFv showed that divalency led to a 5-fold increase in association rate. A similar finding was reported for IgG3 binding to a multivalent carbohydrate antigen, and the effect was attributed to the tendency of IgG3 to aggregate(24.Cooper L.J.N. Robertson D. Granzow R. Greenspan N. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, Se155-4 IgG did not exhibit a significantly faster on-rate than the monovalent forms. This may reflect a more unfavorable interaction energy because of less flexibility or more unfavorable steric interactions associated with the IgG form. The dissociation data, collected in the presence of free trisaccharide, indicate that divalency decreases off-rates approximately 20-fold, which in combination with the faster on-rates translates into a 100-fold increase in functional affinity due to scFv bivalency. However, the dimer dissociation rates in the absence of free ligand, which are approximately 2 × 10-3 s-1(9.Deng S.-J. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Brousseau R. Lowary T.L. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4992-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), may give a more accurate indication of the effect of divalency in vivo. If these off-rate values are used in affinity calculations, a 1000-fold gain is conferred by scFv bivalency. In some instances at least, the considerable amount of monovalent attachment of bivalent molecules as binding approaches Rmax enables the calculation of monovalent or intrinsic affinities. Although it is difficult to derive on-rates from the association phases of sensorgrams for analyte concentrations giving near Rmax binding, analysis of the dissociation phases yields both monomeric and dimeric off-rates. Analysis of binding at low analyte concentration gives accurate measurement of dimer on-rates. For Se155-4 IgG, the fact that the IgG on-rate was the same as that of the monovalent Fab fragment made it possible to calculate an an intrinsic affinity from rate constants that was in good agreement with that obtained by microcalorimetry. This should be possible for other multivalent interactions with low intrinsic affinities, such as lectin-carbohydrate binding, provided the off-rates are not too rapid to be measured by SPR and that the monomer and dimer on-rates are similar. The extremely fast dissociation rates were the most striking feature of the binding kinetics described here. Presumably, this is typical of protein-carbohydrate interactions in general and is the reason for their low intrinsic affinities. Fluorescence (16.Maeda H. Schmidt-Kessen A. Engel J. Jaton J.-C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4086-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and NMR (17.Brewer C.F. Sternlicht H. Marcus D.M. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4448-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) methods have given on-rates for other protein-carbohydrate interactions that are similar to those reported here. These methods have also indicated that fast off-rates are responsible for the low affinities of protein-carbohydrate interactions and that differences in binding constants are primarily the result of differences in off-rates. It is not known if there is a biological reason for these fast rates or if they result from the types of atomic interactions that drive protein-carbohydrate interactions. It may reflect the fact that higher intrinsic affinities are not necessary because repeating epitopes and clustering of glycoproteins and glycolipids on membrane surfaces give large effective ligand concentrations and permit adequate binding through multivalent attachment. Monomeric affinities that are not higher than those needed for exertion of biological function may safeguard against self-recognition. In summary, SPR has been shown to provide new insights into the subtleties of protein-carbohydrate interactions. The affinity gain conferred by bivalency has been quantitated, and it was shown that scFv dimers offer an advantage over whole antibodies in this regard. The observation that rapid off-rates are responsible for the low intrinsic affinity of Se155-4 and probably carbohydrate-binding proteins in general raises the possibility of engineering higher affinity by manipulating the dissociation rate constants.

The transcriptional start site of the chromosomal ars mRNA was mapped by primer extension, and putative −10 and −35 promoter recognition sites were identified. The arsR gene, the first gene in this operon, was cloned using polymerase chain reaction. The arsR gene product, the ArsR repressor, was expressed and purified. The results of gel mobility shift assays indicated that the repressor is a DNA binding protein that binds to a fragment of DNA containing the chromosomal ars promoter. The specific binding site, as determined by DNase I footprint analysis, spans 33 nucleotides in the promoter region, including the putative −35 promoter element. By construction and expression of a series of in-frame fusions between truncated arsR genes and the coding region for the mature form of β-lactamase (blaM′), it was shown that ArsR is a trans-acting repressor that regulates expression of the chromosomal ars operon. In addition, the chromosomally-encoded repressor can regulate expression of the ars operon of plasmid R773, and the R773 repressor can cross-regulate expression from the chromosomal operon. Plasmid-encoded arsenical resistance (ars) operons confer high level resistance to arsenicals and antimonials, while the chromosomally encoded ars operon of Escherichia coli bestows low level resistance. The transcriptional start site of the chromosomal ars mRNA was mapped by primer extension, and putative −10 and −35 promoter recognition sites were identified.

By construction and expression of a series of in-frame fusions between truncated arsR genes and the coding region for the mature form of β-lactamase (blaM′), it was shown that ArsR is a trans-acting repressor that regulates expression of the chromosomal ars operon. In addition, the chromosomally-encoded repressor can regulate expression of the ars operon of plasmid R773, and the R773 repressor can cross-regulate expression from the chromosomal operon. The Escherichia coli chromosomal ars operon was identified first by analysis of the E. coli genome (Sofia et al., 1994) and later by examination of metal-responsive gene fusions (Diorio et al., 1995). It was shown to have three open reading frames, originally termed arsEFG that were subsequently renamed arsRBC (Carlin et al., 1995) because of their high degree of sequence similarity to the plasmid R773 homologues (Chen et al., 1986; San Francisco et al., 1990). The chromosomal operon was shown to confer resistance to arsenite and antimonite in E. coli, with resistance correlating with increased extrusion of arsenite (Carlin et al., 1995), as has been shown for the plasmid-encoded resistances (for reviews, see Dey and Rosen(1995) and Rosen et al.(1995)). The level of resistance conferred by the chromosomal operon was considerably less than the high level of resistance produced by the operons of the staphylococcal plasmids pI258 and pSX267 (Ji and Silver, 1992; Rosenstein et al., 1992) or the E. coli plasmids R773 or R46 (Hedges and Baumberg, 1973; Silver et al., 1981; Mobley et al., 1984). In all plasmid-borne ars operons, transcription was controlled by the ArsR repressor, the product of the first gene of each operon. These are all members of the ArsR family of regulatory proteins (Shi et al., 1994). Other members of the ArsR family include Cd2+/Zn2+ regulatory proteins (Yoon et al., 1991; Ivey et al., 1992; Morby et al., 1993). All are believed to be metal-inducible repressor proteins that control the basal level expression of their respective operons (Wu and Rosen, 1991, 1993; Morby et al., 1993; Rosenstein et al., 1994). The E. coli chromosomal arsR gene encodes a 13-kDa protein, ArsR, in which 75% of the residues (88 of 117) are identical to those of the plasmid R773 repressor in primary amino acid sequence but only 26% (34 of 117) are identical to the staphylococcal plasmids pI258 or pSX267 ArsR proteins (Carlin et al., 1995). In this study, the chromosomal protein was shown to be a trans-acting regulator of both the E. coli chromosomal and the R773 plasmid ars operons. The gene was expressed at a high level, and ArsR was purified. The purified protein eluted from a gel filtration at a position corresponding with that of a 26-kDa homodimer. In gel shift DNA binding assays, the purified protein retarded the migration of DNA fragments containing either the chromosomal or R773 plasmid ars promoters. From DNase I footprint analysis, the ArsR binding site was found to span nucleotides −64 to −31 of the chromosomal operon. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium at 37°C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (80 μg/ml), tetracycline (15 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) were added as required. For protein expression, 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside or 20 μM sodium arsenite were used as inducer, except where otherwise noted. Plasmid pCX1 was made by cloning the SphI and XmaIII fragment from pWPS1 (Carlin et al., 1995) into vector plasmid pJBS633 (Broome-Smith and Spratt, 1986) that had been digested with both SphI and XmaIII. This fragment contained 630 bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)DTTdithiothreitolEDTAethylenediaminetetraacetatePAOphenylarsine oxidePCRpolymerase chain reaction.) upstream of the translational initiation point of the arsR gene, the entire arsR gene, and part of the arsB gene. To remove a PvuII site upstream of the ars promoter but within the insert, a XcmI fragment was deleted from plasmid pCX1, producing plasmid pCX2. Removal of the PvuII site allowed the PvuII site in front of the blaM′ gene to be used for construction of arsR::blaM fusions (see below). To delete the tet promoter in the vector sequence, plasmid pCX2 was digested with BssHII and EcoRV, filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and intramolecularly ligated to produce plasmid pCX3. Plasmid pCX11 was created by ligating the HindIII-EcoRV fragment, which consists of 630 bp upstream of the translational initiation point of arsR, the entire arsR gene, and part of the arsB gene from plasmid pWPS1 into pJBS633 that had been digested with both HindIII and EcoRV. Plasmid pCX12 was derived from plasmid pCX11 by cloning the EcoRI-ScaI fragment containing the chromosomal ars promoter and arsR gene into EcoRI-ScaI-digested plasmid pACYC184 (Chang and Cohen, 1978).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab base pair(s) dithiothreitol ethylenediaminetetraacetate phenylarsine oxide polymerase chain reaction. Preparation of plasmid DNA was performed by using a Wizard DNA purification kit (Promega). Endo- and exonuclease digestions, DNA fragments separations and isolations, ligations, transformations, and Klenow fragment fill in were performed according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989) unless otherwise noted. The Sequenase kit (version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was employed for sequencing of double-stranded DNA. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) (Mullis and Faloona, 1987) were run on a Stratagene Robocycler 40 thermal cycler. The reactions contained in a final volume of 50 μl of 2 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.1 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.25 μg of each primer, and 20 μg of DNA. Each reaction was overlaid with 20 μl of light mineral oil and cycled 30 times: 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 0.5 min, 72°C for 1 min, followed by a single cycle at 72°C for 10 min. Two PCR primers were used for PCR cloning of the arsR gene. The forward primer had the sequence 5′-ATCAGGAGCGCCATATGTC-3′. This introduces an NdeI site at the start codon of the arsR gene by changing the third A before the start codon ATG in the original sequence to C. The reverse primer had the sequence 5′-TCCCGGATAAAACACATCTG-3′, corresponding to the 20 nucleotides immediately downstream of the coding segment of the arsR gene. The PCR product was first cloned into vector plasmid pGEM-T (Promega), generating plasmid pCR0. The PCR product was sequenced to confirm that no errors had occurred during amplification. A 375-bp NdeI fragment was then isolated from pCR0 and cloned into the expression vector pT7-7 (Tabor and Richardson, 1985). Plasmid pCR1 was shown to have the insert in the proper orientation for expression. Cells of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) bearing construct pCR1 were grown overnight in LB medium containing ampicillin at 37°C. The culture was diluted to 100-fold with fresh, prewarmed medium and grown at 37°C. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.8, expression of the arsR gene was induced by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for an additional 3 h. Under these growth conditions, the majority of ArsR was found as a soluble protein in the cytosolic fraction. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 14.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The pelleted cells were suspended in 5 ml of buffer A/g of wet cells and disrupted by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and membranes were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a 2.5-cm diameter column filled to 22 cm with S-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with 600 ml of a linear gradient of 0.1-0.8 M NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions of 6 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970). Fractions containing ArsR were pooled and concentrated. A portion of the concentrated protein was applied to a 2-cm diameter column filled to 45 cm with Superose 12 (Pharmacia) and eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 M NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and those containing ArsR were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −70°C until use. From the intensity of staining, ArsR was judged to be approximately 80-90% pure. To create a series of chromosomal arsR::blaM′ gene fusions, plasmid pCX3 was linearized by digestion at the unique XmaIII site followed by exonuclease III digestion. The digestion products were removed at various times during ExoIII digestion and pooled. The ends were flushed with S1 nuclease, followed by digestion with PvuII. The resulting linear fragments were self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and the ligation mixture was transformed into cells of E. coli strain JM109 made competent by the method of Chung et al.(1989). Kanamycin-resistant transformants were selected. Cells with in-frame fusions of arsR gene to the portion of the blaM′ gene containing the coding region of the mature form of the TEM β-lactamase were identified by growth as patches on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μM sodium arsenite, and confirmed by digestion of BamHI and PstI. To determine the fusion site of blaM′ with arsR, plasmids were sequenced using a primer with the sequence 5′-GTCGTGCACCCAACTGA-3′, which is complementary to codons 14-18 of the mature form of TEM β-lactamase. The resulting arsR::blaM′ fusion plasmids were named as the pCRB series, with the numbers representing the amino acid residue number of the ArsR protein to which the mature TEM β-lactamase was fused. Cells of E. coli strain AW10 bearing each arsR::blaM′ fusion plasmid alone or both the fusion plasmid and plasmid pCX12, which contains a wild-type arsR gene, were grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium containing kanamycin or both kanamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively. The cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh LB medium and grown at 37°C to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm, at which time 50 μM sodium arsenite was added as inducer. Growth was continued at 37°C for 1 h following induction. The cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 0.1 ml of SDS sample buffer for analysis. For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellose membrane using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet (0.2 μm pore size) and immunoblotted as described previously (Tisa and Rosen, 1990). A chemiluminescent assay was used to detect the antigen-antibody reaction. The filter was incubated with 10 ml of the enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Amersham Corp.) and exposed on x-ray film for 1 min at room temperature. TRI Reagent(™) RNA/DNA/protein isolation reagent (MRC, Inc.) was used to isolated total cellular RNA according to the manufacturer's directions from cells of E. coli strain JM109 carrying plasmid pWPS1 induced with 20 μM sodium arsenite. RNA was suspended in ethanol and stored at −70°C until use. A primer, 5′-CCAGACGGGTTTCATCAGCAAGAATTTTG-3′, corresponding to a region within the coding sequence of arsR, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP was used for primer extension analysis (Sambrook et al., 1989). Total RNA was mixed with end-labeled primer, dNTPs, and Superscript II RNaseH− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primer extension product was loaded on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gel. A size ladder produced by dideoxy sequencing of plasmid pWPS1 with the same primer used in the primer extension reaction was used to measure the length of the primer extension product. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays were performed as described previously (Wu and Rosen, 1993). A fragment including the regulatory region DNA and start of the arsR gene was generated by PCR using the primer extension oligonucleotide and a second primer with the sequence 5′-CGGAATTCCGACGCAAAGTC-3′, containing an EcoRI site at the 5′-end. The purified PCR product was digested with MunI, labeled with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and purified using a Wizard DNA purification kit (Promega). This 208-bp labeled fragment was prepared for gel mobility shift assay and coding strand footprinting. For footprinting the non-coding strand, a 203-bp fragment was prepared by digesting the purified PCR product with TfiI and was labeled as described above. A DNA probe carrying the plasmid R773 ars promoter was prepared as described previously (Wu and Rosen, 1993). A mixture of two DNA probes containing the lac promoter (211 bp) and a nonspecific DNA fragment (111 bp) were obtained by digestion of plasmid pUC19 with BamHI and PvuII, and labeled as described above. The nucleotide size ladders were created by dideoxy sequencing of the plasmid pCX11 using primer 5′-AATTGGATGGGTAACAGAA-3′ for DNase I footprinting of the coding strand and primer 5′-ATTCACCTCCTTTCAAATG-3′ for footprinting the noncoding strand. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) is an organoarsenical containing As3+ that interacts strongly with proteins containing vicinal cysteine pairs (Hoffman and Lane, 1992). Its ability to induce the chromosomal ars operon was examined using plasmid pCRBB91, which carried a reporter construct in which the blaM′ gene was fused to the arsB gene and expression of the gene fusion was under control of the ars promoter. Cells with this plasmid become ampicillin resistance when induced from the ars promoter. At low concentrations PAO (up to 10 μM) was as or more effective an inducer of the operon in vivo than arsenite itself (Fig. 1). Higher concentrations of PAO (in excess of 0.1 mM) were toxic, producing a zone of clearing around the disk. It should be pointed out, however, that in vivo induction is multifactorial, reflecting a combination of uptake and transcriptional activation. Thus efficacy in vivo may not correspond to in vitro action. As shown below, PAO is considerably more effective in in vitro assays than either arsenite or antimonite. This is the first demonstration of induction of an ars operon by an organoarsenical. The arsR gene was isolated from the E. coli chromosomal ars operon by PCR, and ArsR was substantially purified. From its elution from a Superose 12 column, the apparent molecular mass of ArsR was calculated to be 25.9 kDa (data not shown), close to the theoretical value of 26,504 Da for a homodimer, as had been suggested for the R773 ArsR repressor (Wu and Rosen, 1993). A series of plasmids were constructed in which the blaM′ gene was fused in-frame to the arsR gene. Eight translational fusions were obtained, with the fusion junctions from the 20th to the 114th aminoacyl residue of the 117-residue ArsR protein (Fig. 2). To study expression of the ArsR-β-lactamase chimeras, the eight fusions were individually transformed into cells of E. coli strain AW10, in which the chromosomal ars operon has been deleted (Carlin et al., 1995). Proteins from uninduced cells or cells induced with arsenite were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with antibody to β-lactamase (Fig. 3A). Chimeras in which the fusion sites were at residues 20, 69, 74, and 79 of the ArsR proteins were produced in both arsenite-induced and uninduced cells, indicating that these chimeric proteins were constitutively expressed. In contrast, the hybrid ArsR-β-lactamase proteins from plasmids with fusions at codons 92, 101, 104, or 114 of the arsR gene were visible only in arsenite-induced cells. Thus expression of the chimeric proteins in these four fusions remained inducible by arsenite.Figure 3:Expression of the arsR::blaM′ fusion genes and their regulation by arsR in trans. Equal amounts of total cell protein from cells of E. coli strain AW3110 harboring the indicated plasmids were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by immunoblotting with antiserum against TEM β-lactamase. A, to measure expression of the fusions, cells bore plasmids pCRB20 (lanes 1 and 2), pCRB69 (lanes 3 and 4), pCRB74 (lanes 5 and 6), pCRB79 (lanes 7 and 8), pCRB92 (lanes 9 and 10), pCRB101 (lanes 11 and 12), pCRB104 (lanes 13 and 14), and pCRB114 (lanes 15 and 16). Cells were grown in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15) or presence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16) of 50 μM sodium arsenite. For reference, the arrow indicates the predicted mass of the ArsR-BlaM chimera from plasmid pCRB20. B, to examine regulation by fusions cells bore both plasmid pCX12 and arsR::blaM′ fusion plasmids pCRB69 (lanes 1 and 2), pCRB79 (lanes 3 and 4), pCRB92 (lanes 5 and 6) or pCRB114 (lanes 7 and 8). Cells were cultured without (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or with (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) 50 μM sodium arsenite.

Four arsR::blaM′ fusion plasmids, pCBR69, pCBR79, pCBR92, and pCBR104 were individually co-transformed with plasmid pCX12 into E. coli strain AW10, and expression of these four chimeric proteins with or without the inducer arsenite was monitored by immunoblotting. Immunoreactive hybrid proteins were only observed in arsenite-induced cells (Fig. 3B). Although the chimeric proteins in pCBR69 and pCBR79 were constitutively expressed in the absence of an arsR gene (Fig. 3A), in the presence of an arsR gene in trans they became inducible. There was no trans effect of a wild-type arsR gene on expression of the fusions in pCBR92 and pCBR104, in which the chimeric ArsR proteins still functioned as repressors (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that ArsR is a trans-acting regulatory protein. Furthermore, the sequence from the 92nd aminoacyl residue to the C terminus is not required for the regulatory activity of the protein. To identify the promoter responsible for chromosomal ars transcription, total RNA was isolated from cells containing plasmid pWPS1, which contains the entire chromosomal ars operon, grown in LB medium with sodium arsenite as inducer. The 5′-end of the RNA was determined by primer extension. The same primer was used in a DNA sequencing reaction with plasmid pWPS1 as template to determine the nucleotide to which the primer extension product mapped. Only one primer extension product was observed; it corresponded to a cytosine nucleotide located 16 nucleotides upstream from the ATG start codon of arsR gene (Fig. 4). Putative −10 and −35 promoter sequences were identified as GACACT and TTGACT. Gel mobility shift assays were used to examine the DNA binding activity of ArsR. Both the chromosomal and R773 ArsR proteins were able to retard the migration of DNA fragments containing either the chromosomal (Fig. 5A) or the plasmid R773 (Fig. 5B) ars promoters. However, with neither protein was a mobility shift observed with DNA fragments carrying either the lac promoter or nonspecific DNA (data not shown). The chromosomal ArsR protein could be dissociated from its promoter by addition of inducer (Fig. 6). However, neither arsenite and antimonite were very effective in vitro, requiring nonphysiological concentrations of inducer to effect dissociation. Although the explanation is unknown, a similar unresponsiveness to arsenite had been noted for the R773 and pSX267 ArsR proteins (Wu and Rosen, 1993; Rosenstein et al., 1994). On the other hand, the organoarsenical PAO was extremely effective, with 1 μM PAO sufficient to completely dissociate the repressor.Figure 6:Effect of inducers of the chromosomal ars operon on ArsR-DNA complex formation. Mobility shift assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The PCR product containing the chromosomal ars promoter region was digested with MunI, radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP and incubated with 3 μg of purified ArsR. Potential inducers were added individually to the binding mixtures. The binding mixtures were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel. All lanes contained probe DNA; lanes 2-13 also contained ArsR; lane 3, 0.5 mM potassium antimonial tartrate; lane 4, 5 mM potassium antimonial tartrate; lane 6, 0.5 mM sodium arsenite; lane 7, 5 mM sodium arsenite; lane 9, 0.1 μM PAO; lane 10, 1 μM PAO; lane 12, 0.5 mM sodium arsenate; lane 13, 5 mM sodium arsenate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using purified chromosomal ArsR, the site of binding to the chromosomal ars regulatory region was analyzed by DNase I protection assays. A protected region of approximately 33 bp (from nucleotides −64 to −31) in both the coding strand (Fig. 7A) and the noncoding strand (Fig. 7B) was observed. Protection was prevented by addition of the inducer PAO (data not shown). R773 ArsR protected this same region of the DNA, and chromosomal ArsR protected the same region of the R773 promoter DNA as did the plasmid repressor (data not shown). The chromosomal ars operon of E. coli was originally identified by sequencing of the E. coli genome (Sofia et al., 1994). This operon is responsible for the basal level resistance to arsenite, antimonite, and arsenate in plasmidless strains of E. coli (Carlin et al., 1995). The operon has three genes, arsR, arsB, and arsC. From the 75% sequence similarity of chromosomal ArsR with the ArsR repressor encoded by the ars operon of plasmid R773 (San Francisco et al., 1990), a regulatory function was proposed for the chromosomal ArsR (Sofia et al., 1994; Carlin et al., 1995). In this study, the chromosomal arsR gene was shown to regulate expression of reporter arsR::blaM′ genes in trans (Fig. 3B). Purified chromosomal ArsR, which was found to elute from a gel filtration column at a size corresponding to that of a homodimer, bound to promoter DNA (Fig. 5). Arsenite and antimonite did not dissociate the complex in concentrations at which they induce in vivo, which may suggest that dissociation is not required for induction. On the other hand, phenylarsine oxide, the only organoarsenical found thus far to induce, prevented retardation of the promoter DNA (Fig. 6) and reversed protection from DNase I digestion at 1 μM (data not shown), the same concentration at which PAO is an inducer in vivo (Fig. 1). These results indicate that induction results when the repressor dissociates from the DNA. The region of the DNA protected from DNase I digestion by ArsR overlaps with the putative −35 element of the chromosomal ars promoter and covers the region from nucleotides −64 to −31 (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The plasmid R773 ArsR repressor has been shown to bind to the R773 ars promoter at a region of imperfect dyad symmetry just upstream of the −35 site (Wu and Rosen, 1993). Although the overall sequences of the two promoters and the location of the protected sequences are different between the two ars operons, higher resolution analysis of the R773 ArsR binding site revealed that only two small regions of 4 bp each (TCAT and TTTG of the coding strand) are protected separated by 7 bp (Wu and Rosen, 1993). Since the chromosomal ars sequence that was protected from DNase I by chromosomal ArsR also contained the TCAT and TTTG elements separated by 7 bp, it was possible that the two repressors could bind to the each other's promoter. As shown in Fig. 5, the chromosomal ArsR repressor retarded the migration of DNA containing the R773 ars promoter, and R773 ArsR retarded the corresponding chromosomal ars DNA. Both proteins protected the same regions of both promoters from DNase I digestion (data not shown). Thus the sequence TCATNNNNNNNTTTG appears to represent a consensus binding site for the two ArsR repressors. It is interesting that the chromosomal and plasmid R773-encoded ArsR proteins from E. coli are essentially interchangeable, even though the two proteins are 25% dissimilar, and their promoter regions contain significant differences in sequence and placement of the regulatory elements. On the other hand, the homologous ars repressor from the staphylococcal plasmid pSX267 protects two regions within the promoter region from DNase I digestion (Rosenstein et al., 1994), but this region does not contain TCATNNNNNNNTTTG, suggesting that it is a Gram-negative consensus sequence. The binding of the ArsR repressors to each other promoters may have physiological significance; in vivo when the chromosomal arsR gene was carried on a compatible plasmid with lacZ gene fused to the R773 ars promoter, expression of the reporter gene became arsenite inducible (data not shown). We would propose that all members of the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins contain at least four domains. First, we have shown that a putative DNA binding domain in the R773 repressor is required for repression (Shi et al., 1994). Second, we have shown that Cys-32 and Cys-34 of R773 ArsR are part of a metal binding domain involved in induction (Shi et al., 1994). However, in the ArsR family of transcriptional repressors, both arsenic/antimony and cadmium/zinc responsive repressors have this cysteine pair. To account for differential recognition of metals, we would propose the existence of an additional metal discrimination domain in the cadmium/zinc responsive regulatory proteins. In those repressors, there is an additional N-terminal sequence with two cysteinyl residues that might provide this function. Finally, the ArsR repressors are most likely functional homodimers, which indicates the existence of a dimerization domain. When the mature form of β-lactamase was fused to the ArsR protein at residue 92, 101, 104, or 114, expression of the chimeric protein was still inducible, indicating that residues 92 to the C terminus are not required for ArsR function. Similar results were obtained for C-terminal chimeras of R773 ArsR (Wu and Rosen, 1991), and those chimeras were shown to be bind to the promoter DNA as dimers (Wu and Rosen, 1993). These results demonstrate that information required for dimerization is not contained in residues from 92 to the C terminus. On the other hand, chimeras with fusions at residues 79 or closer to the N terminus were constitutively expressed. Similar chimeras in R773 ArsR were unable to bind to DNA. These results suggest that residues in the region of 79-92 may be involved in dimerization. In conclusion, members of the ArsR family of repressor proteins are postulated to have a metal binding domain, followed by a DNA binding domain. In some members there may also be an N-terminal metal discrimination domain. Finally, there is most likely a dimerization domain that may require residues C-terminal to the DNA binding domain. A more detailed analysis of these proteins will be necessary to identify this domain."

Life Sci. 1992; 50: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and are thought to do this by interaction with the VIP-2/PACAP-3 receptor(10.Usdin T.B. Bonner T.I. Mezey E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2662-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which has been cloned(11.Inagaki N. Yoshida H. Mizuta M. Mizuno N. Fujii Y. Gonoi T. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This receptor binds VIP and PACAP with similar affinities and has a selective tissue distribution. PACAP exists in two amidated forms: PACAP-27 and the C-terminally extended variant PACAP-38(12.Miyata A. Jiang L. Dahl R.D. Kitada C. Kubo K. Fujino M. Minamino N. Arimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 1-28 sequence of PACAP-38 shows 68% sequence homology with VIP(13.Kimura C. Ohkubo S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Itoh Y.

PACAP is an extremely potent modulator of insulin secretion and has been reported to augment glucose-stimulated insulin release from rat pancreatic islets at a concentration of 0.1 pM(14.Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both VIP and PACAP are localized in the gastrointestinal tract, and the pancreas and VIP- and PACAP-like immunoreactivity was observed in capillaries and nerve fibres terminating on pancreatic islets(15.Bishop A.E. Polak J.M. Green I.C. Bryant M.B. Bloom S.R. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16.Fridolf T. Sundler F. Ahren B. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PACAP-specific staining has been detected even within the islet in rat(14.Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The VIP/PACAP family of peptides are thought to couple positively to the adenylyl cyclase system in their target cells. In some cell types, they increase [Ca2+]i. In accordance with this, in single cell studies in the presence of 8.3 mM glucose, 80% of rat pancreatic β-cells responded to PACAP with a rise in [Ca2+]i, a rise that was blocked by nitrendipine (14.Yada T. Sakurada M. Ihida K. Nakata M. Murata F. Arimura A. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1290-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the mouse β-cell, VIP-stimulated insulin secretion was not associated with a detectable rise in cyclic AMP levels(17.Wahl M.A. Straub S.G. Ammon H.P.T. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a finding that suggests the possibility of an action independent of cyclic AMP and activation of PKA. Furthermore, in AtT20 cells, the stimulation of β-endorphin secretion by VIP was unaffected by the stable expression of mutated regulatory subunits of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, an expression that blocked the effects of isoproterenol and analogs of cyclic AMP(18.Schecterson L.C. McKnight G.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that VIP could stimulate β-endorphin secretion by a mechanism that did not involve cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.In view of these data, we have reinvestigated the mechanisms of action of these peptides to stimulate insulin release. The HIT-T15 β-cell line was used, and careful attention was paid to the temporal aspects of the second messenger responses and their effect on insulin secretion. The results showed that the peptides increase cyclic AMP and [Ca2+]i levels only transiently, but they exert a prolonged stimulatory effect on insulin secretion. The prolonged stimulation of insulin secretion by VIP and PACAP is manifest after [Ca2+]i and cyclic AMP levels have returned to basal values. It is unlikely therefore that either cyclic AMP or raised [Ca2+]i is responsible for the prolonged stimulation of release. Finally, it was found that the prolonged release induced by VIP and PACAP, but not the release induced by forskolin or glucose, was selectively inhibited by low concentrations of wortmannin. Wortmannin, a microbial metabolite found in a variety of fungal species, is known to be an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) with IC50 values between 2 and 4 nM(19.Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindey G. Vlahos C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, wortmannin has been linked to the inhibition of phospholipase D (20.Carrasco-Marin E. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Leyva-Cobian F. Eur. J.

The selective inhibition of PACAP- and VIP-stimulated insulin release by low concentrations of wortmannin points to a novel signal transduction pathway in the action of these peptides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHIT-T15 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37°C in a 95% air plus 5% CO2 atmosphere. The experiments were performed during passages 72-80.Insulin SecretionStatic incubation experiments were carried out in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer of the following composition: 129 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 10 mM HEPES, bovine serum albumin at 0.1%, and the indicated glucose concentrations at pH 7.4. HIT cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C. After removing the preincubation buffer, they were then exposed for another 30 min to fresh KRB buffer containing the test agents. Samples of the incubation medium were collected, centrifuged, and stored at −20°C until radioimmunoassay was performed using a charcoal separation method.For the measurement of insulin release under perifusion conditions, approximately 3 × 106 cells were placed in each of 4 chambers of a perifusion apparatus. Experiments were performed in KRB buffer at 37°C at flow rates of 1 ml/min. The cells were preperifused for 50 min for stabilization of the secretion rates and then exposed to test and control conditions as appropriate. Samples were collected at 1-min intervals and kept at −20°C until assayed.Insulin content of the cells was measured after extraction in 1% Triton X-100 and freezing the cells overnight.Measurement of Cytosolic Free Calcium ([Ca2+]4)HIT cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min in KRB (pH 7.4) in the presence of 1 μM fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester at 37°C under continuous shaking. The fura-2 loaded cells were washed 3 times with modified KRB buffer. 3 ml of the final cell suspension were placed in each quartz cuvette. During the experiments, the cell suspension was maintained at a temperature of 36-37°C and continuously stirred while in the spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS-5). Excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm were used. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was calculated according to the formula by Tsien et al.(24.Tsien R.H. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar).Membrane PotentialQualitative changes in membrane potential were fluorometrically monitored using the fluorescent dye bisoxonol. About 2 × 106 cells were suspended in a cuvette, and bisoxonol was added at a final concentration of 100 nM. The signal was allowed to stabilize for about 20 min before the test agents were added. The signals were monitored using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 540 and 580 nm for excitation and emission, respectively.Measurement of Cellular Cyclic AMP LevelsHIT cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C in KRB buffer. The solution was replaced by KRB buffer containing the test agents, and the incubations were carried out for the indicated time periods. The reaction was terminated by removing the buffer and adding 0.25 ml of ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid to each well. The cells were scraped free, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were extracted 4 times with ether, evaporated to dryness, and then reconstituted in acetate buffer. Cyclic AMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay. The cell pellet was solubilized in 0.1 M NaOH, and the protein content was determined by the Bradford assay(25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and PI 3-Kinase AssayApproximately 2 × 106 HIT-T15 cells/well were incubated for the indicated times in the presence or absence of glucose, VIP, PACAP, and wortmannin as appropriate at 37°C. Then, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by rocking at 4°C for 20 min in a buffer of the following composition: 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. Immunoprecipitation and kinase assay were performed as described by Kaplan et al.(26.Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) with modifications. The lysates were clarified by spinning at 11,000 rpm for 15 min in an Eppendorff centrifuge, and PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 polyclonal antibody for 2 h (at 4°C) and collected on Pansorbin (Calbiochem) over 1 h. After washing (once with lysis buffer + Triton X-100 and twice in lysis buffer without Triton), the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5)). The PI 3-kinase reaction was started by addition of 10 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol, 50 μM ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the kinase buffer. The assays were performed at room temperature and stopped with 100 μl of HCl after 5 min. Lipids were extracted from the lower organic phase after the addition of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1), washed, and spotted on a thin-layer chromatography plate (EM Science), which had been impregnated with potassium oxalate in methanol/water (2:3) and preactivated by heating at 110°C for 60 min before spotting. The lipids were resolved by chromatography in CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH/water (86:76:10:4), and radioactivity was detected by autoradiography.Phospholipid Labeling and ExtractionThe PIP3 production was measured essentially according to the method described by Traynor-Kaplan et al.(27.Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIT-T15 cells were suspended at a density of 108 cells/ml in the labeling medium consisting of 10 mM HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 136 mM NaCl, 4.9 mM KCl, and 4 mM glucose (buffer A). 32PO4 (HCl free 500 μCi/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The cells were washed twice with the buffer A (containing 1 mM Ca2+) and resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml. Aliquots (250 μl) of the cells were incubated at 37°C for the indicated times with or without the addition of the neuropeptides. Cells were then quenched by the addition of 1.55 ml of chloroform, methanol, 8% HClO4 (50:100:5), containing the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (0.63 mg/ml) and carrier amounts of phosphoinositides, followed by vigorous stirring. Another 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of 8% HClO4 were added to separate the organic phase, which was then washed with chloroform-saturated 1% HClO4 before being dried. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (95:5) and spotted on an impregnated thin-layer chromatography plate (see above). The plate, after being developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:30:26:24:14), was dried and subjected to autoradiography.ReagentsWortmannin, forskolin, TPA, VIP, and fura-2 acetoxymethylester were obtained from Sigma. PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). The fluorescent probe bisoxonol was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. The cyclic AMP, 125I radioimmunoassay kits, [32P]orthophosphate, and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from DuPont NEN. The anti-p85 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY).Statistical AnalysisResults are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was by Student's t test for paired and unpaired data as appropriate.RESULTSConcentration-Response Characteristics for the Actions of VIP and PACAP on Insulin ReleaseIn Fig. 1 are shown the concentration-response characteristics for the action of VIP and PACAP to stimulate insulin release in the HIT-T15 cell line. The experiments were carried out under static incubation conditions over 30 min. The two left-hand bars in Fig. 1A show the basal rate of insulin release in the presence of 0.2 mM glucose and the stimulated rate with 4.0 mM glucose, respectively. The cells responded to 4 mM glucose with a 215% increase in the secretion rate. The right-hand bars illustrate the effects of VIP on insulin secretion in the presence of 4 mM glucose, at concentrations from 0.01 to 100 nM. Insulin secretion was stimulated at 0.1 nM, was maximal at 10 nM and remained at maximum stimulation through 100 nM. In Fig. 1B are shown the responses to PACAP-38. Again, the left-hand bars show the effects of 0.2 and 4.0 mM glucose, the latter inducing a 330% increase relative to 0.2 mM glucose. PACAP-38 was slightly more potent than VIP, and a small but significant increase in insulin release was obtained at 0.01 nM (p < 0.05). Stimulation was near maximal at 1 nM and maximal at 10 and 100 nM. PACAP-27 was slightly less potent than PACAP-38 and had similar concentration-response characteristics to VIP (data not shown).Glucose Dependence of the Peptide ResponsesTo determine whether glucose is required for the stimulation of insulin release by VIP and PACAP, insulin release was measured both in the absence of glucose and in the presence of a low concentration of glucose (0.2 mM). The results demonstrated a clear dependence (see Fig. 2). Only minimal effects of VIP and PACAP were detected in the absence of glucose. While 0.2 mM glucose did not stimulate insulin release above the rate of that seen in the absence of glucose, the peptides caused a marked stimulation when 0.2 mM glucose was present. The stimulation was comparable, in -fold terms, to that seen in the presence of 4 mM glucose.Figure 2:Effects of 10 nM VIP and PACAP on insulin release in the absence of glucose (three left-hand bars) and in the presence of the low glucose concentration of 0.2 mM (three right-hand bars). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for pg of insulin released/1000 cells/30 min. n = 4-7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Temporal Profile of the Stimulation of Insulin Release by VIP and PACAPInsulin release in response to VIP and PACAP was also examined under perifusion conditions to determine the pattern and duration of the responses. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3. VIP and PACAP, both used at maximally effective concentrations of 10 nM, stimulated insulin release in the presence of 4 mM glucose. The responses were prompt, and release rates reached peak values after approximately 10 min. The elevated rates of release declined only slightly after reaching these peak values and were still 2-2.5 times the rate with 4 mM glucose alone after 30 min of exposure to the peptides. Removal of the peptides from the perifusate caused a rapid decrease in the rates of insulin secretion and a return to control values after 10 min.Figure 3:Temporal profile of the effects of VIP and PACAP (both 10 nM) to stimulate insulin release. The experiments were carried out under perifusion conditions in the presence of 4 mM glucose. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for pg of insulin released/million cells/min. n = 6. ▪, control; ○, PACAP; ○, VIP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Concentration-Response Characteristics for the Actions of VIP and PACAP on Cellular Cyclic AMP LevelsBoth VIP and PACAP-38 raised cellular cyclic AMP levels. As can be seen from Fig. 4, PACAP-38 was slightly more potent than VIP, a finding in accord with the relative potencies of these two peptides on insulin secretion. In Fig. 4A are shown the stimulatory effects of VIP. At 1 nM, cyclic AMP levels were increased markedly. The maximum increase occurred at 10 and 100 nM. It can be seen from Fig. 4B that PACAP-38 caused changes similar to those seen with VIP except, again, for the increased potency. PACAP-38 caused a small increase in cyclic AMP content at 0.1 nM, a large increase at 1 nM, and maximum values at 10 and 100 nM.Figure 4:Concentration-response characteristics for the effects of VIP and PACAP-38, over the range of 0.1-100 nM, to increase cyclic AMP levels in the presence of 4 mM glucose. The measurements were made under static incubation conditions after 5 min of exposure to the peptides. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. n = 3-7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Actions of VIP and PACAP on the Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+]4)The temporal effects of VIP, PACAP, and forskolin on [Ca2+]4 can be seen from the cellular fura-2 fluorescence traces shown in Fig. 5. Addition of the two peptides, in these cases at 10 nM, was followed by prompt but small increases in [Ca2+]4, which peaked at around 30 s. In all cases, the peak was followed by a decrease lasting for about 1-1.5 min and which usually took the [Ca2+]4 to a nadir slightly below its starting value. Subsequently, the [Ca2+]4 increased to values just above basal where they remained for less than 10 min. At all times after 10 min [Ca2+]4 was at control values. Thus, the effects of the two peptides were similar in that the responses were small, biphasic, and of short duration. Forskolin, tested because of its ability to raise intracellular cyclic AMP levels by activation of adenylyl cyclase, also increased [Ca2+]4 transiently. The 1,9-dideoxy-derivative of forskolin, which lacks activity on adenylyl cyclase(28.Laurenza A. McHugh Sutkowski E. Seamon K.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 442-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), failed to affect [Ca2+]4. Thus the effect of VIP and PACAP to increase [Ca2+]4 is likely due to their ability to raise the cellular cyclic AMP content. However, as the increase in cyclic AMP caused by forskolin is large and prolonged (as described later), the transience and pattern of the increase in [Ca2+]4 must be due to the channels or regulatory components other than cyclic AMP.Figure 5:Effects of 10 nM VIP and 10 nM PACAP in the absence and presence of 3 μM nitrendipine, and of 300 nM forskolin and 300 nM 1,9-dideoxyforskolin on [Ca2+]i. The experiments were carried out in the presence of 4 mM glucose. The individual traces of fura-2 fluorescence shown are representative of at least four similar experiments for each peptide and for forskolin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Neither the peptides nor forskolin had any effect on [Ca2+]4 in the presence of 1 or 3 μM nitrendipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker (3 μM shown in Fig. 5). Additionally, the response was unaffected by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin (data not shown). These results suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]4 is due entirely to activation of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and increased Ca2+ entry. Because of this apparent reliance on the voltage-dependent channels, measurement of the effects of VIP and PACAP on membrane potential were made using the potential-sensitive indicator bisoxonol. Only a very slight and again transient effect to depolarize the membrane was detectable (data not shown). The concentration-response characteristics of the effects of VIP and PACAP on [Ca2+]4, measured at the peak of the response, are shown in Fig. 6. VIP caused a small increase in [Ca2+]4 at 0.1 nM and a near maximal increase at 1 nM. The maximum effect was seen at 10 nM. Interestingly, the peak value for [Ca2+]4 decreased from the maximum value as the concentration of VIP was increased further to 100 nM. The results with PACAP-38 were similar to those with VIP except that PACAP was more potent. PACAP-38 gave a much larger increase than VIP at 0.1 nM and peaked at 10 nM. As was the case with VIP, an increase in PACAP-38 from 10 nM to 100 nM caused the [Ca2+]4 to decrease from the peak value.Figure 6:Concentration-response characteristics for the effect of 0.01 to 100 nM VIP and PACAP-38 to increase [Ca2+]i in the presence of 4 mM glucose. Measurements of [Ca2+]i were made at the peak of the [Ca2+]i responses. Results are expressed in nM as means ± S.E. n = 3-14.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Time Course Studies on the Effects of VIP and PACAP to Raise Cyclic AMP LevelsIt appears unlikely that the small and transient effects of the peptides on [Ca2+]4 can account for the prolonged effect of VIP and PACAP on insulin secretion, as revealed in the perifusion studies in Fig. 3. Consequently, we determined the effects of VIP and PACAP on cyclic AMP levels over time. The data for PACAP are shown in Fig. 7A. PACAP caused a rapid increase in cyclic AMP content, which was close to maximal after 30 s. Maximal values were reached at 1-5 min, after which the cyclic AMP content decreased. Cyclic AMP content had returned to basal values by 30 min despite the continued presence of the peptide. The effects of VIP (not shown) paralleled those of PACAP.Figure 7:Time courses of the effects of PACAP and 300 nM forskolin to increase cyclic AMP levels in the HIT-T15 cell. A, cyclic AMP levels were measured at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 30 min in the absence and presence of 10 nM PACAP. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. n = 4. B, cyclic AMP levels were measured at 0.5, 1, 5, and 30 min in the absence and presence of forskolin. All experiments were in 4 mM glucose. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. n = 4-7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In view of the importance of the findings that both [Ca2+]4 and cyclic AMP levels were at basal levels at 30 min, a time at which insulin secretion was still stimulated by VIP and PACAP, a second series of experiments was performed to confirm that cyclic AMP levels had indeed returned to basal after 30 min of exposure to VIP and PACAP. These data are shown in Table 1. It is clear that at 30 min, the peptides no longer have any effect on the cyclic AMP content of the cells.TABLE 1 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the transient responses to the peptides, forskolin had a prolonged effect on cellular cyclic AMP levels. As can be seen from Fig. 7B, the increase in cyclic AMP caused by forskolin reached a peak at 5 min and only slightly declined thereafter. At 30 min, cyclic AMP levels remained highly elevated.Given that insulin secretion at 30 min is still strongly stimulated by both VIP and PACAP and that the peptides no longer have any effects on [Ca2+]4 and cyclic AMP, it would appear that VIP and PACAP must activate mechanisms in addition to cyclic AMP and [Ca2+]4 in order to cause a persistent stimulation of insulin release. Consequently, additional experiments were performed to investigate these mechanisms.The Effects of VIP, PACAP, and Forskolin on Insulin Secretion in TPA-down-regulated CellsSeveral studies were performed in attempts to explain the fact that insulin secretion is stimulated after 30 min of exposure to VIP and PACAP at a time when the second messenge"

The regulatory subunit is an N-terminal truncated derivative of a 35-kDa protein expressed specifically in brain, hence the name neuronal Cdk5 activator, p25/p35nckoa. In this study, we probe the relationship between the two different forms of Nck5a and their interaction with and activation of Cdk5 in bovine brain extract. Using protein fractionation procedures in combination with Western blot analysis and protein kinase assay, three forms of Cdk5 have been detected in bovine brain: a monomeric Cdk5 that can be activated by bacterially expressed GST-p21nckoa, a heterodimer of Cdk5 and p25nckoa that displays high kinase activity, and a Cdk5•p35nckoa complex that is inactive and refractory to GST-p21nckoa activation. Analysis of the Cdk5•p35nckoa complex by gel filtration chromatography indicated that the complex was part of a macromolecular structure with a molecular mass of ∼670 kDa. When the macromolecular complex was subjected to gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 10% ethylene glycol, the fractions containing both p35nckoa and Cdk5, although eluting at the same position as control, displayed high kinase activity. The result is compatible with the suggestion that the macromolecular complex contained a kinase inhibitory factor that dissociated from the complex in 10% ethylene glycol.

https://openalex.org/W2022087377,"“Activation” of integrins is involved in the dramatic transition of leukocytes and platelets from suspension to adhesion. The integrin αvβ3 is not known to take part in this sort of transition, even though it shares its β subunit with αIIbβ3, the activable integrin on platelets. In the context of a constitutively adhered cell, changes in activation state may be more subtle in their effects, but nonetheless important in regulating cell behavior. We hypothesized that αvβ3 can undergo conformational changes analogous to those associated with αIIbβ3 activation. Accordingly, we examined αvβ3 on the surface of M21 cells (a human melanoma cell line) and found that, like αIIbβ3, it can undergo conformational changes upon binding of a ligand analog and can be activated for ligand binding and migration by a monoclonal antibody directed against β3. Modulation of the binding of this activating antibody, AP5, ligand binding, and antibody-mediated activation all are associated with a discrete cation-binding site shared in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. Based on a measured Ki, this site has an apparent Kd for calcium of approximately 20 μM. At physiological levels of calcium, about 40% of the total αvβ3 on a cell's surface is in a conformation detected by AP5. The data suggest a model for both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 function in which the molecule can exist in either of (at least) two conformational states, one stabilized either by AP5 or ligand binding, refractory to calcium binding, and enhanced for ligand recognition, the other stabilized by calcium binding and refractory to AP5 and ligand binding. Functional analysis suggests that AP5 activates αvβ3 by preventing occupation of this calcium site, and that the activated form of αvβ3 differs functionally from the basal form.

INTRODUCTIONIntegrins comprise a large family of heterodimeric cell-surface receptors involved in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. These receptors mediate adhesion and modulate the cell's responses to various adhesive ligands (for review, see (1.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar)). The integrin's role in modulating information flow recently has become a field of growing interest. Several potentially significant biochemical changes are known now to be regulated by adhesion events involving integrins, including changes in intracellular pH, changes and oscillations in intracellular free calcium, and phosphorylation on tyrosine of a number of proteins (1.Burridge K.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). In addition to this basic requirement of divalent cations, specific divalent cations have been suggested to regulate integrins. For example, manganese (Mn2+) appears to enhance the adhesive properties of many integrins (9.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Crowe D.T. Chiu H. Fong S. Weissman I.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) although the mechanism of this enhancement is not clear. A model has been proposed by Smith and co-workers (9.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C.

In this model, a calcium or other divalent cation is bound to the integrin and is necessary for proper function, but must be displaced as ligand binds.Several integrins are conformationally complex molecules. That is, they can exist in different conformational states, or activation states, that affect ligand recognition. Examples of this included αIIbβ3 and some β2 and β1 integrins on leukocytes(13.Altieri D.C. Wiltse W.L. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 662-670PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H.

Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In the case of αIIbβ3, binding of ligand analogs, such as RGD-containing peptides, induces a conformational change that can be detected by a change in the Stokes radius of the receptor(17.Parise L.V. Helgerson S.L. Steiner B. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12597-12602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This change occurs concomitantly with the presentation of “LIBS,” or ligand-induced binding sites, which are epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies known as anti-LIBS antibodies(18.Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “Activation” of αIIbβ3 results in a conformational change that can be detected by changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (14.Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and occurs concomitantly with increased efficiency of ligand binding and changes in ligand specificity (reviewed in (16.Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar)). It is important to recognize that the so-called “resting” or “inactive” state of αIIbβ3 is a functional integrin(3.Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20.Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T.J. Ruggeri Z.M. Quaranta V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we refer to it as the “basal” state. The binding of some anti-LIBS antibodies results in changes in αIIbβ3 consistent with activation; that is, the antibodies stimulate binding of ligand ((19.Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and references therein).We recently showed for the case of αIIbβ3 that the conformational state can affect not only ligand recognition, but “outside-in” signals as well(20.Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T.J. Ruggeri Z.M. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18133-18140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that integrins in general exist on the cell surface as subpopulations in different conformation, or activation, states with specific ligand-binding and signaling functions. Implicit in this hypothesis is the assumption that integrins on constitutively adhered cells can undergo changes in conformation, or activation state, similar to those seen for αIIbβ3. Although the role of integrin activation in the case of integrins that mediate the conversion from suspension to adhesion in blood cells is obvious, the effect of integrin activation in the context of an adherent cell might be less dramatic.To explore this possibility, we have taken advantage of a conformation-sensitive antibody we have described previously. This antibody, AP5, binds a linear epitope corresponding to the first 6 amino acids of the β3 subunit(22.Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is an anti-LIBS for αIIbβ3, that is its epitope is presented following binding of soluble ligand analogs. It also is an activating antibody; it stimulates the binding of soluble fibrinogen either to platelets or to a cell line expressing αIIbβ3(20.Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T.J. Ruggeri Z.M. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18133-18140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22.Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Since the presentation of LIBS following ligand binding is a measure of a conformational change, we tested whether this conformational change occurred in αvβ3 on the surface of the human melanoma cell line M21 and found that it did. AP5 also activates αvβ3, as measured by increased the efficiency of cell adhesion to various ligands. Moreover, pretreatment with AP5 resulted in an increase in M21 cell migration. We found that a discrete calcium-binding site residing both in αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 was involved in regulating the conformational changes associated with LIBS presentation and activation. Calcium inhibits the presentation of the AP5 epitope on αvβ3 with a Ki of about 20 μM. Functional analysis suggests a model wherein AP5 activates αvβ3 by preventing occupation of an inhibitory calcium-binding site. Further, the binding characteristics of the active and basal receptors were investigated in intact cells. The active receptor promoted efficient, but weak, interactions with matrix and favored migration. The basal receptor, in contrast, promoted stronger adhesion and was less conducive to migration. This result indicates that activation does not represent a simple “on/off” switch of the integrin, but rather a change in function and a resulting change in cell behavior.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and MediaM21 is a human melanoma cell line that expresses αvβ3(11.Felding-Habermann B.

M21 cells were grown on tissue culture-treated Petri dishes (various) in RPMI 1640 (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum and including a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mixture.Other SolutionsFor measurements of antibody binding, a buffer based on Dulbecco's-modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) 2The abbreviations used are: DPBSDulbecco's phosphate-buffered salinePBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateMFImean fluorescence intensityOpnosteopontinVnvitronectin. was made, except that the concentration of calcium or magnesium was varied as indicated. This buffer was made based on the recipe from Bio-Whittaker and includes 900 μM CaCl2, 500 μM MgCl2, sodium and potassium supplied as phosphate, glucose, and sodium pyruvate (34 μg/ml). The buffer was made lacking divalent cations, and these were added as specified. For example, “40 μM calcium DPBS” would be DPBS made with only 40 μM CaCl2. Unless otherwise specified, all other components of DPBS are as given in the recipe. “PBS” when specified, is standard phosphate-buffered saline without added divalent cations.Flow CytometryFITC-labeled AP5 was generated by incubation of AP5 with FITC-Celite (Sigma) at a w:w ratio of 2 in the dark at room temperature for 1 h (in 100 mM sodium carbonate, pH 10). Celite was removed from suspension by centrifugation, and labeled antibody was separated from free FITC by chromatography on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Relative incorporation was determined by comparing A290 to A493. Cells were removed from growth plates with 2 mM EDTA in PBS, washed three times with DPBS of the specified calcium concentration, and exposed to appropriate control or experimental antibodies for 30 min on ice in the same buffer. When “RGD” is specified, G4120 (23.Barker P.L. Bullens S. Bunting S. Burdick D.J. Chan K.S. Deisher T. Eigenbrot C. Gadek T.R. Gantzos R. Lipari M.T. Muir C.D. Napier M.A. Pitti R.M. Padua A. Quan C. Stanley M. Struble M. Tom J.Y.K. Burnier J.P. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (kind gift of Dr. Thomas Gadek and Genentech Inc.) was included in the incubation at 40 μM. The dose of 40 μM was chosen because, by all functional criteria, this is in excess of saturation. Cells were washed twice with the specified buffer, on ice or at 4°C at all times, and finally collected in 0.5 ml of specified buffer. Cells were treated with propidium iodide (Sigma, 500 ng/ml, final) just prior to flow cytometry, which was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan with “Lyses II” software. Appropriate forward- and side-scatter gates were set for these cells, and only those cells excluding propidium iodide were counted.Results were inspected to ensure that a homogeneous, monophasic distribution of fluorescence was obtained, and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was extracted from the histogram by the Lysys-II program.CalculationsMFI data were plotted and line-fitting was performed using “Delta-Graph II” software. This treatment of the data requires the assumption that the binding of the antibody over the time measured constitutes all forward rate and therefore can be considered a measure of “initial velocity” of antibody binding. We independently determined that there was no significant off-rate for the antibody over the time course used (not shown). However, if a substantial off-rate component were present, a linear double-reciprocal plot would not be obtained. In all cases, the R2 values of these lines were greater than 9.6 and generally greater than 9.9. Calculation of Ki for calcium was performed by comparing the ratio of the slopes of the lines obtained using the relationship: [I]÷(S2/S1−1)=Ki(Eq. 1) where S1 and S2 are the slopes of the line without and with inhibitor, respectively, and [I] is the concentration of inhibitor present. This was necessary because the units of binding, MFI, could not be related directly to concentration of antibody-antigen complex with our instrumentation. However, the ratio of the slopes is dimensionless and could be used to calculate Ki. “Without inhibitor” is 1 μM Ca2+, since this concentration resulted in maximal binding.Adhesion AssayThe assay used was that of Calof and Lander (24.Calof A.L. Lander A.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 779-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, this assay was performed with cells labeled with [35S]methionine adhered to polystyrene plates coated with the appropriate ligand or control. Following adhesion, nonadhered cells were removed from the plate by centrifugation in the inverted orientation at the indicated G force. Adhered cells are fixed, the plates are exposed to a phosphorimaging plate, and the remaining 35S (a measure of adhered cells) was quantitated on a phosphorimaging scanner (Applied Biosystems). For Fig. 9, the amount of adhesion obtained on bovine serum albumin (less than 2% maximal adhesion, see Fig. 2) was subtracted to obtain corrected “integrated volume,” a direct measure of cells adhered. In Fig. 2, integrated volume is expressed as a percentage of cells adhering to poly-L-lysine. Values are averages of 6 wells ± 1 S.D. Vitronectin was obtained from Telios Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA), osteopontin made from a recombinant fusion protein was the kind gift of Drs. Jeffrey Smith and Dana Hu of the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, and fibrinogen was the kind gift of Dr. Z. Ruggeri of The Scripps Research Institute; poly-L-lysine was from Sigma. Ligands were coated at the indicated concentrations for 4 h. Plates were washed once with PBS and blocked with 2% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 2 h. Cells were pretreated with 100 μg/ml AP5 in 1 μM calcium DPBS for the indicated times on ice. Adhesion was carried out in 100 μM calcium DPBS or as indicated. Values for counts bound and background were calculated by the Applied Biosystems software.Figure 2:Adhesion of M21 cells to Vn and Opn was quantitated either with or without pretreatment with AP5 (100 μg/ml).

The lower side of the membrane was coated with Vn or Opn as indicated for 3 h at room temperature. Both sides were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were removed from growth plates as above and treated with 100 μg/ml AP5 for 20 min on ice in 10 μM calcium DPBS, or mock-treated. 5 × 104 cells were added per well in the indicated buffer and centrifuged briefly to bring them in contact with the membrane. Following a 20-h incubation at 37°C, cells were fixed and stained with “Diff-quick” (Baxter Scientific), and cells were removed from the top surface of the membrane with cotton swabs.

Fig. 1A shows histograms of fluorescence distribution for 10,000 cells incubated either with a control antibody or 10 μg/liter AP5 with or without G4120. M21 cells comprise a single, homogeneous population of cells with respect to AP5 binding, an indication of “error.” Binding to all cells is increased dramatically by the inclusion of G4120. Fig. 1B shows mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) taken from similar histograms over the indicated concentrations of AP5, in the presence or absence of G4120. In all cases, the distribution of fluorescence within the population measured was similar to that seen in the histograms in Fig. 1A.Figure 1:A, cells were exposed to FITC-labeled AP5 at 10 μg/ml in DPBS on ice in the presence or absence of the cyclic RGD analog, G4120 (40 μM) as indicated.

Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, binding studies with αvβ3 often were performed under different conditions. For example, αvβ3 will only support adhesion to fibrinogen in the presence of the divalent cation manganese (Mn2+)(11.Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Similarly, αvβ3 binding to Opn also is stimulated by Mn2+ and inhibited by Ca2+(9.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We therefore thought it likely that αvβ3 binding to these substrates might be regulated by activation and the alternate cations may induce a kind of activation, as has been suggested ((9.Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and references therein). Accordingly, we examined the ability of AP5 to stimulate adhesion of M21 cells to Vn or Opn in the absence of Mn2+ and in low Ca2+ (40 μM). Mg2+ was included at 400 μM in these experiments (see “Materials and Methods”). The assay for adhesion we employed was that of Calof and Lander(24.Calof A.L. Lander A.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 779-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which includes a low speed centrifugation of the inverted plate to remove unbound or loosely adhered cells. The results, expressed as the percent of cells that remain adhered following 5 min at 100 × g, are shown in Fig. 2. AP5 increased the adhesion of cells to both substrata under these conditions. We have performed more conventional plate assays with similar results on fibrinogen as well (data not shown). Adhesion to fibrinogen, Opn, and Vn in these latter assays was inhibited completely by inclusion of 40 μM G4120 to block αvβ3. LM609 (150 μg/ml), a blocking, anti-αvβ3 antibody, inhibited 100% of the adhesion to Opn and about 85% of adhesion to Vn. This residual adhesion probably was due to αvβ5 on the surface of M21(11.Felding-Habermann B. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 25.Felding-Habermann B. Mueller B.M. Romerdahl C.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 2018-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, Opn adhesion was used in most subsequent assays.AP5 Binding Is Inhibited by CalciumWe previously reported that the reactivity of AP5 toward αIIbβ3 is inhibited by calcium(22.Honda S.

We next determined if the same is true for αvβ3. Fig. 3 shows the same graph of MFI versus AP5 concentration in the presence or absence of 40 μM G4120 as is shown in Fig. 1B. That experiment was performed in DPBS, which includes 900 μM CaCl2. At the same time, a parallel experiment was performed in DPBS lacking CaCl2 (all other components of DPBS were included). Under these conditions, binding of AP5 is constitutively high and is insensitive to the addition of G4120. Since the effect of G4120 and that of low calcium are not additive, the ligand analog must act directly to overcome the effect of the calcium, rather than through an independent mechanism. Thus, the binding of calcium to αvβ3 inhibits the presentation of this ligand-induced binding site, and the ligand analog overcomes that inhibition.Figure 3:Cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of FITC-labeled AP5 in the presence or absence of G4120 (40 μM) either in DPBS or DPBS lacking calcium. Bound AP5 was quantitated by flow cytometry and is expressed as MFI for 10,000 cells. The data for the DPBS case are exactly the same as those presented in Fig. 1B. ▪, -Ca, -G4120; ▴, +Ca, -G4120; •, -Ca, +G4120; ◊, +Ca, +G4120.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calcium is not exerting its effect on AP5 directly. In equilibrium dialysis experiments, no binding of 45Ca to AP5 was detected at concentrations that inhibit binding of AP5 to αvβ3 (data not shown). Also, since the effect of G4120 clearly is on the receptor, we would expect low calcium and G4120 to have additive effects on the overall binding of the antibody if the effect of the calcium were on the antibody. Furthermore, results from detailed analysis of the inhibition (below) are inconsistent with calcium exerting its effect on AP5.Fig. 4 shows the effect of calcium concentration over a range from 100 nM to 2 mM on the binding of AP5. Starting with a calcium-minus “DPBS,” buffers of the indicated calcium concentration were made. The binding of AP5 is maximal at approximately 1 μM Ca2+ and is inhibited significantly at 10 μM.Figure 4:FITC-labeled AP5 (130 μg/ml) was exposed to M21 cells in a buffer based on DPBS, but made with the indicated concentrations of calcium. Washes were carried out in the same buffer as the incubations. MFI of 10,000 cells is presented. Maximal binding of AP5 occurs at approximately 1 μM calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We performed a similar test of the effect of calcium on AP5 binding over a range of AP5 concentrations from 5-140 μg/ml, which is shown in Fig. 5A.

https://openalex.org/W2004220181,"EnvZ of Escherichia coli is a transmembrane histidine kinase belonging to the family of two-component signal transducing systems prevalent in prokaryotes and recently discovered in eukaryotes. In response to changes in medium osmolarity EnvZ regulates the level of phosphorylated OmpR, its conjugate response-regulating transcription factor for ompF and ompC genes. EnvZ has dual opposing enzymatic activities; OmpR-phosphorylase (kinase) and phospho-OmpR-dephosphorylase (phosphatase). The osmotic signal is proposed to regulate the ratio of the kinase to the phosphatase activities of EnvZ to modulate the level of OmpR phosphorylation. In this work we used a COOH-terminal fragment of a previously identified kinase−/phosphatase+ EnvZ mutant (EnvZ•N347D) to demonstrate that the phosphoryl group on phospho-OmpR is transferred back to EnvZ to the same histidine residue (His243) that is utilized for the autokinase reaction by the wild type protein. Phospho-EnvZ•N347D thus formed could also transfer its phosphoryl group back to OmpR. The phosphotransfer reaction from phospho-OmpR to EnvZ•N347D was inhibited by ADP while Mg2+ ions stimulated the dephosphorylation reaction, resulting in release of inorganic phosphate. These results indicate that the energy levels of phosphoryl groups on OmpR and EnvZ are very similar and that the phosphatase reaction in the EnvZ•N347D mutant involves a reversal of the phosphotransfer reaction from EnvZ to OmpR using the identical His243 residue."
https://openalex.org/W1977824741,"Upon binding to double-stranded (ds) RNA, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) sequentially undergoes autophosphorylation and activation. Activated PKR may exist as a dimer and phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α subunit (eIF-2α) to inhibit polypeptide chain initiation. Transfection of COS-1 cells with a plasmid cDNA expression vector encoding a marker gene, activates endogenous PKR, and selectively inhibits translation of the marker mRNA, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This system was used to study the dsRNA binding and dimerization requirements for overexpressed PKR mutants and subdomains to affect DHFR translation. DHFR translation was rescued by expression of either an ATP hydrolysis defective mutant PKR K296P, the amino-terminal 1-243 fragment containing two dsRNA binding motifs, or the isolated first RNA binding motif (amino acids 1-123). Mutation of K64E within the dsRNA binding motif 1 destroyed dsRNA binding and the ability to rescue DHFR translation. Immunoprecipitation of T7 epitope-tagged PKR derivatives from cell lysates detected interaction between intact PKR and the amino-terminal 1-243 fragment as well as a 1-243 fragment harboring the K64E mutation. Expression of adenovirus VAI RNA, a potent inhibitor of PKR activity, did not disrupt this interaction. In contrast, intact PKR did not interact with fragments containing the first dsRNA binding motif (1-123), the second dsRNA binding motif (98-243), or the isolated PKR kinase catalytic domain (228-551).

INTRODUCTIONPhosphorylation of translation initiation and elongation factors is a fundamental mechanism that regulates the rate of protein synthesis as cells respond to their external environment(1.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The best well characterized mechanism that regulates the rate of polypeptide chain initiation is phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α). ( 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2αeukaryotic translation initiation factor 2αPKRdouble-stranded RNA dependent protein kinaseBDPKR dsRNA binding fragment 1-243D1PKR dsRNA binding fragment 1-123D2PKR dsRNA binding fragment 98-243KDPKR kinase domainPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseeIF-2Bguanine nucleotide exchange factor.) eIF-2 is a heterotrimer of α, β, and γ subunits that is essential to transfer initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) in a ternary complex with GTP to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in the first step of polypeptide chain initiation. Upon 60 S ribosomal subunit joining, GTP is hydrolyzed and the eIF-2•GDP complex is released. In order for eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, the GDP must be exchanged for GTP. This reaction is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (eIF-2B)(2, 3). Control of eIF-2 utilization is mediated by phosphorylation of eIF-2α on serine residue 51. Phosphorylated eIF-2 cannot undergo GDP/GTP exchange and forms a non-dissociable complex between eIF-2B and eIF-2•GDP(4.Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5.Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since eIF-2B is present at a lower concentration than eIF-2, eIF-2B becomes sequestered by small increases in eIF-2α phosphorylation and prevents further initiation events(6.Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Three protein kinases are known to control protein synthesis through eIF-2α phosphorylation(7.Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

Both dsRNA binding domains apparently contribute to the stability of the RNA-protein complex. However, the first domain is more important for binding(21.McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E.

Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1992; 188: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The PKR amino acid requirements for dsRNA binding appear to be the same or overlap the requirements for dsRNA-dependent activation, however, very little is known about how dsRNA binding leads to PKR activation. RNA molecules that activate apparently bind the same sites as RNA molecules that inhibit activation(27.Minks M.A. West D.K. Benvin S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10180-10183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Manche L. Green S.R. Schmedt C. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). PKR activation requires critical concentrations of dsRNA. High concentrations of dsRNA inhibit PKR activation. dsRNA binding to PKR induces autophosphorylation(29.Lasky S.R. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11087-11093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Although autophosphorylation can occur in trans(32.Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33.Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1994; 67: 7695-7700Crossref Google Scholar), it is not known if dimerization is required for dsRNA-dependent activation. Two models proposed to explain the dsRNA dependent activation of PKR differ in their requirement for dimerization. One model proposes that each PKR molecule has one dsRNA binding site and activation results from bridging of two PKR molecules to elicit intermolecular autophosphorylation(32.Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Another model proposes that activation involves intramolecular autophosphorylation that is dependent upon proper occupancy of two dsRNA binding sites(34.Galabru J. Katze M.G. Robert N. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, two models based on whether PKR dimerizes have been proposed to explain the capability of mutant PKR to dominantly down-regulate wild-type PKR. One model proposes that mutant PKR forms mixed heterodimers with the wild-type PKR and prevents intermolecular phosphorylation and activation(16.Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 35.Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second model proposes that overexpression of the mutant PKR sequesters PKR activators such as specific dsRNA sequences(12.Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 36.Sharp T.V.Q. Xiao Q. Jeffrey I. Gewert D.R. Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have evaluated the validity of these models through analysis of the functional activity and dimerization of PKR mutants and subdomains upon expression in COS-1 cells. Our results support the hypotheses that dsRNA activation does not require dimerization and that mutant PKR acts as a dominant negative through sequestering activators.Direct studies on the activation of PKR in vivo have been limited due to the inhibition of protein synthesis observed in the presence of active PKR(12.Chong K.L.

In this study we show that expression of a dominant negative mutant K296P PKR can rescue translation of the reporter mRNA in this system. This system was used to study the PKR structural requirements for PKR dimerization and dsRNA binding to down-regulate endogenous PKR activity. By immunoprecipitation of T7 epitope-tagged proteins transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, we demonstrated that dsRNA-independent dimerization of PKR is mediated through the intact dsRNA binding domain (residues 1-243). In addition, expression of a 1-243 fragment harboring a K64E mutation that is defective in dsRNA binding did not rescue protein synthesis although it dimerized with intact PKR. These results support the hypothesis that the PKR dominant negative phenotype observed by mutant PKR overexpression results from competition for binding to potential dsRNA activators and is not due to formation of inactive heterodimers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVector ConstructionThe expression vectors used in this study contain the same transcription unit as described in Fig. 1. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) expression plasmid pD61(38.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), the expression plasmid pETFVA−(39.Davies M.V. Chang H-W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the eIF-2α expression vector pETFVA−-2αwt (39.Davies M.V. Chang H-W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were previously described. The K64E mutant PKR was kindly provided by Dr. C. E. Samuel. All other PKR mutants were made by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The primers used for polymerase chain reaction were designed to contain a PstI site at the 5′ end and a SalI site at the 3′ end. For the T7-tagged PKR mutants, the 3′ end primers were designed to contain an overhang encoding amino acids (MASMTGGQQMG) for T7 antibody binding. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into PstI-SalI sites of pETFVA− vector (Fig. 1). The sequences of the mutants were determined by the dideoxy nucleotide sequencing method(41.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar).DNA Transfection and AnalysisCOS-1 monkey kidney cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure(42.Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were labeled with Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (100 μCi/ml; 1,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) for 20 min in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (38.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE(43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using T7-tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen Corp., Madison, WI) or using polyclonal antibody against PKR kindly provided by Dr. C. E. Samuel. Gels were fixed, prepared for fluorography by treatment with En3Hance (DuPont NEN), dried, and autoradiographed using Kodak XAR-5 film. The coimmunoprecipitated PKR mutants and fragments were quantitated by PhosphorImage scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and band intensity was measured using ImageQuant™ program (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).At 48 h post-transfection, total RNAs were prepared using the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) and analyzed by RNA Northern blot hybridization (44.Thomas P.

Cell. 1981; 23: 731-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) using probes (DHFR, PKR, and β-actin) prepared by [32P]dCTP labeling with random priming (Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, NJ).In Vivo Phosphorylation of eIF-2αCOS-1 cells were co-transfected with pETFVA−-eIF-2α in the presence of different PKR mutants and labeled at 48 h post-transfection with 2 ml of 32PO4 (200 μCi/ml, DuPont NEN) for 4 h in phosphate-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The eIF-2 α-subunit was immunoprecipitated with anti-eIF-2α monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Henshaw), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The membrane was immunoblotted with anti-eIF-2α monoclonal antibody and the eIF-2α protein level was visualized by the alkaline phosphatase immunoblotting detection system (Sigma). 32PO4 incorporation was quantitated by autoradiography of the nitrocellulose membrane using Kodak XAR-5 film and a DuPont Cronex Lightning Plus screen.RESULTSdsRNA Binding Is Required for the Dominant Negative Activity of PKRA series of expression plasmids to direct synthesis of PKR mutants and/or fragments was constructed to evaluate structural requirements to mediate a dominant negative effect on protein synthesis (Fig. 1). The point mutants studied were K64E in the first dsRNA binding motif that is defective in PKR dsRNA binding activity (24.McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1994; 198: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and K296P that is catalytically inactive(16.Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The dsRNA binding fragments D1 (residues 1-123), D2 (residues 98-243), and the intact dsRNA binding domain BD (residues 1-243) were constructed in addition to the isolated kinase domain KD (residues 228-551). The ability of these mutants to inhibit endogenous PKR activity was analyzed utilizing a transfection system that exploits the property of some expression plasmids (such as pD61 encoding DHFR) to produce mRNAs that are selectively inefficiently translated due to PKR activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation(38.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The unique feature of this system is that inefficient translation occurs in a cis-acting manner with respect to the plasmid-derived mRNA.COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pD61 and the vector pETFVA− containing wild-type, mutant, or fragments of PKR. Since the mRNA derived from pETFVA− does not activate PKR and is efficiently translated(39.Davies M.V. Chang H-W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible to measure the ability of the protein expressed from pETFVA− to rescue translation of DHFR mRNA derived from pD61. DHFR protein synthesis was quantitated by [35S]methionine/cysteine pulse labeling of cells and analyses of harvested cell extracts by SDS-PAGE. Results were quantitated by PhosphorImage scanning (Table 1A). In parallel cells were harvested for quantitation of mRNA by Northern blot hybridization analysis. Transfection of pD61 with pETFVA− vector alone into COS-1 cells detected a low level of DHFR synthesis (Fig. 2A, lane 2) that was significantly above the background observed in cells that did not receive pD61 DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Co-transfection of pD61 with wild-type PKR reduced DHFR synthesis to a non-detectable level above background (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Co-transfection of pD61 with PKR mutant K296P increased DHFR synthesis by 7.0-fold compared to co-transfection with the pETFVA− vector alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). Whereas wild-type PKR synthesis was not detected, K296P PKR synthesis was observed as a polypeptide migrating at 69 kDa. Co-transfection with the mutant K64E PKR slightly reduced DHFR synthesis by 10% and K64E mutant PKR synthesis was significantly reduced compared to the K296P mutant PKR (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that K64E mutant PKR displays intermediate activity between the K296P mutant and wild-type PKR. Co-transfection with KD yielded a low level of KD synthesis, likely resulting from its constitutive activation and eIF-2α phosphorylation ((46.Patel R.C. Stanton P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18593-18598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); see below). Expression of KD inhibited DHFR synthesis by 30% (Fig. 2B, lane 11). In contrast, expression of either PKR fragments BD or D1 rescued DHFR synthesis (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 8), whereas expression of fragment D2 did not alter DHFR synthesis (Fig. 2A, lane 10). In addition, D1 harboring the K64E mutation did not rescue DHFR synthesis (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 9). Co-transfection with BD harboring the K64E mutation increased DHFR synthesis 1.8-fold, possibly due to residual dsRNA binding of the BD K64E mutant. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the DHFR mRNA level did not significantly change upon co-transfection with wild-type or mutant PKR (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-11), demonstrating the changes in DHFR synthesis were due to changes in mRNA translational efficiency. The different PKR fragments were detected as polypeptides migrating at the expected sizes (identified in Fig. 2A) and were all expressed at high levels. Northern blot analysis of the PKR mRNA demonstrated the translational efficiency of the mutant PKRs, for example, BD and D1, compared to K64E-BD or K64E-D1, were less affected than the translational efficiencies of DHFR. These results demonstrated that expression of either BD or D1 could rescue DHFR translation and that the K64E mutation destroyed this capability.TABLE 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Rescue of DHFR translation by expression of specific mutants and fragments of PKR. Panel A, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the DHFR expression vector pD61 in the presence of the pETFVA− expression vector alone (lane 2) or of pETFVA− containing the indicated PKR inserts depicted in Fig. 1. Lane 1 received only pETFVA− DNA. Equal amounts (4 μg/10-cm plate) of the two plasmid DNAs were used. The transfected cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The migration of DHFR and the different PKR fragments is indicated. Panel B, total RNA from cells transfected in parallel was isolated and the mRNA levels for DHFR, PKR, and β-actin were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intact Mutant K64E PKR and the KD Phosphorylate eIF-2αSince expression of intact mutant K64E PKR and KD inhibited DHFR translation, we evaluated the effect of their expression on eIF-2α phosphorylation. The phosphorylation status of eIF-2 α-subunit co-expressed with wild-type and mutant PKR was measured by 32PO4 labeling of co-transfected cells. The 32PO4 incorporation into eIF-2α was measured by immunoprecipitation and analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The steady state level of eIF-2α was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Comparison of the steady state level of eIF-2α protein to the level of eIF-2α phosphorylation demonstrated that eIF-2α phosphorylation was increased in cells co-transfected with wild-type PKR, the K64E mutant PKR, or the kinase catalytic domain KD (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 4, and 8) compared to cells co-transfected with intact K296P PKR, the intact dsRNA binding domain BD, D1, or D2 (Fig. 3, lanes 5-7 and 9-11). These data show that the kinase catalytic domain and the K64E mutant PKR phosphorylate eIF-2α. However, we do not know if this phosphorylation occurs directly or through the endogenous wild-type PKR present in COS-1 cells.Figure 3:In vivo phosphorylation of co-expressed eIF-2α subunit. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the eIF-2 α-subunit expression vector pETFVA−-2αwt in the presence of pETFVA− vector alone (lane 2) or pETFVA− containing the indicated PKR inserts. Lane 1 represents cells that did not receive the eIF-2α expression vector. After 48 h, cells were labeled with [32P]phosphoric acid for 4 h and lysed using Nonidet P-40 buffer. The labeled eIF-2α was immunoprecipitated with anti-eIF-2α monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-eIF-2α monoclonal antibody. The same membrane was autoradiographed to measure the incorporation of 32PO4 into the eIF-2α subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dimerization Is Mediated by the Intact dsRNA Binding DomainTo elucidate whether rescue of DHFR translation by BD and D1 was dependent on the ability for the fragments to dimerize with PKR, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was established to measure dimerization. Expression vectors encoding intact PKR or the dsRNA binding fragment BD (1-243) were co-transfected with vectors encoding PKR fragments engineered to contain a bacteriophage T7-epitope tag in the carboxyl terminus. After labeling transfected cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine, the potential for the different fragments to interact with intact PKR or with BD was measured by co-immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-T7 antibody. For these studies, the K296P mutant PKR was used since it was expressed at a higher level than wild-type PKR. Analysis of total protein synthesis by SDS-PAGE indicated that each of the fragments, except for the kinase domain KD, was expressed at a high level (Fig. 4A). In comparison to KD (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 10), the K296P mutant KD was expressed at a significantly higher level (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 11) indicating that kinase activity from the isolated catalytic domain could inhibit PKR protein synthesis. In addition, co-expression of BD or K296P did not rescue the synthesis of the isolated KD (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 10) indicating that either BD or K296P could not inhibit the activity of the KD in trans.Figure 4:Co-immunoprecipitation of intact PKR and BD with different PKR f"

We demonstrated previously that the extracellular domain of CD38 has NAD+ glycohydrolase (NADase) activity and that the ecto-form NADase activity induced in HL-60 cells during cell differentiation by retinoic acid is due to CD38. In the present study, we investigated the intracellular signaling mediated by CD38 in retinoic acid-differentiated HL-60 cells with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The addition of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody to the cells induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular proteins with molecular weights of 120,000, 87,000, and 77,000. An increase in tyrosine kinase activity in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of the cells was also observed after the addition of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Moreover, one of the prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins stimulated by the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody was identified as the c-cbl proto-oncogene product, p120c-cbl.

In the present study, we examined the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins might be involved in the CD38-mediated signaling pathway. We found that stimulation of RA-differentiated HL-60 cells with anti-CD38 mAb induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. One of the prominent phosphorylated proteins was identified as the c-cbl proto-oncogene product, p120c-cbl. HL-60 cells were cultured and caused to differentiate by various inducers as described previously(21.Iiri T. Tohkin M. Morishima N. Ohoka Y. Ui M. Katada T. J. Biol.

Mouse hybridoma HB136 cells, which produce an anti-CD38 mAb (HB-7, subclass IgG1), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in serum-free Cosmedium-001 (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing insulin and transferrin. The anti-CD38 mAb, HB-7, was purified from the culture medium of HB136 cells by means of column chromatography on protein A-Cellulofine (Seikagaku-Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). Another anti-CD38 mAb, T16, and the subclass-matched control IgG1 were purchased from Cosmo Bio (IOB6) and ICN Biochemicals, Inc.(64-335), respectively. The anti-PY mAb PY-20 and rabbit anti-PY pAb were obtained from Leinco Technologies Inc. (Ballwin, MO) and Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA), respectively. An anti-p120c-cbl pAb was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-170). Sepharose 4B and protein G-Sepharose 4-FF were from Pharmacia Biotech. (Uppsala, Sweden). The tyrosine kinase substrate, Raytide, and P-81 ion exchange chromatography paper were purchased from Oncogene Science Inc. (Uniondale, NY) and Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom), respectively. [γ-32P]ATP and 125I-protein A were from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were of analytical grade and from commercial sources. HL-60 cells which had been cultured with or without various inducers were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM Na-Hepes (pH 7.4) at a cell density of 3 × 107 cells/ml. After preincubation at 37°C for 5 min, the cells (1.2 × 107 cells/400 μl) were stimulated with various concentrations of antibodies (or the control IgG1) at 37°C for the indicated times. The reaction was terminated by adding the same volume (400 μl) of a lysis buffer consisting of 40 mM Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 4 mM EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml of aprotinin. The cell lysate was kept at 4°C for 30 min with occasional stirring, before being centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 20 μl of Sepharose 4B resin (50% suspension) at 4°C for 30 min. After removal of the Sepharose resin by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and incubated with 1 μg (10 μl) of PY20 at 4°C for 2 h. Twenty μl of protein G-Sepharose resin (50% suspension) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by further incubation at 4°C for 2 h. The immune complex precipitated with the resin was washed three times with 800 μl of a washing buffer consisting of 20 mM Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 75 mM NaCl, 15 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin and then resuspended in 30 μl of the same buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% of acrylamide), and the separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane, after being shaken at room temperature for 30 min in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% bovine serum albumin, was incubated with rabbit anti-PY pAb at room temperature for 2 h and then washed with TBS buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20. The membrane was further incubated with 125I-protein A at room temperature for 2 h in TBS containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then washed with TBS buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20. The radioactivity retained on the membrane was visualized with a Fuji BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer. Tyrosine kinase activity in the cell lysate was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of a broad specificity peptide substrate, Raytide (Oncogene Science Inc., Manhasset, NY), as described previously(22.Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24126-24133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A lysate was prepared from HL-60 cells which had been stimulated with HB-7 or the control IgG1 and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with PY20 as described above. The resultant immune complex precipitated with protein G-Sepharose was further washed twice with 800 μl of a kinase buffer consisting of 50 mM Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 75 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.075% (w/v) Brij 35 and then resuspended in 30 μl of the same buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of the kinase buffer containing 60 μM Raytide, 44 mM MgCl2, 12 mM MnCl2, 100 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [32-32P]ATP, the reaction mixture being incubated at 30°C for 30 min. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant (20 μl) was transferred to a new tube containing 40 μl of 15% (v/v) phosphoric acid to stop the reaction and then the mixture was applied onto P-81 ion exchange chromatography paper (2 × 2 cm). The paper was washed seven times with 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid and once with acetone, before being dried and subjected to the associated radioactivity counting with a scintillation counter. We first investigated the possibility that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins might be induced on stimulation with anti-CD38 Abs. HL-60 cells that had been cultured with RA to produce CD38 were stimulated with an anti-CD38 mAb, T16, and then a lysate was prepared from the cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the cell lysate, after being immunoprecipitated with PY20, were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by means of immunoblotting with an anti-PY pAb. As shown in Fig. 1A, the addition of T16 to RA-differentiated cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins with Mr of 120,000, 87,000, and 77,000 (lane 3). For simplicity, the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are henceforth referred to as p120, p87, and p77, respectively. In addition, several other proteins with Mr of 65,000 to 45,000 appeared to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by T16 to a lesser extent. Another anti-CD38 mAb, HB-7, also stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the pattern being the same as that observed for T16 (lane 4). The stimulatory effect of HB-7 on the tyrosine phosphorylation was observed at a concentration as low as 0.3 μg/ml and was saturated at about 3 μg/ml (data not shown). However, the subclass-matched control mAb (IgG1) had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation (lane 2). The specificity of the action of HB-7 was confirmed by its inability to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation in undifferentiated or dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells (Fig. 1B), in which CD38 is not produced(6.Kontani K. Nishina H. Ohoka Y. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results clearly indicated that the anti-CD38 mAb stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins through CD38 produced on the surface of HL-60 cells. NAD+ and hyaluronate, which are an enzyme substrate and a potential ligand for CD38(12.Nishina H. Inageda K. Takahashi K. Hoshino S. Ikeda K. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), respectively, did not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (data not shown). Fig. 2A shows the time course of protein tyrosine phosphorylation after the addition of HB-7 to RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. All the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120, p87, and p77 occurred within 1 min, the maximal levels being reached at 1-2 min, followed by gradual decreases in the phosphorylation levels (Fig. 2B). The overall pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by HB-7 was not altered by further cross-linking of the membrane-bound anti-CD38 mAb with an anti-mouse IgG antibody (data not shown). This may imply that the aggregation of CD38 molecules is not essentially required for the CD38-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in cells. It has been generally observed in tyrosine kinase-induced signaling pathways that the activation of tyrosine kinases induces the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues and/or association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Thus, we next measured the tyrosine kinase activity in the lysate of HL-60 cells that had been stimulated with HB-7. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and/or proteins associated with them in the cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with PY20, and the in vitro tyrosine kinase assay was carried out with Raytide as the substrate(22.Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24126-24133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the time course of the tyrosine kinase activity in the PY20-immunoprecipitated fraction after the addition of HB-7 to RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. HB-7 rapidly stimulated the tyrosine kinase activity in the fraction; the maximum stimulation was observed at 2.5 min. The tyrosine kinase activity in the fraction prepared from undifferentiated HL-60 cells was, however, not affected by the addition of HB-7. An effect of the control IgG1 on the tyrosine kinase activity was not observed in undifferentiated or RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. These results suggested that stimulation of CD38 activates a cellular tyrosine kinase(s), which may be responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120, p87, and p77. Recent reports revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-cbl proto-oncogene product, p120c-cbl, may play a critical role in signal transduction mediated by the T cell receptor(23.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fc receptor for IgG (24.Marcilla A. Rivero-Lezcano O. Agarwal A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9115-9120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor receptor(25.Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26.Galisteo M.L. Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Langdon W.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20242-20245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations led us to examine whether or not p120c-cbl is involved in transmembrane signaling mediated by CD38. To investigate this possibility, a lysate prepared from RA-differentiated HL-60 cells that had been treated with HB-7 or the control IgG1 was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p120c-cbl pAb, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PY pAb. The addition of HB-7 to the cells stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120c-cbl (Fig. 4A, lane 2), although the immunoprecipitated amounts of p120c-cbl were the same for the control IgG1- and HB-7-treated HL-60 cells (lanes 3 and 4). This clearly indicated that p120c-cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated on stimulation of CD38 in RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. The relationship between this p120c-cbl and p120 previously identified as the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the same RA-differentiated HL-60 cells was further investigated as follows. A cell lysate obtained from HB-7-stimulated HL-60 cells was first treated with the anti-p120c-cbl antibody to deplete p120c-cbl from the lysate. The treated lysate, after being immunoprecipitated with PY20, was separated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to immunoblotting with the anti-p120c-cbl pAb or anti-PY pAb (Fig. 4B). As expected, the depletion of p120c-cbl from the cell lysate was almost completely achieved (lanes 1 and 2). When the cell lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-PY pAb, a marked decrease in the immunoreactivity of p120 to the pAb was observed without significant changes in any other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (lanes 3 and 4). These results indicated that the major fraction of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 observed on the stimulation of CD38 represents the phosphorylated p120c-cbl in the HL-60 cells. We demonstrated that stimulation with anti-CD38 mAbs induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in HL-60 cells caused to differentiate into granulocytes by RA. The action of the anti-CD38 mAb, HB-7, was specifically observed in CD38-producing HL-60 cells; there was no stimulatory effect of the mAb on undifferentiated or dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells, in which CD38 is not produced. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by anti-CD38 mAb has been also reported in mouse B cells(27.Kirkham P.A. Santos A.L. Harnett M.M. Parkhouse R.M. Immunology. 1994; 83: 513-516PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the phosphorylated proteins was analyzed in the B cells, although some of the anti-PY-immunoreacted proteins appeared to be similar to those observed in the RA-differentiated HL-60 cells in terms of molecular weight. In the present study, we found that one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins stimulated by anti-CD38 mAb is the c-cbl proto-oncogene product with Mr of 120,000, p120c-cbl. The cbl gene was initially identified as a transforming component of Cas NS-1 retrovirus that induces early B-lineage lymphoma(28.Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse III, H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The c-cbl proto-oncogene is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells(29.Langdon W.Y. Hyland C.D. Grumont R.J. Morse III, H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5420-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that p120c-cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to T cell receptor, Fc receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor activation(23.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Marcilla A. Rivero-Lezcano O. Agarwal A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20242-20245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It was also shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated p120c-cbl has an ability to bind the SH2 domains of Fyn, Lck, and Blk protein-tyrosine kinases, GTPase-activating protein and phospholipase C32, and that p120c-cbl also binds to the SH3 domain of Nck, Lyn, and the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb-2(23.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the conversion of c-cbl to a transforming gene involves tyrosine phosphorylation of its protein products(31.Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, p120c-cbl appears to play an important role in the signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. In the case of T cell receptor or Fc receptor stimulation(23.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Marcilla A. Rivero-Lezcano O. Agarwal A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9115-9120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), p120c-cbl might be tyrosine-phosphorylated via intracellular protein-tyrosine kinases which bind to a common cytoplasmic motif, termed ITAM (immune tyrosine-based activation motif, which has been referred to as ARAM or TAM), in those receptors(19.Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24913-24916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 209-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Such a sequence motif is not found in the cytoplasmic domain of CD38(2.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar); however, we can't totally rule out the possibility that the short cytoplasmic domain of CD38 contains an unidentified motif that is capable of interacting with a cellular tyrosine kinase(s). We have not determined what kind of protein-tyrosine kinase(s) is activated upon stimulation of CD38 in RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. In this regard, an interesting finding has been reported that B cells from X-linked immunodeficient mice, which have a defect in Btk protein-tyrosine kinase(33.Tsukada S. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), could not proliferate in response to anti-CD38 mAb(34.Santos-Argumedo L. Lund F.E. Heath A.W. Solvason N. Wu W.W. Grimaldi J.C. Parkhouse R.M.E. Howard M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that Btk might be involved in the signal transduction via CD38 in B cells. However, considering that CD38 is also present in several types of hematopoietic cells(1.Reinherz E.L. Kung P.C. Goldstein G. Levey R.H. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1982; 60: 703-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including thymocytes in which Btk is absent(35.Smith C.I. Baskin B. Humire G.P. Zhou J.N. Olsson P.G. Maniar H.S. Kjellen P. Lambris J.D. Christensson B. Hammarstrom L. Bentley D. Vetrie D. Islam K.B. Vorechovský I. Sideras P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 557-565PubMed Google Scholar), there might be some distinct pathways for CD38-mediated intracellular signaling. Although the mechanism whereby p120c-cbl, together with p87 and p77, is tyrosine-phosphorylated after the stimulation of CD38 remains unknown, identification of such tyrosine kinase(s) leading to the phosphorylation of p120c-cbl in RA-treated HL-60 cells would provide useful information for understanding the transmembrane signaling mediated by CD38."

In this study, we investigated the role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type II receptor in the TGF-β-dependent proliferative response of lung fibroblasts. TGF-β stimulated the proliferation of adult lung fibroblasts at a low concentration (1 ng/ml), but inhibited the growth of fetal lung fibroblasts in a dose-dependent fashion (0.1-10 ng/ml). Cross-linking and Northern analysis demonstrated that the two lung fibroblast cell lines expressed the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and type II receptor (TβRII). We overexpressed in lung fibroblasts a truncated derivative of TβRII that lacked the cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain (TβRIIΔK). TβRIIΔK was a dominant-negative inhibitor of TGF-β signal transduction blocking not only TGF-β-induced mitogenic action upon adult lung fibroblasts but also TGF-β-induced growth inhibition of fetal lung fibroblasts. The results indicate that the type II receptor is indispensable for mediating both the mitogenic and antiproliferative effects of TGF-β upon lung fibroblasts.

Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). Three isoforms TGF-β1, −2, and −3 have been identified in lung and found to act on many different lung-derived cell types and to regulate a wide variety of cellular activities(2.Pelton R.W.

Dis. 1990; 142: 531-535Crossref Google Scholar). TGF-βs elicit their biological effects on cells through binding to cell surface transmembrane receptors. A number of different types of putative receptors for TGF-β, including three distinct size classes termed type I (TβRI, 50-60 kDa), type II (TβRII, 75-85 kDa), and type III (TβRIII, a 280-kDa proteoglycan with a 120-kDa core protein), have been identified by affinity cross-linking experiments(4.Massague J.

Cell. 1987; 48: 409-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of cDNAs coding type I and type II receptors for the TGF-β superfamily have shown that both types belong to a novel family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases with a small extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular region with a serine/threonine kinase domain(6.Franzen P. ten Dijke P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of TβRIII revealed that it is a transmembrane proteoglycan with a short and highly conserved cytoplasmic domain that has no apparent signal motif (9.Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 10.Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that a complex of TβRI and TβRII, but not the individual components, mediates TGF-β signal transduction. A ligand-induced heterodimer model was proposed for TGF-β signal transduction(11.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 12.Laiho M. Weis M.B. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TGF-β may act as either a positive or a negative regulator of cell division. TGF-β stimulates the proliferation of mesenchyme-derived cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts, but acts as a powerful growth inhibitor of cells of epithelial and endothelial origin(13.Masui T. Wakefield L.M. Lechner J.F. LaVeck M.A. Sporn M.B. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2438-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 14.Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β inhibits epithelial cell proliferation by delaying or arresting progression through the late portion of G1(15.Massague J. Cheifetz S. Laito M. Ralph D.A. Weis F.M. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar). TβRII was found to be essential for TGF-β growth inhibition signal. Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells are highly responsive to the growth inhibition of TGF-β. A chemically mutated Mv1Lu cell line defective in TβRII lacks TGF-β-induced growth inhibition. Transfection of the human TβRII to this mutant cell line restored the inhibition of growth by TGF-β(16.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J.

Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion has been drawn by expression of a kinase-defective truncation of the human TβRII in Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells(18.Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).TβRII is required to mediate antiproliferative responses to TGF-β, but its involvement in TGF-β signaling that lead to growth stimulation has not been established. In the present studies, we demonstrate a bifunctional action of TGF-β in lung fibroblast cells. An adult rat lung fibroblast cell line expressed TβRII and was responsive to the growth stimulation of TGF-β, whereas a fetal rat lung fibroblast cell line expressed TβRII and displayed an unexpected response, growth inhibition, to TGF-β. To further determine the role of TβRII in modulating the growth stimulation effects of TGF-β, we transfected into rat lung fibroblast cells an expression plasmid containing rat TβRII cDNA that was lacking the kinase domain. Overexpression of the dominant-negative TβRII mutant blocked both the stimulating and the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on rat lung fibroblasts. These experiments provide evidence for a functional role of TβRII in TGF-β-induced proliferation and growth inhibition of lung fibroblasts.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CulturesFetal rat lung fibroblasts were isolated from day 16 gestational age fetal rat lung tissues as described(19.Zhao Y. Young S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L482-L491PubMed Google Scholar). Adult rat lung fibroblasts isolated from 9-week-old rats were kindly provided by Dr. J. Clarke McIntosh from Duke University Medical Center. These cells exhibited typical fibroblastoid morphology, and they were vimentin-positive and cytokeratin-negative. These lung fibroblasts were also characterized by expression of extracellular matrix protein tenascin and fibronectin(19.Zhao Y. Young S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L482-L491PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were grown in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C.Mitogenesis Assay[3H]Thymidine incorporation was used to determine TGF-β sensitivity of fibroblasts to exogenous TGF-β treatment. Fetal rat lung fibroblasts or adult rat lung fibroblasts were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h in serum-free medium. Quiescent cultures were then incubated with serum-free DMEM in the presence of various concentration of TGF-β (0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml), as indicated. After receiving a 6-h pulse with 2 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Corp.), cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid, then lysed in 0.1 M NaOH. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting.Receptor ConstructsA 1762-base pair cDNA containing the full-length coding sequence for TβRII was isolated from rat lung as described(20.Zhao Y. Young S.L. Am J Physiol. 1995; 269: L419-L426PubMed Google Scholar). A 1542-base pair cDNA containing the full-length coding sequence for TβRI was isolated from rat lung by using reverse transcriptase PCR cloning technique with primers (sense: 5′-dACAGTGGCAGCGGGACCAT-3′; antisense: 5′-GAGCAGAGTTCCCACGGTG-3′). TβRI cDNA was cloned into plasmid pNoTA (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and was characterized by sequencing analysis. Sequencing was carried out in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method (21.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) kit and 35S-dATP (Amersham).Northern AnalysisTotal RNA was from cells prepared by the guanidine thiocyanate/cesium chloride method. Poly(A)+ RNAs were selected with the PolyATtract® mRNA isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Two μg of mRNA was fractionated on an agarose gel, transferred to Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and fixed by a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Filters were hybridized at 42°C in 50% formamide solution containing 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 1 mM EDTA), 1 × Denhart's solution (1 × Denhart's is 0.02% (w/v) each of polyvinylpyrrolidone, bovine serum albumin, and Ficoll), 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml of denatured and sonicated fish sperm DNA with 106 cpm of 32P-labeled TβRI or TβRII cDNA probes. Equivalent RNA loading and transfer were confirmed by subsequent reprobing with a rat glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and finally washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 60°C. The filters were autoradiographed. Scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) was performed to quantify the relative amounts of mRNA species.Construction of TβRII Dominant-negative Mutant and TransfectionA kinase-defective rat TβRIIΔK was generated by PCR using primers (sense: 5′-dGCCGGTCTATGACGAGC-3′; antisense: 5′-CCGCTACACCAGCGTGTCCAGCTC-3′). PCR conditions were 1 min at 92°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C for 25 cycles. The resulting PCR product was cloned into plasmid pNoTA (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) and was characterized by sequencing analysis. For expression in eukaryotic cells, the truncated TβRII cDNA (TβRIIΔK) or the full-length wild type TβRII cDNA was released from pNoTA with restriction enzyme EcoRI and EcoRV, and the fragment of TβRII or TβRIIΔK was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). This plasmid contains the cytomegalovirus major intermediate early transcriptional promoter and enhancer. The subcloned TβRII or TβRIIΔK cDNA was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed by sequence analysis.TransfectionCells were plated in DMEM and 5% fetal bovine serum 24 h before transfection. Cells were cultured overnight, and the medium was replaced on the following day by serum-free medium. Transfection of cells with the dominant-negative mutant and wild type construction was performed by using the lipofectamine transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium were replaced at 16 h following the start of transfection, and TGF-β1 was added at the final concentration of 5 ng/ml for fetal lung fibroblasts and 1 ng/ml for adult lung fibroblasts. The control cells were transfected with the cloning plasmid without TβRII cDNA. The mammalian reporter vector pCMVβ (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), which has the lacZ gene under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter, was used to optimize the transfection conditions.Receptor Affinity Cross-linkingThe affinity labeling of the TGF-β receptor was carried out according to a procedure described previously(22.Massague J. Like B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monolayer cells were washed with binding buffer (DMEM, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 3 h at 4°C with 100 pM of 125I-TGF-β1 (6440 kBq/μg, DuPont NEN) or 100 pM of 125I-TGF-β1 plus 80 nM unlabeled TGF-β1 in binding buffer. Cells were washed three times with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin at 4°C. Bound 125I-TGF-β1 was cross-linked to cell membranes by adding 0.25 mM bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) and incubating on ice for 20 min. Cells were harvested and were solubilized in 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μM aprotinin, and 1 μM pepstatin. Cross-linked proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels under reducing conditions and autoradiographed.RESULTSGrowth responses to TGF-β1 by rat lung fibroblasts were examined. Confluent fetal rat lung fibroblasts and adult rat lung fibroblasts were made quiescent and exposed to different concentration of TGF-β1. The adult rat lung fibroblast cell line was responsive to the growth stimulation of TGF-β as expected of most fibroblast cells, whereas fetal rat lung fibroblasts displayed an unexpected response, growth inhibition (Fig. 1). The effects of TGF-β1 on the proliferation of adult lung fibroblasts were dependent on concentration (Fig. 1A). TGF-β1 stimulated the proliferation of adult lung fibroblasts at concentration less than 5 ng/ml. Maximal effects were observed at a concentration of 1 ng/ml, and TGF-β1 had no effect at concentrations of over 5 ng/ml. In contrast, TGF-β1 inhibited the proliferation of fetal lung fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner up to 10 ng/ml after a 20-h treatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 1B). [3H]Thymidine incorporation peaked at 24-36 h in adult lung fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1, but inhibition of DNA synthesis of fetal lung fibroblasts by TGF-β1 persisted for up to 72 h (data not shown).In order to elucidate a possible mechanism whereby TGF-β1 exerts its actions on fibroblast proliferation, the expression of TGF-β receptors by adult and fetal lung fibroblasts were evaluated. Cross-linking of 125I-TGF-β1 to fetal lung fibroblasts or adult lung fibroblasts revealed three species of receptors with apparent molecular masses of 60, 85 and 280 kDa (Fig. 2A). These proteins were equivalent to the TGF-β type I, II, and III receptors, respectively. A 40-kDa component was seen in fetal lung fibroblasts, but not in adult lung fibroblasts. It is not clear whether it was an isoform of the TGF-β type I receptor or an uncharacterized TGF-β binding protein. A lower molecular mass species (35 kDa) was also detected in both adult and fetal lung fibroblasts.Figure 2:Expression of endogenous TGF-β receptors in lung fibroblasts. A, receptor cross-linking assays were used to measure cell surface TGF-β receptor expression. Monolayer cultures of adult lung fibroblast cells (lane 1) or fetal rat lung fibroblasts (lane 2) in six-well plates were incubated with 100 pM of 125I-TGF-β1. The receptors were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. Cell extracts were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The TGF-β receptor type III (TβRIII), type II (TβRII), and type I (TβRI) were visualized after autoradiography; B, Northern blotting was used to analyze expression of TβRI and TβRII mRNAs. Each lane contained 2 μg of mRNA prepared from adult lung fibroblasts (lane 1) or fetal lung fibroblasts (lane 2). mRNA was subjected to electrophoresis through a formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel and, after Northern blotting, hybridized with radiolabeled TβRI or TβRII cDNA probe and quantified by scanning densitometry. Scan values for TβRI and TβRII mRNA signals were normalized with the scan data of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. Ratios were expressed in arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression of TGF-β type I and II receptor were further examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). TβRII mRNA was detected as a 5.1-kilobase species expressed in adult lung fibroblasts and in fetal lung fibroblasts. Two TβRI mRNA species of approximately 6.1 and 4.0 kilobases were observed in adult lung fibroblasts and in fetal lung fibroblasts. TβRII and TβRI were differentially expressed in fetal and adult lung fibroblasts.To examine the significance of type II receptor in mediating the growth-promoting and growth inhibition effects of TGF-β, we used a dominant-negative inhibitory approach to create a loss-of-function mutation of TβRII. We constructed a kinase-deficient cytoplasmic deletion mutant of rat TβRII (TβRIIΔK). The truncated TβRII and wild type TβRII were cloned into pcDNA3, under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter and enhancer. We transfected rat lung fibroblasts with rat TβRIIΔK or TβRII. The expression level of the truncated receptor was tested by affinity labeling of transfected cells with 125I-TGF-β1 (Fig. 3). Fibroblasts transfected with TβRIIΔK yielded a TGF-β affinity-labeled product of 45 kDa, the predicted size of the truncated receptor TβRII. A high level of TβRIIΔK were expressed on the cell surface of fetal and adult lung fibroblasts. The truncated receptor was able to bind ligand. 125I-TGF-β1 binding to TβRIIΔK was efficiently competed by unlabeled ligand, the same as the wild type TβRII binding.Figure 3:Expression of the truncated TβRII lacking the cytoplasmic kinase domain in lung fibroblasts. Monolayer cultures of fetal rat lung fibroblasts or adult rat lung fibroblasts transiently transfected with rat TβRIIΔK or empty pCDNA3 vector were incubated with 125I-TGF-β1 in the absence(-) or in the presence (+) of 80 nM unlabeled TGF-β1. Bound 125I-TGF-β1 was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then were autoradiographed.

Adult lung fibroblasts were transfected with TβRIIΔK or empty vector. Transfected fibroblasts were cultured in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for 20 h. TβRIIΔK completely blocked the TGF-β1-dependent DNA synthesis (Fig. 4A). When adult lung fibroblasts were transfected with 1 μg of TβRIIΔK and 1 μg of wild type rat TβRII, the growth responsiveness of adult lung fibroblasts to TGF-β1 was restored by adding the wild type TβRII cDNA (Fig. 4B). Fetal lung fibroblasts transfected with TβRIIΔK were unable to convey TGF-β1-dependent growth inhibition (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the diminished response to TGF-β1 by fetal fibroblasts was rescued by cotransfection of TβRIIΔK with the wild type TβRII (Fig. 5B). The results show that the kinase-defective deletion of TβRII is a dominant-acting inhibitor of signal transduction by TGF-β receptor complex and that TβRII was required for TGF-β-dependent positive and negative growth response.Figure 4:Dominant-negative effects of TβRII on TGF-β-induced growth.

Expression of TGF-β isoforms has been detected in the lung at critical times during development(2.Pelton R.W. Johnson M.D. Perkett E.A. Gold L.I. Moses H.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23.Heine U.I. Munoz E.F. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Development (Camb.). 1990; 109: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern and known biological activities of TGF-β suggest an important role for this factor in lung development. In this study, the effects of TGF-β on growth of fetal and adult lung fibroblasts were characterized, and the role of TβRII in TGF-β-induced signaling was examined.Our data show that TGF-β stimulates proliferation of adult fibroblasts at low concentration but remains inactive at higher concentration, while inhibiting growth of fetal fibroblasts regardless of concentration. An example of the bifunctional nature of TGF-β has been reported in human smooth muscle cells(24.Battegay E.J. Raines E.W. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Cell. 1990; 63: 515-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). TGF-β is mitogenic only when used at lower concentration, whereas at higher concentration it inhibits DNA synthesis. More recent studies have demonstrated that TGF-β can act as a negative or positive growth regulator in two sublines of the same epithelial cells, depending on their commitment to differentiation(25.Hafez M.M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β activates two different signal transduction pathways through activating different Ras proteins and myelin basic protein kinases(26.Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We examined the possible relationship between the bifunctional action of TGF-β and the expression of its cellular receptors. The two fibroblast cell lines possess all three TGF-β receptors; however, fetal fibroblasts expressed a much higher level of cell surface type II receptor at the mRNA and the protein level than adult lung fibroblasts. The finding is in agreement with our previous study (20.Zhao Y. Young S.L. Am J Physiol. 1995; 269: L419-L426PubMed Google Scholar) that the expression of TβRII is developmentally regulated in the lung. This raises the possibility that the bifunctional action of TGF-β on lung fibroblasts may depend on their developmental stage.We show that the kinase-deleted truncation of TβRII acts as a dominant inhibitor of TGF-β signal transduction. The proliferative action and the growth inhibition of TGF-β were abolished by overexpression of TβRIIΔK. TGF-β-induced signaling events leading to growth stimulation are likely to be different at some level from that of growth inhibition. TGF-β increases c-fos expression in growth-inhibited cells but not in growth-stimulated cells (27.Hsu S. Huang F. Wang L. Banerjee S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 909-917PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation is seen in TGF-β-induced proliferation(28.Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results indicated TβRII is essential for both pathways. This finding suggests that binding of TGF-β to TβRII may be a common step required for the TGF-β signaling cascade. The TGF-β signal transduction pathways for the growth stimulation and the growth inhibition may diverge after binding of TGF-β to TβRII and then different intracellular signals might be activated. An intriguing question raised by this study is how TGF-β exerts its multiplicity of effects through interaction with its transmembrane receptors. The signaling specificity could occur through interaction of TβRII with different types of type I receptor. The characterization of other members of TGF-β receptor family, particularly type I receptors, might allow us to determine the mechanism of multiple effects of TGF-β.In conclusion, we found that TGF-β stimulates proliferation of adult lung fibroblasts, while inhibiting growth of fetal lung fibroblasts. We have shown that the truncated form of TβRII blocked both growth-stimulating and inhibition effects of TGF-β. The results suggest that TGF-β type II receptor is indispensable for the signal transduction pathway and the diverse regulatory effects of TGF-β.

Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). Three isoforms TGF-β1, −2, and −3 have been identified in lung and found to act on many different lung-derived cell types and to regulate a wide variety of cellular activities(2.Pelton R.W. Johnson M.D. Perkett E.A. Gold L.I. Moses H.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3.Pelton R.W. Moses H.L. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1990; 142: 531-535Crossref Google Scholar). TGF-βs elicit their biological effects on cells through binding to cell surface transmembrane receptors. A number of different types of putative receptors for TGF-β, including three distinct size classes termed type I (TβRI, 50-60 kDa), type II (TβRII, 75-85 kDa), and type III (TβRIII, a 280-kDa proteoglycan with a 120-kDa core protein), have been identified by affinity cross-linking experiments(4.Massague J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 5.Cheifetz S. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Anderson J.K. Mole J.E. Lucas R. Massague J. Cell. 1987; 48: 409-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of cDNAs coding type I and type II receptors for the TGF-β superfamily have shown that both types belong to a novel family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases with a small extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular region with a serine/threonine kinase domain(6.Franzen P. ten Dijke P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of TβRIII revealed that it is a transmembrane proteoglycan with a short and highly conserved cytoplasmic domain that has no apparent signal motif (9.Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 10.Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that a complex of TβRI and TβRII, but not the individual components, mediates TGF-β signal transduction. A ligand-induced heterodimer model was proposed for TGF-β signal transduction(11.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 12.Laiho M. Weis M.B. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TGF-β may act as either a positive or a negative regulator of cell division. TGF-β stimulates the proliferation of mesenchyme-derived cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts, but acts as a powerful growth inhibitor of cells of epithelial and endothelial origin(13.Masui T. Wakefield L.M. Lechner J.F. LaVeck M.A. Sporn M.B. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2438-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 14.Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β inhibits epithelial cell proliferation by delaying or arresting progression through the late portion of G1(15.Massague J. Cheifetz S. Laito M. Ralph D.A. Weis F.M. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar). TβRII was found to be essential for TGF-β growth inhibition signal. Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells are highly responsive to the growth inhibition of TGF-β. A chemically mutated Mv1Lu cell line defective in TβRII lacks TGF-β-induced growth inhibition. Transfection of the human TβRII to this mutant cell line restored the inhibition of growth by TGF-β(16.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 17.Bassing C.H. Yingling J.M. Howe D.J. Wang T. He W.W. Gustafson M.L. Shah P. Donahoe P.K. Wang X.F. Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion has been drawn by expression of a kinase-defective truncation of the human TβRII in Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells(18.Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).TβRII is required to mediate antiproliferative responses to TGF-β, but its involvement in TGF-β signaling that lead to growth stimulation has not been established. In the present studies, we demonstrate a bifunctional action of TGF-β in lung fibroblast cells. An adult rat lung fibroblast cell line expressed TβRII and was responsive to the growth stimulation of TGF-β, whereas a fetal rat lung fibroblast cell line expressed TβRII and displayed an unexpected response, growth inhibition, to TGF-β. To further determine the role of TβRII in modulating the growth stimulation effects of TGF-β, we transfected into rat lung fibroblast cells an expression plasmid containing rat TβRII cDNA that was lacking the kinase domain. Overexpression of the dominant-negative TβRII mutant blocked both the stimulating and the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on rat lung fibroblasts. These experiments provide evidence for a functional role of TβRII in TGF-β-induced proliferation and growth inhibition of lung fibroblasts."

Abnormal and progressive accumulation of fibrillar type I collagen in the interstitial spaces compromises organ function and therefore, the study of transcriptional regulation of this gene and specific targeting of its expression is of major interest. Transient transfection of adult cardiac fibroblasts indicate that the polypurine-polypyrimidine sequence of α1(I) collagen promoter between nucleotides −200 and −140 represents an overall positive regulatory element. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that multiple factors bind to different elements of this promoter region. We further demonstrate that the unique polypyrimidine sequence between −172 and −138 of the promoter represents a suitable target for a single-stranded polypurine oligonucleotide (TFO) to form a triple helix DNA structure. Modified electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that this TFO specifically inhibits the protein-DNA interaction within the target region. In vitro transcription assays and transient transfection experiments demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of the promoter is inhibited by this oligonucleotide. We propose that TFOs represent a therapeutic potential to specifically influence the expression of α1(I) collagen gene in various disease states where abnormal type I collagen accumulation is known to occur.

In response to tissue injury or invasion, a healing response is invoked that ultimately leads to an accumulation of fibrillar type I collagen. This is true for many systemic organs and the heart. Such a healing response, when unabated and invoked in the absence of injury, leads to a progressive interstitial fibrosis that proves pathologic. Parenchymal cell function is compromised by a disproportionate concentration of type I collagen, a characteristic feature of interstitial fibrosis in different organs(1.Abergel R.P. Mon-Li C.

Many of these factors mediate their action through transcriptional mechanisms. Therefore, the study of transcriptional regulatory elements within the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen gene promoters and their trans-acting protein factors is of major interest. Effector cells that bring about fibrosis include interstitial fibroblasts and phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells termed myofibroblasts (21.Sappino A.P. Schürch W. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 144-161PubMed Google Scholar). Several cis-acting elements in the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen genes located on both sides of the transcription start site as well as their trans-acting factors have been identified (for recent reviews, see (22.Slack J.L. Liska D.J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Gen. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23.Brenner D.A. Westwick J. Breindl M. Am. J.

Very little is known about the factor(s) binding to the −200 to −140 region of the α1(I) collagen promoter that includes the 35-bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbkilobase pair(s)RCFrat cardiac fibroblastDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumTFOtriplex-forming oligonucleotide.) stretch of polypyrimidine sequence and an adjacent purine-rich sequence (Fig. 1). These sequences are highly conserved among mammals (25.Ravazzolo R. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7382-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and correspond to the DNase I-hypersensitive regions around the transcriptional start site. It is generally believed that DNase I hypersensitivity represents nucleosome-free regions which can interact with various regulatory proteins(26.Liau G. Szapary D. Setoyama C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11362-11368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cis-acting elements in the −190 to −170, and −160 to −133 region of the mouse α1(I) promoter and trans-acting factors binding to these elements in NIH-3T3 fibroblast nuclear extracts have been studied in some detail (27.Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competition experiments in EMSAs provided evidence that a single factor binds to both of these elements. Furthermore, in transient transfection experiments, while a 3-bp substitution mutation in the more distal element (from −194 to −168) had little effect on the promoter activity, a 3-bp mutation in the more proximal element (from −160 to −133) resulted in a 4-fold increase in reporter gene expression, indicating that this factor negatively regulates transcription (designated IF-1 in (26.Liau G. Szapary D. Setoyama C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11362-11368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast, Brenner et al.(28.Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. Veloz L.

The 35-bp stretch of pyrimidines located from −172 to −138 of the rat α1(I) collagen promoter could potentially serve as a target for a novel antisense strategy, namely the triplex strategy, which employs single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that bind to the major groove of a double-stranded DNA to form a triple helix in a sequence-specific manner. These complexes have been shown to inhibit sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, thereby affecting the transcriptional activity of various promoters in both in vitro and in vivo experiments(29.Ing N.H.

In the present study, we provide evidence for the presence of multiple factors in rat cardiac fibroblasts that specifically interact with the −198 to −138 sequence of the rat α1(I) collagen promoter. We further show that a single-stranded polypurine oligonucleotide can form a triple-helix structure with the long polypyrimidine segment of the promoter, inhibits the protein DNA interaction in this region and in an in vitro transcription system specifically blocks the transcriptional activity of the long α1(I) promoter. In addition, this triple helix-forming oligonucleotide significantly inhibits the expression of a reporter gene, CAT, driven by the rat α1(I) promoter in rat cardiac fibroblasts. All oligonucleotides used were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer at the DNA Core Laboratory of the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by mixing equal amounts of complementary single strands in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl. The mixture was heated to 80°C for 5 min, incubated at 55°C for 30 min, and then at 42°C for 30 min. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides were gel-purified on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, eluted, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. A 1.1-kb fragment of the rat α1(I) collagen promoter was isolated by the polymerase chain reaction technique. Based on published sequence data (33.Lichtler A. Stover M.L. Angilly J. Kream B. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3072-3077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specific 20-30-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to −1000 and +100 regions of the α1(I) collagen gene. Rat genomic DNA was used as template. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the HincII site of pGEM-3Z vector (Promega), and the resulting clone pCol 1.1 was used in all the studies described here. The accuracy of the clone was determined by restriction enzyme analysis and by DNA sequencing, which was done by the dideoxy method(34.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar). A 900-bp fragment of the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene (CMV IE-600 to +300) was isolated from pCMV-NEO (a kind gift of Dr. M. Linial, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) and subcloned into the pGEM-3Z vector. Plasmid pColCAT220 was constructed as follows. pCol 1.1 (−1000 to +113) was digested with XbaI and BglII, which release a 338-bp fragment of the rat α 1(I) gene (−225 to +113). It should be noted that the XbaI site is in the vector 3′ to the collagen sequence. This fragment was cloned into the XbaI-BamHI site of the pCAT Basic vector (Promega, WI). To construct plasmid pCol140, the pColCAT220 plasmid was digested with EarI, the ends of the fragments were filled-in and were digested with XbaI. The resulting 249-bp fragment (−136 to +113) was isolated and inserted into the XbaI-HincII site of pGEM 4Z vector (Promega). Plasmid pColCAT140 was constructed by isolating the XbaI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pCol140, which contains the −136 to +113 sequence of rat α1(I) gene, and cloning into the XbaI-HindII site of pCAT Basic vector. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared by the alkaline lysis method followed by CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation. Target oligonucleotide Oligo C-1 was end-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and was purified through Sephadex G50 column. Approximately 5000 cpm (0.6 ng) was incubated with increasing concentrations of triple helix-forming Oligo Col TFO and Oligo Control (final concentrations from 0 to ≈250 μM) in a binding buffer (TFO binding buffer) consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM spermidine, 10% sucrose, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated at 22°C for 60 min. Samples were electrophoresed through 8% polyacrylamide, 0.25% bisacrylamide gels buffered with 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid (pH 7.5), and 20 mM MgCl2 for 4.5 h at 10 V/cm at 6°C. Gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCF) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and incubated in 8% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were grown to subconfluence; the medium was changed the night before preparation. Nuclear proteins were extracted using a variation of the method of Dignam et al.(35.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping and pelleted (1250 × g, 10 min). They were washed with 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged as described above. Cells were next suspended in 10 packed volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.6% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 5 min. The nuclei were pelleted (1250 × g, 10 min), washed with five volumes of lysis buffer, and again centrifuged. Nuclear proteins were extracted from pelleted nuclei in an equal volume of cold extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.75 mM MgCl2, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 12.5% (v/v) glycerol). The suspension was homogenized with 8 strokes of Kontes glass homogenizer (B type pestle). The resulting solution was stirred gently with a magnetic stirring bar for 30 min and centrifuged for 45 min at 26000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 volumes of storage buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol). The dialysate was centrifuged at 26000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant containing the extract was aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (36.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad reagent, as described by the supplier. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared by the original Dignam method(35.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl. A 100-bp fragment of the rat α1(I) collagen gene (−225 to −123) with BglII and HaeIII ends isolated from pCol 952/1000 was labeled with [α-32P]ATP at BglII site using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Thirty fmol was incubated in a mixture containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI•dC). Six μl of nuclear extract (30 μg of protein) or buffer were added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed on ice for 30 min. Ten μg/ml DNase I stock was freshly diluted in 60 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2. Five liters (2.5 ng DNase I) was added to the binding reaction and incubated for 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min for various samples at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of stop mix containing 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 250 μg/ml yeast RNA, extracted once with phenol, once with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and ethanol-precipitated. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, dried, and resuspended in 70% formamide buffer. The samples were then heat-denatured and loaded on a 8% acrylamide, 7 M urea gel. Radioactive oligonucleotides were used as size markers. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70°C with an intensifying screen. (a) Two μl of RCF nuclear extracts (≈10 μg of protein) were incubated with approximately 20,000 cpm (10 fmol) of end-labeled oligonucleotides in a final volume of 10 μl on ice for 25 min. All binding reactions contained 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI•dC). Following electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bis at 40:1) in Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (37 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM glycine, 2 mM EDTA) at 10 V/cm for 2 h, gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70°C. (b) Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were slightly modified for TFO competition experiments. Ten fmol of end-labeled oligonucleotides (final preincubation concentration 2.5 nM) were incubated with increasing concentrations of Oligo Col TFO and Oligo Control (0-25 μM) in 4 μl of TFO binding buffer as described above. After 1 h of preincubation at 22°C, 10 μg of RCF nuclear extract was added in a volume of 8 μl containing 25 mM Tris acetate (pH 6.8), 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI•dC) resulting in a final volume of 12 μl. Binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 25 min on ice, and the reaction mixture was then loaded on the same gel as described above. Twenty ng (30 fmol) of the 1.1-kb collagen fragment, 5 ng (30 fmol) of the 250-bp fragment, isolated from pCol 1.1 and pCol140, respectively (final preincubation concentration 7.5 nM), and approximately the same concentration of 0.9-kb CMV IE fragment were preincubated in separate reactions with increasing concentrations of Col TFO and 4 μl of TFO binding buffer as indicated in the legend. After 1 h of preincubation at 22°C, templates were incubated with 11 μl of HeLa nuclear extracts (≈80 μg of protein) in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mM ATP, 0.4 mM CTP, 0.4 mM UTP, and 16 μM cold GTP with 130 nM [α-32P]GTP for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 175 μl of stop mix (0.3 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.3 M sodium acetate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2 mM EDTA, 3 μg/ml tRNA), extracted once with phenol and once with phenol/chloroform (1:1), ethanol-precipitated, dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of 50% formamide loading dye. The samples were heat-denatured and loaded on a 6% acrylamide, 7 M urea gel, run at 20 V/cm for 2 h. Gels were directly autoradiographed at −70°C. Rat cardiac fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated in 8% atmosphere, and plated approximately 24 h before transfection at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells in 10-cm diameter plastic dishes. Transfection was performed by the Lipofectamine method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Four μg of ColCAT plasmids and 2 μg of PSV2Gal plasmid (Promega, WI) were preincubated with 20 μl of Lipofectamine in 300 μl of serum-free DMEM at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed two times with prewarmed DMEM. Then, the preincubated mixture was diluted in DMEM to a final volume of 3 ml and added to plates. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Oligonucleotides were preincubated with Lipofectamine under the same conditions as the plasmid DNAs, except that the final dilution to 3 ml was done in DMEM supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed twice, and were incubated in the oligonucleotide containing mixture for 4 h at 37°C following which the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested by scraping 24 h after start of transfection in a 1-ml solution of 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl. Cells were centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and resuspended in 60 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Cell extracts were made by three cycles of freezing and thawing in dry ice/ethanol and 37°C water bath for 5 min each. Supernatant was removed, and protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method(42.Durland R.H. Kessler D.J. Duric M. Hogan M. Pullman B. Jortner J. Molecular Basis of Specficity in Nucleic Acid-Drug Interactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1990: 565-578Google Scholar). CAT activity was measured according to Gorman et al.(37.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Samples were heated for 10 min at 68°C prior to assay of CAT activity. Radiolabeled chloramphenicol (0.1 μCi of D-threo[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol) and 20 μl of 4 mM acetyl coenzyme A were added to samples containing 10 μg of protein and 50 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) in a final volume of 100 μl. The samples were incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C, which was within the linear range for these reactions. After ethyl acetate extraction, the chloramphenicol and the acetylated products were separated by thin layer chromatography for 1.5 h in a 95:5 ratio of chloroform to methanol. The thin layer plates were exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Acetylated and non-acetylated radioactive areas were removed from the plates and placed into scintillation counting fluid. The radioactivity was quantified by a Beckman scintillation counter. Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection with pSV2Gal plasmid (Promega, WI), and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described(38.Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-742PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts containing 5 μg of protein were incubated in 80 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 102 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 9 mM MgC12, and 8 mM CPRG at 37°C for 2 h. The optical density was measured at 570 nm. In order to identify specific binding proteins in rat cardiac fibroblasts, nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured adult rat cardiac fibroblasts and DNase I footprint analysis was carried out as described using a BglII-HaeIII restriction fragment of the α1(I) collagen promoter (−225 to −123), labeled at the −223 position on the noncoding strand (Fig. 1, asterisk). Five areas of protection designated a through f are seen (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The corresponding nucleotide sequences are underlined in Fig. 1. The protected areas a and b are part of the 35-bp-long polypyrimidine region, areas d, e, and f correspond to the purine-rich sequence distal to the polypyrimidine region, and the protected area c is an interconnecting sequence between the two. Examination of the sequences protected by nuclear factors revealed that among the different areas, the complementary sequence to AAAGGG of area f can be found in areas b and a; furthermore, the complementary sequence to GGAGG of area e is present in area a. These results indicate that multiple binding sites are present within the −200 to −120 region of the α1(I) collagen promoter that form complexes with protein factor(s) present in the RCF as well as HeLa cell nuclear extracts. It is important to note that many of these binding sequences, especially binding site a, b, and c, are highly conserved among species (25.Ravazzolo R. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7382-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the functional importance of these elements in the regulation of collagen gene expression. In order to better characterize the protein-DNA interactions within these footprinted segments of the α1(I) promoter, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the −170 to −141 polypyrimidine sequence (designated Oligo C-1), and to the −197 to −173 purine-rich sequence (designated Oligo C-2) were synthesized and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A sequence farther upstream (designated Oligo C-3) was also used as a control in competition experiments. The location and the sequences of these oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 1. In earlier work by Karsenty and de Crombrugghe(27.Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oligonucleotide sequences contained within the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter corresponding to Oligo C-1 and Oligo C-2 were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and were found to bind the same factor present in NIH 3T3 cell nuclear extracts. Transient transfection experiments using substitution mutations of the nucleotides labeled with vertical arrows in Fig. 1 indicated that this factor acted as a transcriptional inhibitor. It is of note that while the sequence of Oligo C-1 is identical in rat and mouse, the purine-rich Oligo C-2 shows only about 80% homology between these two species. The results of the EMSAs in this study are shown in Fig. 3. Oligonucleotides C-1 and C-2 were end-labeled and incubated with RCF nuclear extracts as described. Using Oligo C-1 as a probe, two distinct slow migrating bands, indicating the formation of DNA-protein complexes, are seen (Fig. 3, lane 2, see arrows on left). The incubation of Oligo C-2 probe with nuclear extract resulted in three slow migrating complexes (Fig. 3, lane 9, arrows on right). Competition experiments showing inhibition of complex formation by the use of 10- and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled C-1 and C-2 oligonucleotides with their respective probes demonstrate the specificity of these complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 10 and 11). This is further supported by the fact that the Oligo C-3 was unable to inhibit the formation of any of these complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 14). Looking at the mobility and the pattern of the complexes, it is interesting to note that the sharper top bands in lanes 2 and 9 migrate at the same position, while the mobility of the more diffuse lower bands is different. Furthermore, the pattern of competition indicates that the affinity of protein-DNA binding may be different within the various complexes, as evidenced by complete inhibition of the top complexes at 10 times lower molar excess of the respective competitors than is seen with the lower complexes. Substantial homology exists in the sequences of the different binding sites as we discussed above. The experiments of Karsenty and de Crombrugghe (27.Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested the presence of negative regulatory factors in NIH 3T3 cell nuclear extracts that bind to both oligonucleotides of the mouse promoter corresponding to Oligo C-1 and C-2. Therefore, we performed cross-competition experiments using unlabeled Oligo C-1 to compete the binding of labeled Oligo C-2 and vice versa (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 12 and 13). The results show that Oligo C-1 was able to completely compete with the binding of all three complexes to Oligo C-2 probe (Fig. 3, lanes 12 and 13) indicating that Oligo C-1 contains all the elements required for binding of nuclear factors to Oligo C-2. Once again, a differential competition pattern among the three complexes can be seen (the middle complex is competed at lower molar excess of Oligo C-1 than the top and lower ones). By contrast, when unlabeled Oligo C-2 was used to compete with the binding of nuclear factors to Oligo C-1 probe, complete competition was not seen (Fig. 3, lanes 5 a"
https://openalex.org/W2005518727,"Biliverdin and bilirubin are naturally-occurring tetrapyrrolic bile pigments containing two propionic acid side chains. These side chains, and their propensity for ionization, are critical in the biological disposition of the pigments. Surprisingly, accurate dissociation constants for the propionic acid groups of biliverdin are unknown, and a wide range of values, extending over some 4 orders of magnitude, has been suggested for the Ka values of the propionic acid groups of bilirubin in aqueous solutions. Recently, pKa values of 6.7-9.3 have been reported for bilirubin-values much greater than the value of ∼5 typical of propionic acid groups. These curiously high values, currently being used to explain the biological transport and metabolism of bilirubin and related compounds, have been attributed to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. We have determined the pKa values of 99%13C-enriched (13CO2>H) [83,123-13C2>]mesobilirubin-XIIIα, the corresponding biliverdin, and several monopropionic model compounds by 13C NMR spectroscopy. This technique allows direct observation and quantitative measurement of the carboxylic acid and carboxylate anion carbon signals. Analysis of the variation of carboxyl 13C NMR chemical shift with pH gave rubin pKa values of 4.2 and 4.9 and verdin pKa values of 3.9 and 5.3 in aqueous buffers containing only a very small quantity (0.086 mol fraction) of dimethyl sulfoxide. When extrapolated to water, the pKavalues are essentially unchanged. The data provide the first experimentally-determined pKa values for a biliverdin. They indicate that intramolecular hydrogen bonding has little effect on the acid dissociation of bilirubin and suggest that the equilibrium acidity of the bilirubin carboxylic acid groups is not abnormally high but similar to the thermodynamic acidity found in other carboxylic acids, as originally suggested by Overbeek et al. (Overbeek, J. T. G., Vink, C. L. J., and Deenstra, H. (1955) Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 74, 81-84).

Analysis of the variation of carboxyl 13C NMR chemical shift with pH gave rubin pKa values of 4.2 and 4.9 and verdin pKa values of 3.9 and 5.3 in aqueous buffers containing only a very small quantity (0.086 mol fraction) of dimethyl sulfoxide. When extrapolated to water, the pKavalues are essentially unchanged. The data provide the first experimentally-determined pKa values for a biliverdin. They indicate that intramolecular hydrogen bonding has little effect on the acid dissociation of bilirubin and suggest that the equilibrium acidity of the bilirubin carboxylic acid groups is not abnormally high but similar to the thermodynamic acidity found in other carboxylic acids, as originally suggested by Overbeek et al. (Overbeek, J. T. G., Vink, C. L. J., and Deenstra, H. (1955) Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 74, 81-84)."
https://openalex.org/W2040867447,"Native and oxidized low density lipoprotein retention within arterial wall endothelial cell matrix (ECM) is an early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Previously we showed lipoprotein lipase (LPL) addition to ECM enhanced the retention of apoB-containing lipoproteins. In the present studies we examined whether the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) increases its retention by LPL-containing ECM. Except where noted, 125I-labeled moderately oxidized LDL (ModOxLDL) was prepared by long term storage of 125I-LDL. Without LPL, 125I-ModOxLDL matrix binding was low and nonsaturable. LPL preanchored to ECM resulted in 125I-ModOxLDL binding that was saturable and 20-fold greater than in the absence of LPL, with an association constant equal to 2.6 nM. Copper-oxidized LDL (Cu-OxLDL) was able to compete with 125I-ModOxLDL, whereas a 60-fold native LDL excess had no effect. Reconstituted apolipoprotein B from Cu-OxLDL also reduced 125I-ModOxLDL to LPL, whereas liposomes derived from the lipid extract of Cu-OxLDL had no effect on binding. These data suggest that the increased binding of oxidized LDL to LPL•ECM may be due to the exposure of novel apoB binding sites and not an oxidized lipid moiety. 125I-ModOxLDL binding was also not affected by either preincubation with a 300-fold molar excess of apoE-poor HDL or an 340-fold molar excess of Cu-OxHDL. In contrast, a 4-fold apoE-rich HDL excess (based on protein) totally inhibited 125I-ModOxLDL matrix retention. Positively charged peptides of polyarginine mimicked the effect of apoE-rich HDL in reducing the 125I-ModOxLDL retention; however, polylysine had no effect. We postulate that the oxidation of LDL may be a mechanism that enhances LDL retention by the ECM-bound LPL and that the protective effects of apoE-containing HDL may in part be due to its ability to block the retention of oxidized LDL in vivo.

The process of LDL oxidation is not very well understood, but it appears to occur within the artery wall, facilitated by cellular lipoxygenase-dependent mechanisms or by nonenzymatic pathways. The phospholipid fatty acids of LDL are believed to be oxidatively modified first(25.Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kuhn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26.Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2488-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of phospholipids containing a spectrum of peroxidized fatty acids. Some of these, through chemical decomposition and/or enzymic hydrolysis, are believed to generate reactive aldehydes, which covalently modify the lysine residues of apoB and cause the surface charge to become more negative(27.Uchida K. Toyokuni S. Nishikawa K. Kawakishi S. Oda H. Hiai H. Stadtman E.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12487-12494Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Due to the oxidative attack, apoB also undergoes cleavage, which exposes neoepitopes on the protein(28.Lecomte E. Artur Y. Chancerelle Y. Herbeth B. Galteau M.-M. Jeandel C. Siest G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1993; 218: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although most of the biological effects of OxLDL are thought to result from oxidized lipid products, the increased scavenger receptor uptake of OxLDL is mediated by changes in surface protein charge(3.Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Another important step in the process of atherogenesis is believed to be the trapping of LDL within the subendothelial space. LDL retention increases its residence time within the artery wall and therefore its susceptibility to oxidative modification. In physiological ion and salt concentrations, very little native (unmodified) LDL binds to endothelial cell-derived matrix in vitro(29.Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although lowering the salt concentration or adding divalent cations can increase LDL retention to ECM(30.Radhakrishnamurthy B. Srinivasan S.R. Vijayagopal P. Berenson G.S. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11: 148-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Auerbach B.J. Bisgaier C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this does not appear to be physiologically relevant. However, under physiological conditions, the ECM avidly binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which in turn markedly enhances LDL binding(29.Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). LPL is normally present in the artery wall and increases, due to macrophage and smooth muscle cell production, during atherogenesis(32.O'Brien K.D. Gordon D. Deeb S. Ferguson M. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33.Ylä Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Goldberg I.J. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10143-10147Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The increased binding of LDL to LPL-containing ECM is mediated by positively charged clusters of arginine and lysine domains of apoB(34.Saxena U. Auerbach B.J. Ferguson E. Wölle J. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. Hegele R.A. Bisgaier C.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified or HDL-associated apolipoprotein E (apoE) is able to efficiently displace LDL from LPL-containing ECM by virtue of its positively charged domains(35.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Bisgaier C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14812-14819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine or lysine polymers were able to mimic the LDL displacement effects of apoE(34.Saxena U. Auerbach B.J. Ferguson E. Wölle J. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. Hegele R.A. Bisgaier C.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The binding characteristics of OxLDL to ECM are largely unknown. Because the association of OxLDL to the arterial subendothelial matrix is a potentially pivotal step in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, we explored the requirements for its binding and potential physiologic competitors. To exclude interference in the binding studies from enzymes typically used for enzymatic oxidation of LDL (lipoxygenase/phospholipase), we utilized OxLDL prepared by long term storage or by Cu2+ oxidation. The OxLDL, used in these studies, formed during long term storage in the absence of EDTA, was analyzed by the standard measures for the determination of the extent of oxidation (content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive materials, free amino group, fluorescence (excitation; 360 nm; emission: 430 nm), and migration on agarose gels). Because these particles were intermediate of native and maximally oxidized LDL for all the aforementioned assays, we used the term moderately oxidized (ModOxLDL) to describe these LDLs. We found that ModOxLDLs bound to the LPL with greater affinity than LDL, that the increased binding was due to oxidative modification of the protein moiety and not lipid, and that apoE-rich HDL and polyarginine effectively blocked the interaction between OxLDL and LPL anchored to the ECM. LDL (d = 1.019-1.063 g/ml) and HDL (d = 1.063-1.22 g/ml) were isolated by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation (36.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar) of plasma obtained from normolipidemic human volunteers. LDL was radioiodinated by the iodine monochloride method of McFarlane (37.McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) as modified by Bilheimer(38.Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the 125I-LDL preparations ranged from 360 to 600 cpm/ng. 125I-ModOxLDL was prepared by a modification of Berliner et al.(10.Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-LDL was stored at 4°C for greater than 45 days in phosphate-buffered saline (0.137 M NaCl, 0.01 sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) in the absence of EDTA. This method consistently yielded moderately oxidized LDL, with a migration on agarose intermediate of native and maximally copper-oxidized LDL. LDL was also oxidized by incubation in the presence of 2-10 μM copper sulfate (Sigma). Briefly, copper sulfate was added to 1 mg of LDL in phosphate-buffered saline, yielding a final copper concentration of 2-10 μM, and incubated for 12 h at 37°C. The copper sulfate was then removed utilizing Centriflo 50 concentrating cones (Amicon, Beverly, MA), the lipoproteins were then stored in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% EDTA. The extent of oxidation was determined by migration on agarose gels (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX), content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive material(39.Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), loss of free amino groups(40.Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3603-3608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fluorescence (excitation: 360 nm; emission: 430 nm)(23.Maeba R. Shimasaki H. Ueta N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1994; 1215: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The OxLDL yielded a thiobarbituric acid-reactive material value of 8-22 nmol of malondialdehyde equivalents/mg of protein, a 15-30% decrease in free amino groups (as compared with native LDL), and a fluorescence 6-8-fold greater than native LDL. ApoE-poor HDL was oxidized as outlined above for LDL, by incubation with 10 μM copper. Extent of oxidation was monitored by fluorescence (excitation: 360 nm; emission: 430 nm)(23.Maeba R. Shimasaki H. Ueta N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1994; 1215: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 41.Bonnefont-Rousselot D. Motta C. Khalil A.O. Sola R. La Ville A.E. Delattre J. Gardès-Albert M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1995; 1255: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), yielding a value 6.5-fold greater than native HDL. Lipid-free apoB from Cu-OXLDL was prepared essentially as described by Parthasarathy et al.(42.Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Otero D. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, Cu-OxLDL (2 mg of protein, 0.3 ml) was extracted using 10 volumes of iced-cold MeOH followed by an equivolume of CHCl3. The protein precipitate was isolated, washed, and then solubilized in octylglucoside (6 mg/ml) by vigorous vortexing for 15 min. The solvent fraction containing the lipids was dried, and large unilamelar vesicles were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline by the extrusion method of Berliner et al.(10.Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin S. Kim J.A. Bamshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Phospholipid content of the vesicles was measured enzymatically (Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, VA). ApoE-enriched HDL and apoE-poor HDL were isolated by Affi-Gel heparin chromatography (Bio-Rad) essentially as described by Rifici et al.(43.Rifici V.A. Eder H.A. Swaney J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 834: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Bovine milk LPL was purified from fresh unpasteurized milk using Affi-Gel heparin chromatography as described previously(44.Saxena U. Witte L.D. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4349-4355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured to confluence, and subendothelial cell matrix was prepared as described previously(35.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Bisgaier C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14812-14819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OxLDL and native LDL matrix retention studies were performed in both the presence and absence of LPL. Briefly, matrix was washed four times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma). LPL (8 μg/ml) was then added in DMEM/BSA and allowed to incubate with the ECM for 2 h at 4°C. Following the preincubation with LPL, the matrix was then washed three times with DMEM/BSA to remove any unbound LPL. Next, 125I-ModOxLDL or 125I-LDL was added to the ECM alone or in the presence of various unlabeled lipoproteins, liposomes, reconstituted oxidized apoB, or polypeptides and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The medium was then removed, and the matrix was washed three times with DMEM/BSA. Finally, the retained 125I-lipoproteins were released by the addition of 50 units of heparin (Sigma) and quantitated as described previously (29.Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein apolipoprotein content was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (Novex, San Diego, CA). Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Lowry et al.(45.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), employing BSA as a standard. 125I-ModOxLDL retention by the ECM was examined in the absence or presence of LPL (Fig. 1A). Without LPL,125I-ModOxLDL binding to ECM was low and nonsaturable. With LPL (8 μg/ml) 125I-ModOxLDL binding to ECM increased 25-fold, achieving saturation at 12.5 μg/ml (approximately 200 ng of apoB bound per well), which corresponds to approximately 1.25 mol of 125I-ModOxLDL binding per mol of LPL. Scatchard analysis estimated an association constant of 2.6 nM (Fig. 1A, inset). In a parallel experiment, 125I-LDL (Fig. 1B) also bound with high affinity in the presence of LPL; however, the association constant was one-fourth that of OxLDL. The amount of LDL retained corresponds to approximately 0.5 mol of LDL/mol of LPL. A subsaturating level of 125I-ModOxLDL (3.125 μg/ml) was chosen for the remaining studies. The specificity of ModOxLDL binding to LPL-containing ECM was examined by competition experiments utilizing native LDL, native LDL that was vortexed to promote aggregation, LDL that was oxidized with copper to varying degrees (Fig. 2), or the lipid extract or reconstituted protein from Cu-OxLDL. A 60-fold excess of native LDL or vortexed native LDL was ineffective in blocking the retention of 125I-ModOxLDL (Fig. 3). Conversely, Cu-OxLDL was able to completely block 125I-ModOxLDL binding to ECM (Fig. 4). Using LDL preparations oxidized to various degrees with copper as shown in Fig. 2, competition was shown to be dependent on both the concentration of Cu-OxLDL and the extent of copper oxidation. When 125I-ModOxLDL (12.5 μg/ml) was incubated in the presence of 12.5 μg/ml of Cu-OxLDL or reconstituted apoB from the same Cu-OxLDL there was a 50 and 25% decrease in binding, respectively (Fig. 4B). Lipid vesicles derived from the lipid extract of the Cu-OxLDL, at concentrations up to 25 μg/ml, had no effect on 125I-ModOxLDL retention by LPL-containing ECM (Fig. 4B). A 4-fold excess of Cu-OxLDL was also able to abolish the interaction of 125I-LDL (12.5 μg/ml) with LPL bound to the ECM (Fig. 5). These studies demonstrate that the major factor influencing the enhanced binding of ModOxLDL to LPL•ECM is the oxidation of the apoB protein.Figure 3:Effect of native or vortexed LDL on 125I-ModOxLDL binding to LPL•ECM. LPL was bound to ECM as described in Fig. 1 and then incubated with 125I-ModOxLDL (3.125 μg/ml) in DMEM/BSA alone (Control) or DMEM/BSA containing LDL (200 μg/ml) or the same LDL that was previously vortexed.

LPL was bound to ECM as described in Fig. 1 and then incubated with 125I-LDL (12.5 μg/ml) in DMEM/BSA alone (Control) or DMEM/BSA containing Cu-OxLDL at either 50 or 100 μg/ml. The Cu-OxLDL was generated as described under “Materials and Methods” in the presence of 8 μM copper sulfate.

Data represent the mean ± S.E. of an experiment performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate that the lipid moiety of oxidized LDL is not responsible for its increased affinity to LPL bound to matrix, 125I-ModOxLDL was incubated with a 16-fold excess (based on phospholipid, or approximately 300 HDL particles/LDL) of apoE-poor HDL for 24 h at 37°C to exchange the oxidized lipids and then reexamined for 125I-ModOxLDL binding. The binding characteristics of 125I-ModOxLDL to the LPL-containing ECM were essentially identical whether apoE-poor HDL was present during the preincubation or added just prior to the matrix binding experiment (Fig. 6). These results suggest that an exchangeable lipid on OxLDL is not responsible for its increased affinity to LPL-containing ECM. To determine if the oxidized effects observed were lipoprotein class-specific, we next copper-oxidized apoE-poor HDL (Cu-OxHDL) and used it to compete with 125I-ModOxLDL. Up to a 60-fold excess (based on protein, or approximately 340 HDL particles/LDL), of Cu-OxHDL had little effect on 125I-ModOxLDL binding (Fig. 7). These experiments demonstrate that neither a lipid nor apolipoprotein component of oxidized HDL can block the 125I-ModOxLDL binding, suggesting that the enhanced binding may be due to specific changes of apoB during oxidation.Figure 7:Competition of 125I-ModOxLDL by Cu2+-oxidized apoE-poor HDL. LPL was bound to ECM as described in Fig. 1 and then incubated with 125I-ModOxLDL alone (Control) or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of HDL that was oxidized as described under “Materials and Methods.” Plates were washed with buffer, and heparin-releasable radioactivity was determined as described in Fig. 1. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of an experiment performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that apoE and apoE-rich HDL blocked LDL retention by LPL anchored to ECM. We postulated that this effect was due to the arginine-rich regions contained within apoE competing with native LDL apoB for binding(35.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Bisgaier C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14812-14819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether apoE-rich HDL could similarly compete with OxLDL, 125I-ModOxLDL (3.125 μg/ml) was coincubated with an increasing concentration of apoE-rich HDL (3.125-200 μg/ml) and assessed for binding to an LPL-treated ECM (Fig. 8A). ApoE-rich HDL blocked the retention of125I-ModOxLDL to LPL•ECM in a concentration-dependent fashion, blocking greater than 90% of binding at 12.5 μg/ml. This level of competition was similar to that observed for LDL in our prior studies(35.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Bisgaier C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14812-14819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE-poor HDL at 400 μg/ml had no effect on retention (Fig. 8B). These results suggest that apoE competes with apoB-containing lipoproteins for binding to ECM-bound lipase, whether the lipoprotein is native or oxidatively modified. These experiments also yielded further evidence that the protein moiety of OxLDL is most likely responsible for its increased retention. To further ascertain the role of the oxidized protein in the enhanced retention of OxLDL, we investigated the role of the positively charged polypeptides polyarginine and polylysine for their ability to block 125I-ModOxLDL retention (Fig. 9A). Polyarginine blocked 125I-ModOxLDL retention in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing binding by 50% at 12.5 μg/ml, nearly 100% inhibition at 100 μg/ml (Fig. 9B). This was similar to what we observed for competition with native LDL(34.Saxena U. Auerbach B.J. Ferguson E. Wölle J. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. Hegele R.A. Bisgaier C.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) . However, polylysine at a concentration up to 100 μg/ml had no effect on binding (Fig. 9A). This is in contrast to the previously demonstrated ability of polylysine to compete with native LDL for LPL bound to ECM (34.Saxena U. Auerbach B.J. Ferguson E. Wölle J. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. Hegele R.A. Bisgaier C.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the apoB arginine residues may play an important role in OxLDL retention. The enhanced binding of native LDL to ECM is facilitated through an LPL bridge formed between matrix glycosaminoglycans and the lipoprotein(35.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Bisgaier C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14812-14819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The retention of LDL did not require an enzymatically active protein, since inactivated LPL (overnight incubation at 25°C) adsorbed to a microfilter plate was able to enhance LDL retention in an LPL concentration-dependent manner. 2B. J. Auerbach, C. L. Bisgaier, and U. Saxena, unpublished observations. However, the binding of LPL to the cell proteoglycans does require the enzyme to be active (46.Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2254-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We previously observed that apoE-rich HDL and apoE mimetics (polyarginine or polylysine) were effective competitors of native LDL bound to LPL•ECM and that this interaction did not release LPL from the matrix(34.Saxena U. Auerbach B.J. Ferguson E. Wölle J. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. Hegele R.A. Bisgaier C.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the subendothelium of atherosclerotic plaques epitopes of oxidized apoB have been found(47.Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Sigal E. Särkioja T. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 48.Jürgens G. Chen Q. Esterbauer H. Mair S. Ledinski G. Dinges H.P. Arterioscler.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), suggesting either their localized subendothelium production or rapid sequestration from plasma. In this regard, in the current studies, we investigated the comparative binding affinity of native LDL and ModOxLDL to ECM alone and in the presence of LPL and the ability of apoE-rich and apoE-poor HDL and apoE mimetics to reduce this retention. In the current studies, an experimental model of the subendothelial matrix was utilized to investigate the binding characteristics of 125I-ModOxLDL to the ECM. We found the binding of OxLDL to ECM alone was nonsaturating and of low affinity. In contrast, LPL greatly enhanced the saturable and high affinity binding of this modified lipoprotein. Compared with native LDL, OxLDL-bound ECM anchored LPL with a 4-fold greater affinity. The increased affinity was caused exclusively by the modification of LDL apoB and not the lipid. The affinity of OxLDL binding to LPL bound to ECM was dependent on the extent of LDL oxidation. Neither native LDL, aggregated LDL, nor apoE-poor HDL could effectively compete with 125I-ModOxLDL for ECM-bound LPL; in contrast, apoE-rich HDL efficiently blocked this interaction. Polyarginine mimicked the effects observed with apoE-rich HDL; however, polylysine was unexpectedly ineffective in competing with 125I-ModOxLDL for ECM-bound LPL. Four separate experiments suggest that the binding interaction between LPL bound to matrix and OxLDL is mediated by modified apoB rather than oxidized lipid. First, the isolated, reconstituted apoprotein moiety of Cu-OxLDL decreased the interaction of 125I-ModOxLDL with LPL•ECM, whereas the lipid portion had no effect. Preincubation with excess apoE-poor HDL, to remove any oxidized lipids, did not diminish matrix binding. Oxidized apoE-poor HDL also did not compete with OxLDL for binding. Last, both apoE-rich HDL and polyarginine effectively competed with OxLDL. Prior studies (31.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Auerbach B.J. Bisgaier C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have also shown that lyso-PC, a component of oxidized LDL, did not interfere with the retention of LDL with LPL-containing matrix. Collectively these data suggest that it is the oxidation of apoB that causes the enhanced binding. The experiments involving polyarginine and polylysine may help explain an apparent discrepancy between the present studies and our previous studies with nonoxidatively modified LDL. Native LDL modified by acetylation (modification of lysine residues) (50.Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 348: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and cyclohexanedione (modification of arginine residues) (51.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) do not block LDL binding to LPL-matrix as efficiently as native LDL(34.Saxena U. Auerbach B.J. Ferguson E. Wölle J. Marcel Y.L. Weisgraber K.H. Hegele R.A. Bisgaier C.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, we show that oxidation of LDL, which has been shown to modify the lysine residues, greatly enhances its association with LPL and can completely block LDL retention. Why does OxLDL bind with higher affinity to LPL-containing ECM, and why is polylysine ineffective in blocking OxLDL retention? This apparent paradox may be explained with the process of LDL oxidation. Oxidation of apoB leads to its fragmentation(28.Lecomte E. Artur Y. Chancerelle Y. Herbeth B. Galteau M.-M. Jeandel C. Siest G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1993; 218: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 52.Heinecke J.W. Kawamura M. Suzuki L. Chait A. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which may expose novel sites and also confer conformational changes. This, in turn, may result in a higher affinity binding of OxLDL to LPL•ECM. Oxidation also modifies the lysine residues on apoB. The lysine modification would decrease its role in the binding to LPL, which may account for the inability of polylysine to inhibit the OxLDL binding. Further experiments are necessary to delineate the precise mechanisms of these effects. The ability of apoE-rich HDL to compete with oxidized LDL increases our understanding of the importance of this lipoprotein fraction and in particular apoE. Studies in apoE transgenic and apoE-deficient mice demonstrate the antiatherogenic properties of apoE. Mice, which are normally atherosclerosis-resistant, become very prone to atherosclerosis when they are made apoE-deficient by gene targeting (54.Van Ree J.H. Van den Broek W.J.A.A. Dahlmans V.E.H.

Interestingly, these mice present with both circulating oxidized LDL and antibodies to epitopes of oxidized apoB(49.Palinski W. Ord V.A. Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Recently, Shimano et al. created transgenic mice overexpressing apoE in the arterial wall(56.Shimano H. Ohsuga J. Shimada M. Namba Y. Gotoda T. Harada K. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When these mice were fed an atherogenic diet, significant decreases in fatty streak formation as compared with nontransgenic controls was observed. Therefore, in these models, the excess of apoE within the lesions may impede the retention of OxLDL and thereby inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. Epitopes of oxidized apoB have been demonstrated in the extracellular matrix of lesion areas in animals and humans using antibodies to malondialdehyde OxLDL(47.Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the studies presented here, it is possible that when circulating OxLDL infiltrates the artery wall it is captured by matrix-bound LPL. Alternatively, native LDL may first bind to the matrix-bound LPL, and then be oxidized by cells within the arterial wall, thereby resulting in higher affinity binding. In this regard, it has been shown in vitro that the binding of LDL to matrix proteoglycans increases the lipoprotein's susceptibility to oxidation (62.Hurt Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. Lopez F. Ahlstrom C. Fager G. Bondjers G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In either scenario, OxLDL may be selectively trapped within the artery wall by such interactions as those presented here. The accumulation of native and CuOxLDL have been studied in vivo in balloon catheter-deendothelialized rabbit aorta(63.Chang M.Y. Lees A.M. Lees R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8518-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The accumulation of native and OxLDL in areas of regenerating endothelium were similar. However, in areas that were still de-endothelialized, OxLDL was retained 2.9-fold more than native LDL, despite its more rapid clearance from plasma. Additionally, the extent of lysine modification of ModOxLDL in these studies is sufficient to be recognized by the scavenger receptor (64). Thus, oxidation may enhance retention in the arterial wall by both increased binding to LPL and uptake through the scavenger receptor, markedly increasing its ability to promote various steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that oxidized LDL has a higher affinity to LPL anchored to subendothelial matrix than native LDL and that the increased retention is due to the oxidation of apoB, not the lipids. Furthermore, unlike native LDL, it is mainly the arginine residues, not the lysines, that play an important role in this retention. And finally, apoE-rich HDL has been shown to be as effective in blocking the retention of OxLDL, strengthening its role as an antiatherogenic agent."

We found that detergent-solubilized pIgR binds to CaM-agarose in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, and binding is inhibited by the addition of excess free CaM or the CaM antagonist W-13 (N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide), suggesting that pIgR binding to CaM is specific.

CaM can be chemically cross-linked to both solubilized and membrane-associated pIgR, suggesting that binding can occur while the pIgR is in intact membranes.

Furthermore, pIgR is the most prominent 35S-labeled CaM-binding protein in the detergent phase of Triton X-114-solubilized, metabolically labeled pIgR-expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. CaM can be chemically cross-linked to both solubilized and membrane-associated pIgR, suggesting that binding can occur while the pIgR is in intact membranes. The CaM binding site is located in the membrane-proximal 17-amino acid segment of the pIgR cytoplasmic tail. This region of pIgR constitutes an autonomous basolateral targeting signal. However, binding of CaM to various pIgR mutants suggests that CaM binding is not necessary for basolateral targeting. We suggest that CaM may be involved in regulation of pIgR transcytosis and/or signaling by pIgR. INTRODUCTIONThe plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells is divided into apical and basolateral surfaces, each having a distinct protein and lipid composition. Cells use two pathways to deliver proteins to the correct surface. First, newly made proteins are packaged in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used in this paper are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkpIgRpolymeric immunoglobulin receptorCaMcalmodulind/pIgAdimeric/polymeric immunoglobulin AVSVGvesicular stomatitis virus protein GBS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate[Ca2+]icytosolic free calciumRRCreceptor recycling compartmentMVBmultivesicular bodyCURLcompartment of uncoupling of receptor and ligandSCsecretory componentPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. into vesicles that deliver them directly to either the apical or basolateral surface. Second, proteins can be delivered first to one surface and then endocytosed and transcytosed to the opposite surface. At least in the well polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line, targeting to the basolateral surface generally requires a sorting signal located in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein. For a number of basolateral proteins it has been found that mutations in the cytoplasmic domain prevent TGN to basolateral targeting(1.Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The first basolateral signal to be identified is the 17-amino acid membrane proximal segment (residues 653-670) of the cytoplasmic domain of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)(2.Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This protein is normally delivered from the TGN to the basolateral surface, and then endocytosed and transcytosed to the apical surface. Deletion of most of this 17-residue segment prevents TGN to basolateral delivery. Moreover, this segment can be transplanted to a heterologous reporter molecule, which is then retargeted from the apical to the basolateral surface(2.Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In at least one other case, the low density lipoprotein receptor, autonomous basolateral sorting signals have been identified(3.Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).The pIgR basolateral targeting signal has been systematically analyzed by alanine scanning mutagenesis(4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutation of His-656, Arg-657, or Val-660 to Ala substantially diminishes, but does not eliminate, TGN to basolateral targeting. Mutation of other residues had little or no effect. The structure of a synthetic 17-residue peptide corresponding to this signal has been determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy(4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This peptide tends to adopt a putative type 1 β-turn, encompassing residues 658-661, followed by a nascent helical structure. In MDCK cells polarized sorting takes place in both the TGN and after endocytosis. Mutations that diminish TGN to basolateral sorting and increase TGN to apical sorting have a similar effect on sorting in the endocytotic pathway, decreasing recycling to the basolateral surface and increasing transcytosis to the apical surface(5.Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the basolateral targeting signal also functions as a signal to retrieve the pIgR from the endocytotic pathway to the basolateral surface. Very similar results have been obtained with the two basolateral sorting signals of the low density lipoprotein receptor(6.Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This suggests that the same sorting machinery operates in both the TGN and the endocytotic pathway, or that sorting in both pathways actually occurs in a common compartment.Transcytosis of pIgR is regulated by several mechanisms. Phosphorylation of Ser664, which is part of the basolateral sorting signal, stimulates transcytosis. Mutation of Ser-664 to Ala (S664A) reduces transcytosis, while mutation to Asp (S664D), whose negative charge may mimic a phosphate, stimulates transcytosis(7.Casanova J.E. Breitfeld P.P. Ross S.A. Mostov K.E. Science. 1990; 248: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation apparently works by weakening the basolateral signal, since the S664D mutant exhibits decreased TGN to basolateral sorting, increased TGN to apical sorting(5.Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as well as decreased recycling and increased transcytosis after endocytosis.Binding of the ligand, dimeric IgA (dIgA) to the pIgR also stimulates transcytosis. Ligand binding stimulates transcytosis of the wild-type pIgR, as well as S664D and S664A(8.Song W. Bomsel M. Casanova J. Vaerman J.-P. Mostov K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9.Hirt R.P. Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Michetti P. Perregaux C. Poulain-Godefroy O. Jeanguenat N. Neutra M.R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Cell. 1993; 74: 245-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent stimulation suggests that the pIgR may transduce a signal to the cytoplasm. Indeed, we have recently found that dIgA binding causes tyrosine phosphorylation of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cγ1, activation of protein kinase C, and production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. 2M. Cardone, F. Luton, and K. E. Mostov, unpublished data. Transcytosis of pIgR and other molecules is stimulated either by activation of protein kinase C (10.Cardone M.H. Smith B.L. Song W. Mochley-Rosen D. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or by increase in intracellular free Ca2+, 3M. Cardone and K. E. Mostov, unpublished data. so both arms of the phospholipase C signaling pathway may redundantly stimulate transcytosis. Delivery to the apical surface, either by transcytosis or directly from the TGN, is also stimulated by the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs(11.Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25824-25835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. Nature. 1993; 362: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), as well as cAMP and protein kinase A(13.Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both the Gsα and Gβγ subunits are stimulatory, at least for transcytotic apical delivery(11.Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25824-25835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcytosis in MDCK cells is stimulated by bradykinin,3 while in animals transcytosis is stimulated by several hormones and neurotransmitters (15.Jin G.-F. Guo Y.-S. Houston C.W. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1989; 34: 1708-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16.Freier S. Eran M. Faber J.

Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 881-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Presumably, these extracellular signals work through the various second messengers mentioned above.Transcytosis of the pIgR can be divided by both morphological and biochemical assays into at least three steps. Step 1 is internalization via clathrin-coated pits into basolateral early endosomes. Step 2 is delivery to a compartment located immediately beneath the apical plasma membrane (“apical recycling compartment”)(19.Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20.Barroso M. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Step 3 is delivery to the apical plasma membrane. It has previously been observed that phosphorylation of Ser-726 regulates step 1(21.Okamoto C.T. Song W. Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15676-15682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Ser-664 regulates both steps 2 and 3(22.Song W. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29474-29480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas dIgA(22.Song W. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29474-29480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C(10.Cardone M.H. Smith B.L. Song W. Mochley-Rosen D. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and cAMP (14.Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) act primarily on step 3.We are interested in molecules that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the pIgR, particularly its basolateral sorting signal, as such molecules might be involved in basolateral sorting and/or regulation of traffic. The best evidence for a candidate molecule capable of recognizing and deciphering a basolateral targeting signal is a protein of ∼220 kDa apparent molecular mass that has been cross-linked to the cytoplasmic domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) (23.Pimplikar S.W. Ikonen E. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of VSVG prevented cross-linking and also inhibited TGN to basolateral transport of VSVG in permeabilized MDCK cells, while a peptide corresponding to a mutant VSVG that is not basolaterally targeted prevented neither cross-linking nor basolateral transport. However, a peptide corresponding to the pIgR 17-amino acid basolateral targeting signal did not inhibit basolateral transport of VSVG(23.Pimplikar S.W. Ikonen E. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein might not recognize the pIgR basolateral targeting signal.Studies on MDCK cells using CaM antagonists suggest that CaM is important in endosome function(24.Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Apodaca G. Enrich C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19005-19013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that in the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM) binds to the basolateral sorting signal of the pIgR. An analysis of mutant pIgRs reveals that the sequence requirements for basolateral targeting of the pIgR and CaM binding are not identical, suggesting that the role of CaM binding is not to target the pIgR to the basolateral surface, but rather may be involved in regulation of pIgR transcytosis.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Rat Liver Subcellular FractionsThree rat liver endosomal subfractions, designated early endosomes (CURL, compartment for uncoupling of receptors and ligands), late endosomes (MVB, multivesicular bodies), and a receptor recycling compartment (RRC), were isolated from estradiol-treated rats as described previously(26.Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Endosomal membranes were separated from contents after rupturing the organelles in a French pressure cell(26.Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jaeckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).AntibodiesUnfractionated ascites fluid containing the monoclonal antibody SC166, which recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of the rabbit and rat polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), was prepared as described elsewhere(27.Solari R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Cell. 1984; 36: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A sheep polyclonal antibody made against rabbit secretory component (SC) has also been described (28.Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Tang K. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20380-20385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Western BlottingTwo-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out as described(29.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters at 20 V overnight at 4°C. Filters were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% powdered skim milk to block nonspecific sites. The nitrocellulose was then incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of the monoclonal ascites SC-166 directed against the cytoplasmic tail of the pIgR in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and detection with 4-chloro-1-naphthol as described by Burnette(30.Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5857) Google Scholar).Calmodulin Overlay TechniqueFor the 125I-CaM overlay of two-dimensional gels, the method described by Bachs and Carafoli (31.Bachs O. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10786-10790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Calmodulin, isolated as described (32.Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from Sigma, was radioiodinated with the Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp.). Endosome fractions enriched in CURL and RRC show similar protein compositions and give similar results in 125I-CaM overlays. An experiment using RRC is shown under “Results” (Fig. 1).MDCK Clones Expressing pIgR ConstructsAll nucleotide and amino acid positions are according to the original published rabbit pIgR sequence(33.Mostov K.E. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1984; 308: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). MDCK strain II cells expressing wild-type pIgR (34.Breitfeld P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a mutant lacking a membrane-proximal 14-amino acid segment of the cytoplasmic tail required for basolateral targeting (pIgR Δ655-668) (2.Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and a “tail-minus” construct lacking all but the two membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (2.Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35.Mostov K.E. de Bruyn Kops A. Deitcher D.L. Cell. 1986; 47: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) termed R655-STOP(4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), have been described previously. An MDCK clone expressing pIgR in which the cytoplasmic domain consists only of the membrane proximal 17-amino acid basolateral targeting signal (T670-STOP)(4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and point mutants in which individual residues in the pIgR 17-amino acid basolateral targeting signal are replaced with alanine in the context of the entire cytoplasmic tail (H656A, R657A, N659A, and V660A) (5.Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have also been described. These mutants are indicated by the wild-type amino acid, followed by the position and the new amino acid (e.g. H656A designates a mutant where histidine at position 656 has been mutated to alanine). A construct encoding the full-length pIgR molecule with a substitution of alanine for arginine at position 658 was constructed by ligating a DNA fragment encoding the C terminus (residues 661-755) of wild-type pIgR clone to a fragment encoding residues 1-660 derived from the R658A/T670-STOP mutant described previously (4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) via a common AvaII site at nucleotide position 2007. The resulting cDNA was ligated into the BglII site of pCB6 (36.Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and transfected into MDCK strain II cells as described previously(4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutants in which serine 664 has been mutated to alanine (S664A) or aspartic acid (S664D) have also been described(7.Casanova J.E. Breitfeld P.P. Ross S.A. Mostov K.E. Science. 1990; 248: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation of pIgR was performed using protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) coupled to polyclonal sheep anti-SC IgG, essentially as described(4.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Calmodulin Affinity ChromatographyFor CaM-agarose binding assays, MDCK cells expressing pIgR constructs were grown on 24-mm Transwell filters (0.4-μm pore size, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) metabolically labeled at 37°C for 40 min on an 80-μl drop of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine (obtained from the UCSF cell culture facility, supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum) containing 25 μCi of [35S]cysteine (DuPont NEN). The Transwell filters were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing CaCl2 and Mg2+, and filters were cut out and placed in 1 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 containing 1% Triton X-114 (Boehringer Mannheim) and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 500 μM benzamidine, and 0.1% Trasylol) and rotated for 15 min at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube containing 6 μl of 0.5 M EGTA (3 mM final). Triton X-114 phase-partitioning was performed by warming to 37°C for 3 min, followed by centrifugation at full speed for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. The aqueous phase was discarded, and the detergent phase was resuspended with nine volumes (approximately 0.9 ml) of cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 3 mM EGTA) and incubated at 4°C for 5 min. The phase-separation procedure was repeated, followed by dilution of the detergent phase with nine volumes of ice-cold binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2). After 5 min at 4°C, the samples were precleared with 50 μl of Sepharose CL-2B at 4°C(34.Breitfeld P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The sample (500 μl) was combined with 450 μl of binding buffer and 50 μl of a 20% slurry of CaM-agarose, which had been equilibrated with binding buffer. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a rotator. After pelleting the CaM-agarose beads briefly in a cold microcentrifuge and aspirating the liquid, the beads were washed once with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and once with binding buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100. At this point, a 5-min incubation was carried out at 4°C with binding buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, with or without 3 mM EGTA. The liquid was separated from the beads as before, and the beads were washed once with binding buffer with or without EGTA (no detergent). The beads (10 μl packed) were boiled in 20 μl of sample buffer, and half of the sample (∼10 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or phosphorimaging. Total pIgR in the starting material for CaM-agarose was determine by immunoprecipitation of a duplicate sample. Starting material, typically 500 μl, was diluted with an equal volume of 2.5% Triton dilution buffer (2.5% Triton X-100, 100 mM triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1% Trasylol, 0.02% NaN3) and analyzed by pIgR immunoprecipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or phosphorimaging.To correct for differences in pIgR concentrations in the starting material due to differing expression levels among clones or different partitioning behavior of constructs in Triton X-114, unlabeled preparations were analyzed by Western blotting to determine the relative concentration of each construct in the preparations. For clones that yield more pIgR in the starting material, the volume of Triton X-114 preparation added was reduced appropriately so that approximately equal amounts of each pIgR (wild-type or mutant) were added to CaM beads. The total amount of Triton-X114 starting material added was kept at 500 μl by adding the appropriate volume of an identical preparation from non-transfected MDCK cells.Cross-linking of CaM to Solubilized pIgRTriton X-114 preparations (made as described above, except that Hepes was substituted for Tris) of metabolically labeled proteins from MDCK cells expressing pIgR constructs were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μM exogenous CaM, with or without 3 mM EGTA. After 1 h of incubation at 4°C, 0.5 mM BS3 (Pierce) was added to the samples indicated. Incubation was continued for an additional 1 h, at which time the cross-linker was quenched by addition of glycine to 100 mM. SDS was added to a final concentration of 1%, samples were boiled for 5 min, diluted with an equal volume of 5% Triton dilution buffer (5% Triton X-100, 100 mM triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1% Trasylol, 0.02% NaN3), precleared once with 50 μl of Sepharose CL-2B, and immunoprecipitated for pIgR. Precipitates were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.Cross-linking of CaM to Crude MembranesMDCK cells expressing pIgR constructs were grown on 15-cm dishes for 3-5 days until confluent. Cells were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted at 150 × g for 5 min at 4°C, washed once in homogenization buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose), and resuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors by pipetting with a 1-ml micropipette tip. Cells were homogenized by 12 passes through a 22-gauge needle. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 1400 × g for 15 min at 4°C. EGTA was added to the post-nuclear supernatant to 3 mM, followed by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C (68,000 rpm in a Sorvall RP100-AT4). The pellet, containing crude membranes, was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes, 3 mM EGTA. Glycerol was added to 5%, and the membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Just prior to use, samples were thawed and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and pellets were resuspended in HNMC (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2). 125I-CaM (prepared by the iodine monochloride method; (37.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 241-259Crossref Scopus (1276) Google Scholar)), was incubated with crude membranes in HNMC for 1 h at 4°C in the presence or absence of 3 mM EGTA. BS3 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Samples were quenched with glycine, boiled in SDS, and immunoprecipitated and analyzed as above.RESULTSIdentification of a Rat Liver Endosome CaM-binding Protein as pIgRCaM has been suggested to play several possible roles in membrane traffic in mammalian cells. We and others have examined the effects of inhibitors of CaM, such as W13 and W7, on various steps in membrane traffic(24.Hunziker W. J. Biol.

In MDCK cells expressing pIgR, these drugs inhibited transcytosis of pIgR and recycling of transferrin, and caused all material endocytosed from both surfaces of the cell to be delivered to exceptionally large, abnormal endosomal structures(25.Apodaca G. Enrich C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19005-19013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for CaM in polarized sorting in early endosomes. However, the mechanism(s) by which CaM regulates membrane traffic events are poorly understood.In order to address the mechanism(s) by which CaM regulates endosomal function, we were interested in identifying major CaM-binding proteins in endosomes. Previous studies showed a major CaM-binding protein of approximately 115 kDa could be demonstrated by 125I-CaM overlay of two-dimensional protein blots of an endosome-rich fraction from rat liver(38.Enrich C. Bachs O. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We discovered that this protein can also be labeled by staining with a monoclonal antibody (SC166) against the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with a rabbit antiserum raised against rat SC (data not shown).Characterization of CaM Binding to pIgRIn order to further support the identification of pIgR as the CaM-binding protein, and to map and characterize the CaM binding site on pIgR, we developed a CaM-binding assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” MDCK cells expressing the pIgR were metabolically labeled and solubilized with Triton X-114. Hydrophobic, integral membrane proteins partition into the detergent phase during Triton X-114 phase separation induced by warming to 37°C. Surprisingly, when such a preparation is added to CaM-agarose in the presence of Ca2+, followed by washing to remove nonspecific binding, pIgR is the major protein detected after the CaM beads are eluted with SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 2A). This result is striking when one considers that pIgR is only a minor protein in the starting material (Fig. 2A), and that there are numerous CaM-binding proteins that might be present in the Triton X-114-partitioned material. It is similarly striking that pIgR is the major CaM-binding protein detected in the rat liver membrane fraction (Fig. 1).Figure 2:Binding of pIgR to CaM-agarose.

The increase of GST-P mRNA after lead administration is blocked by actinomycin D, suggesting that GST-P production by lead is regulated at the transcriptional level. To further determine which part of the flanking region of the GST-P gene has the lead-responsive cis-element in vivo, we utilized transgenic rats with five different constructs having GST-P and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence. We studied the effect of lead on these transgenic rats and on transfected NRK (normal rat kidney) cells and found that GST-P induction by lead is indeed regulated at the transcriptional level and that the GST-P enhancer I (GPEI) enhancer is an essential cis-element required for the activation of the GST-P gene by lead. GPEI consists of two AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer) site-like sequences that are palindromically arranged and can bind AP-1. c-jun mRNA in the liver increased after lead administration and GST-P, and c-Jun had patchy expression in the same hepatocytes 24 h after lead exposure. These results suggest that activation of the GST-P gene by lead is mediated in major part by enhancer GPEI and that AP-1 may be involved at least partially. GPEI has been shown to have essential sequence information for the trans-activation of the GST-P gene during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis of the rat (Morimura, S., Suzuki, T., Hochi, S., Yuki, A., Nomura, K., Kitagawa, T., Nagatsu, I., Imagawa, M., and Muramatsu, M.(1993) Proc.

The present study establishes that the same enhancer element does operate in the activation of the GST-P gene by lead regardless of the trans-activators involved. Glutathione transferase P (GST-P) is specifically induced in rat liver and kidney by lead cation.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1979; 29: 175-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). This enzyme is known to be dramatically increased during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis of the rat(2.Kitahara A. Satoh K. Nishimura K. Ishikawa T. Ruike K. Sato K. Tsuda H. Ito N. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2698-2703PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Sugioka Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 365-378PubMed Google Scholar). This is apparently an induction at the transcriptional level(3.Sugioka Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6049-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but is somewhat different from usual induction in that it is not reversed by withdrawal of the carcinogen but becomes constitutive in the precancerous liver cells. It has also been reported that GST-P is induced by lead nitrate (5.Columbano A. Ledda G.M. Sirigu P. Perra T. Pani P. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 116: 83-88Google Scholar, 6.Roomi M.W. Columbano A.

J. 1993; 294: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), although other metals can hardly affect its production(10.Sato K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1988; 79: 556-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Glutathione is supposed to serve as a first line of defense against heavy metal cytotoxicity prior to induction of metallothionein(11.Templeton D.M. Cherian M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Rats given lead acetate induce metallothionein-like lead-bound protein and zinc-metallothionein. The binding of lead to metallothionein-like lead-bound protein seems not so tight but metallothionein-like lead-bound protein bound lead accounts for about 60% of the lead in the rat liver cytosol at maximum(12.Ikebuchi H. Teshima R. Suzuki K. Terao T. Yamane Y. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Ikebuchi H. Teshima R. Suzuki K. Sawada J. Terao T. Yamane Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Zinc-metallothionein is supposed to sequester lead and donate zinc to other zinc-dependent enzyme(11.Templeton D.M. Cherian M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore GST-P may play an important role in cooperation with metallothionein-like lead-bound protein and zinc-metallothioneins in the detoxification of lead. glutathione transferase P chloramphenicol acetyltransferase base pair(s) kilobase(s) GST-P enhancer I glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase normal rat kidney. To understand the mechanisms of tumor-specific expression of this gene during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, we have cloned the GST-P gene (4.Sugioka Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6049-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14.Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3858-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and identified at −2.5 kb of the 5′-flanking region a strong enhancer, termed GPEI, whose core consisting of two AP-1 site-like sequences (1-base mismatch for each) arranged in a palindrome(14.Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3858-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16.Okuda A. Imagawa M. Maeda Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol.

By using transgenic rats we have recently demonstrated that the GST-P gene is activated by some transactivator(s) during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and that the activation requires 5′-flanking region of GST-P gene containing GPEI(18.Morimura S. Suzuki T. Hochi S. Yuki A. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Nagatsu I. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2065-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have also shown that GPEI itself is the necessary cis-element for GST-P gene expression during this process(19.Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Hirabayashi M. Yuki A. Hisatake K. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2651-2655PubMed Google Scholar). Question arises as to whether GST-P expression at lead exposure is regulated at the transcriptional level and whether a common regulatory mechanism of GST-P gene expression is operative between the precancerous liver cells and lead-treated liver cells. To answer these questions, we have utilized transgenic rats having various transgene constructs. We have also transfected NRK fibroblast cells with a series of ECAT deletion mutant genes and determined CAT activity in order to narrow down the lead-responsive DNA region of the GST-P gene. The results indicate that GST-P induction by lead is regulated at the transcriptional level and that the essential cis-element for GST-P gene activation by lead is also the enhancer GPEI. Furthermore, to clarify the role of c-Jun in the activation of GST-P gene by lead, we studied the expression of c-Jun and GST-P in the liver cells at acute lead exposure using immunohistochemistry. The data show that GPEI is an essential element for the activation of the GST-P gene by lead and that trans-acting factor AP-1 is likely to be involved at least in part in the transcriptional activation of GST-P gene by lead through GPEI sequence. A 3.0-kb fragment between −2.9 kb (EcoRI) and +59 bp (AccI) of the GST-P gene was inserted into the HindIII site of pSV0CAT and designated as ECAT. A series of 5′ deletion mutants, including 1CAT, were constructed from the ECAT by using appropriate restriction enzymes(15.Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Δ-56CAT is one of the deletion mutants, containing minimum GST-P promoter (−56 bp to +59 bp) fused with CAT coding region. Although the GST-P gene has one authentic AP-1 site near the promoter at −60 bp, it is disrupted in the Δ-56CAT construct(15.Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Genomic 122-bp sequence containing GPEI (15.Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17.Okuda A. Imagawa M. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was subcloned into downstream BamHI site of CAT gene in Δ-56CAT and designated as Δ-56CAT GPEI. Synthetic oligonucleotides having 17-bp GPEI core sequence was inserted into the BamHI site of Δ-56CAT and named as nCAT. We made six lines of nCAT transgenic rats. nCAT gene is activated in the liver of only one line (line 4) during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis(19.Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Hirabayashi M. Yuki A. Hisatake K. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2651-2655PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we used nCAT line 4 transgenic rats in the following experiments. The above constructs are depicted in each figure. Transgenic rats having DNA of ECAT, 1CAT, Δ-56CAT, Δ-56CAT GPEI, or nCAT were established as described previously(19.Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Hirabayashi M. Yuki A. Hisatake K. Nomura K. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2651-2655PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of the high molecular weight DNA extracted from the surgically removed tails of newborn rats was used to select the transgenic animals. Each rat transmitted 5-33 transgenes integrated into a single site in a tandem array. Minced tail was incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 55°C, and DNA was extracted with phenol. For blotting, 5 μg of BamHI-digested DNA was separated by a 1.0% agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with a labeled fragment of GST-P gene (11.Templeton D.M. Cherian M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or CAT coding region(20.Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions were: 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.9 M NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon testis DNA at 42°C for 18 h. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS at 60°C. Untreated 10-week-old male Wistar rats were used as a control. Lead nitrate or lead acetate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 100 μM just prior to use and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 μmol/kg. Rats were given the same lead salt every 24 h three times and were sacrificed 24 h after the last lead salt administration. In some experiments, a single dose of lead acetate (100 μmol/kg) was administered and rats were sacrificed at 0, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h later. In other experiments, actinomycin D (Serva, Heidelberg) was dissolved in 50% propylene glycol and administered intraperitoneally (0.8 mg/kg body weight) 4 h before single dose of lead nitrate (100 μmol/kg)(21.Shapiro S.G. Squibb K.S. Markowitz L.A. Cousins R.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the rats were killed 12 h thereafter. Cytosol was prepared from control rat liver homogenized in 4 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Ten μg of protein determined by the method of Bradford (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) was electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 12.5% acrylamide(23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filter with a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). After transfer, GST-P band was visualized by immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibody against GST-P (Bioprep, Dublin) and alkaline phosphatase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Total RNA was isolated from control rat tissues by homogenizing in 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate followed by extraction with hot phenol(24.Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.59Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.6 M formaldehyde and blotted to a nitrocellulose filter. Hybridization was performed using a fragment of GST-P cDNA(4.Sugioka Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6049-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), rat c-jun cDNA (25.Sakai M. Okuda A. Hatayama I. Sato K. Nishi S. Muramatsu M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Livers and kidneys were obtained from ECAT, 1CAT, Δ-56CAT, Δ-56CAT GPEI, and nCAT transgenic rats and were homogenized in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Debris was removed from the homogenate by successive centrifugations at 1,000 × g for 10 min and at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Sample supernatant was adjusted to 100 mg of protein and assayed for CAT activity according to Gorman et al.(20.Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The NRK cells, a normal rat kidney fibroblast cell line, was supplied by Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (JCRB). NRK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid construct and 5 μg of pRSVβGAL by calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure described by Chen and Okayama(30.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Lead nitrate was added to the culture medium 24 h before DNA transfection and thereafter every 24 h until the cells were harvested. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The concentration of lead nitrate was 10 nM, because this concentration of lead nitrate could stimulate well the GST-P mRNA accumulation in NRK cells (data not shown) and appeared less harmful to these cells than higher concentrations according to the morphological observation. Cell lysates were obtained after five times of freeze-thaw in 0.25 M Tris HCl (pH 7.5). The protein was equalized using β-galactosidase activity (24.Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.59Google Scholar) and used for CAT assay. The degree of acetylation was determined by reading the intensity of the spots using the Fuji-BAS 2000 system (Fuji Photo, Tokyo). Liver tissues from control rats treated with or without lead acetate and killed at 24 h were fixed in ice-cold acetone, and paraffin wax-embedded sections were used for immunoperoxidase staining method using rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Jun antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Hideo Iba, University of Tokyo) or anti-GST-P antibody (2.Kitahara A. Satoh K. Nishimura K. Ishikawa T. Ruike K. Sato K. Tsuda H. Ito N. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2698-2703PubMed Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Dr. Kiyomi Sato, Hirosaki University) with the Vectastain ABC elite kit (Vector Laboratories, St. Louis, MO). To confirm the effect of lead nitrate on the induction of GST-P in rats and to set the experimental conditions, we first investigated the GST-P protein expression in liver of control rats. Lead nitrate caused accumulation of GST-P protein in liver of control rats as seen by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). The amount of basal GST-P was quite low in the rat liver, although the image being intensified on the Fig. 1. GST-P protein in the liver increased 1.8-fold 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of 100 μmol/kg of lead nitrate once a day for 3 days. GST-P protein in the kidney increased in a similar fashion by lead (data not shown). Higher doses, such as 200 μmol/kg, caused lower increases, probably due to the toxic effect to the animal. The results were confirmed by more than two experiments. To confirm that GST-P production was stimulated by lead cation but not by nitrate ion, we tested the effect of lead acetate on the rat liver and kidney. Lead acetate stimulated the production of GST-P, even more effectively than lead nitrate did in the liver and kidney of the rats (data not shown), confirming that lead cation was indeed responsible for the induction of GST-P. The result is compatible with the previous report by others(9.Boyce S.J. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We next investigated the effect of lead acetate on the content of GST-P mRNA in the liver of rats. As seen in Fig. 2, lead acetate increased GST-P mRNA content significantly at about 12 h after lead administration and decreased by 48 h. After lead injection, c-jun mRNA increased by 15-30 min, once decreased, and then increased at 3 h and decreased and again increased at about 12 h and finally decreased by 48 h. Thus, the amount of c-jun mRNA apparently had three peaks of expression, which was confirmed by repeated experiments (Fig. 2, A and B). We infer that some oscillation of transcription regulators may occur after lead treatment; the first increase of c-jun mRNA may be the result of self-defensive immediate early response to acute invasion of xenobiotics such as lead salt, the second peak may have occurred due to the up-regulation of the c-jun transcription by c-Jun oncoprotein itself produced by the immediate early response, since c-jun is known to have an AP-1 site at its promoter and to be up-regulated by c-Jun(31.Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), and the third peak may be the results of complex interactions of the transcription factors, including c-Jun involved in the detoxification of the xenobiotics. Fig. 2 also shows that the third peak of c-jun expression correlates well with the marked increase of GST-P mRNA, suggesting that the third peak may play a role in the expression of GST-P gene. We also studied the mRNA expression of JunB and JunD, which attenuate the transactivation and transformation activities of c-Jun by heterodimer formation (c-Jun/JunB and c-Jun/JunD)(32.Schutte J. Viallet J. Nau M. Segal S. Fedorko J. Minna J. Cell. 1989; 59: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 33.Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and also of c-Fos, which forms more stable Jun/Fos heterodimer (AP-1 complex) (34.Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 35.Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that first peak of junB and junD mRNA accumulation occurred at 1 h just following the first peak of c-jun mRNA elevation. junB and junD mRNA contents again increased at 3 and 12 h in a similar fashion as c-jun mRNA did. The amount of c-fos mRNA increased at 30 min only once and thereafter kept the low expression level until 48 h. The amount of GAPDH mRNA did not change significantly during the time course studied, which indicates that almost equal amounts of undegraded RNA were loaded. The mechanisms of these oscillations of the Jun family mRNAs are interesting but remain to be elucidated. To see whether lead-induced GST-P mRNA accumulation was regulated at the transcriptional level, we administered actinomycin D to stop mRNA synthesis (21.Shapiro S.G. Squibb K.S. Markowitz L.A. Cousins R.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) before lead injection. The GST-P mRNA of rat liver increased 2.5-fold 12 h after lead nitrate treatment (Fig. 3, lane 1 versus lane 2), whereas actinomycin D completely blocked the increase (lane 3). In the kidney, GST-P mRNA increased 1.8-fold by lead nitrate (lane 4 versus lane 5), which was also blocked completely by actinomycin D (lane 6). The filter was dehybridized and rehybridized with GAPDH cDNA to confirm that RNA was not degraded by actinomycin D treatment and almost equal amount of RNA was loaded on the filter. These experiments have suggested that lead stimulates GST-P production at the transcriptional level. To define preliminarily the lead-responsive cis-element of the 5′-flanking region of GST-P gene, we utilized a series of ECAT deletion mutants (Fig. 4A). We first tested the effect of lead nitrate on ECAT gene transfected into the primary culture of rat liver cells. Various concentrations of lead nitrate were tested to primary culture of liver cells without any effect (data not shown), suggesting that the ECAT transgene was suppressed in these cells as the endogenous GST-P gene was in vivo. We then tested the effect of lead nitrate on the ECAT gene transfected into the dRLh 84 rat hepatoma cells. The basal expression of the ECAT gene was rather high in these cells, but no stimulation was observed with lead nitrate (data not shown). Hep G2 human hepatoma cell line gave similar negative results (data not shown). Thus, we found it difficult to study the in vitro effect of lead on ECAT gene using cultured hepatocytes. Because the expression of the GST-P mRNA was higher in the kidney than in the liver (see Fig. 3), we next examined the effect of lead on the ECAT gene transfected into NRK fibroblast cells (Fig. 4B). The results were shown by the mean values of three independent experiments. Basal ECAT activity was low, but lead could enhance the activity of the ECAT gene 2.7-fold of the control in these cells. Lead nitrate could not activate 1CAT, 2CAT, 3CAT, 4CAT, nor 5CAT deletion mutant genes, from which the GPEI had been deleted. Lead nitrate slightly, but reproducibly, reduced the activity of pSV2CAT transfected into NRK fibroblast cells (0.9-fold), and this might be due to the general toxicity of lead nitrate to the cells. The above results show that the lead-responsive cis-element of the GST-P gene is located between −2.9 and −2.2 kb upstream from the transcription start site of GST-P gene. In this restricted region, there is a strong enhancer GPEI that we have reported previously (14.Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3858-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To investigate whether GST-P induction by lead is regulated at the transcriptional level and whether the lead-responsive cis-element of the GST-P gene is also mapped in the region −2.9 and −2.2 kb in vivo, we tested the effect of lead acetate on the CAT expression in the transgenic rats having ECAT and 1CAT DNA (Fig. 5). We used three lines each of ECAT and 1CAT transgenic rats. Thirteen, 30, 25, 33, 11, and 26 copies of the transgene were integrated in tandem arrays into the chromosomes of lines 1, 4, and 5 of ECAT and lines 3, 4, and 7 of 1CAT rats, respectively(36.Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Nomura K. Hochi S. Hirabayashi M. Ueda M. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 55: 2651-2655Google Scholar). CAT expression was enhanced by lead in the livers and kidneys of all lines of ECAT rats, although the enhancement was rather low in the liver of ECAT line 1 trans-genic rat. The observation that CAT expression was enhanced by lead only in the liver or kidney of the ECAT rats, but not in the 1CAT rats, clearly indicates that the cis-element of GST-P gene present in ECAT, but missing in 1CAT, is responsible for the activation of GST-P gene by lead. The results were confirmed by more than two experiments. We have also shown that lead salt induces the acute accumulation of CAT mRNA in the liver of ECAT transgenic rat. 2T. Suzuki, M. K. Nagai, M. Imagawa, E. Farber, and M. Muramatsu, submitted for publication. The results clearly show that GST-P induction by lead is regulated at the transcriptional level. Because CAT mRNA is relatively unstable in animal cells(37.Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), the increase of CAT mRNA by lead should reflect the in vivo enhancement of transcription of the GST-P gene by lead. The result is compatible with the run-on analysis by others (8.Koo P. Nagai M.K. Farber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14601-14606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To pinpoint, in vivo, the enhancer region that is essential for GST-P gene expression by lead, we used two more types of transgenic rats. Fig. 6A illustrates the constructs. The construct Δ-56CAT has the minimum GST-P promoter connected to CAT coding region. The construct Δ-56CAT GPEI has the genomic 122-bp GPEI (Fig. 6B) subcloned into the Δ-56CAT. We intentionally placed the GPEI element at the 3′ end of CAT coding sequence, i.e. 2.0 kb downstream from the transcription initiation site, because we previously noted with transfected primary hepatocytes that the GPEI enhancer had a constitutive enhancing activity when it was located adjacent to the promoter(38.Morimura S. Okuda A. Sakai M. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 685-691PubMed Google Scholar). We were afraid that CAT might be constitutively expressed in the liver of transgenic rat, if the GPEI is located too close to the promoter. We used each one line of Δ-56CAT and Δ-56CAT GPEI rat. Southern blot showed that 5 and 21 copies of the transgene were integrated in tandem arrays into the chromosome of Δ-56CAT and Δ-56CAT GPEI rats, respectively(36.Suzuki T. Imagawa M. Nomura K. Hochi S. Hirabayashi M. Ueda M. Kitagawa T. Muramatsu M. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 55: 2651-2655Google Scholar). CAT activity did not change significantly by lead in the liver of these transgenic rats (data not shown). However, CAT activity of the kidney samples from Δ-56CAT GPEI rats was en"

Subunit packing within a filament is a consequence of interactions among these domains. Several such interactions are known, but probably many more contribute to stabilizing filament structure. We examined a number of such potential interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system. Domains or subdomains of murine vimentin, a Type III intermediate filament protein, were fused with either the DNA-binding or trans-activating domain of GAL4, a transcription factor. Interaction between the vimentin domains/subdomains functionally reconstituted GAL4, thereby activating transcription of a GAL1-LacZ reporter gene. The oligomeric state at which the interactions took place, i.e. whether the domains/subdomains were dimeric or tetrameric as they interacted, was also determined. These studies revealed a number of interesting interactions, among which was a strong homotypic binding of helix 2B to form tetramers. They also demonstrated a lack of interaction among others expected to do so based on current structural models. From these results we deduced which of the candidates for interactions, suggested by current models, were true protein-protein interactions and which represented nearest-neighbors only.

A family of about 40 related proteins make up the intermediate filaments (IFs), 1The abbreviations used are: IFintermediate filament: MUG, 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-galactopyranosideDBDNA binding domainTAtranscription activating domain. a major class of cytoskeletal elements in most eukaryotic cells. There are several types of IF proteins, based on protein and gene structure: Types I and II are the keratins, which form IFs in epithelial cells; vimentin and desmin are Type III IF proteins, as are peripherin and glial fibrillar acidic protein, two proteins found in the nervous system. Vimentin is expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, and desmin is muscle-specific. The neurofilament triplet proteins, NF-L, NF-M, NF-H, and α-internexin, are found only in neurons and are Type IV proteins. Type V IF proteins are the nuclear lamins and Type VI consists of a single protein, nestin. Several new IF proteins of limited tissue distribution, filensin, phakinin, and tanabin, also have been identified recently (reviewed by Fuchs and Weber(1994) and Klymkowsky (1995)). The unifying structural principle of this family of proteins is the presence of a tripartite motif, a central, ∼310-residue long, α-helical rod domain and flanking non-α-helical head and tail domains. intermediate filament: MUG, 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-galactopyranoside DNA binding domain transcription activating domain. The assembly of 10-nm wide filaments from these highly asymmetric molecules is a complex process. Because the protein molecules are extended, and are packed in a roughly parallel (or anti-parallel) but staggered fashion within the filament, a large number of potential interactions between adjacent molecules is possible. Only a few of these interactions have been identified or characterized. Another complicating factor is that, although several intermediate assembly steps, e.g. the formation of dimers and tetramers, have been identified experimentally (reviewed by Parry and Steinert(1992) and Stewart(1993)), recent detailed structural studies (Steinert, 1991b) suggest that a continuum of oligomers exists beyond the dimer stage. This effectively increases the number of possible protein-protein interactions that may occur within an assembled IF. The most well known interaction during IF assembly is the lateral association of the α-helical rod domains via hydrophobic interactions to form dimeric coiled-coils. This association is thought to lead to formation of the filament backbone, and is made possible by the interaction of hydrophobic amino acids located at the first and fourth positions of a 7-residue repeat present in the primary sequence of the rod domain. Additionally, the rod domain contributes to filament structure on a higher level of organization. The external surface of the dimeric coiled-coil exhibits alternate zones of positive and negative charges (Parry et al., 1977; McLachlan and Stewart, 1982), much like those found in other α-helical proteins such as the myosin rod (Atkinson and Stewart, 1992) and tropomyosin (Hitchcock-DeGregori and Varnell, 1990). Recent experimental evidence, obtained by a deletion mutagenesis approach, strongly suggests that electrostatic interactions involving these charged zones are a major driving force for the formation of tetramers and/or higher order structures (Meng et al., 1994). Additionally, less well recognized interactions involving the head and tail domains also contribute to IF assembly (Birkenberger and Ip, 1990; Eckelt et al., 1992; Herrmann et al., 1992; Makarova et al., 1994; Rogers et al., 1995). It is generally agreed that the head domain of IF proteins is essential for filament assembly, and it has been demonstrated in numerous studies that experimental removal of this domain results in assembly incompetence. Involvement of the tail domain is a matter of some controversy. While it seems clear that removal of the tail does not appreciably hinder in vitro assembly of certain IF proteins, in other cases it has been reported to result in structural aberrations in vitro, in abortive assembly in cells (Kaufmann et al., 1985; Quinlan et al., 1989; Makarova et al., 1994; Bader et al., 1991), or in unusual localization of the IF protein to the nucleus (Rogers et al., 1995). The higher the level of filament organization, the less is known about how oligomeric subunits are arranged within the filament, and what forces drive their formation. For example, although there is strong evidence indicating that two α-helices form a coiled-coil dimer by interactions between hydrophobic residues, what causes the monomers to be aligned in-register and in parallel is not known. Also not yet identified are the forces (and sequences) that drive the formation of tetramers, and filament elongation. At which level of organization does a subunit stagger occur to generate the characteristic 22-nm repeat seen in all IFs? How are IF assembly and disassembly regulated in vivo? While it is widely believed that these interactions are functions of individual IF protein domains, testing of this hypothesis has been primarily carried out by a limited number of approaches, in vitro mutagenesis to look for loss of function in transfected cells or transgenic animals, or in vitro approaches such as reassembly and chemical cross-linking studies. Given that significant differences have been observed between the assembly behavior of some IF proteins in vivo and in vitro (Raats et al., 1991; Eckelt et al., 1992; McCormick et al., 1993), it seems desirable that these interactions be studied in an alternative context. In this paper, we describe our recent efforts in identifying such interactions that are involved in the assembly and maintenance of IF structure, using the two-hybrid system (Fields and Song, 1989). Our results have allowed us to examine more closely certain interactions that have been suggested to occur by current structural models. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PCY2 (MATαΔgal4 Δgal80 URA3::GAL1-LacZ lys2-801amber his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63 leu2ade2-101ochre) (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) was used for all assays. Yeast cultures were grown at 30°C in either YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.004% adenine sulfate, and 2% glucose) or glucose minimal medium (MinGlu; Yocum et al.(1984)) except when they were used for the β-galactosidase assay. In the latter case, yeast was cultured in galactose minimal medium (MinGal, in which the glucose was replaced by 2% (w/v) galactose (Yocum et al., 1984) and 2% (v/v) glycerol and 2% (v/v) ethanol were used as carbon sources. Transformation of yeast was performed according to the procedure of Hill et al.(1991) except that a 50-μl aliquot of competent yeast cells was transformed with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA without carrier DNA. For β-galactosidase assays, yeast colonies were picked and dispersed into 2 ml of MinGlu medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and grown at 30°C with shaking for 48-72 h. The cells were then pelleted by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of MinGal medium to induce expression of protein under the control of the GAL1 promoter. β-Galactosidase activity was measured fluorometrically, using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-galactopyranoside (4-MUG, Fluka) as substrate. Yeast culture samples (100 μl) from MinGal medium were pipetted into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and pelleted in a microcentrifuge at top speed. The supernatants were discarded. The yeast pellets were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for 2 min and thawed at room temperature. 350 μl of reaction buffer (0.01 M phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3) and 50 μl of MUG solution (0.001 M MUG in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM MgCl2) were then added to the yeast cells, mixed well, and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of 400 μl of stop solution (0.1 M glycine, pH 10.3). The amount of 4-MU released from 4-MUG was determined using a Gilford Fluoro IV spectrofluorometer (Gilford, Oberlin, OH), with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm. Results reported were obtained from at least three independent determinations; variations were less than 20%. For rapid mass screening for β-galactosidase positive yeast colonies, plates were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose membrane, which were then stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside (X-gal) (Breeden et al., 1985). On occasion, β-galactosidase activity in crude yeast extracts was determined colorimetrically by using O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate, as described by Ausubel et al.(1990). Yeast shuttle vector plasmids containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pPC62) and the GAL4 transactivation domain (pPC86) (Chevray and Nathans, 1992) were gifts from Drs. P. Chevray and D. Nathans (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The plasmid pMA431, containing the full-length GAL4 cDNA, which we used as a positive control, was a gift from Dr. Jun Ma (Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH). The full-length murine vimentin cDNA (BS-Vim, in pBluescript) was a gift from Dr. Robert Evans (University of Colorado Medical School, Denver, CO) and the human keratin 8 and keratin 18 cDNA were gifts from Dr. Bishr Omary (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). All plasmid constructions (Fig. 1 and Table 1) were performed in Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and bacteria were grown in LB medium. The wild type full-length vimentin cDNA was inserted between the unique SalI and NotI cloning sites of both yeast fusion vectors, pPC62 and pPC86. A sense oligonucleotide, V-P-5 (5′-GCCATGTCGACCAGGT-3′) and the T7 promoter primer (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) in the antisense orientation, were used to amplify the vimentin cDNA and, at the same time, create a unique SalI site at the 5′ terminus. After restriction with SalI and NotI and ligation, the plasmids, p62-wtVim and p86-wtVim, were obtained.TABLE 1 Open table in a new tab A SalI/PstI fragment encoding the vimentin head domain (amino acids 1-106) was introduced into pPC62 to yield p62-VimH. From this resulting plasmid, a SalI/NotI fragment was excised and subcloned into pPC86 to yield p86-VimH. All other truncations of vimentin were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based cloning strategies. For construction of p62-Vim1B, primers V-P-6 (5′-GATAAGTCGACGTACGAGGAGGAGATGCGG-3′) and V-P-7 (5′-GCGCAACTAGTGGCAGCTCCTGGATCTCTTC-3′) were used to amplify the appropriate fragment from BS-Vim. Similarly, a 735-base pair fragment for VimH1B was obtained by amplification using primers V-P-5 and V-P-7. Vim2B, a 363-base pair fragment, was amplified from BS-Vim using a sense primer V-P-8 (5′-GCTTCGTCGACGTACAAGTCCAAGTTTGCT-3′) and an antisense primer, V-P-12 (5′-GCGGA CTAGTAAATCCTGCTCTCCTC-3′). The resulting fragment was subcloned between the SalI and SpeI sites of pPC62 and pPC86 to yield p62-Vim2B and p86-Vim2B, respectively. Finally, VimT, a 165-base pair fragment that encodes the vimentin tail domain, was similarly constructed, using primer V-P-9 (5′-GCTTCGTCGACGTCTCTGCCTCTGCCAACC-3′) (which added a SalI site at the 5′ terminus) and the T7 polylinker primer. After restriction with SalI/NotI and ligation into pPC62 and pPC86, p62-VimT and p86-VimT were obtained. The keratin K8 encoding plasmids, p62-K8 and p86-K8, were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using PUC-K8 as template. The 5′ primer, K8-P-10 (5′-GATAAGTCGACGATGTCCATCAGGGTGACC-3′) was used to insert sequence encoding a SalI restriction site 5′ to the K8 start site. The 3′ primer, the M13(−20) reverse primer (Promega, Madison, WI), adds two restriction sites, XbaI and EcoRI, from the PUC18 vector polylinker, to the 3′ end of the keratin cDNA. The SalI/XbaI fragment was then subcloned into pPC62 to obtain p62-K8, and the SalI/EcoRI fragment from the same polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pPC86 to obtain p62-K8. Similarly, using BS-K18 as template, primer K18-P-11 (5′-GATAAGTCGACGATGAGCTTCACCACTCGC-3′) and the T3 promoter primer (Life Technologies, Inc.), a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing a 5′ unique SalI site, the K-18 coding region, and a 3′ XbaI site was obtained. The SalI/XbaI fragment was introduced into pPC62 to yield p62-K18. From this, a SalI/NotI fragment was subcloned into pPC86 to yield p86-K18. Protein extracts of S. cerevisiae for immunoblotting were prepared essentially as described by Bram and Kornberg(1985) with the following modifications. Culture cells (50 ml) were chilled on ice for 10 min, pelleted at 4°C by centrifugation at 3000 rpm, washed once with cold water, and resuspended in 1 ml of cold buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μM pepstatin A, and 0.6 μM leupeptin). 0.5 ml of cell suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, placed into liquid nitrogen for 3 min, and allowed to thaw for 20 min on ice. Following addition of a three-fourth volume of 0.45-mm acid-washed glass beads, the cells were lysed with eight 30-s pulses of a vortex mixer interspersed with equal periods of cooling on ice. The cell lysate was separated from the glass beads, the beads rinsed with 0.2 ml of buffer A, and the recovered volumes combined. The cell lysate was then mixed with one-third volume of 3 × Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer, placed in a boiling water bath for 2 min, clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant saved for electrophoresis and Western blot analyses. Protein content in cell lysates was determined by the method of Bradford(1976). Immunodetection on Western blots was performed essentially according to the method of Towbin et al.(1979). A rabbit antiserum, Vim11091, raised against full-length murine vimentin expressed in E. coli, was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated affinity-purified, goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was used as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000. The two-hybrid system exploits the fact that the yeast transcription activator, GAL4, consists of two separate and essential domains, the DNA binding (DB) domain and the transcription activating (TA) domain, that must be in proximity to one another to function (Ma and Ptashne, 1987). It was designed originally as a method for screening expression libraries based on interaction between a protein and its ligands (Fields and Song, 1989). In this mode of use, the cDNA of the protein of interest is subcloned into a vector such that it is expressed as a fusion protein with either the DB or TA domain, while the library to be screened is subcloned into a second vector such that it is expressed as fusion proteins with the other GAL4 domain. Upon co-transformation of yeast with both plasmids, interaction between the fusion protein of interest with fusion proteins represented in the library then leads to its screening and subsequent identification of binding partners (for example, see Chevray and Nathans(1992)). In our study, we simplified the two hybrid system for examining interactions between given pairs of IF protein domains, by substituting the expression library with a second IF protein domain. Interaction between the IF protein domains would then reconstitute activity of the GAL4 protein and transcription of a GAL1-lacZ reporter gene would ensue. We used two vectors, pPC62 (the DB vector) and PPC86 (the TA vector) (Chevray and Nathans, 1992). Complementary DNAs encoding full-length IF proteins or individual domains were subcloned into these vectors, and the fusion plasmids were used pairwise to transform yeast strain PCY2, which carried a genomic copy of the GAL1 promoter driving expression of lacZ. Initially, interactions were detected qualitatively by staining nitrocellulose replicas of yeast plates with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside. Quantitation was carried out by expanding positive yeast colonies and assaying for β-galactosidase activity in cell homogenates derived from such colonies, using the fluorescent substrate, 4-MUG. In transformations involving pairs of IF protein domains, the experiments were always repeated by interchanging inserts and vectors, to control for potential steric effects that could result from differences in spatial juxtaposition of the IF protein domain relative to the GAL4 domain when they were expressed as a fusion protein. In most cases, swapping of vectors and inserts in this manner resulted in differences in β-galactosidase activity of only 10-20%, but more importantly, it did not alter the strength of the interaction relative to others that were studied. A series of quantitative controls were undertaken, using MUG fluorescence measurements, to ensure that positive β-galactosidase activity truly reflected interactions between IF domains (Table 1). These included co-transformation with one or both vectors lacking insert, and transformation with only one vector. Without exception, such transformations resulted in extremely low levels of β-galactosidase activity, the highest of which amounted to 0.13% of that reached by co-transformation with both vectors encoding full-length vimentin (see below). In contrast to control transformations, when the full-length vimentin-DB and vimentin-TA fusion proteins were expressed in PCY2 cells, they interacted robustly, resulting in β-galactosidase activity that was readily detected either qualitatively, by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside staining of nitrocellulose replicas (not shown), or quantitatively, by MUG fluorescence (Table 3, row 1). In fact, the interaction was so strong that, in the latter assay, the reconstituted β-galactosidase activity was 46% of that obtained by transformation with a full-length GAL4 cDNA (data not shown). To ascertain that the transformed yeast cells were indeed expressing vimentin as fusion proteins with either the GAL4 TA or DB domain, a cell extract was made from a positive yeast clone and subjected to immunoblotting, using a polyclonal antiserum directed against recombinant murine vimentin. A prominent but diffused immunoreactive band of molecular mass ∼75-80 kDa was detected in the blot (Fig. 2), consistent with the sizes expected for the TA- and DB-vimentin fusion proteins. An additional measure of confidence that the IF protein interactions detected by using the two-hybrid were specific was provided by transformation experiments using keratins K8 and K18 (Table 2). Keratin IFs are obligate heteropolymers, i.e. they must contain one Type 1 and one Type 2 keratin. Thus, one would expect interaction to occur only when yeast cells were co-transformed with plasmids encoding one Type 1 and one Type 2 keratins, but not in a co-transformation with both plasmids encoding either Type 1 or Type 2 keratins. This was indeed the case. Strong interaction was detected when co-transformation was carried out with one plasmid encoding K8, a Type 2 keratin, and the other encoding K18, a Type 1 keratin (Table 2, rows 1 and 2), but when both plasmids encoded either K8 or K18 (Table 2, rows 3 and 4), β-galactosidase activities fell to about 3% of the K8/K18 co-transformation. When one keratin was omitted from the transformation (Table 2, rows 5 and 6), β-galactosidase activity fell to baseline levels. Interestingly, K18, but not K8, interacted quite strongly with full-length vimentin (Table 2, rows 7-10). A similar interaction between an acidic keratin, K14, and vimentin has also been reported (Steinert et al., 1993c). However, as suggested by these investigators, this interaction probably does not proceed beyond the dimer stage and is likely to be non-productive for filament formation.TABLE 2 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3 Open table in a new tab As IF assembly takes place in a number of hierarchical steps, it is important to know the oligomeric state(s) of the IF proteins when they interact in yeast cells in the context of the two-hybrid system. To examine this question, positive yeast clones from co-transformation with plasmids encoding either helix 1B or helix 2B of vimentin were expanded. Cell homogenates were then derived from the clones, cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, and subjected to immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-vimentin antibody to look for the presence of oligomers of vimentin. These domains were used instead of full-length vimentin because they were smaller and the Mr of their cross-linked dimers and tetramers could be more precisely determined in standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots. Results from a sample taken from a co-transformation with both plasmids encoding helix 1B is shown in Fig. 3, lane 2. Two immunoreactive bands, with molecular mass of ∼55 and 100 kDa are found. The former has a size appropriate for a DB-Vim1B/TA-Vim1B dimer, while the latter has a size appropriate for a tetramer. A similar sample, from a co-transformation with helix 2B-encoding vectors, is shown in lane 3 of Fig. 3. Again, immunoreactive bands of sizes compatible with DB-Vim2B/TA-Vim2B dimers and tetramers are evident. Thus, we conclude that the β-galactosidase activity we detected in our transformations was indicative of interactions between IF proteins at the level of both the dimer and the tetramer. We do not have direct information as to whether our GAL4 domain-IF fusion proteins further assemble into 10-nm filaments in PCY2 cells; however, because the fusion proteins contain sizable amounts of TA or DB domains (110 and 144 residues, respectively), which are probably sufficiently large to interfere sterically with subunit packing during filament assembly, it is unlikely that filaments as such are formed. The two-hybrid system offers an opportunity to examine, in an in vivo setting, whether two given IF protein domains interact. In turn, this should allow one to map the interactions that take place along the IF protein molecules as they coalesce to form oligomers and, ultimately, filaments and filamentous networks. Interactions between domains of the vimentin molecule were examined by co-transforming individual pairs of plasmids encoding the relevant domains (Fig. 1). Transformations and the resulting β-galactosidase activity are presented in Table 3. The strongest interaction was detected between subdomains of the rod. For example, homotypic interaction between helix 1B segments, between the amino half of the vimentin molecule (H1B) and also between helix 2B segments, resulted in β-galactosidase activities 18, 44, and 52%, respectively, of that attained by transformation using full-length vimentin molecules. Of interest is that amino halves of vimentin interacted significantly more strongly than helix 1B segments alone (44% versus 18%), even though head domains themselves did not interact to any significant extent (see below). Several co-transformations that resulted in low levels of β-galactosidase activity are also noteworthy. Among these are ones to screen for interaction between helices 1 and 2B, predicted to overlap in several models of IF structure (Stewart et al., 1989; Geisler et al., 1992; Heins et al., 1993; Steinert et al., 1993a). When co-expressed in PCY2 yeast cells, neither helix 1B alone, nor domain H1B, encompassing the entire amino half of the vimentin polypeptide, interacted significantly with helix 2B, which contained the most highly conserved COOH-terminal end of the rod domain (Table 3, rows 5-8). The level of β-galatosidase activity attained in these transformations was less than 1% of that produced by homotypic interaction between full-length vimentin polypeptides. Also of considerable interest is the apparent lack of interaction between vimentin head domains, between tail domains, and between head and tail domains (Table 3, rows 9-18). Interaction among these pairs of domains resulted in 2% or less of the activity attained by interaction between full-length vimentin polypeptides. The GAL4 two-hybrid system appears to be a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions involved in the formation of intermediate filaments. As evident from an extensive battery of controls, the methodology behaves consistently and predictably for IF proteins. Results of transformations using keratin-encoding vectors (Table 2) demonstrate that the detected interactions were specific in the context of the assembly properties of IF proteins, and argue against the possibility that they arose from nonspecific association between α-helical polypeptides. By combining immunoblotting analyses with two-hybrid cloning strategies, one can identify the oligomeric state of IF proteins as they interact in yeast cells. This is an important point, because many classes of interactions are already recognized from previous protein chemical studies, and their identification by two-hybrid cloning would add little to our knowledge of IF structure. An example of such interactions is a homotypic interaction that forms a dimer, which is clearly indicated by the fact that IF dimers are aligned in a parallel and in-register orientation (Parry et al., 1985). In contrast, a novel homotypic interaction that forms tetramers would be interesting because it may provide new information concerning the alignment of dimers within the tetramer, an issue as yet not fully understood. It is also worth noting that this approach complements other methods of structural analysis in specific ways. While sequencing of cross-linked protein fragments provides information concerning nearest neighbors within a filament, whether or not such neighbors in fact interact to effect filament assembly cannot be determined by this approach. In contrast, a two-hybrid screen gives a positive readout only if the two protein domains under study actually interact. Likewise, two-hybrid analyses complement DNA transfection studies because of its ability to specify the oligomeric state of the IF proteins when the interaction takes place, whereas in transfection studies it is only possible to look for the end point of the interaction, i.e. whether the proteins, modified or not, can assemble into a filamentous network in cells. A common feature among the major structural models of IF (Steinert, 1991a; Geisler et al., 1992; Steinert et al., 1993a, 1993b; Heins et al., 1993) is that there are specific domain overlaps within the filament (Fig. 4). For example, the studies of Geisler et al.(1992) identified three lysine cross-linked regions between two desmin dimeric coiled-coils. The locations of two of these regions, EGS1 and EGS2, are compatible with a model of molecular alignment in which the two dimers in a tetramer are paired in an anti-parallel, staggered fashion such that the inner overlapping part of the tetramer is formed by helices 1A, 1B, and 2A (G11 in Fig. 4). This model is consistent with earlier observations, derived from proteolysis studies, that helix 1B could be isolated as a tetramer (Gruen and Woods, 1981; Woods and Inglis, 1984). In an extensive series of chemical cross-linking studies on keratin pairs (Steinert et al., 1993a, 1993b) and vimentin (Steinert et al., 1993c), Steinert and co-workers identified a number of lysine-lysine and cysteine-cysteine cross-links, which led them to describe four types of domain alignment termed A11, A22, A12, and ACN (Fig. 4). The first three of these describe overlap of the rod domains to varying degrees, whereas the fourth, ACN, describes an approximately 10-residue long head-to-tail overlap of helix 2B of one dimer with helix 1A of a second dimer. Interestingly, comparison of the length of the rod (46 nm, Steinert et al. (1993a)) versus the well known 21-nm repeat seen in electron micrographs of metal shadowed IF (Milam and Erickson, 1982; Aebi et al., 1983) also led Heins et al.(1993) to propose an end-to-end overlap of the rod domain of similar dimension. An important question arises when considering these structural data: which of the domain overlaps represent actual protein-protein interactions that bring the molecules together to form the filament, and which of them represent nearest neighbors that were identified as a result of the proximity of cross-linkable lysine and/or cysteine residues within their sequences? Because we were able to determine whether or not given pairs of IF protein domains interact in a cytoplasmic context, it is possible to examine this question in some detail. Transformation with both vectors encoding helix 1B-GAL4 fusion proteins produced high levels of β-galactosidase activity (Table 3, rows 2 and 3), indicating that helices 1B bind strongly to one another. Accompanying Western blotting experiments showed that helices 1B form tetramers, consistent with the aforementioned observation that helix 1 tetramers could be isolated from proteolyzed wool keratin (Gruen and Woods, 1981; Woods and Inglis, 1984). Thus, we conclude that helix 1B is a site along the molecule at which active interaction occurs to stabilize the structure of an IF. Interestingly, the amino-terminal halves of vimentin, encoded by the VimH1B construct, interacted considerably more strongly than helices 1B alone. As the head domain did not interact with either another head domain or the rod (Table 3, rows 9-12), the strength of the homotypic interaction between the amino-terminal halves of vimentin likely stems from the presence of helix 1A, which might have enhanced molecular alignment. An additional transformation using a helix 1 (1A plus 1B) construct should provide a definitive answer. In light of the fact that a tetramer composed of helix 2 has not been isolated, the finding that helices 2B interacted strongly and produced tetrameric complexes in the two-hybrid system was somewhat surprising. Nonetheless, this interaction is consistent with the A22 alignment of Steinert et al. (1993a, 1993b), and is a logical consequence of the A11 interaction discussed above. This is because the alignment of helices 1B between two rows of dimers as specified by the A11 interaction would necessarily place their helices 2B in close proximity also (see Fig. 4). The larger size of helix 2, and the presence of more proteolytic cleavage sites, may account for the failure to detect intact tetramers composed of helix 2. The fact that both helix 1B and helix 2B exist as tetramers does not allow one to discriminate between the anti-parallel staggered alignment of dimers, favored by all three models of IF structure, and the parallel unstaggered alignment not favored by any. However, it does argue against active interaction between dimers arranged in an A12 alignment, because this would have resulted in dimers but not tetramers in an interaction screen. A second result that suggests a lack of true interactions between dimers in the A12 and ACN types of alignment is the low levels of β-galactosidase activity produced by transformations using the relevant constructs (Table 3, rows 7 and 8). VimH1B, which encompassed essentially the amino terminus half of the vimentin polypeptide and includes helix 1A, did not interact with Vim2B, which encompasses the rod's carboxyl terminus, as would have been predicted by the A12 as well as the ACN modes of alignment (Fig. 4). Although there is little doubt that these regions of adjacent vimentin molecules are situated very close to one another within the filament, as evidenced by the positional data provided by chemical cross-linking (Steinert et al., 1993c), it would seem that the cross-links represent juxtaposing, but not interacting, regions of the molecules. Finally, equally interesting was the observation that interactions involving the vimentin end domains were rather minimal (Table 3, rows 9-18). In the two-hybrid system, the end domains formed neither homodimers nor heterodimers, suggesting that they do not bind one another to contribute to filament structure in vivo. Thus, it may be inferred that growth in filament length and girth, and stabilization of filament structure, are functions of overlap of the rod alone. Also of some interest is that neither end domain binds to the full-length vimentin molecule avidly (Table 3, rows 9 and 14). Thus, the binding of tail sequences to other parts of the IF protein molecule as a mechanism of modulating filament assembly, suggested by several investigators including ourselves (Eckelt et al., 1992; Kouklis et al., 1991, 1993; McCormick et al., 1993; Makarova et al., 1994; Rogers et al., 1995), is likely to be a transient or weak interaction, or perhaps one that depends on post-translational modification not found in yeast.

Pierre Chevray and Daniel Nathans for the gift of the two-hybrid system, Dr. Jun Ma for pMA431, Dr. Robert Evans for the murine vimentin cDNA, and Dr. Bishr Omary for the K8 and K18 cDNA.

Each type of regulatory subunit contributes distinct qualities that broadens enzyme function and helps regulate the myriad of cellular responses controlled by this second messenger pathway.

All RIβlac constructs were derived from RIβlac 3.5(20.Rogers K.V. Boring L.F. McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Mol.

Deletions in the RIβ promoter sequence were generated using the restriction sites shown in Fig. 1. The numbering system is relative to the 5′-most transcription initiation site(20.Rogers K.V.

RIβlac-7500 was made by cloning a 6.4-kb fragment of genomic DNA into the XbaI site at position −1063 bp of RIβlac-1515. Neuro-2a (NB2a) cells (American Type Culture Collection) were derived from the murine C1300 neuroblastoma line(27.Klebe R.J. Ruddle F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 69Google Scholar). Cells (106 cells per 10-cm plate) were cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation using 10 μg of DNA/plate of pBSRIβlac or the promoterless lac z gene plac F(26.Peschon J.J.

As an internal control for transfection efficiency, we included 0.1 μg of RSVluc(28.de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). The DNA precipitate was added to cells for 20 min at room temperature. Cultures were then fed 10 ml of complete media and incubated overnight (∼16 h). The precipitate was removed, and the cells were treated with 10% Me2SO in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 min at 37°C, washed twice, and cultured in complete media for an additional 28-30 h. Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. β-Galactosidase (β-gal) activity was measured spectrophotometrically using O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as the substrate(20.Rogers K.V. Boring L.F. McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1756-1765PubMed Google Scholar). 20-50 μg of protein from each plate was assayed with 1.1 mMO-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside in buffer containing 100 mM NaHPO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 54 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were carried out in 1-ml plastic cuvettes at 37°C for 180 min. Absorbance was measured at 420 nm. Luciferase activity was determined using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) in buffer containing 1 mM luciferin, 100 mM KPO4, 40 μM ATP, and 15 mM MgSO4. Luciferase activities measured in 1 μg of transfected cell protein typically ranged from 800 to 1200 relative fluorescence unit/s. Transgene DNA was separated from plasmid sequences by restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis and injected (10 ng/μl) into the pronuclei of fertilized embryos of C57 Bl/6 × C3H F1 mice. After incubation overnight, two-cell embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant foster mothers. Transgenic animals were identified by dot hybridization using tail DNA and 32P-labeled lac z DNA as a probe. Gene copy number was measured by dot hybridization employing a standard curve equivalent to 0-300 copies per cells. Adult mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Brains were divided at the midline; one half was frozen on dry ice and subsequently used to quantitate enzyme activity, and the other half was fixed for histochemistry in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.02% glutaraldehyde at 4°C. Coronal brain sections (approximately 0.5 mm) were cut on a series 1000 Vibratome (Technical Products International), and incubated for 6 h at 37°C in buffer containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactoside (X-gal). Sections from transgenic lineages were scored for relative X-gal staining in ten separate regions of the brain, using a subjective scale from 0-5. The values for each region were averaged for all the lineages expressing a given transgene. Enzyme activity was measured in brain extracts as described previously(20.Rogers K.V. Boring L.F. McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1756-1765PubMed Google Scholar); 100-200 μg of protein was incubated in plastic cuvettes containing 1.1 mMO-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside in the buffer described above at 37°C for 120-180 min. Each sample was measured in triplicate. Average units of β-gal were calculated for each lineage after subtracting activities obtained from non-transgenic brain extracts followed by normalization to a β-galactosidase enzyme standard. Statistical comparisons were measured using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, which is applied for data sets that contain large internal variation(29.Rosner B. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. 3rd Ed. PWS-Kent Publishing, Boston1990: 304-308Google Scholar). This test examines the relative position of each data point rather than the specific value. For any two transgenes being compared, we ranked the reporter gene activities in descending order and then summed the assigned numbers for each set. The sum from one data set was compared to a distribution of values that are calculated for specific sample sizes(29.Rosner B. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. 3rd Ed. PWS-Kent Publishing, Boston1990: 304-308Google Scholar). Values that lie outside this distribution are considered different, and a p value is assigned for determining the stringency at which the null hypothesis is rejected. For these studies, p < 0.05 was used as a criterion for statistical significance. Previous results demonstrated that 3.5 kb of DNA encompassing the RIβ promoter was sufficient to direct lac z gene expression in the central nervous system of transgenic mice(20.Rogers K.V. Boring L.F. McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1756-1765PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 presents the sequence of this DNA and highlights the complex array of transcription factor binding sites used by various tissue-specific regulators, immediate-early genes, and mediators of hormone action. There are, for instance, 12 SP1 binding sites clustered within a 350-bp region surrounding the GC-rich proximal promoter. An additional six SP1 motifs are located within a 200-bp region in intron I. Most of these consensus sequences (14/18) are the “GT” box version, which has been reported to be the preferred binding sequence of a brain-specific member of the SP1 family(30.Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region also contains two EGR-1 (31.Cao X. Koski R.A. Gashler A.

Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). 12 out of 15 E-boxes are located upstream of the transcription initiation sites. This sequence, CANNTG, is recognized by the bHLH family of proteins(34.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin M. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H.

Dev. 1993; 42: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 23.Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8305-8307Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another family of proteins implicated in neural development recognizes the POU consensus sequence(35.Ruvkun G. Finney M. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); five out of six POU motifs are clustered in a 250-bp region of intron I. The most prevalent consensus sequence is recognized by the superfamily of SHRs. At least 40 half-sites comprised mostly of GGTCA, GGTGA, and AGGACA were identified. Employing gel mobility shift assays, we established that many of these consensus sequences bind proteins found in brain nuclear extracts as well as purified SP1, AP2, and MyoD/E47 dimers(21.Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Efforts to identify the functional domains of the RIβ promoter were initiated using standard transient transfection protocols and cell lines that expressed RIβ protein. It was determined that the RIβ promoter retained tissue-specific regulation in vitro since the RIβlac reporter plasmid was active in NB2a and HT-22 neuroblastoma cell lines but inactive in cells of non-neuronal origin such as Chinese hamster ovary and JEG cells (data not shown). To localize the regulatory sequences important for this expression pattern, we introduced a series of deletion constructs into N2Ba cells. It was discovered, however, that plasmid sequences in the expression vector influenced promoter activity. As indicated in Fig. 2A, cells transfected with 1.5 kb of 5′-upstream DNA (pBSRIβlac-1515) produced less β-gal activity than cells given a plasmid containing just 17 bp of 5′-upstream sequence (pBSRIβlac-17). This result might suggest that sequences between −1515 and −17 had an inhibitory effect on promoter function. Alternatively, this “induction” was caused by the juxtaposition of plasmid sequences closer to the RIβ proximal promoter. To distinguish between these possibilities, we repeated this transfection using plasmid-free RIβlac DNA and discovered that the relative strengths of these two constructs were reversed (Fig. 2B). Thus, when assayed in the absence of plasmid DNA, it appears that deleting the majority of 5′-upstream DNA has a negative effect on promoter activity in vitro. Because of the contradictory results obtained with transient transfection and because of the uncertain physiological relevance of testing neuroblastoma cells instead of neurons, we measured the activity of various RIβlac constructs in transgenic mouse brain. Fig. 3A illustrates the transgenes used in this experiment and indicates the number of lineages that expressed lac z. Animals were considered positive if β-gal staining was detected in sections of brain tissue. Note that almost all of the lines expressed the transgene even with as little as 17 bp of upstream sequence. As expected, no animals expressed transgenes containing deletions through the region of transcription initiation and exon I (RIβlac+243). Upon inspection of β-gal staining in brain slices, we noted that enzyme levels appeared to be quite variable within each group of transgenic mice. Fig. 4, for instance, shows the expression pattern of two lineages carrying RIβlac-7500. β-gal staining in line 349 was strong and broadly dispersed throughout all the major regions of the brain (Fig. 4, A and C), whereas expression in line 344 was completely absent or significantly reduced in many regions (Fig. 4, B and D). These patterns were heritable and observed in siblings of different gender and at different ages. Line 344 contained three times the number of integrated transgenes as line 349, so the reduced expression in 344 could not be attributed to gene copy number. In fact, no correlation between copy number and transgene expression was observed in 75 independent lineages. This suggests that the variability of lac z expression probably relates to the random nature of transgene integration and the domain effects caused by the flanking host chromatin(36.Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 465-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Variability of transgene expression in adult mouse brain. A and C, Lineage 349, transgenic for RIβlac-7500, expressed β-gal activity in most regions of the brain, including the neocortex (N), caudate-putamen (Cp), septum (S), hippocampus (H), thalamus (T), hypothalamus (Hy), and piriform cortex (P). B and D, lineage 344, also transgenic for RIβlac −7500, showed intense staining in the cortex but little to no enzyme activity in other anatomical regions. E, lineage 874, transgenic for RIβlac −17, expressed only in the neocortex (arrows show approximate lateral extent of labeled cells). F, lineage 867, also transgenic for RIβlac −17, showed scattered expression in the cingulate region of the neocortex, the dorsal hypothalamic nucleus, and the amygdala (A). Positive cells are also scattered throughout the hypothalamus and piriform cortex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantitate the expression of each transgenic lineage, we scored the relative level of lac z staining in specific regions of the brain (Fig. 4B), and as a second method we measured lac z activity in whole brain extracts (Fig. 4C). The results of these assays showed a similar trend; the construct with the most 5′-upstream DNA, RIβlac-7500, was equivalent to RIβlac −663 in activity. Removal of DNA down to position −333 reduced promoter activity, and deletion to −17 diminished transgene expression significantly. Although RIβlac −17 was rather weak, β-gal expression was always restricted to the central nervous system and undetectable in non-neuronal tissue. To calculate whether the differences observed between these deletion constructs were statistically significant, we employed the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test ((29.Rosner B. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. 3rd Ed. PWS-Kent Publishing, Boston1990: 304-308Google Scholar), see “Materials and Methods”), which is used for data sets with large variances. Using this test, it was determined that the differences between −663, −333, and −17 were statistically significant (p < 0.01). Two-way comparisons involving −7500, −1456, −1063, and −663 showed no statistical differences (p > 0.10). We conclude from this series of deletions that sequences positioned between intervals −663/-333 and −333/-17 contribute to high level expression of the RIb promoter. Moreover, the residual activity of RIβlac −17 (Figure 3:, Figure 4:) indicates that neural-specific expression is controlled by additional sequences downstream of −17. We suggest that these sequences encompass the RIβ proximal promoter and transcription initiation (see “Discussion”). Intron I of the RIβ gene also contains a variety of protein binding motifs (Fig. 1). To test the functional requirement for this DNA, we made transgenic mice with the constructs shown in Fig. 5. The largest deletion removed 1900 bp from the end of exon I to the beginning of the initiator MET of the lac z gene. 6 out of 10 founders demonstrated only very weak staining in brain sections (Fig. 5B). No expression was detected in whole brain extracts (Fig. 5C). Another deletion removed most of the intron but left intact the 5′- and 3′-splice sites (Δ+243/+1661). Again, the loss of activity was dramatic: 4 of 10 founders expressed only low levels of β-gal. Finally, a relatively minor deletion that removed 388 bp of intron sequence (Δ+243/+643) also had a marked effect when compared to the intact intron. These results demonstrate that intron I is required for meaningful RIβ expression in vivo, although its absence does not eliminate brain-specific expression. In contrast to many genes, the 3.5 kb of DNA that flank the RIβ promoter contain a rather complex arrangement of transcription factor binding sites that includes 18 SP1 sites, 15 bHLH E-boxes, 40 steroid hormone receptor half-sites, and multiple EGR-1, AP2, AP1, and POU sequence motifs (Fig. 1, (21.Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). The redundancy of these binding sites has presented an interesting challenge in identifying the sequences responsible for RIβ gene expression, and rather than systematically mutating specific classes of binding sites, we prepared a series of constructs in which varying amounts of DNA were removed from the 5′-upstream region and from intron 1. Although a test of these deletions was initiated in neuroblastoma cells by transient transfection, we turned to transgenic mice to ascertain which mutations would cause a meaningful effect on gene expression in a functional nervous system. Sequences primarily responsible for neuron-specific expression of the RIβ gene most likely reside within the proximal promoter between positions −17 and +243. This conclusion is based on the activities of RIβlac-17 and RIβlac ΔIV, both of which expressed β-gal in a brain-specific manner, and RIβlac+243, which failed to express in the absence of the proximal promoter. Consistent with this result was the observation that the −17/+243 promoter fragment stimulated lac z activity in NB2a neuroblastoma cells but did not function in non-neuronal cell types (data not shown). A likely regulatory element within the proximal promoter coincides with the start of transcription and includes an EGR-1 motif and three consecutive SP1 sites within a 21-bp interval (Fig. 1). Gel shift experiments confirmed that this region in RIβ binds pure SP1 and additional proteins in brain nuclear extract(21.Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similar sequences are present in a number of genes expressed in neural tissue(37.Sauerwald A. Hoesche C. Oshwald R. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Monsma F.J. Sibley D.R. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), including the promoter for the RIIβ subunit of PKA(39.Luo Z. Singh I.S. Fujihira T. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24738-24747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are required for expression of aldolase C in mouse brain(40.Thomas M. Makeh I. Briand P. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sequences such as these have also been shown to bind inhibitors of transcription(41.Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the proximal RIβ promoter could function in a tissue-specific manner, its activity was enhanced considerably by 5′-upstream sequences. RIβlac −663 provided maximum transgene expression, indicating that sequences between −663 and −17 function as positive regulators of the basal promoter. This region contains numerous transcription factor binding sites, possibly the most complex being a 37-bp direct repeat (located between −555 and −519) that contains two E-boxes, each of which are overlapped by two steroid hormone receptor half-sites, and a shared AP1 consensus sequence(21.Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Again, gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that this multiple repeat sequence readily formed a complex with brain nuclear extract containing bHLH-, SHR-, and AP1-related proteins. Nuclear proteins isolated from liver failed to bind these oligonucleotides(21.Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Sequences like these have been shown to function as enhancer elements in numerous genes (42.Schüle R. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Bolado J. Pike J.W. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 497-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 43.Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44.Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Evidence that the 37-bp repeat may be required for high level expression is suggested by the significant reduction in transgene activity obtained with RIβlac −333. This latter deletion construct, however, still enhanced basal promoter activity, suggesting that additional sequences, some of which are redundant with those in region −663/-333, are also involved in controlling promoter activity. Two additional regulatory regions may also have been uncovered further upstream: a positive element between −7500 and −1456 whose removal lowered promoter activity and an inhibitory sequence between −1063 and −666 whose deletion increased expression. Interestingly, this latter segment contains a duplicated E-box (Fig. 1; near position −736), which in the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor gene acts as a negative regulatory element(45.Neuman T. Metsis M. Persson H. Gruss P. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The significance of these deletions is hard to measure because of the large variability inherent to this experiment. However, if we use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and combine the activities from RIβlac −1456 and RIβlac −1063 into a single data set and compare this to RIβlac −663, then the differences between these become statistically significant (p < 0.05). We do not believe, however, that this inhibitory region contains the type of silencer elements observed in other neural-specific genes (46.Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) because their elimination did not stimulate proximal promoter activity in non-neuronal Chinese hamster ovary or JEG cell lines nor did it induce expression in the non-neuronal tissues of these transgenic mice. The final region shown to have regulatory activity was intron I, which contains many binding motifs including Sp1, AP1, bHLH, POU, CarG, and SHR sites (Fig. 1, (21.Clegg C.H. Koeiman N.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Neubauer M.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). We made two large deletions in intron I and saw a dramatic decrease in promoter activity. Interpretation of this effect is complicated by the observation that transgene expression is often dependent on 5′-intronic sequences(47.Palmiter R.D. Sandgren E.P. Avarbock M.R. Allen D.D. Brinster R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). While the loss of promoter activity may have resulted from a splicing requirement, we note that the RNA splice and donor sites were left intact in RIβlacΔ418, and even RIβlacΔ388, which removed one AP1, four SP1, and three SHR half-sites, had significantly lower promoter activity. It has recently been shown with transgenic mice that deletion of peripheral Sp1 sites causes de novo methylation and inactivation of the aprt gene(48.Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Since the RIβ promoter encompasses a GC island, a similar phenomenon may explain the loss of transgene expression following the removal of SP1 sites in RIβlacΔ388. Our experiments show some of the intricacies associated with analyzing promoter function. RIβlac expression in mice, for instance, was subject to large variations in expression due to position effects at the site of transgene integration. The mechanism responsible for this inhibition is unknown but may involve methylation(48.Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). As a result of the variability in expression, a large number of transgenic mouse lineages were produced, and utilizing the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test as a statistical tool, we were able to delineate major regulatory regions in the RIβ promoter. Using transgenic mice, however, to test the relative importance of the specific binding sites within each region may prove more difficult. The N2A neuroblastoma cell line was originally used for a deletion analysis because of the relative simplicity of transient transfections. The contradictory results obtained with these cells (Fig. 2) required that we first establish RIβ promoter regulation in vivo. Now that a similar expression pattern has been established between transgenics and the transfection of RIβlac genes (minus plasmid sequences) in vitro, it should be possible to use a cell culture system for detailed mapping of these regulatory regions. Endogenous RIβ mRNA is detected at varying levels in most regions of the brain and spinal cord(16.Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and RIβ transgene expression has been detected in peripheral nerves as well(20.Rogers K.V. Boring L.F. McKnight G.S. Clegg C.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1756-1765PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that expression of RIβ reflects a constitutive regulation common to many types of neurons and that this occurs at the level of its GC-rich proximal promoter. The large number of transcription factor binding sites flanking this region may serve to integrate information from numerous signal transduction pathways, allowing expression of RIβ mRNA to be finely regulated. The redundancy of these sequences may guarantee the continual expression of this gene. Given the major role PKA plays in the physiology of neurons, precise regulation of individual subunit gene expression may be necessary to provide appropriate cellular responses. -We are indebted to Nerville Koeiman and Teresa Wagner for expert technical assistance and to Dr. Bruce Bamber and Dr. Alan Wahl for helpful discussions."

Large unilamellar vesicles containing headgroup-labeled fluorescent phospholipid analogues in both leaflets of the membrane were treated with phospholipase D, converting all outer membrane phospholipids to phosphatidic acid and leading to the release of the fluorescent label from the outside leaflet. After fusion of virus with these liposomes, addition of the enzyme to the fusion product did not release fluorescent label again, indicating that the phospholipid analogues from the inner leaflet of the membranes had not appeared on the outer leaflet. Moreover, the integral membrane protein hemagglutinin, which is present on the outer leaflet of the viral membrane, was quantitatively digested with protease after fusion, indicating that hemagglutinin remained on the outer leaflet of the fusion product. Therefore, there is no merger of the inner with outer leaflets of the viral or the liposomal membrane during fusion, and transverse membrane asymmetry is maintained. We have investigated the influence of influenza-induced membrane fusion on the transverse asymmetry of the viral and target membranes.

Therefore, there is no merger of the inner with outer leaflets of the viral or the liposomal membrane during fusion, and transverse membrane asymmetry is maintained. The constituents of biological membranes, such as the plasma membranes of cells, are distributed in an asymmetric manner between the two leaflets of the membranes (Devaux, 1991, 1992). Although these membranes continuously undergo membrane fusion and fission, their asymmetry is maintained. Thus, it is likely that membrane asymmetry is maintained even during fusion. One of the most extensively studied membrane fusion mechanisms is that induced by the hemagglutinin (HA) ( 1The abbreviations used are: HAhemagglutininN-Rh-PEN-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamineN-NBD-PEN-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) glycoprotein of influenza virus. Fusion mediated by the protein is induced by low pH, leading to a conformational change in HA, which results in the insertion of the N-terminal “fusion peptide” of the HA2 subunit of the protein into the target membrane (Bentz, 1993). Although many details of the conformational change (reviewed by Hughson (1995)) and its role in fusion are now known, it is not clear how the protein achieves the merger of the viral with the target lipid bilayers. For fusion, a non-bilayer structure has to be formed, at least temporarily and locally at the site of fusion (Wilschut and Hoekstra, 1986). Little is known about these intermediate lipid structures or the role of HA in their formation. One attractive hypothesis proposes that the intermediates formed are stalks, semitoroidal (hourglass-shaped) structures composed of fused outer leaflets, but unfused inner leaflets of both membranes (Siegel, 1993a, 1993b). Stalk formation would be followed by a rupture of the inner membrane leaflets at the site of fusion, followed by their merger, which then completes bilayer fusion. There is little direct evidence for this hypothesis, but a mutant, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HA, expressed on a cell membrane, was found to fuse the outer membrane leaflets of these cells with those of red blood cells, while not inducing the merger of the inner membrane leaflets (hemifusion) (Kemble et al., 1994). These data suggested that fusion induced by the wild type HA could indeed proceed via the merger of the outer leaflets followed by that of the inner leaflets (Kemble et al., 1994; Stegmann, 1994). Therefore, in this as well as in most other proposed molecular mechanisms of membrane fusion (Ohki et al., 1987; Wilschut and Hoekstra, 1990; Bentz, 1993), there would be no merger between inner and outer leaflets, with the possible exception of a small fraction of the lipids at the site of fusion, and the transverse asymmetry of the membranes should be maintained after fusion. hemagglutinin N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Here, we have investigated whether membrane asymmetry is maintained after virus induced fusion, using asymmetric liposomes with fluorescent labels confined to the inner leaflet of the membrane. After their fusion with influenza virus, the fusion products were tested for the appearance of fluorescent probes in the outer leaflet of the fusion products. Also, the orientation of HA in the membrane of the fusion products was investigated after proteolytic treatment. It was found that neither HA nor the membrane lipids were reoriented after fusion. Phospholipase D from Streptomyces spec. AA586, with a specific activity of 180 units/mg from Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, was kindly donated to us by Dr. Peter Walde, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Zürich, Switzerland. Proteinase K from Tritirachium album was obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany), and lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Large unilamellar vesicles, containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (mixed acyl chains, form egg yolk) in a 2:1 ratio, and 0.6 mol% each of N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Rh-PE) and N-(7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine (N-NBD-PE) were made by extrusion through 0.1-μm defined-pore polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) (5er et al., 1986) as described before (Nebel et al., 1995) and stored under argon at 4°C. Phospholipid phosphate was determined according to Böttcher(1961). Influenza virus, strain X-31, was grown for us by the Schweizerische Serum- und Impfstoffinstitut (Bern, Switzerland) and purified and stored as described before (Nebel et al., 1995). Fusion of virus with liposomes was measured by the resonance energy transfer assay (Struck et al., 1981). Fluorescence was recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 530 nm, respectively, using a 515-nm long pass filter between cuvette and emission monochromator. For calibration of the fluorescence scale, the initial residual level of fluorescence was set to 0% and the fluorescence at infinite probe dilution to 100%. The latter value was obtained after lysis of the liposomes with Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) and correction for the effect of Triton on the quantum yield of N-NBD-PE (Struck et al., 1981). Liposomes (350 μM), labeled with N-NBD-PE and N-Rh-PE in both leaflets of the membrane, were made asymmetric by digesting the fluorescent probes and other phospholipids in the outer leaflets with phospholipase D (200 μg/ml) for 60 min at pH 7.5 and 37°C. Subsequently the liposomes were separated from the enzyme by gel filtration on a Sepharose 4B column. The phospholipid concentration of fractions was assayed as described above, and the presence of phospholipase checked by SDS-PAGE. For thin layer chromatography, lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (1959), run on silica-coated glass plates, and eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (65:35:5, v/v/v). Lipids and digestion products were visualized using specific stains as described elsewhere (New, 1990) and identified by comparison to known standards purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Large unilamellar vesicles (0.1 μm diameter), containing PC and PE (2:1 ratio) and the fluorescent phospholipid analogues N-NBD-PE and N-Rh-PE in both leaflets of the membrane were made by extrusion (5er et al., 1986). The incorporation of these probes allows the measurement of membrane fusion by the resonance energy transfer method (Struck et al., 1981). Upon mixing these liposomes with virus at low, but not at neutral pH, an increase in fluorescence was seen (Fig. 1), which is caused by membrane fusion (Stegmann et al., 1986). Liposomes of this size, made by extrusion, have their phospholipids symmetrically distributed over both leaflets of the membrane (Balch et al., 1994). To produce vesicles that would have the fluorescent probes confined to the inner leaflet only, the liposomes were treated with phospholipase D. This enzyme hydrolyzes the bond between the phosphates of phospholipids and their headgroups, converting phospholipids to phosphatidic acid. If the liposomes were treated with phospholipase at pH 7.5 and 37°C, while the fluorescence of N-NBD-PE was being monitored, a continuous decrease in fluorescence was observed, until a level corresponding to about half the original fluorescence was reached (Fig. 2). Further addition of phospholipase did not cause a further decrease in fluorescence. Although the NBD label is present on the headgroup of this fluorescent phospholipid, it is well known to loop back into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane due to its hydrophobicity (Chattopadhyay, 1990). Therefore, the fluorescence of the NBD headgroup, after its removal from the phospholipid, most likely decreased because of the considerably reduced quantum yield of NBD in the aqueous phase (Chattopadhyay, 1990; Fery-Forgues et al., 1993). Moreover, it is possible that the fluorophore aggregates in an aqueous environment, and in that situation self-quenching could further add to the decrease. To check the action of the phospholipase, a sample was taken after the fluorescence decrease had leveled off. The lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. It was found that 49 ± 12% of the total liposomal phospholipids were converted to phosphatidic acid. Further addition of phospholipase after the fluorescence decrease had leveled off (Fig. 2) did not lead to the production of more phosphatidic acid. Together, the above data indicate that phospholipase D digests the outer membrane phospholipids quantitatively, producing liposomes that have PC, PE and fluorescent probes confined to the inner leaflet and only phosphatidic acid in the outer leaflet. Thus, the enzyme does not cross the membrane, and fluorescence can be conveniently used to monitor its activity. To determine if these liposomes were capable of fusing with influenza virus, phospholipase D was first removed from the liposomes by chromatography on a Sephadex 4B column. The efficiency of resonance energy transfer between the N-NBD-PE and the N-Rh-PE of the asymmetric liposomes was found to be somewhat lower (5-10%) than between those of symmetric liposomes. This is most likely because, although asymmetric vesicles have the same concentration of fluorescent probes in the inner leaflet, they lack the resonance energy transfer that takes place between probes in the inner and outer leaflet of symmetric vesicles. If virus was added to the asymmetric liposomes, fusion occurred, as reported by decreased resonance energy transfer between the inner membrane leaflet probes (Fig. 1). Fusion with these liposomes was faster than with symmetric vesicles, most likely because their outer leaflet consisted of the negatively charged phosphatidic acid, and fusion with liposomes made of negatively charged phospholipids is faster than with zwitterionic liposomes (Stegmann et al., 1989). Since some negatively charged liposomes fuse with virus at neutral pH in a non-physiological fashion (Stegmann et al., 1986), fusion was also tested at neutral pH. No increase in fluorescence was seen at that pH (Fig. 1), indicating that fusion of the virus with these asymmetric liposomes is low-pH-dependent. Note that these liposomes, which are negatively charged on the outside and zwitterionic on the inside, are essentially “inside out” with respect to the physiological target membranes for influenza fusion. To analyze if the membrane asymmetry was changed after fusion, the appearance of fluorescent probes from the inner leaflet on the outer leaflet was tested by adding phospholipase to fusion products after their fusion with virus. No decrease in fluorescence was seen (Fig. 1). However, a decrease in fluorescence was detected if we used asymmetric liposomes that had been stored at 4°C for 4 days (not shown). During this time, transmembrane flip-flop of the lipids should have returned fluorophores to the outside of the vesicles (Devaux, 1991, 1992). In order to further test if we would have been able to determine fluorescent phospholipid analogues, should they have appeared on the outside of the liposomes, asymmetric liposomes were subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles to induce lipid “scrambling.” A decrease in fluorescence was seen upon addition of phospholipase to these liposomes (Fig. 2). Therefore, the above data indicate that target membrane phospholipid asymmetry is maintained after the fusion of influenza virus with liposomes. The integral membrane protein HA is present on the outer leaflet of the viral membrane. To test whether the asymmetric distribution of this protein was maintained after fusion, we exploited the fact that HA, which is resistant to a variety of proteases, becomes sensitive to proteinase K after the low-pH induced conformational change in the protein. Virus was incubated at pH 4.8 or 7.4 for 15 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of an excess of liposomes, followed by neutralization and digestion with proteinase K. Subsequently, the enzyme was removed from virus and fusion products by centrifugation as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the digestion products analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). After fusion or low pH treatment of virus, with or without fusion with liposomes, HA was quantitatively digested. The internal matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of the intact virus or the fusion product were not digested, unless the viral membrane was first lysed with Triton X-100. These data indicate that the protease does not cross the membrane. In samples of intact virus that were not treated at low pH, none of the proteins were digested. These data indicate that after fusion HA remains accessible to protease and therefore must be on the outside of the fusion products. The results presented in this paper indicate that membrane asymmetry is maintained after the low pH-induced fusion of influenza virus with large unilamellar vesicles. Experiments with asymmetric liposomes containing fluorescent label on the inside leaflet indicate that there is no merger of the liposomal inner leaflet with either of the outer membrane leaflets. The fusion experiments were done at a 1:1 ratio of virus to liposomes, and virus particles and liposomes have roughly the same size and therefore the same amount of membrane lipids. Earlier quantitative analyses of fusion in this system have shown that one virion fuses with slightly more than one liposome on average, and that there is no further fusion of virus with fusion products or fusion of virus with virus (Nir et al., 1986; Stegmann et al., 1989). Thus, in the fusion products approximately equal amounts of membrane material are contributed by the virus and the liposomes. Considering this degree of lipid mixing, and knowing that the liposomal lipids did not move from their inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the membrane of the fusion product, it is most likely that the viral lipids maintained their transverse asymmetry as well. Moreover, the viral integral membrane protein HA remained on the outer leaflet after fusion. The final level of fluorescence increase that was reached in the fusion experiments (Fig. 1) was about 10%, meaning that approximately 20% of the virus underwent one round of fusion with liposomes (Nir et al., 1986; see above). By loading different quantities of HA on gels, we found that after silver-stain, using a laser-driven gel scanner, we could still detect around 1% of the HA loaded on the gel shown in Fig. 3. Since no HA could be detected after fusion and protease digestion at all, 95-100% of the HA was still present on the outer leaflet of the fusion products. Membrane-impermeant small molecules such as trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid or dithionite are more commonly used to produce and probe membrane asymmetry than phospholipase D (McIntyre and Sleight, 1991; Gruber and Schindler, 1994). However, we found that the viral membrane is quite permeable to these substances. Conveniently, the fluorescence of N-NBD-PE present in the outer leaflet was lost after its digestion with the phospholipase, but the enzyme did not penetrate the viral membrane. Thus, this probe-enzyme combination provided a fast and efficient method for the determination of the asymmetry of these membranes, and it is potentially useful for other membranes that are permeable to small molecules also. Biological membranes continuously undergo membrane fusion and fission. For example, fibroblasts can recycle 50% of their plasma membranes/h (Steinman et al., 1983). Using a short chain fluorescent sphingomyelin analogue inserted into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, Koval and Pagano(1989) found that the probe was internalized by endocytosis, and then recycled to the plasma membrane with a half-time of 15-20 min. After 60 min, all non-metabolized probe could be extracted from the outer leaflet of the membrane again. Thus, although cells possess amino phospholipid translocases and other “flippases” that could restore membrane asymmetry (Devaux, 1991, 1992), it seems more logical to assume that asymmetry is maintained during fusion. In line with this, in most models for the molecular mechanism of biological membrane fusion (Ohki et al., 1987; Wilschut and Hoekstra, 1990; Bentz, 1993) it is proposed that fusion involves merger of the outer leaflets of the participant membranes followed by that of the inner leaflets, maintaining the asymmetry of the bulk of the lipids. This paper presents the first confirmation of that assumption. We thank Dr. R. Glück and R. Mischler of the Swiss Institute for Serum and Vaccines for the preparation of influenza virus, Dr. Devaux for inspiration, Dr. Gruber for advice, Dr. P.

This flexibility, together with other forces, determines the overall solution conformation of oligosaccharides. We used the method of time-resolved resonance energy transfer to study the solution conformations of a biantennary glycopeptide and its partially trimmed products by exoglycosidases. The N-terminal of the glycopeptide was labeled with 2-naphthyl acetic acid as a fluorescent donor. Either terminal sugar residue, Gal6′, on the branch bearing 6-linked Man (antenna 6′), or Neu5Ac on the branch bearing 3-linked Man (antenna 6) was labeled with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl as an acceptor. The distance and distance distributions between the terminals were measured. In the intact biantennary glycopeptide, the donor-acceptor distance distribution of antenna 6′ is bimodal with a majority of the population in the extended conformation and that of antenna 6 in one very broad population. The Neu5Ac on antenna 6 is oriented toward the N-terminal at low temperature and adopts a more extended form at high temperature. The removal of individual sugar residues along one of the two antenna in the biantennary oligosaccharide has a small effect on the distance distribution of the remaining antenna for both antennae 6 and 6′. Together with previous studies of the triantennary glycopeptides (Rice, K. G., Wu, P. G., Brand, L., and Lee, Y. C.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 7264-7270), our results suggest that both steric hindrance and inter-residue hydrogen bonding are very important in the folding pattern in oligosaccharide structures.

C.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 7264-7270), our results suggest that both steric hindrance and inter-residue hydrogen bonding are very important in the folding pattern in oligosaccharide structures. Conformational flexibility of linkages between sugar residues is an integral part of oligosaccharide structure. This is demonstrated in x-ray structures as multiple conformations (2.Wright C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14345-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or conformations selected according to protein-carbohydrate interactions(3.Shaanan B. Lis H. Sharon N. Science. 1991; 254: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 4.Bourne Y. Rouge P. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 197-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 260: 127-134Crossref Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides in solution are subject to thermal fluctuations and consequently they sample various conformations, which leads to heterogeneity in the structure. Great efforts both in the experimental and theoretical areas have been devoted to the determination of solution structure and conformation of oligosaccharides(6.Carver J.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 716-720Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7.Bush C.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 655-660Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8.Rice K.G. Wu P.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 669-674Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In previous work, we used the method of time-resolved resonance energy transfer to determine the solution conformations of complex triantennary glycopeptides. Both extended and folded conformations of carbohydrate chains were observed (9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the conversion between the two forms was temperature-dependent(10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggested that some linkages between sugar residues can rotate to a large extent under certain conditions. When the triantennary glycopeptides were treated with exoglycosidases to produce single chain isomers, the extended conformation was the dominant form(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus the intrinsic flexibility of linkages themselves does not automatically lead to a large conformational heterogeneity in oligosaccharides with multiple antennae. Other factors such as steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding may play roles in the solution behaviors of oligosaccharides. In this work we present results on a biantennary glycopeptide and its partially digested products by exoglycosidases. We used time-resolved resonance energy transfer methods to determine the average end-to-end distances and distance distributions between the N-terminal and each one of the sugar terminals. Our aim is 3-fold. (i) How does the intact biantennary behave in solution compared to the triantennary glycopeptides reported recently? (ii) How does the sugar residue Neu5Ac behave at the end of the carbohydrate chain? (iii) How do the properties of the biantennary glycopeptides change when one or more sugar residues on one antenna are removed? The details for preparation of the doubly fluorescence labeled glycopeptide has been published elsewhere(11.Lee K.B. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 1462-1469Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A brief description of the selective introduction of a fluorophore at a specific branch on a biantennary glycopeptide is described below. The monosialyl biantennary glycopeptides derived from bovine fibrinogen were treated with galactose oxidase to convert the terminal Gal6′ on the Manα(1-6)Man branch into 6-oxo-galactose. The oxidized glycopeptides (C6 aldehyde of galactose) were coupled with 2-(dansylamido)ethylamine by reductive amination and 2-naphthylacetic acid was attached to the N terminus of the peptide. Alternatively, 2-naphthylacetic acid was first attached to the N terminus of the peptide portion on the monosialylated glycopeptide and the sialic acid on the Manα(1-3)Man branch was oxidized with periodate. The oxidized glycopeptide (oxo-sialic acid) was coupled with 2-(dansylamido)ethylamine by reductive amination. All of the doubly fluorescent labeled glycopeptides were purified to homogeneity on reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by monosaccharide and amino acid analysis. Time-resolved fluorescence decays were measured on a photon-counting instrument with a picosecond dye laser system as described earlier (10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The overall instrument response is about 60 ps. The excitation wavelength was set at 290 nm and the emission wavelength of donor naphthyl was set at 340 nm with a polarizer oriented at the magic angle 54.7°. A dilute Ludox (silica) scattering solution was used to collect the instrument response. The temperature of the cuvette was controlled by a circulating water bath. Duplicate or triplicate data sets were collected. The decay data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares as described(9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the donor decay in the absence of acceptor dansyl 1The abbreviation used is: dansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. was analyzed by a sum of exponentials: I(t)=∑αiexp⁡(−t/τi)(Eq. 1) 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. where αi and τi are the amplitude and lifetime of component i. The quality of fit was judged by the reduced-χ2, weighted residuals, and the autocorrelation of the residuals. A good fit was accepted when the reduced-χ2 was between 1.0 and 1.2 with random residuals and autocorrelation of the residuals. The average lifetime was calculated from = Σαiτi/Σαj. The donor decay in the presence of dansyl was also analyzed empirically by to obtain the average lifetime. Once the average lifetimes of the donor in the absence and presence of the acceptor were obtained, the energy transfer efficiency was calculated by E = 1 - τDA/τd. The average distance between donor naphthyl at the N-terminal and acceptor dansyl at the antenna terminal was calculated according to = Ro(1/E - 1)1/6, where Ro is the Förster distance (22 Å at 20°C) of the donor-acceptor pair evaluated as before(9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) . The donor decay in the presence of the acceptor was analyzed by a model of distance distributions, IDA(t)=∑kak∫pk(r)∑iαiexp⁡[−tτi(1+(R0r)6)]dr(Eq. 2) where the first sum refers to the number of populations, each with a concentration of ak and a distance distribution where Ro is pk(r). The distance distribution was modeled either as a Gaussian, p(r)=12Πσexp⁡[−12(r−r¯σ)2](Eq. 3) or by a Lorentzian p(r)=1Πσ[1+(r−r¯σ)2]−1(Eq. 4) where is the average distance and σ is the standard deviation. When the distance distribution is asymmetric, an asymmetry parameter was used as before(12.Wu P. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7939-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). was used to fit experimental data by nonlinear least squares, with the average distance, the standard deviation, and the concentration as the adjustable parameters. Our previous results showed that there is a large fraction of folded conformation in both antennae 6 and 6′ in the triantennary structure(9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When two antennae were completely removed (resulting in three single chain isomers), there is a substantial increase in the average donor-acceptor distance in antennae 6 and 6′(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Starting with a biantennary structure in this work, one might expect either that there has already been a large conformational change from a triantennary to a biantennary structure or that significant changes occur only from a biantennary to a single chain structure. The following results show that conformational changes are relatively minor from a biantennary to a single chain structure, thus implying that a substantial conformational change may have already occurred from a triantennary to a biantennary structure. In this section we compare the average distances between N-terminal naphthyl and the dansyl group attached to either Gal6′ on antenna 6′ or Neu5Ac on antenna 6 (see Fig. 1 for residue and antenna assignment). These distances were measured in the intact biantennary structure as a function of temperature, in a series of partially digested biantennaries, and in the single chain isomers. The results are shown in TABLE 1, TABLE 2 and can be summarized as follows.TABLE 1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2 Open table in a new tab (a) With a stepwise removal of sugars in either antenna 6 or 6′, the change in average distances is small from the biantennary to the single chain structures and is not uniform (or monotonic) in that the removal of either GlcNAc 5 or 5′ leads to a minor decrease. Thus we do not expect a large shift in conformation from a biantennary to a single chain isomer. (b) For antenna 6′, the average distance changes are 1.7 Å in the biantennary and 1.6 Å in the single chain structure from 1 to 40°C. The decrease in distance is comparable with that of a similar single chain glycopeptide containing only a variation in the amino acids(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but not to that of antenna 6′ in the triantennary(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This single chain isomer serves as a reference when we compare our present results with previous ones. The average distance in the single chain antenna 6′ is 17.5 Å at 20°C, as compared to that of the similar single chain 6′ 18.3 Å with a different amino acid substitution(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These distances are very close. The small difference in the average distances may be due to two sources: sample variations may account for about 0.2-0.3 Å and the difference in the interactions of naphthyl with the N-terminal amino acids may account for the rest (the average lifetime of the donor is about 36 ns here and compared to about 26 ns in the earlier sample, and the interaction is primarily from amino acids since the donor decay is nearly single exponential with 98% of the amplitude, excluding the possibility of interactions from folded-back sugar chains). (c) In antenna 6, the average distance is 17.2 Å in the biantennary glycopeptide at 20°C. This is about 3 Å shorter than that of the same antenna without Neu5Ac in the triantennary and about 6 Å shorter than that of the single chain isomer 6 lacking Neu5Ac(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since there is one more sugar unit in antenna 6 of the biantennary structure, the end to end distance should be longer were all sugars in straight conformation. The shortening in the distance in this antenna implies that the linkage between Neu5Ac and Gal6 must be oriented such that Neu5Ac folds back toward the N-terminal in order to reduce the effective end to end distance. This is corroborated by the temperature dependence of the average distances. The change in the average distances from 1 to 40°C in antenna 6 of the biantennary and single chain is about 0.5 Å, which is much smaller than that of antenna 6′. As shown earlier(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the smaller change is due to some conformational change. In this case it can only occur between Neu5Ac and Gal6. It has been shown recently that both antennae 6 and 6′ in a triantennary glycopeptide can adopt a substantial fraction of folded conformation at or below room temperature(9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is interesting to examine how these two antennae behave in the biantennary structure in solution. The distance distribution fits are shown in Fig. 2 for antenna 6 and in Fig. 3 for antenna 6′. The decay of donor naphthyl with the acceptor attached to Neu5Ac in antenna 6 can be described by one asymmetric Lorentzian (also by one asymmetric Gaussian. Since we have used Lorentzian form earlier, this will be the form used throughout the paper.) If we fit with two distance distributions and superimpose them, we then get essentially one asymmetric distribution back. Since the distribution is quite broad, it is difficult to separate two populations under most circumstances. The collapse to one population is not entirely due to the Neu5Ac sugar unit since we can also fit the decay of a similar biantennary sample lacking Neu5Ac (and with three more amino acids) in antenna 6 with one asymmetric Lorentzian distance distribution. The decay of naphthyl with dansyl attached to Gal6′ in antenna 6′ of the biantennary on the other hand requires two distance distributions, similar to the case of antenna 6′ in the triantennary glycopeptide(9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The concentration of the folded form is nonetheless greatly diminished in the biantennary and is thus much less sensitive to temperature modulation than its counterpart in the triantennary(10.Wu P. Rice K.G. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus substantial changes have already occurred from the triantennary to the biantennary structures.Figure 3:Distance distributions of antenna 6′ in the intact biantennary glycopeptide as a function of temperature. Two distance distributions were used in the fit. The distributions are plotted in two ways: in A, the population of each distribution is proportional to the area; in B, is proportional to the peak value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine what the factors are that modulate the conformational changes in the carbohydrate chains, we used exo-glycosidases to remove one sugar residue at a time and monitored the changes in the distance distribution. Fig. 4 shows the change in distance distribution of antenna 6 when sugar residues Gal6′, GlcNAc5′, and Man4′ on antenna 6′ are sequentially removed. The removal of Gal6′ has no noticeable effect on the distance distribution on antenna 6 and the cleavage of GlcNAc5′ slightly broadens the distribution. Cutting Man4′ leads to a small decrease in the width of the distribution. Nonetheless the distance distribution of the single chain 6 is quite broad. Fig. 5 shows the shift in the distance distribution of antenna 6′ with sequential cleavage of sugar residues Neu5Ac as well as Gal6, GlcNAc5, and Man4 on antenna 6. The change is not uniform. In the intact chain (Fig. 1), two distance distributions are required to fit the data. Once Neu5Ac and Gal6 are removed, the decay can be fit with one asymmetric Lorentzian distance distribution (a similar fit to the intact chain leads to systematic deviations). However, when GlcNAc5 is cut, two populations are again required for the fit. Once all the sugar residues on antenna 6 are removed, the decay is fit with one asymmetric distance distribution. It should be noted that the difference between one asymmetric Lorentzian and distribution and two distance distributions is not as large as it appears in the figure. This is because the concentration of the folded form is about 25% at best, which is within borderline between one or two distance distributions when decay curves are analyzed. The real distance distribution may lie somewhere between the two forms of function, i.e. there is a small fraction of the folded form in antenna 6′ and its concentration is slightly modulated by the removal of sugar residues in antenna 6. In the single chain 6′, the distance distribution is close to that of a similar single chain 6′ reported recently(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The end to end distances of the biantennary glycopeptide and those of its single chain isomers show some interesting features compared to those of a triantennary glycopeptide and its single chain isomers(9.Rice K.G.

In the triantennary glycopeptide, the presence of antenna 8 apparently forces antennae 6 and 6′ to fold back half of the time(9.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6646-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the biantennary glycopeptide, on the other hand, the major portion of the population is in the extended conformation in both antenna 6 and 6′. This implies that antenna 8 in the triantennary glycopeptide has substantial steric effects on the solution behaviors of other antennae. Thus steric hindrance is important in determining the overall folding pattern of carbohydrate chains. In antenna 8, all sugars except for Man4-Man3 are β1,4-linked, which are known to be conformationally rigid. The rigidity of antenna 8, in tri-, bi-, and mono-antennary structures suggests that α1,3-linkage in the Man4-Man3 is also a rigid one. Therefore antenna 8 appears more rigid and forces other antennae to adopt an alternative conformation in a crowded structure such as a triantennary. A schematic illustration of the conformational flexibilities in triantennary and biantennary glycopeptides is shown in Fig. 6. In the triantennary structure, there is an equilibrium between the fold-back and open conformation in either antenna 6 or antenna 6′, while in the biantennary structure, the equilibrium is predominantly shifted toward the open form. Our results show that Neu5Ac has orientations more toward the N-terminal. This can be viewed as folded-back conformations as shown in Fig. 7. The α2-6-linkage, like α1-6-linkage(14.Cumming D.A. Carver J.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15.Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6571-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is flexible arising from the rotation of several single bonds. Since this sugar residue is at the end of the antenna, it is unlikely that steric hindrance is the determining factor for the conformation observed. Another factor may be hydrogen bonding between sugar residues. Molecular dynamics simulations of the biantennary glycopeptide up to 200 ps have shown that Neu5Ac can form many hydrogen bonds with various inner sugar residues(13.Dauchez M. Mazurier J. Montreuil J. Spik G. Veroten G. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If a sufficient number of hydrogen bonds are formed, a folded-back conformation can be stabilized. As solution temperature increases, more motions are produced, which leads to breakage of hydrogen bonds. This in turn results in a more extended conformation for Neu5Ac. The shift to an extended conformation compensates the temperature-enhanced intramolecular diffusion between the two ends (which reduces apparent distances when this motion is not included in data analysis) so that a smaller apparent change in average distances is detected. The wide distance distribution of the single chain 6 can be understood in the following. From the results of Rice et al.(1.Rice K.G. Wu P. Brand L. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7264-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the single chain 6 lacking Neu5Ac has quite a wide distance distribution. This can be attributed to the flexibility of β1,2-linkage between GlcNAc5 and Man4. The linkage between Neu5Ac and Gal6 is the α2-6 type, which is also expected to be flexible. The combination of the two factors are thus responsible for the asymmetric distance distribution."

Glycopeptides (by Pronase digestion) were separated by anion-exchange chromatography based on the degree of sialylation. The major monosialyl biantennary glycopeptides (see below) were used as substrates for galactose oxidase and periodate oxidation. [Formula: See Text] Galactose oxidase was used to oxidize the terminal Gal6' located on the Man alpha(1-6)Man branch. The oxidized glycopeptides (containing 6-oxo-galactose) were modified with 2-(dansylamido)ethylamine by reductive amination. The N terminus of the peptide portion was then modified with naphthylacetic acid. Alternatively, the peptide portion of the monosialylated glycopeptide was first modified with naphthylacetic acid and the sialic acid located on the Man alpha(1-3)Man branch was oxidized with periodate under controlled conditions. The oxidized glycopeptides (oxo-sialic acid) were coupled with 2-(dansylamido)ethylamine by reductive amination. These doubly fluorescence-labeled glycopeptides were used for conformational studies of biantennary glycopeptides by energy transfer (see the accompanying article (Wu, P., Lee, K. B., Lee, Y. C., and Brand, L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1470-1474). Furthermore, the unmodified branch of the fluorescent labeled glycopeptides were digested stepwise with exoglycosidases. Resonance energy transfer experiments were done with each of the resulting derivatives to determine the effects of removing sugars at each stage of peeling on any conformational change on the resulting branch antennae."
