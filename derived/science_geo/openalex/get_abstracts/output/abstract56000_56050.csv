Chem. 249, 7260–7269) the structure of the two asparagine-linked oligosaccharide units of an IgA1 myeloma protein was defined. In this paper we present data which establish the structure and linkage points of the five O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide units found on the α1 subtype heavy chain to be as shown below. [see PDF for equation] This structure appears to be identical with that which we have determined for the hinge region glycopeptide isolated by Frangione and Wolfenstein-Todel [Frangione, B., and Wolfenstein-Todel, C. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 3673–3676], from a different IgA1 myeloma protein. This region is deleted in the α2 subtype of IgA. Aside from the presence of a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine at the NH2 terminus, the location and structure of the 5 O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide units of the glycopeptide preserve the symmetry observed by Frangione and Wolfenstein-Todel to be present in the amino acid sequence of the hinge region."

https://openalex.org/W1529604947,"Abstract The elucidation of the factors which govern the production by the kidney of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3) is essential to an understanding of calcium homeostasis. Changes in the specific activity of the renal 25-OH-cholecalciferol-1-hydroxylase (1-hydroxylase) were followed after alterations in dietary vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus or parathyroidectomy using an enzyme assay which measures initial reaction rates. 1-Hydroxylase specific activity varied over a 5- to 20-fold range with changes in dietary vitamin D; it was decreased to a specific activity of 0.1 to 0.6 pmole per min per mg of protein by administration of vitamin D3 (1.6 nmoles per day) or equally effectively by administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.52 nmole per day), and it increased markedly to a level of 0.7 to 1.8 pmoles per min per mg of protein upon withdrawal of the steroids. These changes were not dependent upon measurable changes in serum calcium and occurred regardless of dietary calcium and phosphorous levels. The time period required for the enzyme activity to fall to values characteristic of a vitamin D-repleted chick was inversely proportional to the magnitude of the dose of vitamin D3 given (7 days with 3.2 nmoles per day; 2 days with 32.5 nmoles per day). In the continued presence of vitamin D3, the 1-hydroxylase activity is modulated over a more narrow range (0.1 to 0.6 pmole per min per mg of protein) and enzyme levels reflect the dietary availability of calcium. Changes in dietary calcium were reflected by parallel changes in serum calcium. There was a highly significant (p l 0.001) inverse correlation between 1-hydroxylase activity and serum Ca2+ levels. No significant correlations were found between the enzyme activity and serum phosphorous or renal inorganic phosphorous levels. Parathyroidectomy of cholecalciferol-depleted chicks resulted in a decrease, in 24 hours, of 1-hydroxylase activity to levels characteristic of vitamin D-treated chicks (0.2 to 0.04 pmoles per min per mg of protein). This suggests that parathyroid hormone status is equally as important as calciferol status in determining 1-hydroxylase specific activity. The half-life and rates of synthesis and degradation of 1-hydroxylase in cholecalciferol-deficient and -repleted chicks were determined by measuring enzyme activity following cycloheximide treatment (Berlin, C. M., and Schimke, R. T. (1965) Mol. Pharmacol. 1, 149). Vitamin D status had no effect on the half-life or degradation rate (t1/2 = 4 to 5 hours); the rate of synthesis in deficient birds is 4.7 times that in vitamin D-repleted birds. In summary, the two major components which regulate the steady state level of 25-OH-D3-1-hydroxylase (vitamin D status and serum calcium-parathyroid hormone) appear to exert their effect by changes in the rate of the biosynthesis of this enzyme."

Infection by avian sarcoma viruses of subgroups A, B, and C, but not avian leukosis viruses of groups A and B, elevates the level of plasminogen activators produced by the fibroblasts. The activators produced by transformed chick embryo fibroblasts can convert plasminogen from calf, fetal calf, as well as chicken serum, to plasmin. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and fetuin inhibit plasmin mediated caseinolysis. The active-site alkylating agents TLCK, TPCK, APB, GPB, ZPBK, ZLCK, ZPCK also are inhibitory. Activation is specific for plasminogen; the zymogens trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and pepsinogen cannot be activated."
https://openalex.org/W1485839956,"We have purified formaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.1) 1390-fold from human liver. The final preparation, which has a specific activity of 3.20 i.u. per mg of protein (25°) is homogeneous according to electrophoretic criteria. S-Formylglutathione rather than formate is formed from formaldehyde and reduced glutathione in the reaction catalyzed by purified formaldehyde dehydrogenase. The enzyme is not strictly NAD-specific; NADP can also be used although NADP has a much higher Km value than NAD, especially at high pH values. S-Formylglutathione is reduced by the enzyme to formaldehyde with either NADH or NADPH as cofactors. Methylglyoxal and some other ketoaldehydes also can be used as the substrates of formaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product obtained from methylglyoxal is probably S-pyruvylglutathione. S-Formylglutathione is hydrolyzed very actively in crude human liver preparations. All of this activity is removed during the purification of formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde dehydrogenase has an apparent molecular weight of 81,400 according to gel filtration and a subunit molecular weight of 39,500 according to dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing experiments gave an isoelectric point, pI of 6.35. The enzyme is very sensitive to mercaptide-forming reagents. NAD and NADH protect the enzyme. NAD and especially NADH stabilize the enzyme during storage and against denaturation at high temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2133422577,"Abstract Insulin and glucagon injected into the portal vein produced rapid reciprocal changes in the activities of certain hepatic glycolytic enzymes and fructose diphosphatase in the rat. Insulin produced a rapid increase in hepatic phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities and a decrease in fructose diphosphatase activity. Glucagon produced a rapid but reciprocal response in each of these enzyme activities. Fructose diphosphate aldolase activity was unaltered by either hormone. The insulin effect on these enzymes was detected within 5 min following injection, was maximal by 10 min, and then gradually declined over the remaining 30 min of testing. The magnitude of the insulin effect was dependent on the amount of insulin injected. No effect was detected when 0.005 unit per kg (0.001 unit) was injected; phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities were slightly increased with 0.015 unit per kg (0.003 unit); phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and fructose diphosphatase activities were altered with 0.15 unit per kg (0.03 unit) and 1.5 units per kg (0.3 unit), with the higher dose giving a slightly greater effect. The insulin effect was not associated with a significant change in cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate concentrations. The glucagon effect on the enzyme activities was preceded by a significant increase in cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate concentrations, which occurred within 30 s after hormone injection. A change in enzyme activities was found at 2 to 5 min and was maximal 5 to 10 min following glucagon injection. The hormone effect on enzyme activities and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels was dependent on the amount of glucagon injected, being maximal at doses of 150 to 300 µg. Pretreatment of the rat with actinomycin D or puromycin did not alter the response of the enzymes to insulin and glucagon, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was not responsible for the change in enzyme activities. Glucagon injected 5 min following insulin reversed the insulin effect; insulin given 5 min after glucagon also partially reversed the glucagon effect on cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and the enzyme activities. Intravenous insulin produced rapid changes in the activities of renal cortical, skeletal muscle, and epididymal fat glycolytic enzymes and fructose diphosphatase in the rat. Insulin (0.15 unit per kg) produced rapid increases in pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase and rapid decrease in fructose diphosphatase activities in all tissues. Fructose diphosphate aldolase activity was unchanged following insulin infusion. Intravenous glucagon (0.15 mg) produced rapid changes, reciprocal to those seen with insulin, in fructose diphosphatase activity in all tissues. Glucagon significantly decreased epididymal fat phosphofructokinase activities but did not alter the activity of this enzyme in the renal cortex and skeletal muscle. Glucagon significantly decreased renal cortical pyruvate kinase but had no effect in the epididymal fat and skeletal muscle. Fructose diphosphate aldolase activity was unchanged in all tissues following glucagon infusion. Cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate infusion (0.05 mmole) produced significant changes in pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, and fructose diphosphatase activities in all tissues which resembled those changes seen following glucagon infusion. These data suggest that the glucagon responses seen in the four tissues studied are mediated by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1675332423,"Abstract Steroid hormones appear to regulate gene expression in target tissues by binding tightly to a cytoplasmic receptor protein, thereby causing this protein to increase its affinity for regulatory sites on the genome. In this study, we have measured the hormone-dependent binding of estradiol receptor protein to a variety of nucleic acids and nucleoproteins, using salt conditions in the physiological range. Sedimentation partition chromatography, a new method for quantitating interactions between 2 macromolecules, allows a constant concentration of nucleic acid to be sedimented through a narrow zone containing the receptor. We use this method to estimate equilibrium dissociation constants, and find that the form of the estradiol receptor which sediments at 5 S binds to DNA at least 15-fold more tightly than does the 4 S form. Most strikingly, the 5 S receptor binds equally well (K = 300–400 µg per ml) to the following double-stranded DNAs: heterologous or homologous mammalian DNA, bacterial DNA, and polydeoxyadenylate-deoxythymidylate copolymer (a synthetic DNA); in contrast, no interaction was detected with double-stranded reovirus RNA. No significant binding of the 5 S receptor to either DNA or uterine chromatin was found when tested under these salt conditions by either gel permeation chromatography or standard sucrose gradient co-sedimentation assays. Both of these techniques are able to detect only interactions of much higher affinity than those observable by sedimentation partition chromatography or DNA-cellulose chromatography (Yamamoto, K., and Alberts, B. (1972) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 2105–2109), and these negative results are predicted by the relatively weak binding shown by sedimentation partition chromatography. Because of the lability of receptor proteins, both the gel permeation and sucrose gradient assays are subject to serious artifacts: in particular, aggregated receptors can appear to be tightly DNA-bound. Short term co-sedimentation of receptors with the same DNA preparation sheared to two different sizes is shown to be necessary to distinguish between receptor aggregation and DNA binding. The low affinity, nonspecific, interaction of the estradiol receptor protein with DNA in vitro agrees with several in vivo observations; in particular, it might have been predicted from the careful studies by Williams and Gorski of the partitioning of the receptor between cell nucleus and cytoplasm (Williams, D., and Gorski, J. (1972) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 3464–3468). Thus, although there are good reasons to believe that the receptor activates genes by interacting preferentially with a small number of specific sites on the genome, we believe that these interactions are obscured, both in vitro and in vivo, by a large background of nonspecific DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2048427461,"The glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, binds to the specific cytosol receptors of a steroid-resistant mouse lymphoma cell line with the same affinity as to the receptors of the steroid-responsive parental cells. In the sensitive cells, the receptor-steroid complex translocates to the nucleus, whereas in the resistant cells nuclear transfer is greatly diminished. “Activated” receptor-dexamethasone complex from sensitive cells binds to isolated nuclei from both sensitive and resistant cell types, whereas the complex from the resistant cells binds to neither nuclei. Furthermore, the activated complex from sensitive cells binds to isolated homologous and heterologous DNA, whereas the complex from the resistant cells displays greatly reduced binding activity, implying that DNA plays a significant role in nuclear binding. These results suggest that the normal glucocorticoid receptor has two active domains: one for steroid binding, and the other for interaction with nuclear acceptor sites. The resistant cells described in this paper contain a receptor apparently defective in the latter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1657503303,"Abstract The total reconstitution of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase by stoichiometric addition of the metals to completely metal-free apoprotein is described. Reconstitution has been monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and absorption spectroscopy, enzymic activity, and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under the same conditions, it has been possible to prepare highly active enzymes with cobalt, mercury, or cadmium in place of zinc. The properties of these derivatives demonstrate that the replacement is exact, that copper has the major influence on the spectral properties of the enzyme, and that occupation of the zinc site is necessary in order to attain fully native properties. A technique is described which allows the extraction of superhyperfine patterns from the bulk of magnetic resonance spectra. Use of this technique shows that the superhyperfine patterns of superoxide dismutase from animal sources differ from those of fungal enzymes. In addition, the technique of shows that the superhyperfine patterns in the EPR spectra reconstituted Cu2-, Cu2, Cd2-, Cu2, Hg2-, and Cu2, Zn2-derivatives are very similar to that in the EPR spectrum of native enzyme. Reconstitution with 63Cu and treatment with cyanide demonstrates that three magnetically equivalent nitrogens are the source of these patterns. The results of this study are shown to be consistent with the copper binding site being a distorted square planar arrangement of ligands and neighboring the zinc-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2030254174,"The generation of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in response to catecholamines in the 2B subclone of RGC6 rat glioma cells previously exposed to norepinephrine and refractory to further norepinephrine addition is substantially increased by addition of inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. The time course of the effect of these inhibitors on cyclic AMP concentration suggests that rapid protein synthesis and turnover are involved in catecholamine refractoriness. Norepinephrine induction of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase is demonstrable in RGC6 cells but not in the 2B subclone. Thus, catecholamine refractoriness cannot be attributed to induction of phosphodiesterase. This implies that induction of a protein or proteins, important in catecholamine refractoriness, affects the synthesis rather than the degradation of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2081220201,"Examination of components of the cAMP system in primary cultures of differentiating chick myoblasts revealed a basal intracellular cAMP level of 50–100 pmole/mg of DNA, which increased ten to fifteen-fold for approximately 1 hr between 37.5 and 39.5 hr of culture, only 5–6 hr before the initiation of myoblast fusion. Activities of the enzymes adenylate cyclase and protein kinase were examined during the initial stages of myoblast differentiation. Both the basal activity and the degree of NaF stimulation of adenylate cyclase increased during the time examined, the appearance of these changes coinciding in time of culture with the observed peak of cAMP. The protein kinase present was sensitive to cAMP, and its basal and cAMP stimulated activities increased throughout the prefusion period of culture. The results suggest a causal relationship between the increase in adenylate cyclase activities, the increase in intracellular cAMP, and the onset of fusion; and the possibility that intracellular cAMP levels control the expression of myoblast differentiation is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1533429375,"Abstract The cytoplasmic 4 S receptor protein that specifically binds the steroid hormone 17β-estradiol has been studied in soluble extracts of rat uterine tissue at physiological ionic strengths. After labeling the protein with [3H]estradiol, two related interactions of the receptor with other macromolecular components have been detected and characterized by DNA-cellulose chromatography and sucrose gradient sedimentation. In a reaction requiring the presence of both hormone and DNA-cellulose, the receptor binds a second subunit (Subunit X), increasing its sedimentation rate from 4 S to 5 S. Concomitantly, this 5 S complex binds to DNA. From gel permeation and sedimentation behavior, the molecular weights of the 4 S and 5 S receptor proteins are estimated as 60,000 and 105,000, respectively. Although the strong tendency of these receptors to adsorb to surfaces necessitates the use of carrier proteins as protective agents, essentially identical results have been obtained whether bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, or insulin is used for this purpose. These interactions proceed rapidly at high temperatures, but only slowly at 4°. At 4°, the 4 S to 5 S conversion is second order in extract concentration and rate-limiting, and the 5 S form of receptor binds rapidly to DNA. At low ionic strength, the 4 S form of the receptor can also bind to DNA-cellulose, but it elutes at 0.21 m NaCl while the 5 S receptor remains bound. The X subunit of the 5 S receptor does not itself bind estradiol; it appears to be capable of binding to DNA independently of the receptor, and is present in both target and non-target tissues of the rat. These in vitro results parallel the hormone- and temperature-dependent 4 S to 5 S conversion and nuclear migration observed for the estradiol receptor protein in vivo. We suggest that this nuclear migration results simply from the increased DNA affinity of the 5 S form of receptor, and that the true nuclear binding sites for this receptor are therefore at least partially composed of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1973080672,"Sublines with altered ribonucleotide reductase have been isolated from the mouse fibroblast line 3T6 by selection for resistance to arabinosyl cytosine and the deoxynucleosides of adenine, thymidine, and guanine. The alterations in enzyme activity are of two kinds: (a) 4–10 fold higher levels of enzyme activity per unit of cell protein; (b) partial desensitization of the enzyme to the allosteric negative effector dATP. The combination of these two alterations keeps the reductase activity of extracts of these deoxynucleoside-resistant clones at wild type levels even in the presence of high concentrations of the deoxynucleotides. The alterations of reductase activity are stable over long periods of cultivation in the absence of deoxynucleosides, and are presumably due to mutation. Despite these changes, the reductase activity is still regulated during growth, since it is much lower in resting than in growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1596784535,"Abstract Escherichia coli formylmethionine tRNA is unable to form a ternary complex with bacterial T factor and GTP, as measured by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. Treatment of tRNAfMet with sodium bisulfite produces cytidine to uridine base changes in the tRNA structure and greatly enhances its binding affinity for T factor. The ternary complex formed with the bisulfite-modified initiator tRNA has properties analogous to those of EF-Tu·GTP·AA-tRNA complexes formed with non-initiator tRNAs. Enzymatic formylation of modified Met-tRNAfMet completely eliminates its ability to bind to EF-Tu. Unmodified tRNAfMet is unique among the tRNAs sequenced to date in having a non-hydrogen-bonded base at the 5' terminus. Bisulfite-catalyzed conversion of this unpaired cytidine to uridine results in formation of a normal uridine-adenosine base pair at the end of the acceptor stem. In order to determine whether this modification affects T factor recognition, partially modified Met-tRNAfMet was labeled with 32P at the 5' terminus and the fraction capable of forming an EF-Tu·GTP·Met-tRNAfMet complex was separated from unbound Met-tRNAfMet by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. Terminal nucleotide analysis of the tRNA bound in the complex showed that it was greatly enriched in [5'-32P]uridylate compared to the starting tRNA. Removal of the 5'-phosphate from several normal AA-tRNAs was found to drastically reduce the ability of these tRNAs to form stable ternary complexes with EF-Tu. The requirement for base pairing at the end of the acceptor stem therefore appears to result from a requirement for a specific spatial orientation of the 5'-terminal phosphate for T factor binding. Bisulfite modification of the 3'-terminal CpCpA-OH sequence of Met-tRNAfMet reduces its binding affinity for EF-Tu, indicating that this region of the molecule is also involved in formation of a stable ternary complex. Met-tRNAfMet containing a fully base-paired acceptor stem and normal CpCpA-OH sequence can be completely bound as EF-Tu·GTP·Met-tRNAfMet in the presence of excess T factor, however this ternary complex is less stable than the complexes formed with Met-tRNAmMet, Phe-tRNAPhe, or Gln-tRNAGln, suggesting that other structural features outside of the 3'- and 5'-terminal regions may be involved in T factor recognition of AA-tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1972635127,"Purified vesicular stomatitis virus contains an enzyme activity that incorporates the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine into the messenger RNA products during their synthesis in vitro by the virion-associated transcriptase. The methylation reaction is subject to inhibition by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, suggesting the transfer of only the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to RNA products. The methyl-labeled RNA products are sensitive to RNAase and alkaline hydrolysis and bind efficiently to oligo-(dT)-cellulose. The methylase activity is further shown to be associated only with the VSV ribonucleoprotein core isolated from virions. The methylation occurs at the 5′ terminal base of the RNA chains with approximately 2 methyl groups incorporated per RNA molecule. Alkaline hydrolysis of the methyl-labeled RNA released a 5′ terminal dinucleotide, consistent with some methylation occurring at the 2′ position of the terminal nucleotide."

The A ring of these steroids is dynamically equilibrated between two chair conformers. For vitamin D3, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 the relative proportions of the two conformers are 1 : 1, whereas dihydrotachysterol3 exists principally as only one conformer. Thus, the substituent groups on the A ring may be either equatorially or axially oriented, and suggests a refinement of the existing topological model for vitamin D hormonal activity."

https://openalex.org/W1626769376,"Abstract Intact acini were prepared from the mammary gland of lactating rats by treatment with collagenase. The acini were obtained in high yield. The preparation offers considerable advantage over the use of tissue slices. The acini were incubated with glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and acetate labeled with 14C and tritium, as single substrates or in combination with glucose. Synthesis of fatty acids from glucose was about 2500 µatoms of carbon per g of dry fat-free tissue, or approximately 150 µmoles of acetyl units per g wet weight per hour. Lactate as the sole substrate is oxidized to a small extent and fatty acid synthesis is negligible. Acetate as the sole substrate is hardly utilized. Pyruvate is oxidized at a rapid rate, but lipogenesis is much lower than that from glucose. Addition of glucose stimulates lipogenesis from lactate and acetate, but not from pyruvate. Lipogenesis from glucose is stimulated slightly by acetate, depressed by lactate, and nearly completely inhibited by pyruvate at concentrations of 10 mm. Lipogenesis from lactate plus glucose, and acetate plus glucose, is greater than that from glucose alone. With 5 mm glucose and 5 mm lactate, lactate contributes three-fourths of the fatty acid carbon; with 5 mm glucose and 2 mm lactate, the contribution of the two substrates is approximately equal. A balance between reducing equivalents and ATP production and utilization was calculated for glucose alone and for glucose in the presence of lactate and acetate. There is an excess of reducing equivalent production in the cytosol over the requirement for lipogenesis. In all of the conditions, there was a large apparent excess of ATP production over the requirements for biosynthesis."

Concanavalin A (Con A) added to mouse spleen lymphocytes in serum-free medium leads to an increase in the rate of DNA synthesis as great as 1000 fold, commencing 20 hr after its addition. Prior to 20 hr, the rate of purine synthesis increases 10–100 fold as measured by accumulation of the purine intermediate, formyl glycineamide ribonucleotide (FGAR). Addition of dibutyryl cyclic GMP to the lymphocyte suspensions results in a 10 fold increase in the rate of DNA synthesis in the absence of Con A and enhances both purine synthesis and DNA synthesis in its presence. The activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPP synthetase), an enzyme central to purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, is increased 2–10 fold during the activation. The increase begins to appear 8 hr after Con A addition and requires concomitant protein synthesis. The induced PRPP synthetase activity is stimulated by the presence of cyclic GMP in the enzyme assay. Addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to Con A-stimulated lymphocytes inhibits FGAR production, the stimulation of DNA synthesis, and the appearance of cyclic GMP-sensitive PRPP synthetase. These studies suggest that cyclic nucleotides play a significant role in the molecular mechanism of lymphocyte activation, the regulation of purine biosynthesis, and of eucaryotic genetic expression."

There was an increase in incorporation of 14C-proline into collagen when expressed not only as dpm per μg DNA or protein, but also as the relative rate of collagen synthesis compared to total cellular protein synthesis, which suggests that an alteration in amino acid transport cannot totally account for the increased incorporation into collagen. The three properties studied were all affected over a concentration range of 0.10 to 1.0 mM dbcAMP, but each had a slightly different dose-response curve. At 0.5 mM dbcGMP or sodium butyrate, there was no affect on growth, morphology, or the relative rate of collagen synthesis indicating specificity for the dibutyryl analog of cAMP. Growth of the parent line, BALB 3T3, was inhibited by 0.5 mM dbcAMP, but the relative rate of collagen synthesis did not increase. These results suggest that although growth, morphology, and collagen synthesis are altered in transformed cells so that they more closely resemble those of the parent line, each property may be regulated independently."

https://openalex.org/W1980656642,"Abstract Two viruses isolated following prolonged growth of serologically distinct mouse type C RNA viruses in human cells have previously been shown to have acquired common envelope properties distinct from those of either parental virus. Virus neutralization tests show that the viruses selected in human cells possess envelope antigens identical to those of endogenous mouse type C viruses of cells in which the parental viruses had been propagated. In contrast, the p12 polypeptide of each virus selected in human cells is antigenically indistinguishable from that of its respective parental virus and different from those of known endogenous mouse type C viruses. Molecular hybridization indicates significant differences in the genetic sequences of one virus and its parent, excluding the possibility that it arose from a point mutation. These findings indicate that the viruses selected in human cells represent genetic recombinants between exogenous and endogenous mouse type C viruses."

An observed general increase in cell mass is insufficient to fully account for the larger size. However, RSV-BH-transformed cells contain a greater proportion of water, which is reflected in a decrease in cellular density. These changes in size, water content, and density were not found in cells infected with the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of avian sarcoma virus. CE cells infected with a mutant of RSV-BH are morphologically transformed at 37°C but not at 41°C, and after shifting from 41°C to 37°C they become larger, accumulate more water, and band higher in density gradients. These changes occur without a requirement for new RNA or protein synthesis. The noted increase in cellular water may be an early event leading to changes in transcription and translation, culminating in malignancy in cells transformed by RSV-BH."

Gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated the enzyme was made up of two subunits of equal size each with a molecular weight of 41,500. The light absorption spectrum had a major absorption peak at 277 nm, and calculations based on the absorbance values at 280 and 260 nm indicated the presence of approximately 1 mol of pyridine nucleotide per mol of cyclase. Assay of the pure enzyme for bound NAD+ demonstrated the presence of 1 mol of bound NAD+ per mol of enzyme. The activity of pure enzyme was stimulated by NAD+ and by either ADP or ATP. Chromatography of the pure enzyme on DEAE-cellulose columns dramatically increased the dependence of the cyclase activity on added NAD+. It was inhibited severely by oxygen and by several sulfhydryl group inhibitors."

Here I show that caffeine, which inhibits repair of photolesions and interacts with DNA in various ways3, inhibits the induction of the endogenous virus by IUdR."
https://openalex.org/W1580534767,"Abstract An inhibitor of the elongation factor G-dependent uncoupled GTPase reaction of ribosomes has been purified from a solution obtained by washing ribosomes of Escherichia coli Q13 with a buffer containing 0.5 m NH4Cl. The molecular weight of the inhibitor as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration was 23,000 and 19,000, respectively. The inhibitor was specific for the elongation factor G-dependent uncoupled GTPase reaction of 70 S ribosomal particles and did not inhibit the elongation factor G-dependent GTPase reaction of 50 S ribosomal subunit particles. Kinetic studies on the inhibition of the GTPase reaction indicated that the inhibitor was competitive with ribosomes and noncompetitive with elongation factor G and GTP in the GTPase reaction. The ribosomes, which were incubated with the inhibitor and then separated from the free inhibitor, had lower GTPase activity than the ribosomes incubated without the inhibitor. These results are taken as evidence that the inhibitor acts on ribosomes and inhibits the elongation factor G-dependent uncoupled GTPase reaction of ribosomes."
