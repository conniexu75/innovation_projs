https://openalex.org/W2582801455,"Interspecies blastocyst complementation enables organ-specific enrichment of xenogenic pluripotent stem cell (PSC) derivatives. Here, we establish a versatile blastocyst complementation platform based on CRISPR-Cas9-mediated zygote genome editing and show enrichment of rat PSC-derivatives in several tissues of gene-edited organogenesis-disabled mice. Besides gaining insights into species evolution, embryogenesis, and human disease, interspecies blastocyst complementation might allow human organ generation in animals whose organ size, anatomy, and physiology are closer to humans. To date, however, whether human PSCs (hPSCs) can contribute to chimera formation in non-rodent species remains unknown. We systematically evaluate the chimeric competency of several types of hPSCs using a more diversified clade of mammals, the ungulates. We find that naïve hPSCs robustly engraft in both pig and cattle pre-implantation blastocysts but show limited contribution to post-implantation pig embryos. Instead, an intermediate hPSC type exhibits higher degree of chimerism and is able to generate differentiated progenies in post-implantation pig embryos."

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is not only the prototypical human hallucinogen, but also one of the most potent known psychoactive drugs. LSD was synthesized in 1938 by Albert Hofmann, who in 1943 accidently discovered its potent hallucinogenic properties (Hofmann, 1979Hofmann A. How LSD originated.J. Psychedelic Drugs. 1979; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). LSD alters human perception and mood (Nichols, 2016Nichols D.E. Psychedelics.Pharmacol. Rev. 2016; 68: 264-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and users report profound psychological experiences, or “trips,” lasting 6–15 hr (Passie et al., 2008Passie T. Halpern J.H. Stichtenoth D.O. Emrich H.M. Hintzen A. The pharmacology of lysergic acid diethylamide: A review.CNS Neurosci. Ther. 2008; 14: 295-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). LSD gained popularity as a legal recreational drug in the early 1960’s, although it was soon classified as a schedule 1 controlled substance. A renewed scientific interest in LSD not only provides support for its potential application in disorders such as substance abuse (Bogenschutz and Johnson, 2016Bogenschutz M.P. Johnson M.W. Classic hallucinogens in the treatment of addictions.Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 2016; 64: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), cluster headaches (Sewell et al., 2006Sewell R.A. Halpern J.H. Pope Jr., H.G. Response of cluster headache to psilocybin and LSD.Neurology. 2006; 66: 1920-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and anxiety associated with life-threatening conditions (Gasser et al., 2015Gasser P. Kirchner K. Passie T. LSD-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with a life-threatening disease: A qualitative study of acute and sustained subjective effects.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2015; 29: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), but also has illustrated LSD’s potential utility in studying aspects of human psychopathology and consciousness (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016Carhart-Harris R.L. Muthukumaraswamy S. Roseman L. Kaelen M. Droog W. Murphy K. Tagliazucchi E. Schenberg E.E. Nest T. Orban C. et al.Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 4853-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). LSD has a complex pharmacology, exhibiting potent interactions with essentially all aminergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Kroeze et al., 2015Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol.

LSD appears to manifest its psychoactive properties primarily through 5-HT2-family serotonin receptors, in particular at the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) (Titeler et al., 1988Titeler M. Lyon R.A. Glennon R.A. Radioligand binding evidence implicates the brain 5-HT2 receptor as a site of action for LSD and phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1988; 94: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), which is enriched in cortical layer V pyramidal neurons (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic, 1998Jakab R.L. Goldman-Rakic P.S. 5-Hydroxytryptamine2A serotonin receptors in the primate cerebral cortex: Possible site of action of hallucinogenic and antipsychotic drugs in pyramidal cell apical dendrites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). LSD is a semi-synthetic member of a larger class of ergolines that have long been recognized as therapeutics for many conditions, including migraine headaches, post-partum hemorrhage, and Parkinson’s disease (Berger et al., 2009Berger M. Gray J.A. Roth B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin.Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). It is well known that LSD activates canonical G-protein-mediated signaling at many GPCRs, but it has only recently been appreciated that LSD also potently activates the non-canonical β-arrestin pathway at most biogenic amine GPCRs (Kroeze et al., 2015Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), including all but one serotonin receptor (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D. Wang C. Katritch V. Han G.W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. McCorvy J.D. Jiang Y. Chu M. Siu F.Y. et al.Structural features for functional selectivity at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2013Wang C. Jiang Y. Ma J.

Vardy E. et al.Structural basis for molecular recognition at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Whereas most endogenous agonists, such as serotonin, activate both G-protein and β-arrestin pathways, some compounds can stabilize distinct receptor conformations, thereby preferentially activating select signal transduction pathways. This phenomenon has been termed “functional selectivity” or “biased agonism” (Urban et al., 2007Urban J.D. Clarke W.P. von Zastrow M. Nichols D.E. Kobilka B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Roth B.L.

Although the molecular details responsible for biased signaling are unknown, recent crystallographic studies of G-protein-bound receptors (Carpenter et al., 2016Carpenter B. Nehmé R. Warne T.

Wang C. Katritch V. Han G.W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. McCorvy J.D. Jiang Y. Chu M. Siu F.Y. et al.Structural features for functional selectivity at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), as well as structure-inspired functional studies (Wootten et al., 2016Wootten D.

Given the historical and continuing impact of LSD as a recreational drug, we wished to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for LSD’s activity at serotonin receptors. We thus set out to (1) elucidate the structural characteristics of LSD-bound 5-HT2BR, an excellent model system for 5-HT2AR, (2) provide a detailed functional characterization of LSD’s biased signaling profile, and (3) using the 5-HT2BR structure as a template, clarify the structural features for its activity at the homologous 5-HT2AR, the major target for LSD’s psychedelic effects. To obtain structural insights into LSD’s actions at human serotonin receptors, we crystallized an engineered 5-HT2BR construct bound to LSD by extensively modifying our previous approach (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D. Wang C. Katritch V. Han G.W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. McCorvy J.D. Jiang Y. Chu M. Siu F.Y. et al.Structural features for functional selectivity at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We eventually obtained crystals and solved the X-ray structure of the 5-HT2BR/LSD complex to a resolution of 2.9 Å (Table 1; Figures 1 and S1). LSD is bound in the orthosteric binding site while also engaging the previously described extended binding site of the receptor (Figures 1A–1C) (Wang et al., 2013Wang C. Jiang Y. Ma J. Wu H. Wacker D. Katritch V. Han G.W. Liu W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. et al.Structural basis for molecular recognition at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). As an ergoline, LSD’s tryptamine moiety, which resembles that of 5-HT, is embedded in a tetracyclic scaffold (Figure 1D). Ergolines exhibit diverse amide modifications, such as LSD’s diethylamide that is essential for its optimal potency in vivo (Nichols et al., 1996Nichols D.E. Monte A. Huang X. Marona-Lewicka D. Stereoselective pharmacological effects of lysergic acid amides possessing chirality in the amide substituent.Behav. Brain Res. 1996; 73: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), or the peptide moiety of ergotamine (ERG) (Figure 1D). LSD is anchored to 5-HT2BR by a conserved salt bridge between D1353.32 in helix III and the basic nitrogen of the ergoline system (Figures 1B–1D), an interaction that has been observed consistently in aminergic receptor structures (Chien et al., 2010Chien E.Y.

The ergoline system of LSD occupies the orthosteric pocket, which forms a narrow cleft lined mainly by hydrophobic side chains from residues in helices III, V, VI, and VII; such a cleft is common to most biogenic amine receptors. LSD’s ergoline ring system forms edge-to-face aromatic contacts with conserved phenylalanines (F3406.51, F3416.52) in helix VI, as previously anticipated for its complex with 5-HT2AR (Choudhary et al., 1995Choudhary M.S.

LSD’s diethylamide group binds in a crevice between helices II, III, and VII, where one ethyl group forms non-polar contacts with L1323.29 and W1313.28, while the other ethyl group extends toward L3627.35—residues previously shown to be part of an extended binding pocket in 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D.

Although ergolines are structurally and chemically related, in vivo activities of ergolines are diverse, ranging from the anti-migraine effects of ERG to the hallucinogenic actions of LSD. These differences can be attributed in part to differential blood-brain barrier permeability—ERG, for example, does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is thus not hallucinogenic (Verhoeff et al., 1993Verhoeff N.P. Visser W.H. Ferrari M.D. Saxena P.R. van Royen E.A. Dopamine D2-receptor imaging with 123I-iodobenzamide SPECT in migraine patients abusing ergotamine: Does ergotamine cross the blood brain barrier?.Cephalalgia. 1993; 13: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is also known, however, that ergolines differ greatly in their receptor pharmacology and patterns of signaling (Huang et al., 2009Huang X.P. Setola V. Yadav P.N. Allen J.A. Rogan S.C. Hanson B.J. Revankar C. Robers M. Doucette C. Roth B.L. Parallel functional activity profiling reveals valvulopathogens are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine(2B) receptor agonists: Implications for drug safety assessment.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 710-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ergolines are also predicted to bind to serotonin receptors differently based on modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies (Choudhary et al., 1995Choudhary M.S. Sachs N. Uluer A. Glennon R.A. Westkaemper R.B. Roth B.L. Differential ergoline and ergopeptine binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptors: Ergolines require an aromatic residue at position 340 for high affinity binding.Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 450-457PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we compared the conformations of 5-HT2BR bound to either ERG or LSD (Figures 2 and S2). The 5-HT2BR/LSD structure shows hallmarks of an apparently arrestin-biased state similar to those previously described for 5-HT2BR/ERG, which include a partially activated state of the PIF motif, and larger activation-related changes in helix VII and the NPxxY motif than in helix V, VI, and the DRY motif (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D. Wang C. Katritch V. Han G.W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. McCorvy J.D. Jiang Y. Chu M. Siu F.Y. et al.Structural features for functional selectivity at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). These similarities likely reflect the fact that at 5-HT2BR, both ERG and LSD preferentially engage β-arrestin-mediated over Gq-mediated signal transduction (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D. Wang C. Katritch V. Han G.W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. McCorvy J.D. Jiang Y. Chu M. Siu F.Y. et al.Structural features for functional selectivity at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Although LSD-bound 5-HT2BR adopts an overall conformation reminiscent of that seen in the ERG-bound 5-HT2BR structure, the shared ergoline ring systems of LSD and ERG adopt distinct configurations with respect to the orthosteric binding pocket of the 5-HT2BR (Figure 2A).Figure S2Activation States of 5-HT2BR/LSD and 5-HT2BR/ERG through Comparison with the β2 Adrenergic Receptor, Related to Figure 2Show full captionSuperposition of 5-HT2BR/LSD (light blue), 5-HT2BR/ERG (dark green) (PDB ID: 4IB4 (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D.

Compared to ERG, the ergoline moiety of LSD is located higher in the orthosteric pocket, closer to EL2 and the extracellular space, adopting a shallow binding mode. ERG is located deeper in the pocket with its indole nitrogen hydrogen bonding to T1403.37 in helix III, at the bottom of the pocket, further embedded in the intra-membrane region. In contrast, the indole nitrogen of LSD does not interact with T1403.37 in helix III, but instead hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of G2215.42 in helix V. We also observe conformational changes in the side chains of several important orthosteric pocket residues when comparing the structures of the LSD- and ERG-bound 5-HT2BR: T1142.64, E3637.36, and M2185.39 all change their rotamer states between the two structures (Figure 2A). These changes in rotamer states likely reflect distinct ligand-receptor interactions and an unexpected plasticity of the receptor for these structurally related compounds. For instance, in the 5-HT2BR/ERG complex, the phenyl moiety of ERG appears to “push” down on M2185.39, wedging the M2185.39 side chain between the peptide and ergoline moiety of ERG (Figure 2A) and thus contributing to the deeper seating of the ergoline moiety of ERG in the pocket versus that of LSD. In the 5-HT2BR/LSD complex, by contrast, the diethylamide ergoline substituent does not interact with M2185.39. As a result the M2185.39 side chain flips up, allowing more space for LSD to adopt a shallower binding mode. We also examined these differential binding modes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provided additional support for the hypothesis that the binding of LSD preserves the unliganded conformation of M2185.39, whereas binding of ERG distorts it. In MD simulations initiated from structures of either the ERG-bound or LSD-bound 5-HT2BR but with the ligand removed, the M2185.39 side chain consistently adopted an upward conformation matching that of the LSD-bound structure (Figure S3A). We performed over 100 μs of simulation (Table S1). The smaller amide substituent of LSD also accounts for an overall contraction of the extended binding site relative to the ERG-bound structure (Figure 2B). Specifically, we observe an inward movement of helices II (1.6 Å), VII (2.1 Å), and parts of EL2 (1.0 Å) and EL3 (1.8 Å) toward the seven transmembrane core, and a relocation of helix VI (1.0 Å) away from helix VII toward helix V and the membrane, which is likely a result of the inward movement of helix VII (Figure 2B). Indeed, when we calculated the size of the binding pockets in the 5-HT2BR/LSD and 5-HT2BR/ERG complexes with CASTp (Dundas et al., 2006Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J.

While the foveal and peripheral retina share a similar core circuit architecture, they exhibit profound functional differences whose mechanisms are unknown. Using intracellular recordings and structure-function analyses, we examined the cellular and synaptic underpinnings of the primate fovea. Compared to peripheral vision, the fovea displays decreased sensitivity to rapid variations in light inputs; this difference is reflected in the responses of ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina. Surprisingly, and unlike in the periphery, synaptic inhibition minimally shaped the responses of foveal midget ganglion cells. This difference in inhibition cannot however, explain the differences in the temporal sensitivity of foveal and peripheral midget ganglion cells. Instead, foveal cone photoreceptors themselves exhibited slower light responses than peripheral cones, unexpectedly linking cone signals to perceptual sensitivity."

The inner part of petrous bones and the cementum layer in teeth roots are currently recognized as the best substrates for such research. We present a comparative analysis of DNA preservation in these two substrates obtained from the same human skulls, across a range of different ages and preservation environments. Both substrates display significantly higher endogenous DNA content (average of 16.4% and 40.0% for teeth and petrous bones, respectively) than parietal skull bone (average of 2.2%). Despite sample-to-sample variation, petrous bone overall performs better than tooth cementum (p = 0.001). This difference, however, is driven largely by a cluster of viking skeletons from one particular locality, showing relatively poor molecular tooth preservation (<10% endogenous DNA). In the remaining skeletons there is no systematic difference between the two substrates. A crude preservation (good/bad) applied to each sample prior to DNA-extraction predicted the above/below 10% endogenous DNA threshold in 80% of the cases. Interestingly, we observe signficantly higher levels of cytosine to thymine deamination damage and lower proportions of mitochondrial/nuclear DNA in petrous bone compared to tooth cementum. Lastly, we show that petrous bones from ancient cremated individuals contain no measurable levels of authentic human DNA. Based on these findings we discuss the pros and cons of sampling the different elements."

Infections trigger stereotypical behavioral changes in the host including anorexia, fever, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, and changes in grooming, collectively referred to as “sickness behaviors” (Dantzer, 2009Dantzer R.

These behaviors have been proposed to be adaptive strategies to increase the chance of survival from acute illness (Exton, 1997Exton M.S.

Hutchings M.R. Towards a functional explanation for the occurrence of anorexia during parasitic infections.Anim. Behav. 1998; 56: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Animal studies have suggested that any benefits conferred by anorexia caused by infection are context dependent. In mice systemically infected with Listeria monocytogenes, animals that were force-fed succumbed to infection more rapidly than animals that were allowed to develop the anorexic response (Murray and Murray, 1979Murray M.J. Murray A.B. Anorexia of infection as a mechanism of host defense.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1979; 32: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, in Drosophila, anorexia was maladaptive for surviving an L. monocytogenes systemic infection (Ayres and Schneider, 2009Ayres J.S. Schneider D.S. The role of anorexia in resistance and tolerance to infections in Drosophila.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000150Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Because many biomedical practices interfere with sickness-induced behaviors, it is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to the induction of these behaviors and the contexts in which they are beneficial or detrimental for the host. Whether sickness-induced anorexia is beneficial for the host is largely dependent on how the fasted state functionally influences host resistance and tolerance defenses (Medzhitov et al., 2012Medzhitov R.

Acute starvation and diet restriction studies have primarily focused on how nutrition influences resistance mechanisms (Bedoyan et al., 1992Bedoyan J.K. Patil C.S. Kyriakides T.R. Spence K.D.

In contrast to expectations, food restriction had a negative impact on the outcome of infection for the host (Burger et al., 2007Burger J.M. Hwangbo D.S. Corby-Harris V. Promislow D.E.

However, in a fruit fly model, Drosophila that developed anorexia or were diet restricted during systemic Salmonella infection lived significantly longer despite equivalent pathogen levels compared to infected flies fed a normal diet (Ayres and Schneider, 2009Ayres J.S. Schneider D.S. The role of anorexia in resistance and tolerance to infections in Drosophila.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000150Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). More recently, anorexia promoted tolerance in mice infected with L. monocytogenes, indicating that in these contexts, the fasted state promoted tolerance defenses (Wang et al., 2016Wang A. Huen S.C. Luan H.H. Yu S. Zhang C. Gallezot J.D. Booth C.J. Medzhitov R. Opposing Effects of Fasting Metabolism on Tissue Tolerance in Bacterial and Viral Inflammation.Cell. 2016; 166: 1512-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Pathogens and the microbiota are dependent on energy intake of their hosts during infection. Whether anorexia will have a beneficial effect on host outcome will also likely be determined by how microbial virulence is affected under fasted states. The effects of anorexia on pathogen virulence have been most theorized as creating a less hospitable niche, starving pathogens from essential nutrients required for replication (Hart, 1988Hart B.L. Biological basis of the behavior of sick animals.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1988; 12: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Although anorexia may have some positive and undefined effects on inhibiting pathogen growth, it is equally plausible that the fasted state may trigger increased virulence by altering microbial behavior independent of any effects on microbial growth. Microbes vary in their metabolic capacity and foraging strategies to adjust to situations in which nutrients are scarce (Ayres, 2016Ayres J.S. Cooperative Microbial Tolerance Behaviors in Host-Microbiota Mutualism.Cell. 2016; 165: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Acute starvation in humans is associated with an increased risk of invasive bacterial infections (Page et al., 2013Page A.L. de Rekeneire N. Sayadi S. Aberrane S. Janssens A.C. Rieux C. Djibo A. Manuguerra J.C. Ducou-le-Pointe H. Grais R.F. et al.Infections in children admitted with complicated severe acute malnutrition in Niger.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e68699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While this increased risk has been assumed to be dependent on the poor immune status of the patient due to malnutrition (Gordon et al., 2012Gordon J.I. Dewey K.G. Mills D.A. Medzhitov R.M. The human gut microbiota and undernutrition.Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4: 137ps12Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it is possible that the increased invasiveness and virulence may potentially reflect an adaptive strategy of certain microbes under nutrient-limiting conditions. Thus, the discrepancies shown in previous studies regarding any benefits afforded by sickness-induced anorexia for the host may in part be due to microbe-induced behavioral changes caused by food-restricted conditions that lead to increased virulence of infecting pathogens, the resident microbiota, or both. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) is a gram-negative bacterium that causes enteric and systemic typhoid-like diseases in diverse animal models and humans. Upon oral infection in mice, ST penetrates the gut epithelial layer, typically by invasion of specialized epithelial cells called M cells (Monack et al., 2004Monack D.M. Mueller A. Falkow S. Persistent bacterial infections: the interface of the pathogen and the host immune system.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 747-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Once in the lamina propria (LP), bacteria are engulfed by innate immune cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, and infection induces the infiltration of T and B cells (Monack et al., 2004Monack D.M. Mueller A. Falkow S. Persistent bacterial infections: the interface of the pathogen and the host immune system.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 747-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The SPI-I type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and associated effectors are important for the gut stage of ST infection (Galán, 1996Galán J.E. Molecular genetic bases of Salmonella entry into host cells.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In adapted salmonellosis such as typhoid fever, with the aid of a second T3SS, SPI-2, and associated effectors (Hensel et al., 1998Hensel M. Shea J.E. Waterman S.R. Mundy R. Nikolaus T. Banks G. Vazquez-Torres A. Gleeson C. Fang F.C. Holden D.W. Genes encoding putative effector proteins of the type III secretion system of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 are required for bacterial virulence and proliferation in macrophages.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), the bacteria disseminate via the lymphatics and bloodstream to systemic organs, including the spleen and liver. The gut phase of salmonellosis in mice induces an anorexic response in the host (Schieber et al., 2015Schieber A.M. Lee Y.M. Chang M.W. Leblanc M. Collins B. Downes M. Evans R.M. Ayres J.S. Disease tolerance mediated by microbiome E. coli involves inflammasome and IGF-1 signaling.Science. 2015; 350: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and this pathogen can be transmitted to new mice via the fecal-oral route. As ST has evolved mechanisms to manipulate diverse physiological aspects of the mouse, a natural host of ST, it is an excellent pathogen to dissect the relationship among anorexia, host health, pathogen virulence, and transmission. Here, we examined how sickness-induced anorexia affected infection-induced lethality in a transmissible model of infection. We found that the ST effector, Salmonella leucine rich repeat protein (SlrP), negatively regulated virulence and promoted survival of the host by inhibiting the infection-induced anorexic response. We found that SlrP inhibited inflammasome activation and IL-1β maturation in the small intestine (SI), preventing the anorexic feeding program in the hypothalamus that is dependent on the vagus nerve. Failure to inhibit IL-1β and the anorexic response resulted in increased extra-intestinal dissemination and increased virulence of the pathogen but at the expense of pathogen transmission to new hosts. Our study provides mechanistic aspects for how local tissue response to microbes can signal to the brain to induce anorexia and demonstrates that microbes have evolved anti-virulence strategies that inhibit sickness-induced anorexia to promote host survival and pathogen transmission. In ongoing efforts to identify microbial factors that promote host health, we tested the importance of the ST effector, SlrP, in regulating host health during oral infection. SlrP is a member of the novel E3 ubiquitin ligases (NEL) class, a class of ubiquitin ligases that are encoded by some bacteria (Maculins et al., 2016Maculins T. Fiskin E. Bhogaraju S. Dikic I.

Immun. 1999; 67: 6385-6393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of NELs and other prokaryotic ubiquitin ligases is traditionally thought to promote virulence during infection (Maculins et al., 2016Maculins T. Fiskin E. Bhogaraju S. Dikic I. Bacteria-host relationship: ubiquitin ligases as weapons of invasion.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, because commensal bacteria and microbes that can colonize the host asymptomatically, including Salmonella species (Boyer and Lemichez, 2004Boyer L. Lemichez E. Targeting of host-cell ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like pathways by bacterial factors.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), also encode mechanisms to interact with the host ubiquitin system, we hypothesized that SlrP may be important for negatively regulating virulence. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 (B6) mice orally infected with an ST SL1344 strain deficient in slrP (ΔslrP) exhibited faster death kinetics than mice infected with the parental ST SL1344 strain (wild-type, WT) (Figure 1A). ΔslrP-infected animals exhibited a median time to death of 7 days post-infection, while ∼70% of mice infected with the parental strain were alive at day 10 post-infection (Figure 1A). The increased death kinetics of ΔslrP-infected mice were associated with increased weight loss (Figures 1B and 1C). We previously showed that ST infection in B6 mice causes wasting of lean and fat stores (Schieber et al., 2015Schieber A.M. Lee Y.M. Chang M.W. Leblanc M. Collins B. Downes M. Evans R.M. Ayres J.S. Disease tolerance mediated by microbiome E. coli involves inflammasome and IGF-1 signaling.Science. 2015; 350: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We found that, while ΔslrP-infected mice had slightly higher lean body mass (Figure 1D), they exhibited significantly more wasting of adipose tissue stores compared to WT-infected mice (Figure 1E). These data suggest that SlrP function is necessary for controlling ST virulence and sustaining health of the host during infection in vivo of B6 mice. We performed an in-depth metabolic characterization of infected animals using the Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) and found that mice infected with the ΔslrP strain exhibited differences in the rate of oxygen consumption (VO2, Figure S1A) and CO2 production (VCO2, Figure S1B), resulting in a decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) compared to mice infected with WT ST (Figure 2A). In agreement with increased wasting of adipose tissue, lower RER suggests that ΔslrP-infected mice preferentially utilize fat as an energy substrate, resulting in increased lipid oxidation and depletion of fat stores, while WT-infected mice with higher RER use carbohydrates as the preferential fuel source (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997Schmidt-Nielsen K. Animal physiology: adaptation and environment.Fifth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England; New York, NY, USA1997Google Scholar). We hypothesized that nutrient availability may be compromised in ΔslrP-infected mice due to the development of a more severe anorexic response in the absence of SlrP function. Consistent with our previous findings (Schieber et al., 2015Schieber A.M. Lee Y.M. Chang M.W. Leblanc M. Collins B. Downes M. Evans R.M. Ayres J.S. Disease tolerance mediated by microbiome E. coli involves inflammasome and IGF-1 signaling.Science. 2015; 350: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we found that mice infected with WT ST exhibited an anorexic response (Figure 2B). However, we found that ΔslrP-infected mice exhibited a more severe anorexic response compared to WT-infected mice that was apparent within the first 24 hr post-infection and became more severe by 24–48 hr post-infection (Figure 2B). Between 0–24 hr post-infection, ΔslrP-infected mice consumed ∼6% less food compared to WT infected animals, and this difference increased to ∼20% less food by 24–48 hr post-infection (Figure 2B). Expression of a WT copy of slrP under the native promoter in the ΔslrP mutant protected B6 mice from infection induced anorexia (Figures S1C and S1D). These data raise the possibility that the more severe anorexic response results from increased pathogen burden, indicating the ΔslrP strain may either grow faster, be cleared less efficiently than the parental strain, or both. However, we found that at both 0–24 and 24–48 hr post-infection—the time frames in which we observe the onset of the more severe anorexic response in ΔslrP-infected mice (Figure 2B)—the pathogen burdens in WT- and ΔslrP-infected mice were comparable in all target tissues of this pathogen (SI, cecum, colon, Peyer’s patches [PP], MLN, liver, and spleen) (Figure 2C). We further found that, at 48 hr post-infection, the percentage of hosts with an extraintestinal dissemination event to be identical between ΔslrP- and WT-infected B6 mice (Figure 2D). Another possibility is that ΔslrP infection induces perturbations in the intestinal microbiota, resulting in a more pathogenic microbiota that leads to increased anorexia. Similar to our findings with SPF mice, germ-free mice monoinfected orally with ΔslrP exhibited a more severe anorexic response compared to germ-free mice that were monoinfected orally with the parental strain (Figure 2E), consuming approximately 50% less food within the first 24 hr post infection. Thus, the more severe anorexic response observed in ΔslrP-infected mice is not due to increased pathogen burdens, differences in pathogen tissue tropism, dissemination, or differential responses of the intestinal microbiota. To determine if the host nutrient status was related to pathogen virulence, we compared infection of food-restricted WT-infected animals to that of WT-infected mice that were fed ad libitum. Food-restricted WT-infected mice exhibited increased wasting that was associated with increased death kinetics compared to WT-infected mice that were fed ad libitum (Figures 2F and 2G). This was specific to infection, as uninfected food-restricted animals exhibited no mortality (Figures S1E and S1F). We next tested whether force-feeding could dampen ΔslrP virulence in B6 mice. ΔslrP-infected mice force-fed a liquefied diet during infection were protected from weight loss and had increased survival comparable to that of WT-infected B6 mice fed ad libitum (Figures 2H and 2I). Taken together, our data suggest that reduced nutrient intake leads to increased virulence of ST oral infection. Since the protection against anorexia mediated by SlrP was neither due to regulation of pathogen burdens nor regulation of the pathogenicity of the intestinal microbiota, we hypothesized that SlrP interacts directly with host physiologies that negatively regulate the sickness-induced anorexic response and, in doing so, regulate ST virulence. Protection from anorexia without a change in pathogen infection levels suggests that SlrP can negatively regulate ST virulence through (1) the inhibition of host processes that promote the anorexic response or (2) through the induction of a disease tolerance mechanism that promotes feeding. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we asked how the absence of SlrP function during ST infection influences the canonical mediators of sickness-induced anorexia. Using the CLAMS monitoring system, we found equivalent activity levels between ΔslrP- and WT-infected mice, indicating that ΔslrP-infected mice are not more anorexic because they are less active during infection (Figure 3A). Although we found no difference in the systemic levels of pathogen between mice infected with either strain at the onset of the more severe anorexic response (0–24 and 24–48 hr), we considered the hypothesis that the absence of SlrP rendered ST more stimulatory of an anorexic response. However, systemic challenge of B6 mice with either ΔslrP or WT ST resulted in an equivalent degree of anorexia (Figure 3B), indicating that ΔslrP is not more stimulatory of an anorexic response when systemic. Consistent with this and our burden analyses (Figure 2C), we found no significant difference in the extent of tissue pathology in ST target tissues liver, spleen, and SI between mice infected with WT or ΔslrP ST (Figures 3C and S2A). Thus, SlrP does not inhibit anorexia by alleviating tissue damage in target organs of this pathogen. SlrP has been shown in in vitro assays to inhibit dendritic cell (DC) migration (McLaughlin et al., 2014McLaughlin L.M. Xu H. Carden S.E. Fisher S. Reyes M. Heilshorn S.C. Monack D.M. A microfluidic-based genetic screen to identify microbial virulence factors that inhibit dendritic cell migration.Integr. Biol. (Camb). 2014; 6: 438-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found no difference in the levels of DCs or other immune cells associated with ST infection or intestinal inflammation in the LP, MLNs, liver, or spleen between 0–24 and 24–48 hr post-infection, indicating that SlrP does not inhibit anorexia by limiting immune cell infiltration (Figures 3D, 3E, and S2B–S2H). Additionally, levels of TNFα and IL-6, cytokines that can modulate sickness-induced behavioral changes (Dantzer, 2009Dantzer R. Cytokine, sickness behavior, and depression.Immunol. Allergy Clin. North Am. 2009; 29: 247-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), in ST target tissues were not higher in ΔslrP-infected mice at 24 and 48 hr post-infection (Figures 3F, 3G, S2I, and data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that SlrP does not inhibit the anorexic response by alleviating the primary cause of disease (tissue damage), nor does it inhibit the induction of TNFα, the induction of IL-6, or immune cell infiltration during infection.Figure S2SlrP Modulates Feeding Behavior Independent of Cell Infiltration, Pathology, TNFα, or IL-6, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Histological scoring of spleen, liver, and ileum 72hr after oral infection of B6 mice with stated strain of S.

Systemic IL-1β is believed to be the predominant mediator of sickness-induced anorexia (Dantzer, 2009Dantzer R. Cytokine, sickness behavior, and depression.Immunol. Allergy Clin.

We did not detect any differences in the levels of serum, liver, or spleen IL-1β between ΔslrP- and WT-infected mice within the first 48 hr of infection (Figures 4A and S3A). We did, however, find significantly increased levels of IL-1β in the SI of ΔslrP-infected mice compared to WT-infected mice within the first 48 hr of infection, which correlates with the onset of the more severe anorexic response observed in these mice (Figure 4A). This increased IL-1β was specific to the SI because IL-1β levels of other tissues of the digestive tract including the stomach, cecum, colon, pancreas, PP, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) were not significantly different between WT and ΔslrP-infected mice (Figure S3B and data not shown). Expression of a WT copy of slrP under the native promoter in the ΔslrP mutant prevented increased levels of IL-1β in the SI of infected mice (Figures S1D and S3C).Figure S3SlrP Modulates Feeding Behavior by Regulating Inflammasome Activation and IL-1β Maturation, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) L"

We developed an integrative approach to reconstruct the 3D architecture of protein complexes in vivo. We applied this approach to the exocyst, a hetero-octameric complex of unknown structure that is thought to tether secretory vesicles during exocytosis with a poorly understood mechanism. We engineered yeast cells to anchor the exocyst on defined landmarks and determined the position of its subunit termini at nanometer precision using fluorescence microscopy. We then integrated these positions with the structural properties of the subunits to reconstruct the exocyst together with a vesicle bound to it. The exocyst has an open hand conformation made of rod-shaped subunits that are interlaced in the core. The exocyst architecture explains how the complex can tether secretory vesicles, placing them in direct contact with the plasma membrane."

We developed a non-invasive survey method based on environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect the presence of the red-listed cave-dwelling amphibian, Proteus anguinus, in the caves of the Dinaric Karst. We tested the method in fifteen caves in Croatia, from which the species was previously recorded or expected to occur. We successfully confirmed the presence of P. anguinus from ten caves and detected the species for the first time in five others. Using a hierarchical occupancy model we compared the availability and detection probability of eDNA of two water sampling methods, filtration and precipitation. The statistical analysis showed that both availability and detection probability depended on the method and estimates for both probabilities were higher using filter samples than for precipitation samples. Combining reliable field and laboratory methods with robust statistical modeling will give the best estimates of species occurrence."

We showed previously that Rab8a recruits PI3Kγ for Akt-dependent signaling during TLR4 activation to limit the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 while enhancing the release of the regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Here we broaden the array of immune receptors controlled by Rab8a-PI3Kγ and further define the Rab-mediated membrane domains required for signaling. With CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to stably knock out and recover Rab8a in macrophage cell lines, we match Akt signaling profiles with cytokine outputs, confirming that Rab8a is a novel regulator of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway downstream of multiple TLRs. Upon developing a Rab8a activation assay, we show that TLR3 and 9 agonists also activate Rab8a. Live-cell imaging reveals that Rab8a is first recruited to the plasma membrane and dorsal ruffles, but it is retained during collapse of ruffles to form macropinosomes enriched for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), suggesting that the macropinosome is the location where Rab8a is active. We pinpoint macropinosomes as the sites for Rab8-mediated biasing of inflammatory signaling responses via inducible production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, Rab8a and PI3Kγ are positioned in multiple TLR pathways, and this signaling axis may serve as a pharmacologically tractable target during infection and inflammation.

Bowie A.G. The family of five: TIR-domain-containing adaptors in Toll-like receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). Members of this family respond to molecular signatures of different pathogens, and the ensuing signaling and transcriptional responses are required to mount frontline innate immune defenses to help fight infection. These responses include the expression and secretion of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines and chemokines (2Stow J.L. Murray R.Z. Intracellular trafficking and secretion of inflammatory cytokines.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2013; 24: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms serve to tailor the signaling output of TLR pathways toward immune responses against different types of pathogens. The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptors at the plasma membrane as well as in endosomes or phagosomes provide spatiotemporal control of TLR signaling (3Leifer C.A. Medvedev A.E. Molecular mechanisms of regulation of Toll-like receptor signaling.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2016; 100: 927-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For example, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and MyD88-adapter-like (Mal) couple with TLR4 at the cell surface, whereas TRIF and TRAM generate signaling from endosomal compartments in response to LPS (4Rossol M. Heine H. Meusch U. Quandt D. Klein C. Sweet M.J. Hauschildt S. LPS-induced cytokine production in human monocytes and macrophages.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 31: 379-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other TLR family members have thus far been shown to only signal from either the cell surface or from endosomal compartments. Viral and host double-stranded RNAs activate TLR3 (with TRIF) (5Vercammen E. Staal J. Beyaert R. Sensing of viral infection and activation of innate immunity by Toll-like receptor 3.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 21: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), whereas endosomal non-methylated CpG DNA motifs activate TLR9 (with MyD88) to signal from endosomal compartments (6Bonham K.S.

Class 1A PI3Ks contribute to signaling downstream of TLRs. We revealed previously that the class1B PI3Kγ regulates Akt/mTOR signaling downstream of LPS-activated TLR4 (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C.

Unusually, the GTPase Rab8a recruits the PI3Kγ catalytic subunit (p110γ) to membranes for this role in TLR4 signaling. Activation of Rab8a and PI3Kγ constrains the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 while enhancing the release of IFNβ and IL-10 (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D.

Rab8a interacts directly with PI3Kγ to modulate TLR4-driven PI3K and mTOR signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rab8a is initially recruited to the membranes of dorsal ruffles on the macrophage cell surface, where the TLR4-Mal-MyD88 complex is also located (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D. Norwood S.J.

Dorsal ruffles collapse to form macropinosomes or contribute to the formation of phagosomes for the uptake of fluid phase solutes or pathogens and particles, respectively (10Patel P.C. Harrison R.E.

TLR4 in ruffles is poised for incorporation into membranes of endosomal compartments, where a change in the signaling adaptors to TRAM and TRIF facilitates the distinct switch in signaling and gene expression outputs (7Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Given the spatial and temporal coupling between cell surface dorsal ruffles and endocytic pathways and the distribution of signaling sites for TLR family members across these membrane domains, here we explored the potential for Rab8a to recruit PI3Kγ for regulation of additional TLR pathways. Traditionally, the leukocyte-specific PI3Kγ has been viewed as a regulator downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G protein-coupled receptor pathways, where its most prominent role is in chemotactic recruitment of cells to sites of inflammation (13Vadas O.

Exploring other members of the TLR family will thus demonstrate the spectrum of exogenous pathogen-derived and endogenous host-derived danger signals that induce PI3Kγ-mediated signaling. Here we examine the role of the Rab8a-PI3Kγ axis in skewing macrophage inflammatory responses downstream of multiple TLRs. We previously showed that Rab8a recruits PI3Kγ for Akt/mTOR signaling downstream of LPS-activated TLR4 (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D. Norwood S.J. Schoenwaelder S. Chen K.W. Jackson S. Jenkins B.J. Hartland E.L. Schroder K. Collins B.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Rab8a interacts directly with PI3Kγ to modulate TLR4-driven PI3K and mTOR signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TLR3 and 9 signal as endosomal receptors (4Rossol M. Heine H. Meusch U. Quandt D. Klein C. Sweet M.J. Hauschildt S. LPS-induced cytokine production in human monocytes and macrophages.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 31: 379-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and here we compared the ability of TLR3, 4, and 9 agonists to activate Rab8a (Fig. 1). A GST fusion protein comprised of the Rab binding domain from the PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase OCRL, another Rab8 effector protein (17Hagemann N. Hou X. Goody R.S. Itzen A. Erdmann K.S. Crystal structure of the Rab binding domain of OCRL1 in complex with Rab8 and functional implications of the OCRL1/Rab8 module for Lowe syndrome.Small GTPases. 2012; 3: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was used for pulldowns of the active, GTP-bound Rab8a from macrophage extracts. The assay was calibrated using extracts preloaded with exogenous GDP or GTP at different concentrations (Fig. 1, A and B). Pulldowns from cells treated with TLR agonists for 0, 2, 10, and 60 min show rapid activation of Rab8a (Fig. 1C). Both LPS/TLR4 and poly(I:C)/TLR3 result in an ∼2.5-fold increase in active Rab8a 10 min post-stimulation, whereas the TLR9 agonist CpG DNA (CpG) caused a more modest but sustained activation of Rab8a over 60 min. Thus, multiple TLR agonists activate Rab8a. In its active, GTP-bound form, Rab8a should recruit effectors, and indeed, GFP-Rab8a immunoprecipitates its effector PI3Kγ in response to all three TLR agonists (Fig. 1D). These results reveal that activation of Rab8a downstream of TLR4, 3, or 9 results in recruitment of PI3Kγ, suggesting a broader role for this GTPase-PI3K complex in diverse TLR pathways. We showed previously that Rab8a is initially enriched on membranes of dorsal ruffles at the cell surface (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D. Norwood S.J. Schoenwaelder S. Chen K.W. Jackson S. Jenkins B.J. Hartland E.L. Schroder K. Collins B.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Rab8a interacts directly with PI3Kγ to modulate TLR4-driven PI3K and mTOR signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and now show in live cells that these domains are sites where the dorsal ruffles close over into circular macropinosomes (Fig. 2A). These are confirmed to be genuine macropinosomes because they are found loaded with dextran and are not detected by post-fixation wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which does not access fully closed macropinosomes (Fig. 2B). Hence, although Rab8a is initially in ruffle membranes, it is then found enriched in macropinosomes. Co-expression of Rab8a with other endosomal markers shows that GFP-Rab8a does not overlap with mCherry-Rab5a on small punctate early endosomes in live cells, whereas time-lapse analysis of macropinosomes reveals the conversion of the membrane from Rab8a-enriched to Rab5a as the macropinosome matures (Fig. 2C). Finally, tdTomato-Rab8a was coexpressed with markers that cycle between recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane, namely transferrin (Tfn-647) and GFP-VAMP3 (Fig. 2D). In triple-labeled, fixed cells, there is significant overlap between VAMP3 and Tfn but little overlap with Rab8a. This is further highlighted on line scans showing that Rab8a peak fluorescence is at the plasma membrane and macropinosomes (Fig. 2D, i) while being offset from recycling endosome markers (Fig. 2D, ii). We can thus conclude that, in macrophages, Rab8a is most prominent on dorsal ruffle membranes and early macropinosomes. The conversion of dorsal ruffles to macropinosomes is also accompanied by a transition in phosphoinositides from plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2, which is converted to PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (11Welliver T.P. Swanson J.A. A growth factor signaling cascade confined to circular ruffles in macrophages.Biol. Open. 2012; 1: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Yoshida S. Hoppe A.D. Araki N. Swanson J.A. Sequential signaling in plasma-membrane domains during macropinosome formation in macrophages.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3250-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This spatiotemporal control of phosphoinositides can influence TLR signaling in two ways: the TLR adaptor Mal dissociates from membranes (and TLRs) when PI(4,5)P2 is depleted from endocytic membranes (7Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and enhanced PI(3,4,5)P3 is the first step in the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway (19Vanhaesebroeck B. Stephens L. Hawkins P. PI3K signalling: the path to discovery and understanding.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). This transition can be tracked in live cells with plasmid-encoded fluorescent phosphoinositide probes such as PH-PLCδ-GFP, which recognizes PI(4,5)P2, and the PH domain from Akt, which recognizes both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Coexpressed Rab8a is first present on PI(4,5)P2-containing ruffles that close over into circular macropinosomes that then lose PI(4,5)P2 during scission from the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). Rab8a is retained on membranes as they acquire PI(3,4,5)P3, peaking in intensity alongside Akt-PH-GFP in early macropinosomes (Fig. 3B). Finally, Rab8a labeling dissociates as the membranes accumulate early endosome-associated PI(3)P, which is recognized by 2xFYVE-mCherry on more mature macropinosomes (Fig. 3C), and Rab5a, which is responsible for the production of PI(3)P (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the enrichment of Rab8a in newly forming signaling macropinosomes. Live-cell imaging of full-length GFP-Akt additionally designates these early dorsal ruffles and macropinosomes as the site of Akt recruitment to macropinosomes (supplemental Fig. S2). The results obtained with the Akt-PH probe (Fig. 3B) and full-length proteins (supplemental Fig. S2) thus indicate that Rab8a is enriched at signaling domains along with PI(3,4,5)P3 and Akt. Rab8a and Akt enrichment in early macropinosomes is relevant to this compartment as a locale for TLR-driven PI3K signaling. Accordingly, Rab8a colocalizes both with Mal on ruffles and newly forming macropinosomes in addition to the TLR adaptor for endosomal signaling, TRAM (Fig. 3, D and E). Therefore, Rab8a is on membranes that are positioned to support signaling from TLRs 4, 3, and 9, which act at both the cell surface and/or only in endosomes (20Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. A cell biological view of Toll-like receptor function: regulation through compartmentalization.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To further explore roles for Rab8a in TLR signaling, we developed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Rab8a knockout cell lines from RAW 264.7 cells. Instead of isolation and expansion of clonal populations with insertion or deletion (INDEL) mutations, we used homologous recombination to disrupt the first intron of Rab8a using a neomycin expression cassette (supplemental Fig. S1). This is of particular importance in maintaining a large heterogeneous population of cells in the RAW 264.7 cell line. After selection, Rab8a protein expression was undetectable in KO cells, whereas expression of Rab8b was unaffected (supplemental Fig. S1D). Using these Rab8a CRISPR KO cell lines, Akt phosphorylation was assessed over a time course in cells treated with LPS, CpG, or poly(I:C) (Fig. 4A). Representative gels and densitometry analysis revealed that, at early time points, there is a >50% decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt in response to all three agonists compared with controls. This early defect in Akt phosphorylation is recovered at later time points in Rab8a KO cells. The decrease in p-Akt levels was the major pathway affected by Rab8a depletion compared with the more subtle decrease in phosphorylation of Erk1/2 observed after activation of TLR4, 3, and 9 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3A). Thus, loss of Rab8a impairs TLR4, 3, and 9-mediated activation of Akt. To address the possibility of off-target effects, Rab8a recovery cell lines were generated by stably expressing exogenous V5-tagged Rab8a to restore Rab8a expression in the CRISPR/Cas9 Rab8a KO cells to almost wild-type levels (supplemental Fig. S3B, exo-Rab8). As matched controls, V5-empty vector was used in both control and KO cells. Re-expression of Rab8a in all cases restored TLR-inducible Akt activation (Fig. 4B), further supporting the conclusion that Rab8a positively regulates Akt signaling downstream of TLR4, 3, and 9. Having shown previously that PI3Kγ is the Rab8a effector that modulates Akt/mTOR signaling in response to LPS/TLR4 (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D. Norwood S.J. Schoenwaelder S. Chen K.W. Jackson S. Jenkins B.J. Hartland E.L. Schroder K. Collins B.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Rab8a interacts directly with PI3Kγ to modulate TLR4-driven PI3K and mTOR signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we next used BMMs from p110γ catalytic subunit knock-out mice (PI3Kγ−/−) to compare TLR-mediated signaling events. Phospho-Akt levels are markedly decreased in PI3Kγ−/− BMMs after challenge with LPS, as identified previously (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D. Norwood S.J. Schoenwaelder S. Chen K.W. Jackson S. Jenkins B.J. Hartland E.L. Schroder K. Collins B.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Rab8a interacts directly with PI3Kγ to modulate TLR4-driven PI3K and mTOR signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Representative densitometry analysis of Akt phosphorylation in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C) or CpG reveal that this response is reduced at early time points (Fig. 5, A and B), reflecting the result obtained after depletion of Rab8a. The downstream influence of this delay in Akt phosphorylation in PI3Kγ−/− BMMs was assessed by phosphorylation analysis of the Akt substrate PRAS40, mTOR, and one of its substrates, p70S6K. Overall, delayed or reduced Akt phosphorylation results in reduced levels of PRAS40 across all TLR pathways (Fig. 5A). Other responses show some divergence between TLR pathways. Phosphorylation of mTOR and its substrate p70S6K are decreased after LPS and poly(I:C) stimulation but not in CpG-stimulated cells. Interestingly, this is reflected in decreased phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor by LPS and poly(I:C), which is indirectly downstream of p70S6K (21Turnquist H.R. Cardinal J. Macedo C. Rosborough B.R. Sumpter T.L. Geller D.A. Metes D. Thomson A.W. mTOR and GSK-3 shape the CD4+ T-cell stimulatory and differentiation capacity of myeloid DCs after exposure to LPS.Blood. 2010; 115: 4758-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PI3Kγ−/− BMMs showed only a very modest enhancement of LPS-induced p65 phosphorylation at 15 min post-stimulation, suggesting that NF-κB activation is not a major target of this kinase downstream of TLR engagement. Finally, in PI3Kγ−/− BMMs, there is a modest increase in TLR-inducible Erk1/2 phosphorylation compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S4A). Based on these results, we conclude that Rab8a-recruited PI3Kγ contributes to Akt signaling downstream of not only TLR4 but also of TLR3 and 9. Moreover, this signaling module appears to be particularly important for mTOR activation downstream of TLR4 and 3 in comparison with TLR9. We reported previously that loss of PI3Kγ impaired neither LPS-induced macropinocytosis nor the internalization of TLR4 itself (9Luo L. Wall A.A. Yeo J.C. Condon N.D. Norwood S.J. Schoenwaelder S. Chen K.W. Jackson S. Jenkins B.J. Hartland E.L. Schroder K. Collins B.M. Sweet M.J. Stow J.L. Rab8a interacts directly with PI3Kγ to modulate TLR4-driven PI3K and mTOR signalling.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we show that Rab8a-deficient and PI3Kγ−/− macrophages exhibit comparable levels of dextran loading compared with control cells (supplemental Fig. S5). Therefore, although Rab8a and PI3Kγ are recruited to membranes undergoing macropinocytosis, they do not influence this process per se but, rather, contribute specifically to enhancing the signaling environment of the membrane subdomains, which results in enhanced phosphorylation of Akt from macropinosomes. TLR signaling directs transcriptional programs of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. In PI3Kγ−/− BMMs, LPS stimulation results in increased secretion of proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-12p40 and reduced secretion of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig. 5C). CpG stimulation revealed similar patterns for the proinflammatory response; however, there are no differences in IL-10 secretion between PI3Kγ−/− and WT macrophages (Fig. 5C). In contrast, in response to poly(I:C) stimulation, IL-12p40 secretion was similar in PI3Kγ−/− and WT macrophages, whereas IL-10 secretion was markedly reduced (Fig. 5C). IL-6 secretion in response to poly(I:C) was not detectable under these experimental conditions. Thus, altered signaling in PI3Kγ−/− cells changes cytokine outputs from the endosomal TLRs but with variable effects on the inflammatory response. Therefore, Rab8a-recruited PI3Kγ is required for Akt/mTOR signaling and inflammatory cytokine responses generated by both plasma membrane-initiated TLR4 as well as endosomal TLR3 and 9. This highlights the early macropinosome and the associated Rab8a-PI3Kγ complex as major functional components that dictate the cytokine program initiated during TLR activation. As PI3Ks are known to have both enzymatic and scaffolding functions in vivo (22Damilano F. Perino A. Hirsch E. PI3K kinase and scaffold functions in heart.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2010; 1188: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we inhibited the function of PI3Kγ using the γ-selective inhibitor AS605240. As this inhibitor is only 7.5-fold more selective for PI3Kγ than PI3Kα, we performed a titration of AS605240 in BMMs derived from PI3Kγ−/− mice that were stimulated with CSF-1. The results from the AS605240 titration experiment show that the optimal concentration for the inhibitor is 1 μm, whereas, at higher concentrations of 10 and 20 μm, the inhibitor showed significant off-target effects (supplemental Fig. S4B). Next, we examined the phosphorylation of Akt in response to LPS and CpG in both mouse macrophages and in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) (Fig. 6, A–D). In keeping with the effects of genetic ablation of PI3Kγ, pharmacologic inhibition decreases the phosphorylation of Akt in response to LPS and CpG in both mouse and human cells. This supports an active kinase function for PI3Kγ in modulating Akt signaling in macropinosomes during TLR-induced activation of macrophages. We also examined the downstream cytokine responses to LPS in human cells using both primary HMDMs (Fig. 6) and a human cell line (supplemental Fig. S4C) to monitor regulated gene expression. Inhibition of PI3Kγ with AS605240 results in a significant increase in mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 in response to LPS compared with cells treated with DMSO (Fig. 6E). In contrast, mRNA levels of IL-10 are significantly suppressed in AS605240-treated cells at every time point analyzed. This supports our previous findings in mouse macrophages, thus demonstratin"
https://openalex.org/W2581411608,"North Africa experienced dramatic changes in hydrology and vegetation during the late Quaternary driven by insolation-induced shifts of the tropical rain belt and further modulated by millennial-scale droughts and vegetation-climate feedbacks. While most past proxy and modelling studies concentrated on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the last African humid period, little is known about the intensities and characteristics of pre-Holocene humid periods. Here we present a high-resolution record of fine-grained eastern Saharan dust from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea spanning the last 180 kyr, which is based on the clay mineral composition of the marine sediments, especially the kaolinite/chlorite ratio. Minimum aeolian kaolinite transport occurred during the African Humid Periods because kaolinite deflation was hampered by increased humidity and vegetation cover. Instead, kaolinite weathering from kaolinite-bearing Cenozoic rocks was stored in lake basins, river beds and soils during these periods. During the subsequent dry phases, fine-grained dust was mobilised from the desiccated lakes, rivers and soils resulting in maximum aeolian uptake and transport of kaolinite. The kaolinite transport decreased again when these sediment sources exhausted. We conclude that the amount of clay-sized dust blown out of the Sahara into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is proportional to the intensity of the kaolinite weathering and accumulation in soils and lake sediments, and thus to the strength of the preceding humid period. These humid periods provided the windows for the migration of modern humans out of Africa, as postulated previously. The strongest humid period occurred during the Eemian and was followed by two weaker phases centred at ca. 100 ka and ca. 80 ka."

Flooding is a central component of hurricane exposure, influencing mental health through multiple pathways that unfold over months after flooding recedes. Here we assess the concordance in self-reported and Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) flood exposure after Hurricane Sandy and determine the associations between flooding and anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Self-reported flood data and mental health symptoms were obtained through validated questionnaires from New York City and Long Island residents (N = 1231) following Sandy. Self-reported flood data was compared to FEMA data obtained from the FEMA Modeling Task Force Hurricane Sandy Impact Analysis. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine the relationship between flooding exposure and mental health outcomes. There were significant discrepancies between self-reported and FEMA flood exposure data. Self-reported dichotomous flooding was positively associated with anxiety (ORadj: 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1–1.9]), depression (ORadj: 1.7 [1.3–2.2]), and PTSD (ORadj: 2.5 [1.8–3.4]), while self-reported continuous flooding was associated with depression (ORadj: 1.1 [1.01–1.12]) and PTSD (ORadj: 1.2 [1.1–1.2]). Models with FEMA dichotomous flooding (ORadj: 2.1 [1.5–2.8]) or FEMA continuous flooding (ORadj: 1.1 [1.1–1.2]) were only significantly associated with PTSD. Associations between mental health and flooding vary according to type of flood exposure measure utilized. Future hurricane preparedness and recovery efforts must integrate micro and macro-level flood exposures in order to accurately determine flood exposure risk during storms and realize the long-term importance of flooding on these three mental health symptoms."

Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E), also known as thymic shared antigen 1 (TSA-1), stem cell antigen 2 (SCA-2), and retinoic acid-induced gene E (RIG-E), is an IFN-inducible protein belonging to the Ly-6/uPAR family, whose members share structural and functional similarities. The C terminus of this family protein contains a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which allows them to attach to the lipid raft microdomain of the plasma membrane, critical for their biological functions. LY6E was initially characterized as a thymocyte marker that discriminates between immature and mature T cell subsets because its expression inversely correlates with T cell receptor (TCR/CD3) (5Godfrey D.I.

However, other studies demonstrated that the susceptibility of mice to mouse adenovirus type 1 is partially determined by one or more members of the LY6 family (18Stier M.T. Spindler K.R.

The role of LY6E in HIV-1 infection has remained murky. A whole-genome analysis identified a SNP, rs2572886, in the LY6/uPAR family that is associated with susceptibility to HIV-1, possibly because of increased LY6E expression (23Loeuillet C. Deutsch S. Ciuffi A. Robyr D. Taffé P. Muñoz M. Beckmann J.S. Antonarakis S.E. Telenti A. In vitro whole-genome analysis identifies a susceptibility locus for HIV-1.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that HIV-1 infection in human PBMCS induces LY6E expression, which, in turn, promotes HIV-1 replication. Mechanistically, we find that LY6E enhances HIV-1 entry and gene expression. Our work reveals a positive role of LY6E in HIV-1 infection, which could have implications for AIDS pathogenesis. Viral infection often triggers the host innate immune response, leading to the production of type I IFN and downstream effectors. We examined whether HIV-1 infection in human PBMCs can induce type I IFN production and LY6E expression. We infected phytohemagglutinin/IL2-activated PBMCs with HIV-1 NL4.3 bearing VSV-G for a period of 48 h and quantified the mRNA levels of LY6E and representative ISGs by qRT-PCR. We observed that HIV-1 infection up-regulated the expression of IFN-β, LY6E, and ISG15 after 24 h of infection and continued to increase at 48 h (Fig. 1, A–C). Of note, the CXCL10 level, which is normally induced by IFN-γ, did not show apparent change following HIV-1 infection (Fig. 1D), similar to a previous report (24Wetzel M.A. Steele A.D. Henderson E.E. Rogers T.J. The effect of X4 and R5 HIV-1 on C, C-C, and C-X-C chemokines during the early stages of infection in human PBMCs.Virology. 2002; 292: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We noted that the up-regulation of IFN-β, LY6E, and ISG15 correlated with the expression of HIV-1 Gag in infected cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that HIV infection likely triggers a type I response and, therefore, induces LY6E expression in activated human PBMCs. To confirm this latter effect, we treated PBMCs with interferon α receptor-neutralizing antibody (α-IFNRA1) for 24 h (10 μg/ml) and observed that the expression of IFN-β, ISG15, and LY6E induced by HIV-1 infection was completely abolished (data not shown), suggesting that LY6E induction following HIV-1 infection is indeed IFN signaling-dependent. We next examined the role of endogenous LY6E in HIV-1 infection. To this end, we transduced activated human PBMCs with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against LY6E or control shRNA, either in the presence or absence of IFN-α, and infected these cells with HIV-1 NL4.3-bearing VSV-G (to increase the infection efficiency of the first round) for a total of 55 h; intracellular p24, HIV-1 production, as well as the infectivity of newly produced virions were measured. No deleterious effect on cell proliferation was observed in LY6E shRNA-transduced cells compared with control shRNA (data not shown). The knockdown efficiency of LY6E was confirmed by flow cytometry using an anti-LY6E antibody, showing that both shRNA clones (LY6E-C1 and C2) reduced LY6E expression in the cell (Fig. 2A) (mean florescence intensity in the absence of IFN: 3950 for control shRNA, 1477 for shRNA LY6E-C1, and 1518 for shRNA LY6E-C2). Interestingly, we noticed that treatment of cells with IFN-α2b modestly up-regulated LY6E expression in PBMCs (∼20% increase based on geometric mean measurements) (Fig. 2A, see mean florescence intensity in the legend), possibly because of the mixed target cell populations treated and other experimental conditions. In the absence of IFN-α, knockdown of LY6E decreased the intracellular p24 level of HIV-1 by 30–50%; similar extents of decrease of HIV-1 infection were noticed in IFN-α-treated LY6E knockdown cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Release of newly produced HIV-1 virions was measured by an RT assay, showing that knockdown of LY6E decreased HIV-1 production by 20–50% compared with cells expressing control shRNA, regardless of IFN-α treatment (Fig. 2D). The same virus stocks with equivalent amounts were also used to infect indicator HeLa-TZM cells, which showed similar extents of inhibition in shRNA LY6E knockdown cells, suggesting that LY6E does not appear to change the HIV-1 infectivity, at least in human PBMCs (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these data imply that endogenous LY6E supports HIV-1 infection in primary human PBMCs. To determine whether LY6E plays a role in prolonged HIV-1 replication or cell-cell spread, we generated two SupT1 stable cell lines expressing shRNA LY6E (LY6E shRNA-C1 and C2, respectively). We first confirmed the knockdown efficiency of LY6E in these cells by qRT-PCR, showing that LY6E expression in both cell lines was reduced, i.e. ∼20% and ∼60% for C1 and C2, respectively (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometric analysis showed that LY6E protein on the cell surface was also decreased by shRNA (Fig. 4E without PI-PLC; mean florescence intensity: 5301 for control shRNA, 4199 for shRNA LY6E-C1, and 2788 for shRNA LY6E-C2, respectively). In the short-term replication assay (48 h), we infected these cells with NL4.3 bearing VSV-G and observed an ∼70–80% decrease in HIV-1 production by LY6E knockdown, as measured by RT assay, either in the presence or absence of IFN-α treatment (Fig. 3B). We noted that the knockdown efficiency of LY6E was relatively low, and it did not perfectly correlate with its inhibition of HIV-1 infection. For long-term HIV-1 replication, we infected these SupT1 cells with 5 ng of p24 HIV-1 NL4.3 (wild-type) and collected newly released virions every 2 days. As shown in Fig. 3C, knockdown of LY6E shifted the HIV-1 infection peak from 7 days to 11 or 13 days post-infection, showing that knockdown of LY6E slows HIV-1 replication and implying that endogenous LY6E promotes HIV-1 spread and replication.FIGURE 4Depletion of LY6E in SupT1 cells decreases HIV-1 entry. A, entry of infectious HIV-1 bearing NL4.3 Env or VSV-G was determined by using the BlaM-Vpr assay. B, entry of HIV-1 lentiviral pseudotypes bearing HIV-1 Env or VSV-G was determined by using the pLenti-puro-GFP vector. In both cases, SupT1 cells stably expressing shRNA control or LY6E were used as target cells for infection. C and D, representative flow cytometric profiles of pLenti-puro-GFP infection.

We primarily focused on viral entry because LY6E is a GPI-anchored protein and is expressed on the plasma membrane. We infected the stable SupT1 cell lines expressing shRNA LY6E with HIV-1 BlaM-Vpr virions bearing either NL4.3 Env or VSV-G and determined the viral uptake by flow cytometry. Although viral entry mediated by NL4.3 Env was decreased in LY6E knockdown cell lines, i.e. by ∼20% to 50%, VSV-G-mediated HIV-1 entry was unaffected (Fig. 4A). Similar results were also obtained in a single-round HIV-1 infection assay using an HIV-1 lentiviral vector encoding GFP (pLenti-puro-GFP) bearing NL4.3 Env or VSV-G (Fig. 4, B–D). We next treated SupT1 cells with phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), a chemical that is known to cleave GPI-anchored proteins on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4E). We observed that, although PI-PLC generally reduced HIV-1 entry, the inhibitory effect of LY6E knockdown on HIV-1 entry, but not that of VSV, disappeared (Fig. 4, F and G). Altogether, these results indicate that LY6E specifically promotes HIV-1 but not VSV entry and that the surface expression of LY6E is critical for this functional effect. To dissect in detail the steps of HIV-1 entry possibly affected by LY6E, we next used HIV-iGFP, an infectious NL4.3 clone that contains an internal GFP within Gag (25Hübner W. Chen P. Del Portillo A. Liu Y. Gordon R.E. Chen B.K. Sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag localization and oligomerization monitored with live confocal imaging of a replication-competent, fluorescently tagged HIV-1.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12596-12607Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and examined HIV-1 binding and trafficking in target cells expressing shRNA LY6E. We incubated the purified HIV-iGFP virions with SupT1 cells at 4 °C for 2 h, and, following extensive wash of unbound virions, flow cytometry was carried out to quantify the GFP fluorescence signal on the cell surface; Env-deficient HIV-iGFP particles served as a negative control. However, we did not observe any significant differences between control and shRNA LY6E-expressing cells in HIV-iGFP virion binding (Fig. 5A). To confirm this result, we infected the SupT1 cells with WT NL4.3 and measured the Env binding to soluble CD4 (CD4-Ig) on the cell surface. Note that the amounts of HIV-1 virions used were adjusted for infection to ensure that the gp120 expression on the cell surface would be comparable between control and shRNA LY6E cells. Again, we found no difference in soluble CD4 binding (Fig. 5, B and C). The expression levels of CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4 on the surfaces of these target cells were examined, showing no apparent differences between shRNA control and shRNA LY6E cells (Fig. 5D). Although Env-CD4 binding does not exactly mimic the virus-cell binding, the result showed that LY6E does not affect the Env-CD4 interaction on the cell surface. We next examined whether the entry kinetics and/or membrane fusion of HIV-1 are affected by LY6E. Following extensive washes of unbound virions, we shifted the HIV-iGFP-cell complex to 37 °C for various periods of time to allow viral uptake into target cells. At each time point, non-internalized HIV-1 virions on the cell surface were removed by trypsin, and cells were examined for GFP signals of internalized viral particle by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5E, HIV-1 uptake appeared to plateau in shRNA control cells after 60 min of the temperature switch, but there was an ∼50% reduction in LY6E knockdown cells compared with the control (Fig. 5E). We then performed a cell-cell fusion assay to determine whether HIV-1 fusion is influenced by LY6E. To this end, we cotransfected the HIV-1 Tat and Env derived from either BH10, NL4.3, or AD8 strains into HEK293T effector cells and cocultured these cells with target HeLa-TZM cells stably expressing shRNA LY6E or control shRNA for 16 h; cell-cell fusion was quantified by measuring the firefly luciferase activity. Despite the relatively low knockdown efficiency of LY6E in HeLa-TZM cells (around 10–20%) based on qPCR (data not shown), we observed a 2- to 3-fold reduction in Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, particularly for shRNA-C2 HeLa-TZM cells (Fig. 5F). Note that, in these experiments, we used Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) Env, which is known not to render fusion in HeLa-TZM cells because of the lack of a functional Hyal2 receptor, as a negative control (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results indicate that HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion is impaired in LY6E knockdown cells. Given that GPI-anchored proteins are normally present in lipid rafts, which are known to modulate some viral fusion and entry, we next investigated the stage of fusion, in particular whether hemifusion of HIV-1 Env is impaired in LY6E knockdown cells. We treated cocultured cells for 1 min with 0.5 mm chlorpromazine (CPZ), a chemical that is known to promote transition of hemifusion to complete fusion (26Melikyan G.B. Brener S.A. Ok D.C. Cohen F.S. Inner but not outer membrane leaflets control the transition from glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored influenza hemagglutinin-induced hemifusion to full fusion.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Li K. Markosyan R.M. Zheng Y.-M. Golfetto O. Bungart B. Li M. Ding S. He Y. Liang C. Lee J.C. Gratton E. Cohen F.S. Liu S.-L. IFITM proteins restrict viral membrane hemifusion.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003124Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We observed that CPZ largely rescued HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion in LY6E knockdown cells (Fig. 5G), suggesting that LY6E does not influence the creation of hemifusion but, likely, steps after hemifusion. To determine the possible post-entry steps of HIV-1 infection that are affected by LY6E, we utilized an Env-defective NL4.3-based HIV-1 vector (NL4.3-KFS) (28Freed E.O. Englund G. Martin M.A. Role of the basic domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 matrix in macrophage infection.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which allows measurement of single-round infection and gene expression when pseudotyped with VSV-G. VSV-G was shown to be unaffected by LY6E in SupT1 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar to the results shown in Fig. 3B, knockdown of LY6E in SupT1 cells resulted in decreased RT activity (Fig. 6A) in this single-round infection assay, although the extent was less compared with that of multi-round replication. Noticeably, the expression of HIV-1 Gag and Env in SupT1 cells expressing shRNA LY6E, in particular clone 2 (LY6E-C2), was decreased, which correlated with their RT activity and LY6E knockdown efficiency (Fig. 6B). To confirm the effect of LY6E on HIV-1 gene expression, we used another pNL4.3Luc-R−E− vector (29He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral protein R (Vpr) arrests cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting p34cdc2 activity.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) in which the Vpr and Env genes are defective and whose Nef gene is fused with a firefly luciferase gene; this vector allows the luciferase activity to be measured as an indicator of LTR-driven gene expression. As shown in Fig. 6C, knockdown of LY6E resulted in a 2- to 3-fold reduction in luciferase activity (Fig. 6C). Similar results were also obtained by using another luciferase-based HIV-1 vector, HIV-LTR-Luc (Fig. 6D). Collectively, these results indicate that LY6E up-regulates HIV-1 gene expression in addition to promoting viral entry, although the detailed mechanism needs to be elucidated. The results presented so far were mostly from human primary PBMCs or CD4-positive T cell lines with CXCR4-using NL4.3 HIV-1. Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether the effects of LY6E in these cells can also be observed in monocytes and/or macrophages, especially with CCR5-using HIV-1. THP-1 is a monocyte cell line that expresses a high level of LY6E (15Xu X. Qiu C. Zhu L. Huang J. Li L. Fu W. Zhang L. Wei J. Wang Y. Geng Y. Zhang X. Qiao W. Xu J. IFN-stimulated gene LY6E in monocytes regulates the CD14/TLR4 pathway but inadequately restrains the hyperactivation of monocytes during chronic HIV-1 infection.J. Immunol. 2014; 193: 4125-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We thus applied a lentiviral vector transduction strategy and established two stable THP-1 cell lines expressing shRNA against LY6E. The knockdown efficiency of LY6E in these THP-1 cells was similar to that observed in SupT1 cells (Fig. 3A), again with shRNA-LY6E-C2 exhibiting higher efficiency compared with shRNA-LY6E-C1 (data not shown). We first tested infection of HIV-1 NL4.3 bearing VSV-G in these shRNA LY6E cells, and we observed that the viral production was reduced by ∼2-fold (Fig. 7A). We used equivalent amounts to infect HeLa-TZM cells, and we observed similar extents of decrease in viral infectivity in shRNA LY6E cells (Fig. 7B). As a control, we found that triple knockdown of IFITM1, 2, and 3 (shRNA IFITMs) increased the RT activity and infectivity, consistent with our previous report as expected (Fig. 7B) (30Yu J. Li M. Wilkins J. Ding S. Swartz T.H. Esposito A.M. Zheng Y.M. Freed E.O. Liang C. Chen B.K. Liu S.L. IFITM proteins restrict HIV-1 infection by antagonizing the envelope glycoprotein.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 145-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We next treated THP-1 cells with PMA to differentiate them into macrophages and infected these cells with CCR5-using HIV-1 NL4.3(AD8) (AD8 Env in the backbone of NL4.3 provirus) (31Freed E.O. Martin M.A. HIV-1 infection of non-dividing cells.Nature. 1994; 369: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar to HIV-1 NL4.3, the RT activity and viral infectivity of AD8 virus in both shRNA LY6E cell lines were decreased (Fig. 7, C and D). Noticeably, the extent of the inhibitory effect of LY6E knockdown on AD8 infectivity was more pronounced than its effect on viral production, suggesting that LY6E may have additional effects on the infectivity of HIV-1 NL4.3 (AD8) virus. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LY6E actively regulates HIV-1 replication in monocytes as well as in monocyte-derived macrophages. In this study, we provide evidence that LY6E is a positive modulator of HIV-1 infection in primary human PBMCs, immortalized CD4+ T lymphoid cells, and macrophages. Our results lend support to a recent study showing that up-regulation of LY6E correlates with severe HIV-1 infection and rapid progression to AIDS (15Xu X. Qiu C. Zhu L. Huang J. Li L. Fu W. Zhang L.

https://openalex.org/W2581778384,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Posttraumatic complaints are frequently reported, interfering with outcome. However, a consistent neural substrate has not yet been found. We used graph analysis to further unravel the complex interactions between functional brain networks, complaints, anxiety and depression in the sub-acute stage after mTBI. This study included 54 patients with uncomplicated mTBI and 20 matched healthy controls. Posttraumatic complaints, anxiety and depression were measured at two weeks post-injury. Patients were selected based on presence (n = 34) or absence (n = 20) of complaints. Resting-state fMRI scans were made approximately four weeks post-injury. High order independent component analysis resulted in 89 neural components that were included in subsequent graph analyses. No differences in graph measures were found between patients with mTBI and healthy controls. Regarding the two patient subgroups, degree, strength, local efficiency and eigenvector centrality of the bilateral posterior cingulate/precuneus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus were higher, and eigenvector centrality of the frontal pole/ bilateral middle & superior frontal gyrus was lower in patients with complaints compared to patients without complaints. In patients with mTBI, higher degree, strength and eigenvector centrality of default mode network components were related to higher depression scores, and higher degree and eigenvector centrality of executive network components were related to lower depression scores. In patients without complaints, one extra module was found compared to patients with complaints and healthy controls, consisting of the cingulate areas. In conclusion, this research extends the knowledge of functional network connectivity after mTBI. Specifically, our results suggest that an imbalance in the function of the default mode- and executive network plays a central role in the interaction between emotion regulation and the persistence of posttraumatic complaints."

To understand the occurrence and distribution of bacterial infections in these mammals, 218 bats belonging to eight species collected from four regions of Georgia were examined for Bartonella, Brucella, Leptospira, and Yersinia using molecular approaches. Bartonella DNA was detected in 77 (35%) bats from all eight species and was distributed in all four regions. The prevalence ranged 6–50% per bat species. The Bartonella DNA represented 25 unique genetic variants that clustered into 21 lineages. Brucella DNA was detected in two Miniopterus schreibersii bats and in two Myotis blythii bats, all of which were from Imereti (west-central region). Leptospira DNA was detected in 25 (13%) bats that included four M. schreibersii bats and 21 M. blythii bats collected from two regions. The Leptospira sequences represented five genetic variants with one of them being closely related to the zoonotic pathogen L. interrogans (98.6% genetic identity). No Yersinia DNA was detected in the bats. Mixed infections were observed in several cases. One M. blythii bat and one M. schreibersii bat were co-infected with Bartonella, Brucella, and Leptospira; one M. blythii bat and one M. schreibersii bat were co-infected with Bartonella and Brucella; 15 M. blythii bats and three M. schreibersii bats were co-infected with Bartonella and Leptospira. Our results suggest that bats in Georgia are exposed to multiple bacterial infections. Further studies are needed to evaluate pathogenicity of these agents to bats and their zoonotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2580868089,"A growing understanding of the bone remodeling process suggests that inflammation significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. T cells and various cytokines contribute majorly to the estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss.

IL-27 exerts protective effects in autoimmune diseases like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; however, its role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis remains to be determined. In this report, we study the effect of IL-27 supplementation on ovariectomized estrogen-deficient mice on various immune and skeletal parameters. IL-27 treatment in ovariectomized mice suppressed Th17 cell differentiation by inhibiting transcription factor RORγt. Supplementation of IL-27 activates Egr-2 to induce IL-10 producing Tr1 cells. IL-27 treatment prevented the loss of trabecular micro-architecture and preserved cortical bone parameters. IL-27 also inhibited osteoblast apoptosis through increased Egr-2 expression, which induces anti-apoptotic factors like MCL-1. IL-27 suppressed osteoclastogenesis in an Egr-2-dependent manner that up-regulates Id2, the repressor of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Additionally, these results were corroborated in female osteoporotic subjects where we found decreased serum IL-27 levels along with reduced Egr-2 expression.

Bone is an active tissue and serves multiple functions, including mechanical support, protection, and storage (1Amarasekara D.S. Yu J. Rho J. Bone loss triggered by the cytokine network in inflammatory autoimmune diseases.J. Immunol. Res. 2015; 2015: 832127Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Bone is mainly composed of 60% crystalline hydroxyapatite and 30% organic matrix (2Feng X. McDonald J.M. Disorders of bone remodeling.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2011; 6: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and it is continuously maintained by the process of bone remodeling, a lifelong process where mature bone is removed by osteoclasts and new bone is formed by osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are of mesenchymal origin and are the bone-forming cells (1Amarasekara D.S. Yu J. Rho J. Bone loss triggered by the cytokine network in inflammatory autoimmune diseases.J. Immunol.

Osteoblasts are incorporated into the bone matrix as osteocytes or remain at the bone surface as bone-lining cells at the end of the remodeling phase. In contrast, osteoclasts are the bone-resorbing cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells following stimulation by two essential factors: the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL). The process of bone remodeling is a tightly coupled process where it is ensured that bone resorption does not exceeds the process of bone formation. However, in diseases like osteoporosis, the balance between bone resorption and formation is disturbed (1Amarasekara D.S. Yu J. Rho J.

Until recently, osteoporosis etiology was mainly attributed to various endocrine, metabolic, and mechanical factors (8Ginaldi L. Di Benedetto M.C. De Martinis M. Osteoporosis, inflammation and ageing.Immun. Ageing. 2005; 2: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, a growing understanding of the bone-remodeling process suggests inflammation significantly contributes to the etiopathogenesis of osteoporosis (8Ginaldi L. Di Benedetto M.C. De Martinis M. Osteoporosis, inflammation and ageing.Immun. Ageing. 2005; 2: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that T cells are major contributors to estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss (9Weitzmann M.N. Pacifici R. Estrogen deficiency and bone loss: an inflammatory tale.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In estrogen-deficient conditions, there is an up-regulation of TNF-producing T cells. The TNF produced by these activated T cells is sufficient to augment RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (9Weitzmann M.N. Pacifici R. Estrogen deficiency and bone loss: an inflammatory tale.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Besides, activated T cells also produce RANKL, the main osteoclastogenic cytokine. Reports from our laboratory and other labs have shown that estrogen deficiency induces the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17)-secreting Th17 cells, the major osteoclastogenic subset that contributes to bone loss by augmenting the production of pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines (10Tyagi A.M. Srivastava K. Mansoori M.N. Trivedi R. Chattopadhyay N. Singh D. Estrogen deficiency induces the differentiation of IL-17 secreting Th17 cells: a new candidate in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e44552Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown that functional block of IL-17 in Ovx mice prevents bone loss (10Tyagi A.M. Srivastava K. Mansoori M.N. Trivedi R. Chattopadhyay N. Singh D. Estrogen deficiency induces the differentiation of IL-17 secreting Th17 cells: a new candidate in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e44552Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified the IL-12 cytokine family, which includes four members. Although IL-12 and IL-23 are pro-inflammatory, IL-27 and IL-35 are anti-inflammatory cytokines (11Vignali D.A. Kuchroo V.K. IL-12 family cytokines: immunological playmakers.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Among these four cytokines, IL-27 was particularly intriguing as earlier studies suggested it to have a pivotal role as both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine (12Villarino A.V. Huang E. Hunter C.A. Understanding the pro- and anti-inflammatory properties of IL-27.J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, later studies have established it mainly as an anti-inflammatory cytokine (13Hunter C.A. Kastelein R. Interleukin-27: balancing protective and pathological immunity.Immunity. 2012; 37: 960-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). IL-27 is a heterodimeric glycosylated protein consisting of p28 and EBI3 subunits (14Adamopoulos I.E. Pflanz S. The emerging role of Interleukin 27 in inflammatory arthritis and bone destruction.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2013; 24: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). IL-27 is predominantly secreted by the antigen-presenting cells and signals through a receptor complex consisting of the common IL-6 receptor chain, gp130, and the IL-27 receptor α-chain, WSX-1. IL-27 suppresses Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell functions in vivo as IL-27ra−/− mice showed enhanced T cell functions (14Adamopoulos I.E. Pflanz S. The emerging role of Interleukin 27 in inflammatory arthritis and bone destruction.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2013; 24: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory action of IL-27 is via IL-10 induction from various T cell subsets like Tr1 (type 1 regulatory T cells) (15Bosmann M. Ward P.A. Modulation of inflammation by interleukin-27.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2013; 94: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). IL-27 uses transcription factors like STAT-1, STAT-3, early growth response-2 (EGR-2), and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP-1) to induce IL-10 production (15Bosmann M. Ward P.A. Modulation of inflammation by interleukin-27.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2013; 94: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Effect of IL-27 has also been studied on bone cell types. A study by Park et al. (16Park J.S. Jung Y.O. Oh H.J. Park S.J. Heo Y.J. Kang C.M. Kwok S.K. Ju J.H. Park K.S. Cho M.L. Sung Y.C. Park S.H. Kim H.Y. Interleukin-27 suppresses osteoclastogenesis via induction of interferon-γ.Immunology. 2012; 137: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has shown that IL-27-mediated suppression of osteoclastogenesis is IFN-γ-dependent. Kamiya et al. (17Kamiya S. Nakamura C. Fukawa T. Ono K. Ohwaki T. Yoshimoto T. Wada S. Effects of IL-23 and IL-27 on osteoblasts and osteoclasts: inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2007; 25: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in an earlier study reported that osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow cells induced by soluble RANKL was partially inhibited by IL-27 with a reduced number of functional osteoclast cells. A report by Kalliolias et al. (18Kalliolias G.D. Zhao B. Triantafyllopoulou A. Park-Min K.H. Ivashkiv L.B. Interleukin-27 inhibits human osteoclastogenesis by abrogating RANKL-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 and suppressing proximal RANK signaling.Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 402-413PubMed Google Scholar) has also shown the direct effect of IL-27 on osteoclastogenesis by suppressing responses of osteoclast precursors to RANKL. IL-27 inhibits human osteoclastogenesis by abrogating RANKL-mediated induction of NFATc1 and suppressing proximal RANK signaling (18Kalliolias G.D. Zhao B. Triantafyllopoulou A. Park-Min K.H. Ivashkiv L.B. Interleukin-27 inhibits human osteoclastogenesis by abrogating RANKL-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 and suppressing proximal RANK signaling.Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 402-413PubMed Google Scholar). In osteoblasts, IL-27 stimulated STAT-3 activation but had no significant effect on alkaline phosphatase activity and proliferation of osteoblasts (17Kamiya S. Nakamura C. Fukawa T. Ono K. Ohwaki T. Yoshimoto T. Wada S. Effects of IL-23 and IL-27 on osteoblasts and osteoclasts: inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2007; 25: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that IL-27Ra deletion in mice leads to excessive Th17 responses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (19Batten M. Li J. Yi S. Kljavin N.M. Danilenko D.M. Lucas S. Lee J. de Sauvage F.J. Ghilardi N. Interleukin 27 limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing the development of interleukin 17-producing T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). IL-27 also has been reported to provide protection against collagen-induced arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis by suppressing Th17 cells and augmenting T regulatory cell differentiation (20Moon S.J. Park J.S. Heo Y.J. Kang C.M. Kim E.K. Lim M.A. Ryu J.G. Park S.J. Park K.S. Sung Y.C. Park S.H. Kim H.Y. Min J.K. Cho M.L. In vivo action of IL-27: reciprocal regulation of Th17 and Treg cells in collagen-induced arthritis.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As Th17 differentiation is under negative regulation of estrogen and estrogen deficiency augments Th17 differentiation, it was interesting to study whether IL-27 can provide protection under estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss conditions. Thus, in this study we investigate the role of IL-27 cytokine in estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss conditions where bone resorption exceeds the process of bone formation. We have determined the effect of IL-27 on T cell proliferation and Th17/Treg cell differentiation. It has also been determined whether IL-27 has an osteoprotective effect on Ovx-induced bone loss situations and what might be the possible mechanism involved. Finally, we have measured the levels of serum IL-27 in healthy, osteopenic, and osteoporotic post-menopausal women to determine whether IL-27 level co-relate with bone mineral density data. IL-27 has been shown to provide protection in collagen-induced arthritis; however, its effect in estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss is not studied. Thus, we sought to study the role of IL-27 in pathogenesis of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Hence, the first step was to determine the levels of IL-27 in mouse PBMC and serum after 1 month of Ovx. mRNA expression of IL-27 and serum levels was significantly reduced in Ovx animals compared with sham-operated (vehicle) animals (Fig. 1, A and B). This result formed a strong basis to determine the effect of IL-27 treatment to Ovx mice. As Ovx leads to deterioration in trabecular microarchitecture, IL-27 role in reversal of Ovx-induced loss of trabecular bones was studied. In gross observation by 3D-μCT, deterioration of the trabecular micro-architecture of femur bone was readily observed in the Ovx group compared with the sham group (Fig. 2A). Femoral response to various treatments was quantified. The Ovx group had reduced BV/TV (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B), Tb.Th (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C), and Tb.N (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D) and increased Tb.Sp (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2E), SMI (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4F), and Tb.Pf (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2G) compared with sham group. Treatment of Ovx animals with IL-27 led to significant prevention of trabecular parameters as evident by increased BV/TV (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B), Tb.Th (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C), and Tb.N (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2D) and decreased Tb.Sp (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2E), SMI (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2F), and Tb.Pf (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2G). No difference was observed between sham control and sham group treated with IL-27 in all parameters (Fig. 2, B–G). A similar kind of pattern was observed in tibia bones (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 4% CD4+ T cell populations in the BM of Sham, Sham + IL-27, Ovx, and Ovx + IL-27 groups were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Compared with the Ovx group, the IL-27-treated group showed greater Cs.Th (p < 0.05) and B.Ar (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5, B and C). Cortical thickness and cortical bone area were significantly high in the sham group treated with IL-27 compared with sham alone (p < 0.001 each) (Fig. 3, B and C). In fact, both cortical thickness and bone area were better in the sham group treated with IL-27 compared with the Ovx group treated with IL-27 (p < 0.001 each) (Fig. 3, B and C).FIGURE 5IL-27 initiates Egr-2 activation to induce Tr1 regulatory cell development and in vitro treatment of IL-27 induce IL-10 producing Tr1 cells.

IL-27 treatment to Ovx mice led to increased stiffness (p < 0.001), energy (p < 0.001), and power (p < 0.001) compared with the Ovx control group (Fig. 3, D–F). Power and stiffness of femoral bones were not different between sham and sham + IL-27 groups; however, higher energy was required to break the femoral bone in sham animals treated with IL-27 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3, D–F). As Ovx leads to increased proliferation of effector T cells and B cells, it was therefore determined whether IL-27 cytokine alters this phenomenon. It was seen that Ovx-induced CD4+ T cell proliferation was significantly reduced in the IL-27-treated Ovx group and brought back to sham control levels (Fig. 4, B and C). No difference was observed in sham control and sham group treated with IL-27 (Fig. 4, B and C). OPG/RANKL ratio in the BM B220+B cells was also found to be increased in Ovx animals supplemented with IL-27 (Fig. 4D). OPG/RANKL ratio was also increased in osteoblast treated with IL-27 (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, IL-27 treatment to Ovx animals led to a decrease in percentage of B220+B cells, which was otherwise increased in the Ovx control group (Fig. 4, E and F). Sham group treated with IL-27 (Fig. 4, E and F) has a lower number of B cells than the sham control group. IL-27 cytokine facilitates the differentiation of CD49, LAG3-expressing Tr1 regulatory cells, which execute their suppressor functions by secreting IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine (21Vasanthakumar A. Kallies A. IL-27 paves different roads to Tr1.Eur. J. Immunol. 2013; 43: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that the early growth response gene-2 (Egr-2), whose activation is initiated by IL-27, plays an important role in the differentiation of the CD49+ LAG3+ Tr1 subset and induction of IL-10 from these cells (21Vasanthakumar A. Kallies A. IL-27 paves different roads to Tr1.Eur. J. Immunol. 2013; 43: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Okamura T. Sumitomo S. Morita K. Iwasaki Y. Inoue M. Nakachi S. Komai T. Shoda H. Miyazaki J. Fujio K. Yamamoto K. TGF-β3-expressing CD4+CD25(−)LAG3+ regulatory T cells control humoral immune responses.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, transcript levels of Egr-2 were evaluated in CD4+ T cells. It was found that Egr-2 expression was very low in Ovx animals, whereas there was a robust increase in Ovx animals treated with IL-27, and this was significantly higher than the sham control (Fig. 5A). Additionally, sham group animals treated with IL-27 exhibited significantly higher Egr-2 transcript levels than the sham group (Fig. 5A). Once it was determined that Ovx animals treated with IL-27 expressed high levels of Egr-2 mRNA, it was investigated whether IL-27-mediated increased Egr-2 expression also induces Tr1 cell development. It was observed that although Ovx mice had a higher percentage of Tr1 cells than the sham group, treatment with IL-27 further led to a significant increase in % Tr1 cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Also, sham group animals treated with IL-27 had a significantly higher percentage of Tr1 cells (Fig. 5, B and C). As Tr1 cells exert their anti-inflammatory actions by secreting IL-10 cytokine, levels of IL-10 were determined in IL-27-treated CD4+ T cells. It was observed that IL-27-treated CD4+ T cells significantly enhance IL-10 production in CD49+ LAG3+ Tr1 cells (Fig. 5, D–F). Furthermore, it was checked as to why increased Tr1 cells were observed in Ovx mice. As high levels of IL-6 are found in Ovx mice and reports show that IL-6 can induce Tr1 cells, CD4+ T cells were treated with or without IL-6, and the percentage of Tr1 cells was determined. It was observed that IL-6 significantly induced the generation of Tr1 cells (Fig. 5, G and H). Estrogen deficiency induces the differentiation of IL-17-secreting Th17 cells, whereas IL-27 has been reported to inhibit Th17 generation (23Murugaiyan G. Mittal A. Lopez-Diego R. Maier L.M. Anderson D.E. Weiner H.L. IL-27 is a key regulator of IL-10 and IL-17 production by human CD4+ T cells.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, it was determined whether IL-27 cytokine treatment can mitigate an increase in IL-17-secreting Th17 cells in Ovx-induced bone loss. It was observed that Ovx-induced increase in the percentage of Th17 cells in PBMC isolated from bone marrow was significantly reduced in IL-27-treated Ovx mice and was equal to sham control (Fig. 6, A and B). Not much difference was observed between sham and the sham group treated with IL-27 cytokine. Transcription factor-like ROR-γt is crucial for Th17 differentiation (24Tyagi A.M. Mansoori M.N. Srivastava K. Khan M.P. Kureel J. Dixit M. Shukla P. Trivedi R. Chattopadhyay N. Singh D. Enhanced immunoprotective effects by anti-IL-17 antibody translates to improved skeletal parameters under estrogen deficiency compared with anti-RANKL and anti-TNF-α antibodies.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2014; 29: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and its transcript level was determined in CD4+ T cells. As expected, the expression of ROR-γt was robustly enhanced in T cells harvested from Ovx animals, whereas treatment with IL-27 significantly reversed this effect and brought it back to the sham control and sham group treated with IL-27 (Fig. 6B). Transcript level of FoxP3, which is a negative regulator of Th17 development (24Tyagi A.M. Mansoori M.N. Srivastava K. Khan M.P. Kureel J. Dixit M. Shukla P. Trivedi R. Chattopadhyay N. Singh D. Enhanced immunoprotective effects by anti-IL-17 antibody translates to improved skeletal parameters under estrogen deficiency compared with anti-RANKL and anti-TNF-α antibodies.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2014; 29: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was very low in T cells harvested from Ovx animals (Fig. 6D). However, IL-27 treatment led to a significant increase in these levels and was equal to sham (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, FoxP3 transcript levels were significantly enhanced in sham animals treated with IL-27 compared with sham control (Fig. 6D). Thus, IL-27 mitigates Ovx-induced Th17 generation and differentiation. A study by Liu and Rohowsky-Kochan (25Liu H. Rohowsky-Kochan C. Interleukin-27-mediated suppression of human Th17 cells is associated with activation of STAT1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011; 31: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggests that SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling) participates in IL-27-mediated suppression of Th17 cell production; hence levels of SOCS-3 in Ovx and IL-27-treated Ovx mice were determined. It was observed that Ovx led to robust down-regulation of SOCS-3, whereas treatment with IL-27 brought back the mRNA levels to sham control (Fig. 6E). Similar to FoxP3, a significant increase in SOCS-3 expression was observed in sham animals treated with IL-27 compared with sham (Fig. 6E). Thus, SOCS-3 participates in IL-27-mediated Th17 suppression in estrogen-deficient bone loss conditions. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-17 play a critical role in pathogenesis of osteoporosis (9Weitzmann M.N. Pacifici R. Estrogen deficiency and bone loss: an inflammatory tale.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of IL-27 treatment on the levels of major pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the Ovx group, there was a significant increase in the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNFα and a decrease in IL-10 over the sham group (Table 1). However, treatment of Ovx animals with IL-27 significantly reduced the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines (Table 1). Especially, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-17A and IL-6 in Ovx mice treated with IL-27 were even more reduced than the sham control group (Table 1). Even the sham group treated with IL-27 exhibited a significant decrease in IL-17A and IL-6 levels compared with sham control (Table 1). The most drastic decrease was observed in IL-6 levels in Ovx mice treated with IL-27, which was significantly better than Ovx, sham control, and sham group treated with IL-27 (Table 1). Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels were quite low in Ovx animals; however, treatment with IL-27 significantly increased the IL-10 levels, which were even higher than that observed in sham control group and sham animals treated with IL-27 (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of IL-27 on expression of various cytokinesCytokinesShamSham + IL-27OvxOvx + IL-27IL-1022.24 + 1.78**24.04 ± 1.21**14.92 ± 1.0831.1 ± 2.18***,b,qTNF-α17.00 ± 0.75**15.41 ± 2.71***25.28 ± 1.3612.35 ± 1.04***IL-17A15.13 ± 0.15***11.49 ± 0.59***,y26.66 ± 1.5510.95 ± 0.50***,bIFN-γ10.38 ± 1.31***10.50 ± 0.07***29.68 ± 0.8911.93 ± 1.86***IL-418.3 ± 0.4018.32 ±"
https://openalex.org/W2581357125,"Elevated serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) was previously reported to be associated with an elevated risk for cardiovascular events. TMAO originates from the microbiota-dependent breakdown of food-derived phosphatidylcholine (PC) to trimethylamine (TMA), which is oxidized by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases to TMAO. Our aim was to investigate the predominant site of absorption of the bacterial PC-breakdown product TMA. A healthy human proband was exposed to 6.9 g native phosphatidylcholine, either without concomitant treatment or during application with the topical antibiotic rifaximin, or exposed only to 6.9 g of a delayed-release PC formulation. Plasma and urine concentrations of TMA and TMAO were determined by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (plasma) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (urine). Native PC administration without concomitant treatment resulted in peak plasma TMAO levels of 43 ± 8 μM at 12 h post-ingestion, which was reduced by concomitant rifaximin treatment to 22 ± 8 μM (p < 0.05). TMAO levels observed after delayed-release PC administration were 20 ± 3 μM (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the peak urinary concentration at 24 h post-exposure dropped from 252 ± 33 to 185 ± 31 mmol/mmol creatinine after rifaximin treatment. In contrast, delayed-release PC resulted in even more suppressed urinary TMAO levels after the initial 12-h observation period (143 ± 18 mmol/mmol creatinine) and thereafter remained within the control range (24 h: 97 ± 9 mmol/mmol creatinine, p < 0.001 24 h vs. 12 h), indicating a lack of substrate absorption in distal intestine and large bowel. Our results showed that the microbiota in the small intestine generated the PC breakdown product TMA. The resulting TMAO, as a cardiovascular risk factor, was suppressed by topical-acting antibiotics or when PC was presented in an intestinally delayed release preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2581823621,"Myotonic dystrophy type 2 is a genetic neuromuscular disease caused by the expression of expanded CCUG repeat RNAs from the non-coding region of the CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) gene. These CCUG repeats bind and sequester a family of RNA-binding proteins known as Muscleblind-like 1, 2, and 3 (MBNL1, MBNL2, and MBNL3), and sequestration plays a significant role in pathogenicity. MBNL proteins are alternative splicing regulators that bind to the consensus RNA sequence YGCY (Y = pyrimidine). This consensus sequence is found in the toxic RNAs (CCUG repeats) and in cellular RNA substrates that MBNL proteins have been shown to bind. Replacing the uridine in CCUG repeats with pseudouridine (Ψ) resulted in a modest reduction of MBNL1 binding. Interestingly, Ψ modification of a minimally structured RNA containing YGCY motifs resulted in more robust inhibition of MBNL1 binding. The different levels of inhibition between CCUG repeat and minimally structured RNA binding appear to be due to the ability to modify both pyrimidines in the YGCY motif, which is not possible in the CCUG repeats. Molecular dynamic studies of unmodified and pseudouridylated minimally structured RNAs suggest that reducing the flexibility of the minimally structured RNA leads to reduced binding by MBNL1.

Similar to DM1, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by expression of expanded CCUG repeats in an intron of the CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) gene. DM1 and DM2 occur when the CUG/CCUG repeats are expanded beyond 100 repeats, and patients can have up to thousands of CUG/CCUG repeats (1.O'Rourke J.R. Swanson M.S.

Berglund J.A. MBNL1 binds GC motifs embedded in pyrimidines to regulate alternative splicing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2467-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CUG and CCUG repeats are composed of YGCY motifs creating hundreds or thousands of perfect MBNL-binding sites resulting in large numbers of MBNL proteins binding to the repeats and forming nuclear foci (11.Mankodi A. Urbinati C.R. Yuan Q.P. Moxley R.T. Sansone V. Krym M. Henderson D. Schalling M. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Muscleblind localizes to nuclear foci of aberrant RNA in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). When MBNL proteins are sequestered, they are unable to regulate RNA processing events, and consequently, many DM1 and DM2 symptoms are caused by mis-regulated alternative splicing and potentially the loss of other MBNL activities (12.Machuca-Tzili L. Brook D. Hilton-Jones D. Clinical and molecular aspects of the myotonic dystrophies: a review.Muscle Nerve. 2005; 32: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to understand how MBNL proteins bind to their toxic and cellular RNA substrates to develop mechanisms to alleviate MBNL sequestration in DM1 and DM2. MBNL proteins have two sets of zinc finger domains that are proposed to bind to RNA on opposing faces of the domain (13.Fu Y. Ramisetty S.R. Hussain N. Baranger A.M.

Gates D.P. Berglund J.A. The four Zn fingers of MBNL1 provide a flexible platform for recognition of its RNA binding elements.BMC Mol. Biol. 2011; 12: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Teplova and Patel (15.Teplova M. Patel D.J. Structural insights into RNA recognition by the alternative-splicing regulator muscleblind-like MBNL1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) published a crystal structure of one of the zinc finger domains of MBNL1 in complex with a YGCY-containing RNA, showing that MBNL1 interacts with the Watson-Crick face of the GC dinucleotide. This structure indicates that at least this portion of the RNA must be single-stranded to interact with MBNL1, as the Watson-Crick face interacts with the opposing strand in double-stranded RNA. Pseudouridine (Ψ), the most abundant RNA modification, is often referred to as the fifth RNA base. Ψ is found in tRNA, rRNA, and many spliceosomal RNAs, and it functions to stabilize the structure of these RNAs (16.Charette M. Gray M.W. Pseudouridine in RNA: what, where, how, and why.IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Ψ is a 5-ribosyl isomer of uridine, with a C–C bond connecting the ribose to the base instead of a C–N and an extra H-bonding donor on the N1 (Fig. 1A). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that Ψ induces rigidity in both single- and double-stranded RNA via base-stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions (16.Charette M. Gray M.W. Pseudouridine in RNA: what, where, how, and why.IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 17.Davis D.R.

There is evidence that in some cases base-stacking interactions are the primary stabilizing force in RNA containing Ψ (19.Yarian C.S. Basti M.M. Cain R.J. Ansari G. Guenther R.H. Sochacka E. Czerwinska G. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. Structural and functional roles of the N1- and N3-protons of ψ at tRNA's position 39.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3543-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In our previous work, replacing uridines with Ψ in the CUG repeats induced structural stabilization, prevented MBNL1 binding, and rescued mis-splicing. X-ray crystallography data suggested that Ψ stabilized the CUG repeats through water bridging via hydrogen bonding of the N1-H of Ψ with the uridine on the opposing strand (20.deLorimier E. Coonrod L.A. Copperman J. Taber A. Reister E.E. Sharma K. Todd P.K. Guenza M.G. Berglund J.A. Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy zebrafish model.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12768-12778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, we have extended our studies to determine that Ψ can stabilize CCUG repeat RNA and minimally structured RNA containing YGCY motifs and that this modification inhibits MBNL1 binding. MD simulations indicate that Ψ increases base-stacking interactions in minimally structured YGCY RNAs. Previous studies showed that Ψ increased the thermal stability of CUG repeat RNA in a helical conformation (20.deLorimier E. Coonrod L.A. Copperman J. Taber A. Reister E.E. Sharma K. Todd P.K. Guenza M.G. Berglund J.A. Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy zebrafish model.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12768-12778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we determined whether Ψ had a similar effect on stabilization of CCUG repeats. Although both types of repeats contain the MBNL1-binding motif YGCY, the additional cytosine in CCUG repeats renders them different from CUG repeats. Uridine is only upstream of the GC dinucleotide, so Ψ substitutions can only change the 5′ side of the YGCY-binding site unlike the CUG repeats, where uridine is on both sides. We designed a model CCUG repeat RNA containing two sets of three CCUG repeats separated by a UUCG linker (Fig. 1C, RNA 1). This linker has been shown to favor stem-loop formation (21.Molinaro M. Tinoco Jr., I. Use of ultra stable UNCG tetraloop hairpins to fold RNA structures: thermodynamic and spectroscopic applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3056-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and was included to facilitate structural studies. The most energetically favorable secondary structure for this RNA, as predicted by several different software programs, is one in which C-U and U-C mismatched base pairs are adjacent to G-C base pairs (Fig. 1B). However, NMR studies suggested that RNA 1 did not adopt a single defined structure. Unmodified CCUG repeats exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) of 47 ± 1 °C (Fig. 1D, RNA 1), whereas the Tm for CCUG repeats with Ψ substitutions was 56 ± 2 °C (Fig. 1D, RNA 2). These data showed that Ψ increases the thermal stability of CCUG repeats, similar to what was found with CUG repeats. Melting temperatures were similar across a broad range of RNA concentrations, suggesting that intramolecular rather than intermolecular interactions are the dominant force determining thermal stability (Fig. 1E and Table 1). The same trends were observed whether Tm was measured from a curve of increasing or decreasing temperatures, although in our spectrophotometer we consistently obtained a slightly higher Tm when using a curve of increasing temperature (Table 1).TABLE 1CCUG repeat RNA melting temperaturesRNA0.5 μm1 μm1.5 μm2 μm2.5 μm5 μmUpDownUpDownUpDownUpDownUpDownUpDownRNA 1, CCUG repeat45 ± 145 ± 347 ± 246 ± 247 ± 145 ± 147 ± 144 ± 146 ± 146 ± 248 ± 145 ± 2RNA 2, CCψG repeat59 ± 457 ± 458 ± 357 ± 257 ± 155 ± 156 ± 254 ± 258 ± 157 ± 358 ± 254 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Gel shift assays were used to determine whether the Ψ stabilization observed in the CCUG repeat RNAs inhibited MBNL1 binding. The dissociation constant (Kd) for MBNL1 binding to unmodified CCUG repeats is 118 ± 15 nm (Fig. 2, A and B, RNA 1), and modification of uridines to Ψ in CCΨG repeats resulted in a modestly increased Kd of 168 ± 19 nm (Fig. 2, A and B, RNA 2). These results show that Ψ has a modest inhibitory effect on MBNL1 binding to the YGCY-binding sites in the CCUG repeats. This effect is significantly less than that observed with Ψ modification of CUG repeats (20.deLorimier E. Coonrod L.A. Copperman J. Taber A. Reister E.E. Sharma K. Todd P.K. Guenza M.G. Berglund J.A. Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy zebrafish model.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12768-12778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We next asked whether Ψ modification would inhibit the ability of MBNL1 to bind to minimally structured RNA. We chose the model MBNL1 RNA substrate (U4(GC)U11(GC)U4), which was previously demonstrated to have little RNA structure (Fig. 3A, RNA 3) (14.Cass D. Hotchko R. Barber P. Jones K. Gates D.P. Berglund J.A. The four Zn fingers of MBNL1 provide a flexible platform for recognition of its RNA binding elements.BMC Mol. Biol. 2011; 12: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that RNA 3 forms a weak hairpin structure through non-canonical U-U base pairing (22.Lietzke S.E. Barnes C.L. Berglund J.A. Kundrot C.E.

However, such a structure would be much less stable than that formed through canonical base pairing in CCUG repeat RNA 1 (Fig. 1B). The Ψ modification was placed 5′ or 3′ of the GC dinucleotide and flanking both GC dinucleotides in the U4(GC)U11(GC)U4 RNA (Fig. 3A, RNAs 4–6). The dissociation constant of MBNL1 binding to unmodified minimally structured RNA is 0.14 ± 0.09 μm (Fig. 3A, RNA 3). The addition of Ψ modifications 5′ to the GC dinucleotides increased the Kd to 0.83 ± 0.15 μm (Fig. 3A, RNA 4), whereas Ψ placement 3′ to the GC dinucleotides increased the Kd to 3.2 ± 0.66 μm (Fig. 3A, RNA 5). When four pseudouridines flank the two GC dinucleotides, the fraction of RNA bound does not reach 0.5 in these assays, so the dissociation constant is >3.2 μm (Fig. 3A, RNA 6). Binding curves used to calculate these values are shown in Fig. 3B. These results show that MBNL1 binding was generally inhibited by Ψ incorporation. The nucleotide 3′ to the GC dinucleotide had a more pronounced effect on MBNL1 binding than the nucleotide in the 5′ position, as the Kd for RNA 5 with the 3′ Ψ modifications is ∼4-fold greater than for RNA 4 with 5′ modifications (Fig. 3). Melting studies were performed to determine whether the Ψ modifications would increase the thermal stability of the MBNL1 model minimally structured substrate, RNA 3. Previous reports have shown that Ψ can induce base-stacking interactions in single-stranded RNAs, thereby predicting that increased base stacking might be observed with this RNA (17.Davis D.R. Stabilization of RNA stacking by pseudouridine.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5020-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). RNA 3 melted at a temperature of 29 ± 1 °C, which is presumably due primarily to the unstacking of the bases in the minimally structured RNA, but could also reflect melting of a hairpin containing non-canonical base pairs (Fig. 4A). The RNA with the two pseudouridines 5′ of the GC dinucleotides melted at 39 ± 1 °C (Fig. 4A, RNA 4). The RNA containing pseudouridines 3′ to the dinucleotide melted at 37 ± 2 °C (Fig. 4A, RNA 5). The RNA containing Ψ substitutions flanking the GC dinucleotides melted at 45 ± 1 °C (Fig. 4A, RNA 6). These data indicate that Ψ stabilizes minimally structured RNAs, possibly by increasing base stacking. Consistent with this interpretation is that additional Ψ substitutions increased the melting temperature (Fig. 4A). An increase in thermal stability of these minimally structured RNAs is likely due to strand rigidifying via base-stacking interactions. Melting temperatures were similar across a broad range of RNA concentrations, suggesting that intramolecular interactions were the primary drivers behind changes in thermal stability (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Like what was observed with CCUG repeat RNAs, minimally structured RNA melting temperatures measured from a curve of increasing temperatures were consistently slightly higher than those from a curve of decreasing temperatures, likely due to an artifact of our measuring equipment (Table 2).TABLE 2Minimally structured model RNA melting temperaturesRNA0.5 μm1 μm1.5 μm2 μm2.5 μm5 μmUpDownUpDownUpDownUpDownUpDownUpDownRNA 3, U4(GC)U11(GC)U428 ± 129 ± 232 ± 229 ± 231 ± 128 ± 129 ± 128 ± 131 ± 128 ± 130 ± 128 ± 1RNA 4, U3(GC)U10ψ(GC)U439 ± 137 ± 138 ± 135 ± 139 ± 336 ± 139 ± 136 ± 139 ± 136 ± 139 ± 235 ± 1RNA 5, U4(GC)ψU10(GC)ψU334 ± 337 ± 336 ± 333 ± 139 ± 236 ± 237 ± 235 ± 139 ± 135 ± 237 ± 135 ± 2RNA 6, U3ψ(GC)ψU9ψ(GC)ψU340 ± 342 ± 242 ± 145 ± 346 ± 143 ± 145 ± 142 ± 145 ± 142 ± 144 ± 243 ± 1 Open table in a new tab We conducted MD simulations to study whether Ψ induces increased base-stacking interactions in a fully atomistic explicit solvent model of minimally structured YGCY RNA. MD simulations allowed us to computationally investigate the dynamics of minimally structured U5(GC)U5 (RNA 7), U4Ψ(GC)U5 (RNA 8), U5(GC)ΨU4 (RNA 9), and U4Ψ(GC)ΨU4 (RNA 10). There were many differences in the conformational ensemble of the unmodified RNA versus the pseudouridylated RNAs. Overall, the pseudouridylated structures were much more compact and stable than the ensemble of unmodified RNA structures. To quantify base-stacking interactions, we calculated the relative free energy of the distance between the U/Ψ5-G6 and the G6-C7 bases throughout the simulation (Fig. 5, A and B). We define the distance between the bases to be the distance between the C2 atom on the G6 base and the C2 (C4) atom on the U5 (Ψ5) base. U5-G6 bases had a global minimum in the stacked configuration but a very small barrier of 1.0 kcal/mol separating a range of open states of nearly equal free energy to the stacked state (Fig. 5B, RNA 7). Overall, the range of open conformations, defined as structures with a U/Ψ5-G base separation of greater than 7 Å, was about four times more probable than closed conformations (Fig. 5B, RNA 7). The widespread distribution of base separation distances in the U5(GC)U5 simulation indicates that the bases are dynamic, without a strong preference for base stacking. Furthermore, analysis of the ensemble of open structures of the U5(GC)U5 from the simulation show that G6 is commonly unstacked from both neighboring bases (Fig. 5, A and B, RNA 7). These open conformations can be easily docked into the MBNL1-binding site similar to the bound conformation observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 5C), supporting the model that effective MBNL1 binding requires the presence of flexible conformations with the G of the YGCY-binding site unstacked from both neighbors. Although some pseudouridylated constructs displayed slightly increased flexibility at small separations, open configurations with a stacking distance to the guanine base of greater than 7 Å were highly disfavored in comparison with the U5(GC)U5 construct for both constructs containing Ψ upstream of G6 (Fig. 5B, RNAs 8 and 10). At the U-G base separation distance of 10.7 Å, as measured in the crystal structure of bound MBNL1 and RNA, the difference in free energy between the unmodified RNA and fully pseudouridylated RNA studied in the MD simulations was 1.9 kcal/mol (Fig. 5B, RNAs 7 and 10). This could be significant in a conformational selection model of binding. Pseudouridylation of only U5 resulted in increased base stacking with G6 but a modest decrease in base stacking between G6 and C7 (Fig. 5, A and B, RNAs 7 and 8). Conversely, pseudouridylation of the 3′ U8 alone led to increased base-stacking between G6 and C7 but increased U5-G6 base separation (Fig. 5, A and B, RNAs 7 and 9). Pseudouridylation of both U5 and U8 led to increased base stacking on both sides of G6 (Fig. 5, A and B, RNAs 7 and 10). These data suggest that Ψ increases base-stacking interactions in these minimally structured YGCY RNAs. Replacing the six uridines in CCUG repeats with pseudouridines (RNAs 1 and 2) increased the thermal stability of this RNA by 9 °C (Fig. 1D). Surprisingly, this stabilization only resulted in a modest ∼1.5-fold inhibition of MBNL1 binding (Fig. 2A). In contrast, stabilization of CUG repeats with two or four Ψs resulted in a larger increase in thermal stability (13 or 19 °C for two or four Ψ modifications, respectively) (20.deLorimier E. Coonrod L.A. Copperman J. Taber A. Reister E.E. Sharma K. Todd P.K. Guenza M.G. Berglund J.A. Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy zebrafish model.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12768-12778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and displayed a more dramatic effect on MBNL1 binding (>20-fold loss of binding) compared with CCUG repeat binding. A possible explanation for the difference in MBNL1 binding observed between CUG and CCUG repeats with Ψ modification is that CCUG repeats are relatively less stable compared with CUG repeats (the observed Tm of (CUG)4 was ∼59 °C (20.deLorimier E. Coonrod L.A. Copperman J. Taber A. Reister E.E. Sharma K. Todd P.K. Guenza M.G. Berglund J.A. Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy zebrafish model.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12768-12778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that of CCUG repeat RNA 1 was ∼47 °C) and the increased stability provided by the Ψ modification to the CCUG repeats was not sufficient to strongly inhibit MBNL1 binding. Another possibility is that modifying both pyrimidines of the YGCY motif is necessary for robust inhibition of MBNL1 binding. A model minimally structured RNA was used to probe the difference between the two pyrimidine positions in the YGCY motif. The modification studies with the minimally structured RNA revealed that the Ψ substitution 3′ to the GC dinucleotide had a much more pronounced effect on MBNL1 binding affinity compared with the 5′ substitution (Fig. 3, RNAs 4 and 5). This difference in binding affinity does not appear to be due to thermal stability as the 5′ and 3′ modifications were similarly stabilized by Ψ modification (Tm of 39 and 37 °C, respectively; Fig. 4A). This contrasts with findings in the context of duplex RNA, in which the position of Ψ within the duplex and the identity of adjacent Watson-Crick base pairs influence thermodynamic stability (26.Hudson G.A. Bloomingdale R.J. Znosko B.M. Thermodynamic contribution and nearest-neighbor parameters of pseudouridine-adenosine base pairs in oligoribonucleotides.RNA. 2013; 19: 1474-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27.Kierzek E. Malgowska M. Lisowiec J. Turner D.H. Gdaniec Z. Kierzek R. The contribution of pseudouridine to stabilities and structure of RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3492-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The difference in MBNL1 binding inhibition at the 5′- and 3′-pyrimidine positions in the model minimally structured RNA may be due to contacts made by the zinc fingers of MBNL1 with the 3′-pyrimidine observed in the crystal structure (15.Teplova M. Patel D.J. Structural insights into RNA recognition by the alternative-splicing regulator muscleblind-like MBNL1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The 3′ Ψ modification likely adopts conformations with bases in stacked structures that are less compatible with MBNL1 binding. The double Ψ modification that nearly eliminated MBNL1 binding (Fig. 3, RNA 6) again favors RNA conformations with single strand base stacking. These studies are consistent with the crystal structure that showed that the zinc fingers of MBNL1 interact primarily with the bases in an unstacked conformation. Consistent with the melting studies, molecular dynamics simulations showed that Ψ modification of the 5′- or 3′-uridine increases the base-stacking interactions at the YGCY MBNL1-binding site of minimally structured RNAs. Although the structure published by Teplova and Patel (15.Teplova M. Patel D.J. Structural insights into RNA recognition by the alternative-splicing regulator muscleblind-like MBNL1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in 2008 shows that the 3′-uridine in the YGCY motif makes contact with the protein, this structure also shows that when the RNA is bound to the protein, the G of the GC dinucleotide stacks with the amino acids of the protein (Fig. 5C). These results impose a model in which MBNL1 is able to form interactions with YGCY RNA when it is flexible enough for the G to unstack with its neighboring pyrimidine. The MD simulations indicate that Ψ causes the RNA to prefer conformations in which the G is stacked with its neighbor. Based on the distribution of base separation distances, unmodified RNA also tends to form stacking interactions, but the population of those conformations is much less abundant than the range of open configurations. These data and our previous work (20.deLorimier E. Coonrod L.A. Copperman J. Taber A. Reister E.E. Sharma K. Todd P.K. Guenza M.G. Berglund J.A. Modifications to toxic CUG RNAs induce structural stability, rescue mis-splicing in a myotonic dystrophy cell model and reduce toxicity in a myotonic dystrophy zebrafish model.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12768-12778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggest that Ψ modifications can generally be used to shift YGCY motifs into conformations with increased base stacking that reduce binding by MBNL proteins. Thermal melts were carried out in 20 mm PIPES buffer at a pH of 7.0 and 150 mm NaCl. PIPES buffer was chosen because of its minimal change in pH with increasing temperature (−0.0085 ΔpKa/°C) (28.Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Connolly T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M. Hydrogen ion buffers for biological research.Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). The buffer was de-gassed before diluting RNA to a concentration of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 5 μm. The temperature was raised by 1 °C per min over a range of 12–70 °C for minimally structured model RNAs and 15–95 °C for CCUG repeat RNAs, held at the highest temperature for 2 min, and then lowered by 1 °C per min to the lowest temperature. Absorbance at 260 nm was measured once per min by a Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer. Absorbance was normalized by subtracting the absorbance at the lowest temperature measured. The melting temperature (Tm) of CCUG repeat RNAs was calculated as the temperature at which the derivative of the absorbance was the highest. The Tm of a minimally structured RNA was calculated as the temperature at the halfway point between the minimum and maximum absorbance. GST-tagged MBNL1 (amino acids 2–260) was expressed in BL21 Star Escherichia coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific), grown to an OD of 0.6–0.7, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and shaken for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed for 15 min at 4 °C with 4 ml/g B-PERTM bacterial protein extraction reagent. 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 units/ml DNase I, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 were added to the lysate followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. An equal volume of 1× PBS was added, and cells were lysed for an additional 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) in 1× PBS, followed by washing two times with 25 ml of 40 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, and 50 mm NaCl; two times with 20 ml of 20 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, and 1 m NaCl; and three times with 20 ml of 16 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, and 20 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted by incubating three times with 5 ml of 16 mm Bicine, pH 8.3, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mm glutathione. Eluates were combined, run through a 0.2-μm filter, and concentrated to 250 μl using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel-50 membrane. 10 ml of protein storage buffer (500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol) was added to the protein followed by concentration using an Amicon Ultra 0.5-ml 50K centrifugal filter, flash freezing, and storage at −80 °C. RNA synthesized by Dharmacon or IDT was radiolabeled with [α-32P]ATP with a polynucleotide kinase and stored at −20 °C in low TE (10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA). RNA oligonucleotides were diluted in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) and folded by incubation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. RNA (final concentration 1 nm) was incubated together for 30 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of GST-MBNL1 (from 20 nm to 5 μm in 2-fold steps for RNAs 1 and 2, from 3.125 nm to 3.2 μm for RNAs 3, 5, and 6, and from 9.8 nm to 5 μm for RNA 4) in 115 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 2 mg/ml BSA, and 0.02% xylene cyanol. RNA-protein complexes were separated from free RNA on a 6% native acrylamide gel. Complex formation was quantified by exposure on a phosphorimager screen followed by analysis with ImageQuant from GE Healthcare.

https://openalex.org/W2556128762,"To identify new host factors that modulate the replication of influenza A virus, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic tail of matrix protein 2 from the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. The screen revealed a high-score interaction with cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle early G1 phase. M2-cyclin D3 interaction was validated through GST pull-down and recapitulated in influenza A/WSN/33-infected cells. Knockdown of Ccnd3 by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced virus progeny titers in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, the increase in virus production was due to cyclin D3 deficiency per se and not merely a consequence of cell cycle deregulation. A combined knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1, which rescued cell cycle progression into S phase, failed to normalize virus production. Infection by influenza A virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2 with M1, which is essential for proper assembly of progeny virions, lending further support to its role as a putative restriction factor. Our study describes the identification and characterization of cyclin D3 as a novel interactor of influenza A virus M2 protein. We hypothesize that competitive inhibition of M1-M2 interaction by cyclin D3 impairs infectious virion formation and results in attenuated virus production.

The threat of influenza infection is felt globally, and the disease leads to an estimated 3–5 million cases of severe illness and about 250,000–500,000 deaths each year (1.World Health Organization Influenza (seasonal) fact sheet. 2016; (www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/)Google Scholar). Although the strategy of antagonizing influenza infection through vaccination has been partially successful, the necessity for effective antiviral agents is underscored by the toxic side effects of currently available drugs and the emergence of drug-resistant variants (2.Stoof Stoof Booij Booij Drukarch Drukarch Wolters Wolters The anti-parkinsonian drug amantadine inhibits the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-evoked release of acetylcholine from rat neostriatum in a non-competitive way.Eur.

Influenza viruses, like any other viruses, are obligate intracellular pathogens that exploit the host cellular machinery to replicate. The identification of cellular mechanisms required for the virus life cycle not only sheds light on its trafficking characteristics but also provides strategies for interfering with host factors as an alternative approach to inhibit viral infection. Elucidating host-pathogen interactions as an unbiased approach to gain insights into disease pathogenesis has received ample attention. Various functional assay systems have been used for screening host factors involved in the influenza virus replication cycle thus far.

Antimicrob. Chemother. 2009; 64: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although these strategies unveiled hundreds of genes important for the virus life cycle, their functional relevance and molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Among others approaches, effort has been invested to dissect how the cellular interactors of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes regulate the replication and transcription of influenza virus (18.Jorba Jorba Juarez Juarez Torreira Torreira Gastaminza Gastaminza Zamarreño Zamarreño Albar Albar Ortín Ortín Analysis of the interaction of influenza virus polymerase complex with human cell factors.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Host interactors of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a multifunctional protein modulating several aspects of the virus replication cycle with a major role in inhibiting interferon mediated immune response, have also been extensively studied (16.Hale Hale Randall Randall Ortín Ortín Jackson Jackson The multifunctional NS1 protein of influenza A viruses.J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2359-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar).

We reasoned that the integral membrane proteins of the viral envelope would interact with cellular factors at various stages: endosomal fusion and release of the genetic material during entry, transport from endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, and assembly and budding of nascent virions. M2 is a minor protein of the viral envelope that forms a homotetramer in its native state (19.Zebedee Zebedee Lamb Lamb Influenza A virus M2 protein: monoclonal antibody restriction of virus growth and detection of M2 in virions.J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2762-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Holsinger Holsinger Lamb Lamb Influenza virus M2 integral membrane protein is a homotetramer stabilized by formation of disulfide bonds.Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, M2 possesses the longest C-terminal tail among the three viral envelope proteins, namely hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase, and M2. It is an ion channel that was initially discovered as the target of the antiviral drug amantadine and facilitates diffusion of protons to the interior of the endosomally entrapped virus (21.Pinto Pinto Holsinger Holsinger Lamb Lamb Influenza virus M2 protein has ion channel activity.Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Low pH induces a conformational change in HA and subsequently triggers fusion with the endosomal membrane during virus entry (22.Helenius Helenius Unpacking the incoming influenza virus.Cell. 1992; 69: 577-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). M2 is a 97-residue single-pass membrane protein that displays considerable pleiotropism. It determines the filamentous morphology of some viral strains through binding to cholesterol (23.Roberts Roberts Lamb Lamb Compans Compans The M1 and M2 proteins of influenza A virus are important determinants in filamentous particle formation.Virology. 1998; 240: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24.Iwatsuki-Horimoto Iwatsuki-Horimoto Horimoto Horimoto Noda Noda Kiso Kiso Maeda Maeda Watanabe Watanabe Muramoto Muramoto Fujii Fujii Kawaoka Kawaoka The cytoplasmic tail of the influenza A virus M2 protein plays a role in viral assembly.J.

The cytoplasmic tail (CT) of M2 interacts with M1 at the site of virus budding for efficient packaging of virus particles (26.McCown McCown Pekosz Pekosz Distinct domains of the influenza a virus M2 protein cytoplasmic tail mediate binding to the M1 protein and facilitate infectious virus production.J.

Altogether, these studies provide evidence that influenza M2, especially the CT domain, plays a critical role in multiple steps of the virus life cycle. Hence, the identification of cellular interactors of M2 would provide mechanistic insights into influenza pathogenesis and possibilities for development of novel strategies to interfere with multiple steps of the infection process. By using M2-CT as bait, we screened a human placenta complementary DNA (cDNA) library to identify host proteins that either facilitate or restrict viral infection. Cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle G0/G1 phase progression, was uncovered as a novel host factor interacting with M2-CT. The physical interaction between M2 and cyclin D3 was confirmed in virus-infected cells. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection resulted in host cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, which was accompanied by cyclin D3 relocalization and degradation. Using a combination of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated genetic analyses we further showed that cyclin D3 restricts IAV production, independent of its role in the cell cycle. The restriction of cyclin D3 on IAV life cycle did not impair viral protein synthesis but interfered with M1-M2 binding, which may result in defective assembly and release of progeny virions. The role of cyclin D3 in the context of influenza infection has not been described previously. More interestingly, our results suggest a novel function of cyclin D3 that is beyond its classical function in cell cycle regulation. The IAV M2 ion channel protein is a multifunctional protein with a highly conserved sequence among influenza A virus isolates that approaches 95% identity in some regions (29.Thomas Thomas Stevens Stevens Percy Percy Barclay Barclay Phosphorylation of the M2 protein of influenza A virus is not essential for virus viability.Virology. 1998; 252: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30.Le Le Leluk Leluk Study on phylogenetic relationships, variability, and correlated mutations in M2 proteins of influenza virus A.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e22970Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Among the three viral envelope proteins, M2 possesses the longest CT with a high probability of interactions with the cellular machinery at various steps of the virus life cycle. These include fusion, intracellular trafficking through the secretory pathway (31.Henkel Henkel Weisz Weisz Influenza virus M2 protein slows traffic along the secretory pathway: pH perturbation of acidified compartments affects early Golgi transport steps.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (24.Iwatsuki-Horimoto Iwatsuki-Horimoto Horimoto Horimoto Noda Noda Kiso Kiso Maeda Maeda Watanabe Watanabe Muramoto Muramoto Fujii Fujii Kawaoka Kawaoka The cytoplasmic tail of the influenza A virus M2 protein plays a role in viral assembly.J.

It is of considerable interest to identify intracellular interactors of M2-CT, not only to elucidate cellular components that are exploited by influenza, but also to understand host defenses involved in restricting the virus life cycle. To this end, a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened by Y2H using the IAV M2-CT as bait (Fig. 1A). The screening revealed human cyclin D3 (GenBankTM accession number NM_001760.2) as one of the most prominent interactors of M2-CT, as summarized in Table 1. Sequence alignment of the positive clones pointed to amino acid residues 138–251 as the minimal interacting domain for M2-CT (Fig. 1B). The M2-binding domain on cyclin D3 is largely outside of its cyclin box, which is responsible for binding to and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (33.Nugent Nugent Alfa Alfa Young Young Hyams Hyams Conserved structural motifs in cyclins identified by sequence analysis.J.

Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 558-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the absence of other cyclins among positive clones, suggests a certain degree of specificity of the interaction, which was tested in the next series of experiments.TABLE 1Yeast two-hybrid screen identifies/predicts cyclin D3-M2-CT interactionCharacteristicValue or descriptionBaitM2 cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 44–97)LibraryRandom-primed human placenta cDNANo. of interactions tested63.89 millionPreyCyclin D3No. of positive clones42Confidence scoreaPredicted biological score (from A to E, highest to lowest), a statistical confidence score assigned to each interaction by Hybrigenics.AMinimal interacting domainAmino acids 138–251a Predicted biological score (from A to E, highest to lowest), a statistical confidence score assigned to each interaction by Hybrigenics.

There are three early G1 phase D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3), which are functionally related with tissue-specific expression profiles (37.Sherr Sherr G1 phase progression: cycling on cue.Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar, 38.Sherr Sherr Cancer cell cycles.Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar, 39.Inaba Inaba Matsushime Matsushime Valentine Valentine Roussel Roussel Sherr Sherr Look Look Genomic organization, chromosomal localization, and independent expression of human cyclin D genes.Genomics. 1992; 13: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 40.Pokrovskaja Pokrovskaja Ehlin-Henriksson Ehlin-Henriksson Bartkova Bartkova Bartek Bartek Scuderi Scuderi Szekely Szekely Wiman Wiman Klein Klein Phenotype-related differences in the expression of D-type cyclins in human B cell-derived lines.Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1723-1732PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Bartkova Bartkova Lukas Lukas Strauss Strauss Bartek Bartek Cell cycle-related variation and tissue-restricted expression of human cyclin D1 protein.J.

Our results from Y2H screening indicate that only cyclin D3, and not the other two D-type cyclins, interacts with M2-CT. We first checked the specificity of this interaction in human A549 lung epithelial cells. GST-M2-CT fusion protein was purified and incubated with wild-type cell lysate to pull down endogenous D-type cyclins. Cyclin D3 bound specifically to GST-M2-CT and not to either GST or beads (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these results confirm that cyclin D3 binds to the IAV M2-CT. To examine the intracellular association of M2-CT with cyclin D3 during the IAV life cycle, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from virus-infected cells. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged cyclin D3 (cyclin D3-FLAG) and infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-M2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D (lane 1), M2 was found to co-purify with cyclin D3, demonstrating their physical interaction during virus infection, either directly or through a common interactor. No interaction was observed in control samples, where cells were either mock-transfected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 2) or transfected with cyclin D3-FLAG and immunoprecipitated with isotype control antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 3). These data validate cyclin D3 as a bona fide interactor of influenza M2, corroborating our results from the Y2H screening. The specificity of interaction between cyclin D3 and M2 was tested using a panel of exogenously expressed cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, D3, and E1). Although M2 appears to interact with other cyclins to some degree when they are overexpressed, we consistently found that it has the strongest interaction with cyclin D3 (Fig. 1E). To understand the functional relevance of cyclin D3-M2 interaction in virus-infected cells, we tested their subcellular distribution through immunofluorescence imaging. To achieve unbiased analysis, A549 cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.5 to have a mixed population of infected and uninfected cells in the same sample. Cells were fixed at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) and stained for cyclin D3 and M2 proteins. In uninfected cells, cyclin D3 resides both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm with only the nuclear CDK4/6-cyclin D3 complex displaying retinoblastoma (Rb)-directed kinase activity (44.Mahony Mahony Parry Parry Lees Lees Active cdk6 complexes are predominantly nuclear and represent only a minority of the cdk6 in T cells.Oncogene. 1998; 16: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon virus infection, a much weaker cyclin D3 signal was observed in the nuclei of infected cells compared with control cells, as revealed by M2 staining. These results suggest that cyclin D3 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytosol as a response to infection (Fig. 2A, top panels). The effect of M2 protein on cyclin D3 relocalization was recapitulated in analogous experiments using A549 cells expressing M2 protein alone (Fig. 2A, bottom panels), which resulted in the apparent reduction of cyclin D3 from the nucleus, similar to the phenotype induced by viral infection. To address the reduction of cyclin D3 from the nucleus upon virus infection, we fractionated both control and infected cells into cytosol and nuclear material to measure cyclin D3 levels. Cytoplasm- and nucleus-enriched extracts were prepared from A/WSN/33-infected (MOI of 2 to achieve a more homogeneous infection of the cell culture) and uninfected A549 cells. Lamin B1 and GAPDH were used as markers to verify clear separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Total intracellular level of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells decreased to ∼60% of that observed in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2, B and C, top). Densitometric analysis indicates that 10% of total cyclin D3 was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. This is very likely an underestimation because cyclin D3, being soluble, would leak from the nuclear into the cytoplasmic fraction during the experimental procedures. The percentage of nuclear cyclin D3 dropped to <4% at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 2C, bottom), indicating translocation of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in virus-infected cells. This significant (>60%) reduction of nuclear cyclin D3 detected through biochemical measurement confirmed our immunofluorescence data on its subcellular relocalization. We further verified colocalization of cyclin D3 with that of M2 through infection of A/WSN/33 in cyclin D3-expressing cells. Because at 24 h p.i. most of cyclin D3 is degraded, we selected an earlier time point and treated mock- and virus-infected cells with MG-132 to increase the signal strength of cyclin D3. Indeed, at 15 h p.i., we could capture colocalization of influenza M2 and cyclin D3 along the secretory pathway (Fig. 2D). Most of cyclin D3 appeared in the cytosolic fraction under these conditions. Interaction of cyclin D3 with M2, combined with its enrichment in the cytosol upon M2 expression strongly suggests that this association must occur in the cytosol, either directly or as a complex presumably en route to assembly and release of intact progeny virions. The induction of D-type cyclins is growth factor-dependent, and both mRNAs and proteins exhibit moderate oscillations in continuously proliferating cell populations (37.Sherr Sherr G1 phase progression: cycling on cue.Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar, 38.Sherr Sherr Cancer cell cycles.Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubM"

We costed scaling-up priority interventions to coverage targets.Strategy-targeted declines in Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum and Trichomonas vaginalis were applied to WHO-estimated regional burdens at 2012. Syndromic case management was costed for these curable STIs, symptomatic Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), and non-STI vaginal syndromes, with incrementally expanding etiologic diagnosis. Service unit costs were multiplied with clinic attendances and people targeted for screening or prevention, by income tier. Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination and screening were costed for coverage increasing to 60% of 10-year-old girls for vaccination, and 60% of women 30-49 years for twice-lifetime screening (including clinical follow-up for positive screens), by 2021.Strategy implementation will cost an estimated US$ 18.1 billion over 2016-2021 in 117 low- and middle-income countries. Cost drivers are HPV vaccination ($3.26 billion) and screening ($3.69 billion), adolescent chlamydia screening ($2.54 billion), and antenatal syphilis screening ($1.4 billion). Clinical management-of 18 million genital ulcers, 29-39 million urethral discharges and 42-53 million vaginal discharges annually-will cost $3.0 billion, including $818 million for service delivery and $1.4 billion for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing. Global costs increase from $2.6 billion to $ 4.0 billion over 2016-2021, driven by HPV services scale-up, despite vaccine price reduction. Sub-Saharan Africa, bearing 40% of curable STI burdens, covers 44% of global service needs and 30% of cost, the Western Pacific 15% of burden/need and 26% of cost, South-East Asia 20% of burden/need and 18% of cost.Costs of global STI control depend on price trends for HPV vaccines and chlamydia tests. Middle-income and especially low-income countries need increased investment, innovative financing, and synergizing with other health programs."
https://openalex.org/W2580155875,"Background Pathophysiological investigation of disease in a suitable animal model is a classical approach towards development of a credible therapeutic strategy. This study examined appropriate insulin level in selecting animal model for type 2 diabetes (T2D) studies. Method Albino Wistar rats (150-200g) were divided into two groups fed with commercially available normal-diet-feed (NDF) and water or fortified diet feed (FDF) (10g NDF per gram of margarine) with 20% fructose solution as drinking water. After 6 weeks of dietary regimen both groups were divided into 5 sub-groups and injected intraperitoneally with a graded dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (0, 25, 35, 45 & 55mg/kg bw.). Result The result showed that the FDF-fed rats increased significantly in body weight, basal serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose levels as compared to NDF-fed rats. Ten days post STZ induction, the groups treated with STZ (45 & 55 mg/kg) developed frank hyperglycaemia with < 46.8% serum insulin, a severe deficiency typical of diabetes type 1. The NDF25 and NDF35 groups with 75.7% and 64.4% serum insulin respectively presented relative normoglycemia, whereas the FDF35 (85.8% serum insulin) were notably hyperglycaemia (>300 mg/dL) throughout the 6weeks post diabetes confirmation. These FDF35 rats were sensitive to glibenclamide, metformin and pioglitazone in lowering hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia Conclusion The hyperglycaemia stability of the FDF35 rats (85.5% insulin) together with their sensitivity to 3 different hypoglycaemic drugs strongly suggests their suitability as a non-genetic model of T2D. Hence the study shows that circulating serum insulin ≥ 85.8% with overt hyperglycaemia may be utilized as the benchmark in selecting rat models for T2D studies."
https://openalex.org/W2579964976,"Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus is an important virulence attribute because of its potential to induce persistent antibiotic resistance, retard phagocytosis and either attenuate or promote inflammation, depending upon the disease syndrome, in vivo. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential significance of strength of biofilm formation by clinical bovine mastitis-associated S. aureus in mammary tissue damage by using a mouse mastitis model.Two S. aureus strains of the same capsular phenotype with different biofilm forming strengths were used to non-invasively infect mammary glands of lactating mice. Biofilm forming potential of these strains were determined by tissue culture plate method, ica typing and virulence gene profile per detection by PCR. Delivery of the infectious dose of S. aureus was directly through the teat lactiferous duct without invasive scraping of the teat surface. Both bacteriological and histological methods were used for analysis of mammary gland pathology of mice post-infection.Histopathological analysis of the infected mammary glands revealed that mice inoculated with the strong biofilm forming S. aureus strain produced marked acute mastitic lesions, showing profuse infiltration predominantly with neutrophils, with evidence of necrosis in the affected mammary glands. In contrast, the damage was significantly less severe in mammary glands of mice infected with the weak biofilm-forming S. aureus strain. Although both IL-1β and TNF-α inflammatory biomarkers were produced in infected mice, level of TNF-α produced was significantly higher (p<0.05) in mice inoculated with strong biofilm forming S. aureus than the weak biofilm forming strain.This finding suggests an important role of TNF-α in mammary gland pathology post-infection with strong biofilm-forming S. aureus in the acute mouse mastitis model, and offers an opportunity for the development of novel strategies for reduction of mammary tissue damage, with or without use of antimicrobials and/or anti-inflammatory compounds for the treatment of bovine mastitis."

The pancreatic beta cell is ranked among the most specialized cells in the human body, functioning as a sole source for providing insulin in response to the blood glucose level (1.Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Renström E. Gromada J. Barg S. Göpel S. The cell physiology of biphasic insulin secretion.News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 72-77PubMed Google Scholar). After a meal, beta cells are stimulated not only to secrete insulin but also to replenish the intracellular insulin stores by up-regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis. As much as 20–50% of the total protein synthesized in a beta cell is proinsulin under stimulation conditions (2.Eizirik D.L. Colli M.L. Ortis F. The role of inflammation in insulitis and beta cell loss in type 1 diabetes.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2009; 5: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Every six insulin molecules need two zinc ions to form a hexameric complex that is crystallized in the insulin secretory granules (3.Dunn M.F. Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer: a review.Biometals. 2005; 18: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As a result, pancreatic beta cells have one of the highest zinc concentrations among mammalian cells with estimated values between 10 to 20 mm in insulin granules (4.Dodson G. Steiner D.

It is not clear, however, whether the granule-resident ZnT8 is linked to the insulin secretory pathway and how glucose stimulation may modulate the level of ZnT8 surface display.

Cell- or antibody-mediated autoimmune responses may be directly targeted at ZnT8 displayed on the beta cell surface either in a form of processed ZnT8 peptides associated with MHC class I molecules or intact ZnT8 self-antigen. Tracking the surface display of intact ZnT8 is the first step in closing a knowledge gap regarding how ZnT8 self-antigen may be exposed to extracellular immune surveillance before the onset of beta cell destruction. In particular, a putative coupling between the GSIS 3The abbreviations used are: GSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretionFSECfluorescence size exclusion HPLCpAbpolyclonal antibodyDDMdodecyl maltosideKRBHKrebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES. and ZnT8 surface display may enforce a positive feedback loop of beta cell destruction, starting from a moderate initial beta cell loss to a compensatory increase of GSIS/ZnT8 exposure that exacerbates autoimmune insults and beta cell loss. As such, the coupling between GSIS and ZnT8 surfacing may contribute to a vicious cycle of disease progression to overt type 1 diabetes with an ultimate loss of beta cell mass and deterioration of glycemic control (29.Atkinson M.A. Bluestone J.A.

A critical technical barrier to tracking ZnT8 on the surface of live beta cells is the lack of a specific and sensitive ZnT8 tracer. Here, we report structure-guided tagging and specific immunofluorescence staining of ZnT8 on the extracellular surface of INS-1E cells (30.Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Glucose sensitivity and metabolism-secretion coupling studied during two-year continuous culture in INS-1E insulinoma cells.Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) that stably expressed tagged ZnT8. Flow cytometry quantification of ZnT8 surface display revealed a sigmoidal correlation with GSIS. Further analysis of endogenous ZnT8 surfacing in clonal INS-1E cells demonstrated that ZnT8 was abundantly displayed on the cell surface in a GSIS-dependent fashion, thereby providing direct experimental evidence to link increased insulin secretion and ZnT8 self-antigen exposure. Moreover, specific antibody labeling of tagged-ZnT8 on the cell surface enabled flow cytometry sorting of heterogeneous INS-1E cells to subpopulations with varied GSIS phenotypes, suggesting that ZnT8 may be used as a surface biomarker for tracking and isolating functional beta cells in mixed cell populations. The luminal face of a granular ZnT8 would be displayed on the cell surface if ZnT8 is translocated to the plasma membrane after insulin granule exocytosis (Fig. 1A). The X-ray structure of a bacterial ZnT8 homolog (YiiP) suggested that a ZnT8 homodimer adopts a Y-shaped immunoglobulin-like architecture (31.Lu M. Chai J. Fu D. Structural basis for autoregulation of the zinc transporter YiiP.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32.Lu M. Fu D. Structure of the zinc transporter YiiP.Science. 2007; 317: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This structural similarity may give rise to a specific and stable ZnT8-antibody complex through dual epitope-paratope recognition and interlock binding (Fig. 1A). Guided by homology modeling, we inserted an octapeptide FLAG epitope to the ZnT8 extracellular loops. In addition, we also added a green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag (33.Shaner N.C. Lambert G.G. Chammas A. Ni Y. Cranfill P.J. Baird M.A. Sell B.R. Allen J.R. Day R.N. Israelsson M. Davidson M.W. Wang J. A bright monomeric green fluorescent protein derived from Branchiostoma lanceolatum.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) to the cytosolic C terminus (Fig. 1A). The folding of the tagged-ZnT8 in the detergent extract of stably transfected INS-1E cells was examined by fluorescence size exclusion HPLC (FSEC). ZnT8 with a C-terminal GFP fusion tag (termed ZnT8-GFP) revealed a major monodispersed GFP fluorescence peak as reported previously (34.Merriman C. Huang Q. Rutter G.A. Fu D. Lipid-tuned zinc transport activity of human znt8 protein correlates with risk for type-2 diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26950-26957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inserting a FLAG epitope at one of the nine sites on the ZnT8 extracellular surface yielded only one tagged construct that exhibited a monodispersed FSEC profile. Structure modeling indicated that the FLAG epitope was inserted to the most exposed section of this doubly-tagged FLAG-ZnT8-GFP construct, termed ZnT8-FLAG/GFP (Fig. 1A). Anti-GFP and anti-FLAG Western blotting confirmed the expression of ZnT8-GFP or ZnT8-FLAG/GFP in pooled stable INS-1E transfectants, corresponding to a major protein band between the 50 and 75 kDa markers (Fig. 1B). In contrast, anti-FLAG and anti-GFP signals were not detected in non-transfected INS-1E cells (Fig. 1B). Endogenous rat ZnT8 was detected by an anti-ZnT8 antibody, showing strong immunoblotting signals below the 50 kDa marker in both stably transfected and non-transfected INS-1E cells (left panel, Fig. 1C). The observed molecular mass between 45 and 50 kDa for rat ZnT8 (calculated Mr = 40.1 kDa) matched the manufacture's specification (Proteintech). On the same anti-ZnT8 blot, however, ZnT8-GFP and ZnT8-FLAG/GFP were barely detectable above the 50-kDa marker. Because the anti-ZnT8 antibody recognized a linear peptide epitope at the cytosolic N terminus, the presence of FLAG tag on the extracellular surface or GFP tag at the C terminus was unlikely to affect anti-ZnT8 immunoblotting. This assumption was confirmed experimentally with stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing ZnT8-GFP and ZnT8-FLAG/GFP. Both tagged ZnT8 variants in HEK293 cells yielded positive anti-ZnT8 immunoreactivities on the Western blot, but endogenous ZnT8 was not detected (right panel, Fig. 1C). The lack of the endogenous ZnT8 signal in HEK293 cells was consistent with cell-specific expression of ZnT8 restricted to pancreatic beta cells. Taken together, our results indicated that FLAG and GFP tagging did not affect anti-ZnT8 immunodetection. The low ZnT8-GFP and ZnT8-FLAG/GFP signals observed in stably transfected INS-1E cells (left panel, Fig. 1C) suggested that the expression levels of both tagged-ZnT8 variants were negligible relative to that of endogenous ZnT8. The dual epitope-paratope recognition and interlock binding in the predicted antibody-ZnT8 complex (Fig. 1A) were expected to yield higher binding affinity and a degree of conformation specificity. We tested a rabbit polyclonal (pAb) and a mouse monoclonal (mAb) anti-FLAG antibody for binding stability and specificity. FSEC analysis of detergent extracts of stably transfected INS-1E cells showed that both anti-FLAG pAb and mAb shifted the ZnT8-FLAG/GFP peak from an unbound position at 14.5 min (red arrows, Fig. 2A) to a complex position at 13.5 min (purple arrows). The difference between the apparent molecular masses of these two peak positions was ∼150 kDa, corresponding to a 1-to-1 antibody-to-ZnT8 binding (Fig. 1A). As a negative control, neither anti-FLAG pAb nor mAb was found to cause any detectable change to the peak position of ZnT8-GFP (Fig. 2A), indicating that the observed peak shift was specific to the FLAG epitope. Confocal microscopy imaging of GFP fluorescence in live stably transfected INS-1E cells showed that ZnT8-FLAG/GFP or ZnT8-GFP was mainly confined intracellularly, but occasional ring-like GFP fluorescence was observed around the cell outer boundaries (Fig. 2C). Rabbit anti-FLAG pAb or mouse anti-FLAG mAb labeling to stable ZnT8-FLAG/GFP transfectants followed by staining with a red fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody yielded discrete red puncta around the surface of INS-1E cells (Fig. 2, B and D). The surface staining was specific to the FLAG tag because no surface staining was detected on INS-1E cells stably expressing ZnT8-GFP (Fig. 2, C and E). The specificity of anti-FLAG staining was further supported by mutual inhibitions of rabbit anti-FLAG pAb and mouse anti-FLAG mAb labeling to the same FLAG epitope on the cell surface. To extend the imaging analysis of individual cells to the bulk cell population, we analyzed ZnT8-FLAG/GFP surface display by flow cytometry coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of stably transfected INS-1E cells over 10 million live cell counting events (Fig. 3A). Cellular GFP fluorescence and surface anti-FLAG staining exhibited >1000- and 100-fold fluorescence increases above the respective autofluorescence background (Fig. 3A). Three distinct cell populations were observed on the GFP fluorescence scale (x axis); cells in red boxes with mid-range GFP intensity showed a large spread of anti-FLAG fluorescence intensity on the y axis, whereas the low or high GFP cells in orange or blue boxes displayed limited anti-FLAG changes at a basal level (Fig. 3A). Thus, the mid-GFP cells were further gated into four subpopulations with increasing intensities of surface anti-FLAG staining (red boxes, Fig. 3A). All GFP-positive stable transfectants were sorted into six cell populations (group 1–6) (Fig. 3A). The post-FACS cells were solubilized by detergent and then analyzed by FSEC, showing a major ZnT8-FLAG/GFP peak (red arrows, Fig. 3B) in the mid-GFP population (group 2–5). A minor GFP fluorescence peak (blue arrows, Fig. 3B) with an apparent molecular mass of a GFP monomer (∼30 kDa) was eluted after the main ZnT8-FLAG/GFP peak. This GFP peak was also observed in low and high GFP populations, but the peak height of the high GFP cells (box 6) was >1000-fold higher than that of low-GFP cells (box 1) (Fig. 3B). This dramatic difference in the cellular GFP amount was confirmed by the observation of exceedingly bright GFP fluorescence in high GFP cells using confocal microscopy. Despite a complete loss of the ZnT8-FLAG/GFP protein in high-GFP cells (Fig. 3B), only the full-length ZnT8-FLAG/GFP mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, suggesting that the large GFP buildup in high GFP cells was a result of proteolytic degradation of the ZnT8-FLAG/GFP protein as opposed to an overexpression of GFP from a truncated ZnT8-FLAG/GFP genomic sequence. Because the GFP signal in high GFP cells was irrelevant to the cellular ZnT8-FLAG/GFP protein level, this population (3–4% of total cells) was excluded from analysis. Fluorescence data corresponding to each of the five sorted cell populations (group 1–5) were used to construct calibration curves that correlated the FSEC peak height to the fluorescence intensity of cellular GFP (Fig. 4C) or cell surface anti-FLAG staining (Fig. 4D). The linear correlations between the level of ZnT8-FLAG/GFP expression (FSEC peak height) with cellular GFP signal and surface anti-FLAG staining validated the linear responsiveness of flow cytometry measurements.FIGURE 4GSIS-dependent ZnT8-FLAG/GFP surface display.

Although ZnT8-FLAG/GFP expression varied among individual INS-1E cells, the bivariate flow cytometric profiles in Fig. 4A showed that the surface staining intensity of ZnT8-FLAG/GFP increased linearly with the GFP intensity of cellular ZnT8-FLAG/GFP expression. Thus, the anti-FLAG/GFP ratio obtained from a linear regression analysis over the entire mid-GFP population was used to normalize surface-displayed ZnT8-FLAG/GFP to total cellular ZnT8-FLAG/GFP expression (Fig. 4A). Mid-GFP cells were exposed to a series of glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 17 mm, exhibiting a linear increase of the anti-FLAG/GFP ratio with the glucose concentration (Fig. 4B). The ratio at 17 mm glucose was 2.2-fold above a basal level at 0 mm glucose. GSIS from replicated cells was measured over the same glucose concentration range, showing a typical glucose-dependent GSIS profile (Fig. 4C). Two GSIS blockers, diazoxide and nifedipine (35.Mariot P. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Tolbutamide and diazoxide influence insulin secretion by changing the concentration but not the action of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in beta cells.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36.Doyle M.E. Egan J.M. Pharmacological agents that directly modulate insulin secretion.Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 105-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), were found to inhibit ZnT8-FLAG/GFP surface display at stimulatory glucose concentrations but had little effect at the basal glucose level (Fig. 4B). Concomitantly, both diazoxide and nifedipine inhibited GSIS without significant effects on the basal insulin release (Fig. 4C). The parallel inhibitory effects of diazoxide and nifedipine linked the ZnT8 surface display to GSIS. Plotting anti-FLAG/GFP ratios obtained at various glucose concentrations versus corresponding GSIS levels revealed a sigmoidal relationship between ZnT8-FLAG/GFP surface display and insulin secretion (Fig. 4D). Next we explored the possibility of sorting GSIS phenotype based on surface anti-FLAG staining. Live stably transfected INS-1E cells were labeled and sorted into four populations using the following window settings: mid-GFP with anti-FLAG (+) or (−), low or high GFP with anti-FLAG (−) (Fig. 5A). The sorted cells were reseeded and grown to confluence and then subjected to GSIS. The mid-GFP cells exhibited a small difference in GSIS between the anti-FLAG positive and negative cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that these two populations shared a similar GSIS phenotype despite a large difference in surface anti-FLAG staining (Fig. 5A). Also, anti-ZnT8 immunoblotting analysis revealed a similar level of endogenous ZnT8 expression between the MG(+) and MG(−) population (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, low and high GFP cells (LG(−) and HG(−)), although both anti-FLAG-negative, exhibited a 2.3-fold difference in GSIS at a stimulatory glucose concentration of 17 mm (Fig. 5B). The hypersecreting phenotype of high GFP cells was accompanied by a 4.6-fold increase in endogenous ZnT8 expression over that of low GFP cells (Fig. 5C). Plotting the level of the endogenous ZnT8 expression in each of four sorted cell populations against the corresponding GSIS level revealed strong correlations between the endogenous ZnT8 level and GSIS either at a basal (r = 0.90) or a stimulatory (r = 0.91) glucose concentration (Fig. 5D). This result suggested that the GSIS phenotype was reliant on endogenous ZnT8 expression but independent of surface anti-FLAG staining. This observation may be explained by a high level of endogenous ZnT8 expression overriding any phenotypic perturbation of GSIS caused by a negligible level of ZnT8-FLAG/GFP expression (left panel, Fig. 1C). The hypersecreting beta cells were <5% of total cells, forming a distinct population cluster in the bivariate dot-plot (Fig. 5A). As a negative control, anti-FLAG labeling to stably transfected ZnT8-GFP INS-1E cells yielded a continuous GFP fluorescence distribution along the x axis (Fig. 5E). A discrete hypersecreting subpopulation was not observed. To detect the surface display of endogenous ZnT8, we biotinylated live INS-1E cells using a membrane impermeant, amine-reactive, and thiol-cleavable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. The resultant biotinylated surface proteins were detergent-solubilized, immobilized to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads, and then eluted by DTT. Immunoblotting detection of bound (biotinylated) or unbound (non-biotinylated) proteins in the cell lysate showed that Na+/K+ ATPase, a housekeeping cell surface marker, was completely captured by the beads and appeared in the eluate (Fig. 6A), whereas tubulin, an intracellular marker, was only observed in the unbound fraction (Fig. 6B). These control experiments indicated that Na+/K+ ATPase was fully biotinylated, whereas tu"

Using an in vitro model of the BBB, we identify NHE9, an endosomal cation/proton exchanger, as a novel regulator of this system. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) that constitute the BBB receive brain iron status information via paracrine signals from ensheathing astrocytes. In hBMVECs, we show that NHE9 expression is up-regulated very early in a physiological response invoked by paracrine signals from iron-starved astrocytes. Ectopic expression of NHE9 in hBMVECs without external cues induced up-regulation of the transferrin receptor (TfR) and down-regulation of ferritin, leading to an increase in iron uptake. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NHE9 localizes to recycling endosomes in hBMVECs where it raises the endosomal pH. The ensuing alkalization of the endosomal lumen increased translocation of TfRs to the hBMVEC membrane. TfRs on the membrane were previously shown to facilitate both recycling-dependent and -independent iron uptake. We propose that NHE9 regulates TfR-dependent, recycling-independent iron uptake in hBMVECs by fine-tuning the endosomal pH in response to paracrine signals and is therefore an important regulator in iron mobilization pathway at the BBB.

The study objective is to determine the prevalence of this pathogens in Peruvian children with acute respiratory infections. Methods A consecutive cross-sectional study was conducted in Lima, Peru from May 2009 to September 2010. A total of 675 children admitted with clinical diagnoses of acute respiratory infections were tested for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical symptoms were registered by the attending physician. Results Mycoplasma pneumonia was detected in 25.19% (170/675) of nasopharyngeal samples and Chlamydia pneumonia in 10.52% (71/675). The most common symptoms in patients with these atypical pathogens were rhinorrhea, cough and fever. A higher prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases were registered in summer, between December 2009 and March 2010. Conclusions Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumonia are a significant cause of morbidity in Peruvian children with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Further studies should evaluate the use of reliable techniques such as PCR in Peru in order to avoid underdiagnoses of these atypical pathogens."

Although the genomes of some songbird species were sequenced recently, the chromosomal organization of these species is mostly unknown. Here we focused on the two most studied songbird species in neuroscience, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and the canary (Serinus canaria). In order to clarify these issues and also to integrate chromosome data with their assembled genomes, we used classical and molecular cytogenetics in both zebra finch and canary to define their chromosomal homology, localization of heterochromatic blocks and distribution of rDNA clusters. We confirmed the same diploid number (2n = 80) in both species, as previously reported. FISH experiments confirmed the occurrence of multiple paracentric and pericentric inversions previously found in other species of Passeriformes, providing a cytogenetic signature for this order, and corroborating data from in silico analyses. Additionally, compared to other Passeriformes, we detected differences in the zebra finch karyotype concerning the morphology of some chromosomes, in the distribution of 5S rDNA clusters, and an inversion in chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W2582885342,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that hepatitis E virus (HEV) can be transmitted across species. According to previous reports, swine HEV has two genotypes, genotype 3 and 4, and both can infect humans by the fecal-oral route. Thus, it is crucial for the control of HEV zoonotic transmission to evaluate the dynamics of viral shedding and distribution in different tissues during cross-species infection by HEV. In this study, rabbits were infected with genotype 4 swine HEV by the intraperitoneal route. The results showed that HEV RNA not only shed in the feces but also in the saliva of some rabbits during infection with swine HEV. Viremia appeared late after infection, and anti-HEV IgG was not obvious until the appearance of high viremia levels. After the rabbits were euthanized, a histopathological examination showed that the livers developed overt hepatitis accompanied by an elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Furthermore, HEV RNA was detected in various tissues, especially in the salivary glands and tonsils. Subsequently, negative-stranded HEV RNA was practiced in tissues with positive HEV RNA, which demonstrated that HEV replicated in the tissues. Next, we harvested additional tissues from the liver, salivary gland, tonsil, spleen, thymus gland, lymph node and intestine, which are known as replication sites of swine HEV. Additionally, we also observed the HEV antigen distributed in the organs above through immunohistochemical staining. These results demonstrate that rabbits could be used as an animal model for researching cross-species infection of genotype 4 HEV. It is also noteworthy that HEV can shed in the saliva and presents the risk of droplet transmission. These new data provide valuable information for understanding cross-species infection by HEV."
https://openalex.org/W2580664241,"Background One Health (OH) is an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to human and animal health that aims to break down conventional research and policy ‘silos’. OH has been used to develop strategies for zoonotic Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID). However, the ethical case for OH as an alternative to more traditional public health approaches is largely absent from the discourse. To study the ethics of OH, we examined perceptions of the human health and ecological priorities for the management of zoonotic EID in the Southeast Asia country of Singapore. Methods We conducted a mixed methods study using a modified Delphi technique with a panel of 32 opinion leaders and 11 semi-structured interviews with a sub-set of those experts in Singapore. Panellists rated concepts of OH and priorities for zoonotic EID preparedness planning using a series of scenarios developed through the study. Interview data were examined qualitatively using thematic analysis. Findings We found that panellists agreed that OH is a cross-disciplinary collaboration among the veterinary, medical, and ecological sciences, as well as relevant government agencies encompassing animal, human, and environmental health. Although human health was often framed as the most important priority in zoonotic EID planning, our qualitative analysis suggested that consideration of non-human animal health and welfare was also important for an effective and ethical response. The panellists also suggested that effective pandemic planning demands regional leadership and investment from wealthier countries to better enable international cooperation. Conclusion We argue that EID planning under an OH approach would benefit greatly from an ethical ecological framework that accounts for justice in human, animal, and environmental health."

To assess the CO2 flux and its relationship to environmental factors, the eddy covariance method was used to evaluate the diurnal cycle and seasonal pattern of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of a cultivated pasture in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) on the Qinghai−Tibetan Plateau from January 1 to December 31, 2008. The diurnal variations in the NEE and ecosystem respiration (Re) during the growing season exhibited single-peak patterns, the maximum and minimum CO2 uptake observed during the noon hours and night; and the maximum and minimum Re took place in the afternoon and early morning, respectively. The minimum hourly NEE rate and the maximum hourly Re rate were −7.89 and 5.03 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1, respectively. The NEE and Re showed clear seasonal variations, with lower values in winter and higher values in the peak growth period. The highest daily values for C uptake and Re were observed on August 12 (−2.91 g C m−2 d−1) and July 28 (5.04 g C m−2 day−1), respectively. The annual total NEE and Re were −140.01 and 403.57 g C m−2 year−1, respectively. The apparent quantum yield (α) was −0.0275 μmol μmol−1 for the entire growing period, and the α values for the pasture’s light response curve varied with the leaf area index (LAI), air temperature (Ta), soil water content (SWC) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Piecewise regression results indicated that the optimum Ta and VPD for the daytime NEE were 14.1°C and 0.65 kPa, respectively. The daytime NEE decreased with increasing SWC, and the temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q10) was 3.0 during the growing season, which was controlled by the SWC conditions. Path analysis suggested that the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm (Tsoil) was the most important environmental factor affecting daily variations in NEE during the growing season, and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was the major limiting factor for this cultivated pasture."

While complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is commonly used for low back pain (LBP), there are no studies reporting use of integrative Korean medicine in FBSS patients. Methods Patients with pain continuing after back surgery or recurring within 1 year and visual analogue scale (VAS) of LBP or leg pain of ≥6 (total n = 120) were recruited at 2 hospital sites from November 2011 to September 2014. Weekly sessions of integrative Korean medicine treatment were conducted for 16 weeks (herbal medicine, acupuncture/electroacupuncture, pharmacopuncture/bee venom pharmacopuncture, and Chuna manual therapy) with additional follow-ups at 24 weeks and 1 year. Outcome measures included VAS of LBP and leg pain (primary outcome), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36), medical use, and patient global impression of change (PGIC). Results VAS of LBP and leg pain improved at 6 months (LBP from 6.1±2.0 at baseline to 2.9±2.3; and leg pain from 5.4±2.6 to 2.4±2.5, respectively). Eighty patients (66.7%) showed improvement of 50% or more in main pain of LBP or leg pain from baseline. Disability and quality of life also improved at 6 months (ODI from 41.3±12.3 at baseline to 23.6±13.6; and SF-36 from 42.8±14.5 to 62.7±16.8). At 1 year follow-up, conventional medical management use decreased, improvement in pain and disability was maintained, and 79.2% reported improvement of PGIC. Conclusions Despite limitations as an observational study, integrative Korean medicine treatment showed positive results in pain, function, and quality of life of FBSS patients."

However, specific genetic information of each TSZ population has been lacking and has caused difficulties in designing programs such as selection, crossbreeding, breed improvement or conservation. This study was designed to evaluate the genetic structure, assess genetic relationships, and to identify signatures of selection among cattle of Tanzania with the main goal of understanding genetic relationship, variation and uniqueness among them.The Illumina Bos indicus SNP 80K BeadChip was used to genotype genome wide SNPs in 168 DNA samples obtained from three strains of TSZ cattle namely Maasai, Tarime and Sukuma as well as two comparative breeds; Boran and Friesian. Population structure and signatures of selection were examined using principal component analysis (PCA), admixture analysis, pairwise distances (FST), integrated haplotype score (iHS), identical by state (IBS) and runs of homozygosity (ROH). There was a low level of inbreeding (F~0.01) in the TSZ population compared to the Boran and Friesian breeds. The analyses of FST, IBS and admixture identified no considerable differentiation between TSZ trains. Importantly, common ancestry in Boran and TSZ were revealed based on admixture and IBD, implying gene flow between two populations. In addition, Friesian ancestry was found in Boran. A few common significant iHS were detected, which may reflect influence of recent selection in each breed or strain.Population admixture and selection signatures could be applied to develop conservation plan of TSZ cattle as well as future breeding programs in East African cattle."

Noise is inevitable in neuronal systems and can change the electrical activities of neuron in different ways. Many previous theoretical studies about the impacts of noise on spiral waves focus an unbounded Gaussian noise and even colored noise. In this paper, the impacts of bounded noise and rewiring of network on the formation and instability of spiral waves are discussed in small-world (SW) network of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons through numerical simulations, and possible statistical analysis will be carried out. Firstly, we present SW network of HH neurons subjected to bounded noise. Then, it is numerically demonstrated that bounded noise with proper intensity σ, amplitude A, or frequency f can facilitate the formation of spiral waves when rewiring probability p is below certain thresholds. In other words, bounded noise-induced resonant behavior can occur in the SW network of neurons. In addition, rewiring probability p always impairs spiral waves, while spiral waves are confirmed to be robust for small p, thus shortcut-induced phase transition of spiral wave with the increase of p is induced. Furthermore, statistical factors of synchronization are calculated to discern the phase transition of spatial pattern, and it is confirmed that larger factor of synchronization is approached with increasing of rewiring probability p, and the stability of spiral wave is destroyed."
https://openalex.org/W2580861634,"TRPM7 channels participate in a variety of physiological/pathological processes. TRPM7 currents are modulated by protons but opposing effects of external pH (pHo) (potentiation vs inhibition) have been reported. TRPM7 has been less studied in human cardiomyocytes than in heart-derived non-cardiomyocyte cells. We used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on isolated human atrial cardiomyocytes to investigate the impact of an acidic pHo on the TRPM7 current. With voltage-dependent and other ion channels inhibited, cardiomyocytes were challenged with external acidification in either the presence or the absence of extracellular divalent cations. TRPM7 outward and inward currents were increased by acidic pHo in extracellular medium containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, but suppressed by acidic pHo in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+. The potentiating effect in the presence of extracellular divalents occurred at pHo below 6 and was voltage-dependent. The inhibitory effect in the absence of extracellular divalents was already marked at pHo of 6 and was practically voltage-independent. TRPM7 current density was higher in cardiomyocytes from patients with history of coronary vascular disease and the difference compared to cardiomyocytes from patients without history of myocardial ischemia increased with acidic pHo. We demonstrate that proton-induced modification of TRPM7 currents depends on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+. Variability of the TRPM7 current density in human cardiomyocytes is related to the clinical history, being higher in atrial fibrillation and in ischemic cardiomyopathy."

This area was chosen because it was the most heavily radionuclide contaminated part of Chiba Prefecture and it neighbors metropolitan Tokyo. Measurements were performed using a 3-in × 3-in NaI(Tl) scintillation spectrometer in June 2015. The survey route covered the whole Tokatsu area which includes six cities. A heterogeneous distribution of absorbed dose rate in air was observed on the dose distribution map. Especially, higher absorbed dose rates in air exceeding 80 nGy h-1 were observed along national roads constructed using high porosity asphalt, whereas lower absorbed dose rates in air were observed along local roads constructed using low porosity asphalt. The difference between these asphalt types resulted in a heterogeneous dose distribution in the Tokatsu area. The mean of the contribution ratio of artificial radionuclides to absorbed dose rate in air measured 4 years after the accident was 29% (9-50%) in the Tokatsu area. The maximum absorbed dose rate in air, 201 nGy h-1 was observed at Kashiwa City. Radiocesium was deposited in the upper 1 cm surface layer of the high porosity asphalt which was collected in Kashiwa City and the environmental half-life of the absorbed dose rate in air was estimated to be 1.7 years."
https://openalex.org/W2580004582,"Human chitotriosidase (HCHT) is involved in immune response to chitin-containing pathogens in humans. The enzyme is able to degrade chitooligosaccharides as well as crystalline chitin. The catalytic domain of HCHT is connected to the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) through a flexible hinge region. In humans, two active isoforms of HCHT are found–the full length enzyme and its truncated version lacking CBM and the hinge region. The active site architecture of HCHT is reminiscent to that of the reducing-end exo-acting processive chitinase ChiA from bacterium Serratia marcescens (SmChiA). However, the presence of flexible hinge region and occurrence of two active isoforms are reminiscent to that of non-processive endo-chitinase from S. marcescens, SmChiC. Although the studies on soluble chitin derivatives suggest the endo-character of HCHT, the mode of action of the enzyme on crystalline chitin is not known. Here, we made a thorough characterization of HCHT in terms of the mode of action, processivity, binding, and rate constants for the catalysis and dissociation using α-chitin as substrate. HCHT efficiently released the end-label from reducing-end labelled chitin and had also high probability (95%) of endo-mode initiation of processive run. These results qualify HCHT as an endo-processive enzyme. Processivity and the rate constant of dissociation of HCHT were found to be in-between those, characteristic to processive exo-enzymes, like SmChiA and randomly acting non-processive endo-enzymes, like SmChiC. Apart from increasing the affinity for chitin, CBM had no major effect on kinetic properties of HCHT."

Complications comprise severe end-organ diseases and acute or chronic transplant rejection. Risk for CMV manifestation is stratified according to the CMV-IgG-serostatus, with donor+/recipient- (D+/R-) patients carrying the highest risk for CMV-replication. However, risk factors predisposing for primary infection in CMV-seronegative recipients are still not fully elucidated. Therefore, we monitored D+/R- high-risk patients undergoing kidney transplantation in combination with antiviral prophylaxis for the incidence of CMV-viremia for a median follow-up time of 784 days (156-1155 days). In this period, we analyzed the functional CMV-specific T cell response by intracellular cytokine staining and CMV-serology by ELISA. Only four of eight D+/R- patients developed clinically relevant CMV-viremia followed by seroconversion. Viremia triggered expansion of functional CMV-specific T cells correlating with protection against secondary CMV-reactivations. In contrast, all other patients remained permanently aviremic and showed no immunological correlate of infection after discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis for up to three years. Comparing cold ischemic times (CIT) of viremic (median = 1020 min; 720-1080 min) and aviremic patients (median = 335 min; 120-660 min) revealed significantly (p = 0.0286) protracted CIT in patients with primary CMV-infection. Taken together, primary CMV-infection affects only a subgroup of D+/R- patients correlating with length of CIT. Therefore, patients with extended CIT should be thoroughly monitored for CMV-replication well beyond discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis. In contrast, patients with short CIT remained permanently uninfected and might benefit from shorter prophylactic treatment."

Previous research has linked short-term training in CCH to improvements in attention and memory. Little is known about the potential impacts of long-term CCH practice on a broader array of executive functions and their potential neural substrates. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 36 practitioners with at least 5 years of CCH experience and 50 control subjects with no more than one month of CCH practice and investigated their differences in the three components of executive functions (i.e., shifting, updating, and inhibition). Valid resting-state fMRI data were collected from 31 CCH and 40 control participants. Compared with the controls, CCH individuals showed better updating (as measured by the Corsi Block Test) and inhibition (as measured by the Stroop Word-Color Test), but the two groups did not differ in shifting (as measured by a cue-target task). The CCH group showed stronger resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) than the control group in brain areas involved in updating and inhibition. These results suggested that long-term CCH training may be associated with improvements in specific aspects of executive functions and strengthened neural networks in related brain regions."

Genomic DNA was obtained from 216 Japanese and 227 Korean subjects. Four FGFR1 SNPs, namely, rs881301, rs6996321, rs4647905, and rs13317, were genotyped. These SNPs were tested for association with craniofacial measurements obtained from lateral and posteroanterior cephalometries, in which principle component analysis was performed to compress the data of the craniofacial measurements. We observed that SNPs rs13317 and rs6996321 were correlated with the overall head size and midfacial development, indicating that FGFR1 SNPs played crucial roles in the normal variation of human craniofacial morphology. Subjects with the derived alleles of SNPs rs13317 and rs6996321 had a small face and a facial pattern associated with a retruded midface and relatively wide-set eyes. These facial features were similar to but were milder than those of individuals with Pfeiffer syndrome, which is caused by a dysfunctional mutation in FGFR1."
https://openalex.org/W2581233927,"Among Kazakh-Chinese population in Xinjiang province of China, prevalence of obesity and hypertension were 40.1% and 50.3% respectively, the highest across all ethnic groups residing in this pastureland. Despite this, there remained a dearth of information regarding the association between the anthropometric measures [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) etc.] and indicators for hypertension control [achieved levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP), pulse pressure index (PPI), ankle-brachial index (ABI) etc.] among them.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Xinjiang to determine the distribution and inter-relationships of the anthropometric measures and indicators for achieved BP control as well as their predictors among hypertension patients of Kazakh-Chinese ethnicity. Out of 550 randomly selected patients, 516 completed the interview, anthropometry and BP assessments.In the sample population, average SBP, DBP and PP were 156.26±24.40mmHg, 87.55±14.73mmHg and 68.71±19.39mmHg respectively. Bivariate analysis identified age, gender, education, duration of hypertension, WC and BMI being factors influencing the achieved levels of BP. Adjusted multiple linear regression models elicited positive associations of age (βa = 0.152, p = 0.001) and duration of hypertension (βa = 0.132, p = 0.003) with achieved level of SBP as well as BMI (βa = 0.135, p = 0.002) with DBP. Age (βa = 0.207, p<0.001) and WHtR (βa = 0.304, p = 0.005) were positively and WC (βa = -0.406, p<0.001) was negatively associated with PPI. Increasing age (βa = -0.125, p = 0.005), female gender (βa = -0.122, p = 0.005) and 5years' duration of hypertension (βa = -0.091, p<0.039) were negatively associated with ABI. After adjustment for socio-demographic variables, hypertensive patients with (reference = without) abdominal obesity had 93% (p = 0.013) higher odds of missing the target BP control.Anthropometric measures and indicators for blood pressure control among Kazakh-Chinese patients were far beyond normal. Several anthropometric measures appeared useful for monitoring BP. Using them, regular screening and consequent targeted intervention were required urgently to control hypertension among Kazakh-Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2582415187,"Many studies have reported that genetic variants correlate with higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) or in-stent restenosis (ISR) after bare metal stent (BMS) implantation. However, there is limited data assessing the impact of these variants on ISR in patients treated with drug-eluting stent (DES). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of genetic risk factors on ISR in Chinese Han patients treated with DES.A total of 425 patients with a diagnosis of CAD who underwent successful revascularization in native coronary arteries with DES were included in this retrospective study. Genotyping was performed on six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (eNOS), the angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE), the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene (AT1R), the transforming growth factor beta gene (TGF-β), and the vascular endothelial growth factor gene (VEGF). Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was performed during the follow-up period to detect ISR. Logistic regression models were used to test for association.Fifty-four patients (12.7%) developed ISR during the follow-up period. Of the six analyzed SNPs, the frequency of the C allele of T786C polymorphism in eNOS was significantly higher in the ISR group (22.2%) compared to the non-ISR group (12.7%) (p<0.01). In the ISR group, the frequency of the TT, TC, and CC genotypes was 61.1%, 33.3%, and 5.6%, respectively, and in the non-ISR group, the frequencies were 76.8%, 21.0%, and 2.2%, respectively. The multivariable analysis adjusted for potential confounders and revealed that the T786C polymorphism increased the risk of ISR in both additive and dominant models with odds ratios of 1.870 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.079-3.240, p = 0.03) and 2.045 (95% CI: 1.056-3.958, p = 0.03), respectively.The eNOS T786C polymorphism was associated with ISR in Chinese Han patients treated with DES. Genotyping may be helpful to identify patients with higher risks of ISR after DES implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2952511083,"Experimental huts are part of the WHO process for testing and evaluation of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) in semi-field conditions. Experimental Hut Trials (EHTs) mostly focus on two main indicators (i.e., mortality and blood feeding reduction) that serve as efficacy criteria to obtain WHO interim recommendation. However, several other outputs that rely on counts of vectors collected in the huts are neglected although they can give useful information about vectors' behavior and personal protection provided by ITNs. In particular, EHTs allow to measure the deterrent effect and personal protection of ITNs. To provide a better assessment of ITNs efficacy, we performed a retrospective analysis of the deterrence and the personal protection against malaria transmission for 12 unwashed and 13 washed ITNs evaluated through EHTs conducted in West Africa. A significant deterrent effect was shown for six of the 12 unwashed ITNs tested. When washed 20 times, only three ITNs had significant deterrent effect (Rate Ratios (RR)<1; p<0.05) and three showed an apparent ""attractiveness"" (RR>1; p<0.01). When compared to the untreated net, all unwashed ITNs showed lower number of blood-fed Anopheles indicating a significant personal protection (RR<1, p<0.05). However, when washed 20 times, three ITNs that were found to be attractive did not significantly reduce human-vector contact (p>0.05). Current WHO efficacy criteria do not sufficiently take into account the deterrence effect of ITNs. Moreover, the deterrence variability is rarely discussed in EHT's reports. Our findings highlighted the long-range effect (deterrent or attractive) of ITNs that may have significant consequences for personal/community protection against malaria transmission. Indicators measuring the deterrence should be further considered for the evaluation of ITNs."
https://openalex.org/W2581347522,"In photosynthesis, the pigments chlorophyll a/b absorb light energy to convert to chemical energy in chloroplasts. Though most enzymes of chlorophyll biosynthesis from glutamyl-tRNA to chlorophyll a/b have been identified, the exact composition and regulation of the multimeric enzyme Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase (MPEC) is largely unknown. In this study, we isolated a rice pale-green leaf mutant m167 with yellow-green leaf phenotype across the whole lifespan. Chlorophyll content decreases 43–51% and the granal stacks of chloroplasts becomes thinner in m167. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, including Fv/Fm (the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII) and quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)), were lower in m167 than those in wild type plants (WT), and photosynthesis rate decreases 40% in leaves of m167 mutant compared with WT plants, which lead to yield reduction in m167. Genetic analysis revealed that yellow-green leaf phenotype of m167 is controlled by a single recessive genetic locus. By positional cloning, a single mutated locus, G286A (Alanine 96 to Threonine in protein), was found in the coding sequence of LOC_Os01g17170 (Rice Copper Response Defect 1, OsCRD1), encoding a putative subunit of MPEC. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that OsCRD1 is mainly expressed in green tissues of rice. Sequence alignment analysis of CRD1 indicated that Alanine 96 is very conserved in all green plants and photosynthetic bacteria. OsCRD1 protein mainly locates in chloroplast and the point mutation A96T in OsCRD1 does not change its location. Therefore, Alanine96 of OsCRD1 might be fundamental for MPEC activity, mutation of which leads to deficiency in chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development and decreases photosynthetic capacity in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2582734947,"Reassortment of genetic segments between and within influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) has been shown to generate novel reassortants with unique genetic characteristics. Based on hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, recent surveillance study has identified reassortment properties in B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus, which is currently used in the WHO-recommended influenza vaccine. To understand the potential reassortment patterns for all gene segments, four B/Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses and two unique reassortants (one each from Yamagata and Victoria) detected in Malaysia from 2012–2014 were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Each gene was phylogenetically classified into lineages, clades and sub-clades. Three B/Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses from Yamagata lineage were found to be intra-clade reassortants, possessing PA and NA genes derived from Stockholm/12-like sub-clade, while the remaining genes from Wisconsin/01-like sub-clade (both sub-clades were within Yamagata Clade 3/Yam-3). However, the other B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus had NS gene that derived from Stockholm/12-like sub-clade instead of Wisconsin/01-like sub-clade. One inter-clade reassortant had Yamagata Clade 2/Yam-2-derived HA and NP, and its remaining genes were Yam-3-derived. Within Victoria Clade 1/Vic-1 in Victoria lineage, one virus had intra-clade reassortment properties: HA and PB2 from Vic-1B sub-clade, MP and NS from a unique sub-clade “Vic-1C”, and the remaining genes from Vic-1A sub-clade. Although random reassortment event may generate unique reassortants, detailed phylogenetic classification of gene segments showed possible genetic linkage between PA and NA genes in B/Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses, which requires further investigation. Understanding on reassortment patterns in influenza B evolution may contribute to future vaccine design."

GlmA is a member of the glycosidase hydrolase (GH)-A superfamily-subfamily 35 and is a novel enzyme in terms of its primary structure. Here, we present the crystal structure of GlmA in complex with glucosamine at 1.27 Å resolution. The structure reveals that a monomeric form of GlmA shares structural homology with GH42 α-galactosidases, whereas most of the spatial positions of the active site residues are identical to those of GH35 α-galactosidases. We found that upon dimerization, the active site of GlmA changes shape, enhancing its ability to hydrolyze the smaller substrate in a manner similar to that of homotrimeric GH42 α-galactosidase. However, GlmA can differentiate glucosamine from galactose based on one charged residue while using the “evolutionary heritage residue” it shares with GH35 α-galactosidase.

https://openalex.org/W2580781053,"IcmF is a 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the carbon skeleton rearrangement of isobutyryl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. It is a bifunctional protein resulting from the fusion of a G-protein chaperone with GTPase activity and the cofactor- and substrate-binding mutase domains with isomerase activity. IcmF is prone to inactivation during catalytic turnover, thus setting up its dependence on a cofactor repair system. Herein, we demonstrate that the GTPase activity of IcmF powers the ejection of the inactive cob(II)alamin cofactor and requires the presence of an acceptor protein, adenosyltransferase, for receiving it. Adenosyltransferase in turn converts cob(II)alamin to AdoCbl in the presence of ATP and a reductant. The repaired cofactor is then reloaded onto IcmF in a GTPase-gated step. The mechanistic details of cofactor loading and offloading from the AdoCbl-dependent IcmF are distinct from those of the better characterized and homologous methylmalonyl-CoA mutase/G-protein chaperone system.

https://openalex.org/W2581456259,"Plant litter is an indispensable component of constructed wetlands, but how the submergence of plant litter affects their ecosystem functions and services, such as water purification, is still unclear. Moreover, it is also unclear whether the effects of plant litter submergence depend on other factors such as the duration of litter submergence, water source or litter species identity. Here we conducted a greenhouse experiment by submerging the litter of 7 wetland plant species into three types of water substrates and monitoring changes in water nutrient concentrations. Litter submergence affected water quality positively via decreasing the concentration of nitrate nitrogen and negatively via increasing the concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus. The effects of litter submergence depended on the duration of litter submergence, the water source, the litter species identity, and the plant life form. Different plant species had different effects on the water nutrient concentrations during litter submergence, and the effects of floating plants might be more negative than that of emergent plants. These results are novel evidence of how the submergence of different plant (life form) litter may affect the purification function of constructed wetlands. For water at low eutrophication levels, submerging a relative small amount of plant litter might improve water quality, via benefiting the denitrification process in water. These findings emphasized the management of floating plant litter (a potential removal) during the maintenance of human-controlled wetland ecosystems and provided a potential tool to improve the water quality of constructed wetlands via submerging plant litter of different types."
https://openalex.org/W2582783350,"The digestive fluid of the sea hare Aplysia kurodai can liberate approximately 2.5 mg of glucose from 10 mg of dried Eisenia bicyclis powder. Although laminaran, a major storage polysaccharide in E. bicyclis, is easily digested to glucose by the synergistic action of the 110 and 210 kDa A. kurodai β-glucosidases (BGLs), glucose is not liberated from E. bicyclis by direct incubation with these BGLs. To clarify this discrepancy, we searched for an Eisenia hydrolysis enhancing protein (EHEP) in the digestive fluid of A. kurodai. A novel 25 kDa protein that enhances E. bicyclis saccharification by β-glucosidases was purified to a homogeneous state from the digestive fluid of A. kurodai, and its cDNA was cloned from total cDNAs reverse-transcribed from hepatopancreas total RNA. The E. bicyclis extract strongly inhibited BGLs, suggesting some compound within this brown alga functioned as a feeding deterrent. However, when E. bicyclis was incubated with BGLs in the presence of EHEP, glucose production was markedly increased. As E. bicyclis is rich in phlorotannin, which are only found in brown algae, our study suggested that these compounds are the main BGL inhibitors in E. bicyclis extract. EHEP protects BGLs from phlorotannin inhibition by binding to phlorotannins and forming an insoluble complex with phloroglucinol and phlorotannins. These findings indicated that EHEP plays a key role in the saccharification of brown seaweeds containing phlorotannins in the digestive fluid of A. kurodai. This is the first report of EHEP as a phlorotannin-binding protein that protects BGLs from inhibition."

Here, we determined the molecular characteristics of cattle XCR1 and XCL1 and their distribution among peripheral blood cells. Cattle XCR1 mRNA expression was mainly restricted to CD26+CADM1+CD205+MHCII+CD11b- cells in blood that were otherwise lineage marker negative (lin-); these represented a subset of classic dendritic cells (DCs), not plasmacytoid DCs. Some of these DCs expressed CD11a, CD44, CD80 and CD86, but they did not express CD4, CD8, CD163 or CD172a. Cattle XCL1 was expressed in quiescent NK cells and in activated CD8+ T cells. Cattle XCR1+ DCs migrated chemotactically in response to mouse, but not to human, XCL1. The distribution characters of cattle XCR1 and XCL1 suggested a vital role in regulation of acquired immune responses and indicated a potential for a DC targeted veterinary vaccine in cattle using XCL1 fused antigens."

Students participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition are on the front lines of this revolution. The new field of synthetic biology promises to change health care, computer technology, the production of biofuels, and more. Students participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition are on the front lines of this revolution. A scientific revolution has begun, and it’s being ushered in by groups of young people wearing matching T-shirts and hoodies. The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition invites college and high school students to design and build their own biological “machines.” Students work throughout the summer and fall in labs all around the world designing and building cellular systems to address real-world problems. The most recent competition culminated in a four-day event in October in Boston, Massachusetts, where each of the nearly 300 teams presented its project. The colorful gathering with 3,000 participants (another 2,600 registered participants didn’t make the trip) felt more like a celebration than a competition. Hundreds of six-foot banners lined the wide hallways of the Hynes Convention Center, each banner advertising a genetic engineering project. Groups of students wearing matching T-shirts or sweatshirts emblazoned with their team’s name and project gathered in the huge poster exhibition area. A team from France wore red berets, and the students from Munich wore traditional Bavarian skirts or lederhosen while giving their presentation. The iGEM competition, which originated as a course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and held its first competition in the summer of 2004, has fueled excitement and progress in synthetic biology around the world. Fundamentally different from research biology, the field of synthetic biology combines engineering and biology, applying design principles to the world of cells for the purpose of building a marketable product to solve a human problem. Synthetic biologists view cells as factories containing machines that manufacture “outputs.” The goal is to genetically reprogram these machines in order to produce a desired output and to do it efficiently. Synthetic biologists often combine multiple functions in an engineered biological system, creating something new that doesn’t exist in nature. For example, researchers have created targeted cancer treatments using a multifunction biological system, housed within Salmonella bacteria. The bacteria, which already thrive in the low-oxygen environment of a tumor, are perfect tools for drug delivery. The bacteria are engineered to produce tumor-killing drugs, and they are designed with a quorum sensing system—a system that allows each bacterial cell to sense how dense the bacterial population is. Once the population gets to a predetermined density, the bacterial cells self-destruct simultaneously, releasing a large dose of their toxic drugs directly to the tumor cells. This type of cancer treatment isn’t ready for humans yet, but synthetic biologists say the not-too-distant future will feature treatments like this, as well as yeast that produce jet fuels, synthetic anti-malarial drugs costing pennies per treatment, genetic data storage, microbes that manufacture alternatives to petroleum-based acrylics, and synthetic organs “printed” by 3D printers, ready for implantation. The students participating in iGEM are part of this revolutionary future. To be clear, this is a technical revolution more than a scientific revolution. The iGEM students see themselves less as traditional scientists and more as transformative designers who, like Steve Jobs, will invent entirely new product categories. In fact, one iGEM presentation concluded with a student unveiling his team’s prototype device, a portable meter that measures alcohol content in the blood, and he did it exactly like Jobs announced the iPhone. Dressed in jeans and a long-sleeved black T-shirt, Jobs’ iconic outfit, the student presented the device by pulling it from his pocket, just like Jobs did. The name of the device? The iMeter, of course. Based on his first-hand experience in the computer industry, Randy Rettberg, president of the iGEM Foundation, believes synthetic biology will revolutionize our world. “The computer revolution—the information revolution—is an honest-to-god, for-real revolution that has changed everything.” While the field of synthetic biology is only in its infancy and while “we don’t yet have billion-dollar companies,” says Rettberg, “revolutions come bit by bit by bit by bit” and tend to develop more slowly than expected. Right now, synthetic biology is still at the part-building stage, and iGEM teams are helping to create new parts. Building parts involves applying engineering principles, such as modularity and standardization, to genetic material. Modularity refers to separating complex, natural biological systems into simpler components that each handle one task or function, such as detecting a toxic substance, binding to a particular target molecule, turning a gene on, or expressing green fluorescent protein. Standardization refers to creating component parts that all possess similar input and output interfaces so that parts can be combined easily, like in an electric circuit, and can be used interchangeably in different projects. A synthetic biologist with a new idea and a stockpile of different parts that work together could quickly bring that idea into reality. Each iGEM team creates at least one new biological part and then uses that part in conjunction with other parts they have created, or with parts created by previous iGEM teams, to design a multifunction biological machine. Individual parts are submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, an online registry and physical repository hosted by the iGEM Foundation and available for all iGEM teams to use. The registry currently contains some 20,000 parts. Because synthetic biologists alter the genetic code of living organisms—organisms that reproduce quickly and whose genes could affect the environment or be affected by the environment—the field of synthetic biology is teeming with issues around safety and ethics. Critics are concerned about accidental harm to the environment, to workers in labs and manufacturing plants, to patients, and to wider communities, not to mention the intentional harm caused by people with evil motives. Critics ask how it is possible to even guess the environmental impacts of synthetic organisms. A collaboration of 117 environmental and social justice organizations published a document titled “The Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology,” and in it, they advise taking a precautionary approach, which requires exploring and developing alternatives to engineered biological machines, implementing transparent research and safety regulations, and engaging in “open, meaningful, and full public participation at every level.” They insist on broader conversations with all stakeholders regarding ethical issues, specifically questions about the fundamental relationship between humans and nature and questions about economic justice. While safety and ethics are huge areas that require larger conversations and decision-making processes, iGEM teams grapple with the safety and ethical issues associated with their projects. Even at the first iGEM competition, with just a handful of teams, students were already doing this, Rettberg says. “We brought in the topic: Is it safe? Is it moral? Is it okay to do this thing? Is it good to do this thing? … What would happen if this got loose?” Today, all iGEM projects are closely reviewed by iGEM’s own safety committee, which consists of experts from biotech companies, research institutions, and policy agencies. Teams fill out detailed forms about their project, biological materials to be used, equipment, resources, and safety training. The safety committee monitors projects throughout the competition and can disqualify any team over safety concerns. Students engage in conversations with scientists and nonscientists, asking for input about their project. They specifically work to create two-way conversations with the public in a variety of ways: they conduct surveys, they arrange meetings with groups who would be affected by their product or application if it came to market, they present their work at local fairs and schools and invite questions, and they create games and activities that educate the public about the basics of synthetic biology. The iGEM judging rubric includes the question, “Did the [education and public engagement] work establish a dialogue?” A team from Taiwan, China developed a biological part that creates a spider toxin to be used by farmers as an alternative to pesticides, so they met with an agricultural expert, an entomologist, organic farmers, and the owner of an organic tea store to get their technical input, as well as discuss issues associated with food safety and pesticides. The University of Calgary team, using a bacterial host, created a medical patch to be used by astronauts as protection from ionizing radiation, but they discovered that there were no Canadian policies addressing the use of engineered organisms in biotherapeutics. They worked with one of the directors of Canada’s public health department and helped write a policy brief, addressing some of the regulatory gaps related to engineered organisms. The iGEM competition embodies the values of diversity, openness, and mutual support. Teams are comprised of students from a diversity of majors—biology, computer science, chemistry, genetics, biotechnology, biomedical engineering, mathematics, environmental engineering—in order to create innovative and effective projects. In addition, most teams have roughly an equal number of women and men (think about that for a moment). The founders of iGEM believe that radical openness is one of the fastest ways to fuel innovative design. Therefore, all information about a team’s project is published on the web, including a description of the project, what real-world problem it intends to solve, lab notes, diagrams, photographs, and videos, as well as the names of team members, funders, and mentors. Anyone can access this information. In addition, all the information in the extensive online Registry of Standard Biological Parts is available to the public. Teams are encouraged to actively help and support each other. One team provided another team with bacterial growth data for its computer model. One team hosted a lab workshop to teach a couple of teams about the biological part assembly standard. One team shared its yeast strains with a team that did not have a yeast lab. One team tested another team’s biological part. And one team helped another team develop their software application. In addition, many teams helped mentor new teams. So, it is clear that the iGEM competition is not a competition in the traditional sense. In fact, it feels like the beginning of a revolution of a different sort: a revolution where students are excited about scientific discovery and design; where they are motived to solve local problems by including all stakeholders in the conversation; where they reflect deeply on their work and how it will affect others; where they work with diverse team members and help other teams; where they share their discoveries and inventions openly. A revolution where they come together once a year to celebrate their work. Asif Gil, a member of the team from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, stated that the best part of iGEM’s large gathering was “meeting so many people from different countries and different scientific backgrounds.” He added, “A few times after I finished presenting our poster, I was caught up with other iGEMers in a conversation that started in biology, moved on to physics, and ended with a … discussion about nationalities. It was fascinating! I also found it very interesting how, in spite of technology and multiple platforms to transform knowledge, we as human beings still need the unmediated form of communication in order to learn new information. It made me hopeful.” The entire iGEM culture makes me hopeful, too."
