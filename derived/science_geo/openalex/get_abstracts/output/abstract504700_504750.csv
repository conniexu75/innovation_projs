https://openalex.org/W1998292935,"For the analysis of microbial community structure based on 16S rDNA sequence diversity, sensitive and robust PCR amplification of 16S rDNA is a critical step. To obtain accurate microbial composition data, PCR amplification must be free of bias; however, amplifying all 16S rDNA species with equal efficiency from a sample containing a large variety of microorganisms remains challenging. Here, we designed a universal primer based on the V3-V4 hypervariable region of prokaryotic 16S rDNA for the simultaneous detection of Bacteria and Archaea in fecal samples from crossbred pigs (Landrace × Large white × Duroc) using an Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. In-silico analysis showed that the newly designed universal prokaryotic primers matched approximately 98.0% of Bacteria and 94.6% of Archaea rRNA gene sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project database. For each sequencing reaction performed with the prokaryotic universal primer, an average of 69,330 (± 20,482) reads were obtained, of which archaeal rRNA genes comprised approximately 1.2% to 3.2% of all prokaryotic reads. In addition, the detection frequency of Bacteria belonging to the phylum Verrucomicrobia, including members of the classes Verrucomicrobiae and Opitutae, was higher in the NGS analysis using the prokaryotic universal primer than that performed with the bacterial universal primer. Importantly, this new prokaryotic universal primer set had markedly lower bias than that of most previously designed universal primers. Our findings demonstrate that the prokaryotic universal primer set designed in the present study will permit the simultaneous detection of Bacteria and Archaea, and will therefore allow for a more comprehensive understanding of microbial community structures in environmental samples."

The workhorse technique in cold-atom physics is the magneto-optical trap (MOT), which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from radiation pressure. For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture and cool large numbers of particles to ultracold temperatures (<1 mK); this has enabled the study of a wide range of phenomena from optical clocks to ultracold collisions whilst also serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 mK. This method is expected to be viable for a significant number of diatomic species. Such chemical diversity is desired for the wide array of existing and proposed experiments which employ molecules for applications ranging from precision measurement, to quantum simulation and quantum information, to ultracold chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2035909267,"There has been active debate over microbial life in Antarctic subglacial lakes owing to a paucity of direct observations from beneath the ice sheet and concerns about contamination in the samples that do exist; here the authors present the first geomicrobiological description of pristine water and surficial sediments from Subglacial Lake Whillans, and show that the lake water contains a diverse microbial community, many members of which are closely related to chemolithoautotrophic bacteria and archaea. Whether there is microbial life in subglacial lakes in the Antarctic has been a matter of controversy, as early results were compromised when it was discovered that contamination may have occurred during drilling. Discovered less than a decade ago using satellite data, Lake Whillans lies beneath some 800 metres of ice on the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and evolving subglacial drainage network. In the first study to sample Antarctic subglacial waters directly, analysis of sediments obtained by the WISSARD drilling program shows that Lake Whillans' water contains more than 3,900 different types of bacteria and archaea, including one closely related to the nitrite oxidizing betaproteobacterium 'Candidatus Nitrotoga arctica', which comprised 13% of the sequence data. The lake waters contain a diverse range of metabolically active microorganisms, many of which seem to gain nutrients from the melting ice and from the rock and sediment beneath the ice. Liquid water has been known to occur beneath the Antarctic ice sheet for more than 40 years1, but only recently have these subglacial aqueous environments been recognized as microbial ecosystems that may influence biogeochemical transformations on a global scale2,3,4. Here we present the first geomicrobiological description of water and surficial sediments obtained from direct sampling of a subglacial Antarctic lake. Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) lies beneath approximately 800 m of ice on the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and evolving subglacial drainage network5. The water column of SLW contained metabolically active microorganisms and was derived primarily from glacial ice melt with solute sources from lithogenic weathering and a minor seawater component. Heterotrophic and autotrophic production data together with small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and biogeochemical data indicate that SLW is a chemosynthetically driven ecosystem inhabited by a diverse assemblage of bacteria and archaea. Our results confirm that aquatic environments beneath the Antarctic ice sheet support viable microbial ecosystems, corroborating previous reports suggesting that they contain globally relevant pools of carbon and microbes2,4 that can mobilize elements from the lithosphere6 and influence Southern Ocean geochemical and biological systems7."
https://openalex.org/W2058571413,"Cys-loop receptors are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that are essential mediators of fast chemical neurotransmission and are associated with a large number of neurological diseases and disorders, as well as parasitic infections. Members of this ion channel superfamily mediate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission depending on their ligand and ion selectivity. Structural information for Cys-loop receptors comes from several sources including electron microscopic studies of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, high-resolution X-ray structures of extracellular domains and X-ray structures of bacterial orthologues. In 2011 our group published structures of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in complex with the allosteric partial agonist ivermectin, which provided insights into the structure of a possibly open state of a eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor, the basis for anion selectivity and channel block, and the mechanism by which ivermectin and related molecules stabilize the open state and potentiate neurotransmitter binding. However, there remain unanswered questions about the mechanism of channel opening and closing, the location and nature of the shut ion channel gate, the transitions between the closed/resting, open/activated and closed/desensitized states, and the mechanism by which conformational changes are coupled between the extracellular, orthosteric agonist binding domain and the transmembrane, ion channel domain. Here we present two conformationally distinct structures of C. elegans GluCl in the absence of ivermectin. Structural comparisons reveal a quaternary activation mechanism arising from rigid-body movements between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and a mechanism for modulation of the receptor by phospholipids."

https://openalex.org/W2000742696,"ESRP1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1) and ESRP2 regulate alternative splicing events associated with epithelial phenotypes of cells, and both are down-regulated during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, little is known about their expression and functions during carcinogenesis. In this study, we found that expression of both ESRP1 and ESRP2 is plastic: during oral squamous cell carcinogenesis, these proteins are up-regulated relative to their levels in normal epithelium but down-regulated in invasive fronts. Importantly, ESRP1 and ESRP2 are re-expressed in the lymph nodes, where carcinoma cells metastasize and colonize. In head and neck carcinoma cell lines, ESRP1 and ESRP2 suppress cancer cell motility through distinct mechanisms: knockdown of ESRP1 affects the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton through induction of Rac1b, whereas knockdown of ESRP2 attenuates cell-cell adhesion through increased expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated transcription factors. Down-regulation of ESRP1 and ESRP2 is thus closely associated with a motile phenotype of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043152532,"The antidiabetic drug metformin exhibits both chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activity for multiple cancers including pancreatic cancer; however, the underlying mechanism of action of metformin is unclear. A recent study showed that metformin down-regulated specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors (TFs) Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in pancreatic cancer cells and tumors, and this was accompanied by down-regulation of several pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes. Treatment with metformin or down-regulation of Sp TFs by RNAi also inhibits two major pro-oncogenic pathways in pancreatic cancer cells, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-dependent activation of Ras. Metformin and Sp knockdown by RNAi decreased expression of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), resulting in inhibition of mTOR signaling. Ras activity was also decreased by metformin and Sp knockdown of EGFR, another Sp-regulated gene. Thus, the antineoplastic activities of metformin in pancreatic cancer are due, in part, to down-regulation of Sp TFs and Sp-regulated IGF-1R and EGFR, which in turn results in inhibition of mTOR and Ras signaling, respectively.

Results of this study demonstrate novel findings indicating that metformin-induced antineoplastic activities are primarily due to down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 transcription factors in pancreatic cancer cells. Firstly, treatment with metformin or silencing Sp transcription factors by RNAi down-regulated insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which in turn inhibited activation of mTOR. Secondly, treatment with metformin or silencing Sp transcription factors by RNAi decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, resulting in inhibition of Ras activity, which is regulated by EGFR in pancreatic cancer cells (37.Ardito C.M.

Thus, we know show for the first time that metformin-dependent inhibition of both mTOR signaling and Ras activity is due to down-regulation of Sp transcription factors in pancreatic cancer. Human Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Panc28 and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells that express Ras mutation were provided by The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. All three cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, 0.022% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 10 ml/liter 100× antibiotic, antimycotic solution (Sigma) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Sp1 antibody was purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA); Sp3 and Sp4 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). FAS, Ras, p-mTOR, mTOR, p-4EBP, 4EBP, S6 ribosomal protein, and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Metformin was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Chemiluminescence reagents (Immobilon Western) for Western blot imaging were purchased from Millipore. Active Ras detection assay kit was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit was purchased from Thermo Scientific. Panc28 and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells (3 × 104/well) were seeded in 12-well plates with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS, allowed to attach for 24 h, and treated with different concentrations of NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Cells were then trypsinized and counted after 24 and 48 h using a Coulter Z1 cell counter. Each experiment was determined in triplicate, and results are expressed as mean ± S.E. for each set of experiments. Panc28 and L3.6pL cells (3 × 105/well) were seeded in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with different concentrations of metformin. Nuclear and cytoplasmic contents were extracted using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed using high salt lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/liter HEPES, 0.5 mol/liter sodium chloride, 1.5 mmol/liter magnesium chloride, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture, 1:1000 (Sigma). Lysates were collected and vortexed every 15 min for 1 h, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and quantified with Bradford reagent. Western blot analysis was carried out by separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE at 120 V for 4 h. Proteins were then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) by wet electroblotting, and membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer containing 1.576 g/liter Tris, 8.776 g/liter sodium chloride, and 0.5 ml/liter Tween 20. The PVDF membranes were then probed with primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immobilon Western chemiluminescence substrates (Millipore) were used to develop the membrane, and images were captured on a Kodak 4000 MM Pro image station. Panc28, Panc1, and L3.6pL pancreatic cancer cells were seeded (1 × 105/well) in 6-well plates in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS without antibiotic and left to attach for 24 h. Knockdown of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 along with iLamin as control was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (35.Jutooru I.

Pancreatic cancer cells (Panc28 and L3.6pL, 3 × 105/well) were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without metformin (15 mm) for 36 h. Cells were harvested under nondenaturing conditions and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed using lysis buffer. Affinity precipitation of active Ras was performed using active Ras detection assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates (500 µg) were treated with GTPγS or GDP to activate or inactivate Ras, which acts as a positive or a negative control, respectively. The lysates were then incubated with GST-Raf1-RBD fusion protein in glutathione resin (where RBD is Ras-binding domain). The eluted samples were electrophoresed and immunoblotted using Ras mouse monoclonal antibody. Male athymic nude mice (NCI-nu) (at least four per treatment group) were injected with suspensions of L3.6pL cells consisting of single cells with >90% viability directly into the pancreas as described previously (31.Nair V.

https://openalex.org/W1990738873,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and increased inducible NOS (iNOS) activity amplify vascular oxidative stress. The role of inflammatory myelomonocytic cells as mediators of these processes and their impact on tetrahydrobiopterin availability and function have not yet been defined. Angiotensin II (ATII, 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days) increased Ly6C(high) and CD11b(+)/iNOS(high) leukocytes and up-regulated levels of eNOS glutathionylation in aortas of C57BL/6 mice. Vascular iNOS-dependent NO formation was increased, whereas eNOS-dependent NO formation was decreased in aortas of ATII-infused mice as assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of lysozyme M-positive (LysM(+)) monocytes in ATII-infused LysM(iDTR) transgenic mice prevented eNOS glutathionylation and eNOS-derived N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-sensitive superoxide formation in the endothelial layer. ATII increased vascular guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I expression and biopterin synthesis in parallel, which was reduced in monocyte-depleted LysM(iDTR) mice. Vascular tetrahydrobiopterin was increased by ATII infusion but was even higher in monocyte-depleted ATII-infused mice, which was paralleled by a strong up-regulation of dihydrofolate reductase expression. EPR spectroscopy revealed that both vascular iNOS- and eNOS-dependent NO formation were normalized in ATII-infused mice following monocyte depletion. Additionally, deletion as well as pharmacologic inhibition of iNOS prevented ATII-induced endothelial dysfunction. In summary, ATII induces an inflammatory cell-dependent increase of iNOS, guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I, tetrahydrobiopterin, NO formation, and nitro-oxidative stress as well as eNOS uncoupling in the vessel wall, which can be prevented by ablation of LysM(+) monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2056985832,"We have investigated the molecular basis of intracellular Ca(2+) handling in human colon carcinoma cells (HT29) versus normal human mucosa cells (NCM460) and its contribution to cancer features. We found that Ca(2+) stores in colon carcinoma cells are partially depleted relative to normal cells. However, resting Ca(2+) levels, agonist-induced Ca(2+) increases, store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), and store-operated currents (ISOC) are largely enhanced in tumor cells. Enhanced SOCE and depleted Ca(2+) stores correlate with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and survival characteristic of tumor cells. Normal mucosa cells displayed small, inward Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) currents (ICRAC) mediated by ORAI1. In contrast, colon carcinoma cells showed mixed currents composed of enhanced ICRAC plus a nonselective ISOC mediated by TRPC1. Tumor cells display increased expression of TRPC1, ORAI1, ORAI2, ORAI3, and STIM1. In contrast, STIM2 protein was nearly depleted in tumor cells. Silencing data suggest that enhanced ORAI1 and TRPC1 contribute to enhanced SOCE and differential store-operated currents in tumor cells, whereas ORAI2 and -3 are seemingly less important. In addition, STIM2 knockdown decreases SOCE and Ca(2+) store content in normal cells while promoting apoptosis resistance. These data suggest that loss of STIM2 may underlie Ca(2+) store depletion and apoptosis resistance in tumor cells. We conclude that a reciprocal shift in TRPC1 and STIM2 contributes to Ca(2+) remodeling and tumor features in colon cancer."

Nonetheless, the differences between 7,8-DHF and BDNF in activating TrkB remain incompletely understood. Here we show that 7,8-DHF and BDNF exhibit different TrkB activation kinetics in which TrkB maturation may be implicated. Employing two independent biophysical approaches, we confirm that 7,8-DHF interacts robustly with the TrkB extracellular domain, with a Kd of ∼10 nm. Although BDNF transiently activates TrkB, leading to receptor internalization and ubiquitination/degradation, in contrast, 7,8-DHF-triggered TrkB phosphorylation lasts for hours, and the internalized receptors are not degraded. Notably, primary neuronal maturation may be required for 7,8-DHF but not for BDNF to elicit the full spectrum of TrkB signaling cascades. Hence, 7,8-DHF interacts robustly with the TrkB receptor, and its agonistic effect may be mediated by neuronal development and maturation. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a newly identified small molecular TrkB receptor agonist, rapidly activates TrkB in both primary neurons and the rodent brain and mimics the physiological functions of the cognate ligand BDNF.

https://openalex.org/W1991550633,"Lysine methylation has been extensively studied in histones, where it has been shown to provide specific epigenetic marks for the regulation of gene expression; however, the molecular mechanism and physiological function of lysine methylation in proteins other than histones remains to be fully addressed. To better understand the substrate diversity of lysine methylation, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) derivatives with alkyne-moieties have been synthesized. A selenium-based SAM analog, propargylic Se-adenosyl-l-selenomethionine (ProSeAM), has a wide spectrum of reactivity against various lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) with sufficient stability to support enzymatic reactions in vitro. By using ProSeAM as a chemical probe for lysine methylation, we identified substrates for two seven-beta-strand KMTs, METTL21A and METTL10, on a proteomic scale in mammalian cells. METTL21A has been characterized as a heat shock protein (HSP)-70 methyltransferase. Mammalian METTL10 remains functionally uncharacterized, although its ortholog in yeast, See1, has been shown to methylate the translation elongation factor eEF1A. By using ProSeAM-mediated alkylation followed by purification and quantitative MS analysis, we confirmed that METTL21A labels HSP70 family proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated that METTL10 also methylates the eukaryotic elongation factor EF1A1 in mammalian cells. Subsequent biochemical characterization revealed that METTL10 specifically trimethylates EF1A1 at lysine 318 and that siRNA-mediated knockdown of METTL10 decreases EF1A1 methylation levels in vivo. Thus, our study emphasizes the utility of the synthetic cofactor ProSeAM as a chemical probe for the identification of non-histone substrates of KMTs."
https://openalex.org/W1982364050,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are multisystem neurodegenerative disorders that manifest overlapping cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor features. The cerebellum has long been known to be crucial for intact motor function although emerging evidence over the past decade has attributed cognitive and neuropsychiatric processes to this structure. The current study set out i) to establish the integrity of cerebellar subregions in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia spectrum (ALS-bvFTD) and ii) determine whether specific cerebellar atrophy regions are associated with cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms in the patients. Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with ALS, ALS-bvFTD, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), most without C9ORF72 gene abnormalities, and healthy controls were investigated. Participants underwent cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional evaluation as well as structural imaging using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to examine the grey matter subregions of the cerebellar lobules, vermis and crus. VBM analyses revealed: i) significant grey matter atrophy in the cerebellum across the whole ALS-bvFTD continuum; ii) atrophy predominantly of the superior cerebellum and crus in bvFTD patients, atrophy of the inferior cerebellum and vermis in ALS patients, while ALS-bvFTD patients had both patterns of atrophy. Post-hoc covariance analyses revealed that cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were particularly associated with atrophy of the crus and superior lobule, while motor symptoms were more associated with atrophy of the inferior lobules. Taken together, these findings indicate an important role of the cerebellum in the ALS-bvFTD disease spectrum, with all three clinical phenotypes demonstrating specific patterns of subregional atrophy that associated with different symptomology."
https://openalex.org/W1976264598,"Background Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV infection is a strategy recommended by the World Health Organization for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). We assessed pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women with a recent pregnancy in Zimbabwe. Methods We analyzed baseline data from the evaluation of Zimbabwe’s Accelerated National PMTCT Program. Eligible women were randomly sampled from the catchment areas of 157 health facilities offering PMTCT services in five provinces. Eligible women were ≥16 years old and mothers of infants (alive or deceased) born 9 to 18 months prior to the interview. Participants were interviewed about their HIV status, intendedness of the birth, and contraceptive use. Results Of 8,797 women, the mean age was 26.7 years, 92.8% were married or had a regular sexual partner, and they had an average of 2.7 lifetime births. Overall, 3,090 (35.1%) reported that their births were unintended; of these women, 1,477 (47.8%) and 1,613 (52.2%) were and were not using a contraceptive method prior to learning that they were pregnant, respectively. Twelve percent of women reported that they were HIV-positive at the time of the survey; women who reported that they were HIV-infected were significantly more likely to report that their pregnancy was unintended compared to women who reported that they were HIV-uninfected (44.9% vs. 33.8%, p<0.01). After adjustment for covariates, among women with unintended births, there was no association between self-reported HIV status and lack of contraception use prior to pregnancy. Conclusions Unmet need for family planning and contraceptive failure contribute to unintended pregnancies among women in Zimbabwe. Both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women reported unintended pregnancies despite intending to avoid or delay pregnancy, highlighting the need for effective contraceptive methods that align with pregnancy intentions."

However, up to now little is known about the mechanisms underlying CD4+ T-cell dysfunction during chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection and the role of inhibitory molecules such as programmed death 1 (PD-1) for CD4+ T-cell failure.The expression of multiple inhibitory molecules such as PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, CD244, KLRG1 and markers defining the grade of T-cell differentiation as CCR7, CD45RA, CD57 and CD127 were analyzed on virus-specific CD4+ T-cells from peripheral blood using a newly established DRB1*01-restricted MHC class II Tetramer. Effects of in vitro PD-L1/2 blockade were defined by investigating changes in CD4+ T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.CD4+ T-cell responses during chronic HBV infection was characterized by reduced Tetramer+CD4+ T-cell frequencies, effector memory phenotype, sustained PD-1 but low levels of CTLA-4, TIM-3, KLRG1 and CD244 expression. PD-1 blockade revealed individualized patterns of in vitro responsiveness with partly increased IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α secretion as well as enhanced CD4+ T-cell expansion almost in treated patients with viral control.HBV-specific CD4+ T-cells are reliably detectable during different courses of HBV infection by MHC class II Tetramer technology. CD4+ T-cell dysfunction during chronic HBV is basically linked to strong PD-1 upregulation but absent coregulation of multiple inhibitory receptors. PD-L1/2 neutralization partly leads to enhanced CD4+ T-cell functionality with heterogeneous patterns of CD4+ T-cell rejunivation."

In the fibrillar state, the monomers adopt a parallel, in-register five-layered (β1 to β5) β-sandwich arrangement spanning residues Leu38–Val95 (10.Vilar M. Chou H.T. Lührs T. Maji S.K. Riek-Loher D.

In regard to oligomeric intermediates, it is recognized that oAS contain a substantial amount of β-sheet structure (13.Volles M.J. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Vesicle permeabilization by protofibrillar α-synuclein: implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), lacking the canonical cross-β-fibrillar fold (14.Kim H.Y. Cho M.K. Kumar A. Maier E. Siebenhaar C. Becker S. Fernandez C.O. Lashuel H.A. Benz R. Lange A. Zweckstetter M. Structural properties of pore-forming oligomers of α-synuclein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 17482-17489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Indeed, we demonstrated that oAS adopt a distinctive antiparallel β-sheet structure as opposed to the parallel organization found in the fibrillar state (15.Celej M.S. Sarroukh R. Goormaghtigh E. Fidelio G.D. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V. Toxic prefibrillar α-synuclein amyloid oligomers adopt a distinctive antiparallel β-sheet structure.Biochem. J. 2012; 443: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence and deuterium exchange studies showed that the core of oAS spans residues ∼Phe4–Ala90, where distinctive segments from the N-terminal and central part of the protein exhibit stable hydrogen-bonded or solvent-shielded structures (16.van Rooijen B.D. van Leijenhorst-Groener K.A.

Characterizing the dynamics of α-synuclein oligomers using hydrogen/deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 9097-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed a number of engineered single cysteine AS variants selectively labeled with thiol-reactive fluorophores with the aim of identifying cooperatively folded units and intermolecular proximities within oAS with residue-specific resolution. Several of the plasmids encoding for single cysteine variants of AS were a kind gift of Dr. C. Bertoncini (Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Barcelona, Spain) and Dr. T. Jovin (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). Other mutants were obtained from GeneScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). In all cases, the codon 136 was changed from TAC to TAT to prevent cysteine misincorporation upon bacterial expression (18.Masuda M. Dohmae N. Nonaka T. Oikawa T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Cysteine misincorporation in bacterially expressed human α-synuclein.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The single cysteine variants were expressed and purified as the wild-type protein (15.Celej M.S. Sarroukh R. Goormaghtigh E. Fidelio G.D. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V. Toxic prefibrillar α-synuclein amyloid oligomers adopt a distinctive antiparallel β-sheet structure.Biochem. J. 2012; 443: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), with the addition of 5 mm DTT in the elution buffers to avoid disulfide bridge formation. Proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm DTT in Milli-Q water and stored at −20 °C until further use. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance (ϵ275 = 5600 m−1 cm−1). The single-cysteine AS variants were labeled with acrylodan or N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) after removal of DTT by passage through a Sephadex G-25, PD-10 desalting column (General Electric) using 25 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.5, as elution buffer. The working pH was maintained at 6.5 because N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide shows a tendency to undergo aminolysis at pH ≥ 7.5, especially in the presence of free amines (19.Wu C.W. Yarbrough L.R. N-(1-pyrene)maleimide: a fluorescent cross-linking reagent.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2863-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were identified by tyrosine fluorescence. A 4-fold excess of the corresponding dye in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to 300 µm protein solutions (the final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was <1%). The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark, and the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 mm DTT. The labeled proteins were purified with PD-10 columns, and protein fractions were identified by fluorescence emission of the attached probes. The samples were centrifuged to remove any precipitate, concentrated in Amicon Ultra-4 10 KDa cut-off filters (Millipore), and buffer exchanged into Milli-Q water. Because the dye absorption bands strongly overlap with the protein absorption at 275 nm, protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry assay using wild-type AS (quantified by absorbance) as standard for the calibration curve. The labeling efficiencies, typically 70–85%, were calculated using ϵ372 = 16,400 m−1 cm−1 for acrylodan (20.Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. Synthesis, spectral properties, and use of 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Acrylodan). A thiol-selective, polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ϵ343 = 36000 m−1 cm−1 for pyrene (19.Wu C.W. Yarbrough L.R. N-(1-pyrene)maleimide: a fluorescent cross-linking reagent.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2863-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were stored at −20 °C until further use. For control experiments, glutathione (GSH) was chosen as a mimetic of a polypeptide chain. Labeling of GSH was achieved by incubation of 100:1 GSH/dye solutions overnight at 4 °C in phosphate buffer. Solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g to remove any particle and lyophilized. Monomeric AS solutions (300 µm) were prepared by mixing the adequate amounts of wild-type and labeled proteins to give an initial label density of 5% acrylodan-tagged or 25% pyrene-tagged AS variant, unless stated otherwise. Typical initial volumes were 1 ml and 400 µl per independent experiment of the acrylodan- and pyrene-containing mixtures, respectively. The samples were freeze-dried and redissolved in phosphate buffer. Due to the stochastic nature of aggregation, labeled monomers are expected to be randomly incorporated in the oligomer (21.Zijlstra N. Claessens M.M. Blum C. Subramaniam V.

J. 2014; 106: 440-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22.Zijlstra N. Blum C. Segers-Nolten I.M. Claessens M.M. Subramaniam V.

Engl. 2012; 51: 8821-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to remove big particles. oAS were separated from the monomer using Amicon Ultra-0.5 100-kDa cut-off filters (Millipore). Diafiltration was carried out at 4 °C to diminish the tendency of fibril formation, which can be enhanced by the presence of the hydrophobic probe moieties (23.Thirunavukkuarasu S. Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. Multiparametric fluorescence detection of early stages in the amyloid protein aggregation of pyrene-labeled α-synuclein.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) due to π-π stacking interactions between aromatic rings. The procedure was repeated until the fluorescence intensity of the probe detected in the flow-through was negligible as compared with the intensity measured in the retentate. oAS were in a final volume of 50–100 µl in phosphate buffer. (Typical final concentrations were ∼100–150 µm as measured by the Lowry assay.) The removal of the monomeric protein was confirmed by native gradient PAGE. The absence of amyloid fibrils was verified by Thioflavin T (ThioT) fluorescence. If needed, additional ultracentrifugation steps (50,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) were performed to settle out ThioT positive aggregates of the oAS solution. oAS duplicate samples were prepared independently of each other. For the pyrene-labeled oAS, an additional guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) cold denaturation step was implemented to disrupt possible preformed protein aggregates that could be present in the highly concentrated labeled protein stock solutions. If present, these aggregates would result in biased excimer signals. Then, 300 µm stock AS solutions were kept overnight at −20 °C in the presence of 0.1 m GdmCl, a condition that suffices to disaggregate AS oligomers as appraised by red-shifted emission spectra and native gradient PAGE of acrylodan-labeled oAS (data not shown). GdmCl was exchanged into Milli-Q water before lyophilization, and oligomeric species were purified as described above. Native polyacrylamide gels were cast with a linear gradient from 4 to 15%. HMW native marker (GE Healthcare) was loaded as molecular mass marker. Electrophoresis was performed under non-denaturing conditions at a constant 60 V. Gels were silver-stained. Aliquots of oAS (5 µl) were adsorbed onto Formvar-coated carbon grids (200 mesh), washed with Milli-Q water, and stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. The samples were imaged in a JEM-1200 Ex (Jeol) transmission electron microscope equipped with a GATAN camera, model 785. IR spectra were acquired on an Equinox 55 IR spectrophotometer (Bruker Optics) equipped with a single reflection diamond reflectance accessory (Golden Gate, Specac) and purged with dry air. Aliquots of oAS (∼2 µl) were spread on a diamond crystal, flushed with nitrogen. A total of 256 accumulations were recorder at 21 °C using a resolution of 2 cm−1. The water vapor was subtracted, and the spectra were baseline-corrected between 1600 and 1700 cm−1. Emission spectra were acquired with a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a thermally controlled multi-cuvette holder. Ten spectra were acquired at 25 °C using a 0.3-mm path cuvette and averaged. Acrylodan was excited at 380 nm, with excitation/emission slit widths of 5/5 nm. Pyrene was excited at 343 nm, with excitation/emission slit widths of 5/2.5 nm. ThioT was excited using λexc = 446 nm, spectral bandwidths of 10 nm and a 1-cm path cuvette. For denaturation experiments, each acrylodan-labeled sample was equilibrated for 30 min at room temperature by increasing GdmCl concentrations prior to spectral acquisition. Same spectral features were obtained in samples incubated up to 17 h, indicating that incubation for 30 min was enough to reach equilibrium (data not shown). Matched amounts of monomeric labeled proteins at 4 m GdmCl exhibited the same fluorescence yields regardless the position of the probe (data not shown). Therefore, after subtracting the corresponding blank curves, the acrylodan fluorescence spectra were scaled relative to the absolute intensity obtained at 4 m GdmCl for an easier comparison among the different variants. Denaturation profiles were expressed as fractional changes at 480 nm. For proximity analysis, pyrene spectra were normalized to the intensity of the peak at 375 nm (monomer signal). The ratio between the fluorescence intensities measured at 460 nm (excimer signal) and 375 nm were computed for each labeled oAS. The profiles describing the β-sheet and amyloid aggregation propensities were generated using the sequence-based algorithms TANGO (24.Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Prediction of sequence-dependent and mutational effects on the aggregation of peptides and proteins.Nat.

Soc. Rev. 2008; 37: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Averaged hydropathy indexes were calculated from hydropathy plots predicted according to the Kyte-Doolittle scale using a seven-amino acid window (27.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17168) Google Scholar). We capitalized on the absence of cysteine residues in wild-type AS for selectively labeling a number of engineered individual cysteine variants with thiol-reactive fluorophores. The mutations cover the three functional domains of AS (Fig. 1A), i.e. the amphipatic N-terminal domain (residues 1–60), which holds the familial mutations linked to early onset of PD, the hydrophobic aggregation-prone central region (residues 61–95) and the acidic C terminus (residues 96–140) that modulates fibrillogenesis. We selected the environment-sensitive fluorescent dye acrylodan to report on the conformational status of different segments of AS after protein assembly (Fig. 1C). In addition, we exploited the ability of pyrene to form distance-dependent excimers (excited state dimers) to map intermolecular proximities in neighboring monomers within oAS. Typical spectral responses of the dyes employed in this work (Fig. 1B) are represented in Fig. 1C. A number of methods for producing oAS have been reported in the literature (13.Volles M.J. Lee S.J.

Goormaghtigh E. Fidelio G.D. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V. Toxic prefibrillar α-synuclein amyloid oligomers adopt a distinctive antiparallel β-sheet structure.Biochem.

Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Acta. 2009; 1788: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we optimized here the protocol to avoid undesirable dye-dye stacking interactions before lyophilization and fibril formation during the purification steps of labeled oAS. We then characterized the oligomers by complementary techniques and representative results obtained for oAS labeled with acrylodan at position Ala76 are presented in Fig. 2. The results obtained for the wild-type protein are also shown for comparison. Labeled oAS showed the typical smeared band in a native gradient PAGE gel migrating concomitantly with the molecular mass marker ferritin of ∼440 kDa, as the wild-type oligomers (Fig. 2A). The incorporation of the labeled protein does not alter the morphology of the oligomers, as both labeled and unlabeled species appeared as polydisperse spheroidal aggregates (Fig. 2B). In addition, neither labeled nor unlabeled oAS enhanced the fluorescence of ThioT, which became highly fluorescent upon intercalation into the amyloid core of fibrils (Fig. 2C) indicating that both oAS lack the canonical cross-β-amyloid structure. Finally, the distinctive IR signatures of the different aggregation states were present in both the labeled and wild-type proteins (15.Celej M.S. Sarroukh R. Goormaghtigh E. Fidelio G.D. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V. Toxic prefibrillar α-synuclein amyloid oligomers adopt a distinctive antiparallel β-sheet structure.Biochem. J. 2012; 443: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), i.e. the spectra of the monomeric proteins were centered at ∼1645 cm−1, as expected for predominantly unordered conformations; the amide I band of the oligomeric species presented a band at 1625 cm−1 along with a shoulder at 1695 cm−1, the hallmark of antiparallel β-sheet structure; lastly, the FTIR spectra of fibrils displayed prominent maxima at ∼1627 cm−1, typical of parallel β-sheets (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we concluded that labeled oAS recapitulate the morphology, polydispersity, tinctorial properties, and secondary structure signatures of amyloid oligomers formed by the wild-type protein (15.Celej M.S. Sarroukh R. Goormaghtigh E. Fidelio G.D. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V. Toxic prefibrillar α-synuclein amyloid oligomers adopt a distinctive antiparallel β-sheet structure.Biochem. J. 2012; 443: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We mapped the environmental properties of labeled oAS with site-specific resolution. All of the tested positions of acrylodan-labeled oAS showed hyperchromic blue-shifted emission spectra (λmax = 476–491 nm) as compared with the monomeric proteins (λmax = 515–528 nm) indicating sequestration from the aqueous solvent (Figs. 1C and 3A, upper panel). In the framework of a continuous dielectric model, the solvatochromic response of acrylodan spans a polarity range defined by a dielectric constant (ϵ) of ∼5–40, as judged by the reference curve obtained from the fluorescence spectra of acrylodan-labeled GSH in neat solvents (upper panel of Fig. 3A). Based on the spectral features of this dye, all of the labeled positions in oAS experience low-polarity microenvironments with apparent ϵ ∼ 10–20, substantially lower than those (ϵ ≥ 50) found for the same positions in the monomeric form. The ϵ values appraised for oAS are in the same range as those estimated from the spectral analysis of Trp residues selectively positioned at the N-terminal and central domains of the protein in single-Trp oAS mutants (ϵ ∼ 10–30) (16.van Rooijen B.D. van Leijenhorst-Groener K.A. Claessens M.M. Subramaniam V. Tryptophan fluorescence reveals structural features of α-synuclein oligomers.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For the sake of comparison, we note that an apparent ϵ value of ∼11 was estimated for wild-type AS fibrils when bound to the extrinsic dual-emission probe 4′-(diethylamino)-3-hydroxyflavone (31.Celej M.S. Caarls W. Demchenko A.P. Jovin T.M. A triple emission fluorescent probe reveals distinctive amyloid fibrillar polymorphism of wild-type α-synuclein and its familial Parkinson's disease mutants.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7465-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, we employed the relative changes in intensity of characteristic vibronic bands of pyrene monomer fluorescence (region between ∼370 and 410 nm, Fig. 1C) as a complementary tool to evaluate the polarity of the probe surroundings. The Py scale of polarity is defined by the intensity ratio between the first (375 nm) and third (385 nm) emission bands. The higher the Py value, the higher the polarity of the environment (32.Valeur B. Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications. 1st Ed. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2001: 200-225Crossref Google Scholar). A drop of the Py value observed upon oligomerization, attested to an increase in the local hydrophobicity around the probe for all the labeled positions except for Ala140 (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Comparison with the calibration curve measured for pyrene-labeled GSH dissolved in protic solvents yielded apparent ϵ values of ∼ 40 and 30 for the labeled positions within the N-terminal and central parts of the protein in its monomeric and oligomeric form, respectively. The three most C-terminal labeled residues in both AS monomers and oligomers exhibited Py values that lie within the polarity range where the reference curve approximates a plateau. At these positions, the pyrene"
https://openalex.org/W2030579756,"Noise, or undesirable sound, is one of the most common environmental stressors, and it can cause various health effects. Beyond the auditory consequences of occupational noise exposure, extra-auditory effects such as psychological problems have also been found. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the association between occupational noise annoyance and psychological symptoms, including symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation.A total of 10,020 participants (5,410 men and 4,610 women) were included in the current analysis, using data from the fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess noise annoyance levels, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for psychosocial symptoms were calculated using multiple logistic regression models.Compared to the no noise annoyance group, ORs (95% CI) of the severe annoyance groups were 1.58 (1.12-2.23) and 1.76 (1.29-2.40) in men and 1.49 (1.05-2.11) and 1.41 (1.01-1.97) in women for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, respectively. The ORs (95% CI) for severe noise annoyance in those with less than five hours of sleep were 2.95 (1.46-5.96) and 2.05 (1.01-4.16) in men and women, respectively, compared with those with no noise annoyance and a sleep time of more than five hours.Our study shows that occupational noise annoyance is significantly related to mental health, including depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation after controlling for individual and socio-demographic characteristics even with gender stratification. However, prospective studies with quantified noise exposure assessment were needed to elucidate the causality on the association between noise annoyance and psychological symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2062044882,"Objectives To assess the safety and acceptance of the PrePex device for medical male circumcision (MMC) in rural Uganda. Methods In an observational study, HIV-uninfected, uncircumcised men aged 18 and older who requested elective MMC were informed about the PrePex and dorsal slit methods and offered a free choice of their preferred procedure. 100 men received PrePex to assess preliminary safety (aim 1). An additional 329 men, 250 chose PrePex and 79 chose Dorsal slit, were enrolled following approval by the Safety Monitoring Committee (aim 2). Men were followed up at 7 days to assess adverse events (AEs) and to remove the PrePex device. Wound healing was assessed at 4 weeks, with subsequent weekly follow up until completed healing. Results The PrePex device was contraindicated in 5.7% of men due to a tight prepuce or phimosis/adhesions. Among 429 enrolled men 350 (82.0%) got the PrePex device and 79 (18.0%) the dorsal slit procedure. 250 of 329 men (76.0%) who were invited to choose between the 2 procedures chose Prepex. There were 9 AEs (2.6%) with the PrePex, of which 5 (1.4%) were severe complications, 4 due to patient self-removal of the device leading to edema and urinary obstruction requiring emergency surgical circumcision, and one due to wound dehiscence following device removal. 71.8% of men reported an unpleasant odor prior to PrePex removal. Cumulative rates of completed wound healing with the PrePex were 56.7% at week 4, 84.8% week 5, 97.6% week 6 and 98.6% week 7, compared to 98.7% at week 4 with dorsal slit (p<0.0001). Conclusion The PrePex device was well accepted, but healing was slower than with dorsal slit surgery. Severe complications, primarily following PrePex self-removal, required rapid access to emergency surgical facilities. The need to return for removal and delayed healing may increase Program cost and client burden."
https://openalex.org/W2028485353,"Background Information on causes of death (CODs) for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is sparse and limited by standard categorizations of underlying and immediate CODs on death certificates. Prior research indicated that excess mortality among MS patients was largely due to greater mortality from infectious, cardiovascular, or pulmonary causes. Objective To analyze disease categories in order to gain insight to pathways, which lead directly to death in MS patients. Methods Commercially insured MS patients enrolled in the OptumInsight Research database between 1996 and 2009 were matched to non-MS comparators on age/residence at index year and sex. The cause most-directly leading to death from the death certificate, referred to as the “principal” COD, was determined using an algorithm to minimize the selection of either MS or cardiac/pulmonary arrest as the COD. Principal CODs were categorized into MS, cancer, cardiovascular, infectious, suicide, accidental, pulmonary, other, or unknown. Infectious, cardiovascular, and pulmonary CODs were further subcategorized. Results 30,402 MS patients were matched to 89,818 controls, with mortality rates of 899 and 446 deaths/100,000 person-years, respectively. Excluding MS, differences in mortality rate between MS patients and non-MS comparators were largely attributable to infections, cardiovascular causes, and pulmonary problems. Of the 95 excessive deaths (per 100,000 person-years) related to infectious causes, 41 (43.2%) were due to pulmonary infections and 45 (47.4%) were attributed to sepsis. Of the 46 excessive deaths (per 100,000 person-years) related to pulmonary causes, 27 (58.7%) were due to aspiration. No single diagnostic entity predominated for the 60 excessive deaths (per 100,000 person-years) attributable to cardiac CODs. Conclusions The principal COD algorithm improved on other methods of determining COD in MS patients from death certificates. A greater awareness of the common CODs in MS patients will allow physicians to anticipate potential problems and, thereby, improve the care that they provide."
https://openalex.org/W2083788001,"Machado-Joseph disease or Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the polyglutamine-expanded protein ataxin-3. Recent studies demonstrate that RNA interference is a promising approach for the treatment of Machado-Joseph disease. However, whether gene silencing at an early time-point is able to prevent the appearance of motor behavior deficits typical of the disease when initiated before onset of the disease had not been explored. Here, using a lentiviral-mediated allele-specific silencing of mutant ataxin-3 in an early pre-symptomatic cerebellar mouse model of Machado-Joseph disease we show that this strategy hampers the development of the motor and neuropathological phenotypic characteristics of the disease. At the histological level, the RNA-specific silencing of mutant ataxin-3 decreased formation of mutant ataxin-3 aggregates, preserved Purkinje cell morphology and expression of neuronal markers while reducing cell death. Importantly, gene silencing prevented the development of impairments in balance, motor coordination, gait and hyperactivity observed in control mice. These data support the therapeutic potential of RNA interference for Machado-Joseph disease and constitute a proof of principle of the beneficial effects of early allele-specific silencing for therapy of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2141129707,"Src-family kinases (SFKs) are non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases involved in a variety of signaling pathways in virtually every cell type. The SFKs share a common negative regulatory mechanism that involves intramolecular interactions of the SH3 domain with the PPII helix formed by the SH2-kinase linker as well as the SH2 domain with a conserved phosphotyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail. Growing evidence suggests that individual SFKs may exhibit distinct activation mechanisms dictated by the relative strengths of these intramolecular interactions. To elucidate the role of the SH3:linker interaction in the regulation of individual SFKs, we used a synthetic SH3 domain-binding peptide (VSL12) to probe the sensitivity of downregulated c-Src, Hck, Lyn and Fyn to SH3-based activation in a kinetic kinase assay. All four SFKs responded to VSL12 binding with enhanced kinase activity, demonstrating a conserved role for SH3:linker interaction in the control of catalytic function. However, the sensitivity and extent of SH3-based activation varied over a wide range. In addition, autophosphorylation of the activation loops of c-Src and Hck did not override regulatory control by SH3:linker displacement, demonstrating that these modes of activation are independent. Our results show that despite the similarity of their downregulated conformations, individual Src-family members show diverse responses to activation by domain displacement which may reflect their adaptation to specific signaling environments in vivo."

As the DHIMS-2 database has not been validated before this study aimed to evaluate its validity.Seven out of ten districts in the Greater Accra Region were randomly sampled; the district hospital and a polyclinic in each district were recruited for validation. Seven pre-specified neonatal health indicators were considered for validation: antenatal registrants, deliveries, total births, live birth, stillbirth, low birthweight, and neonatal death. Data were extracted on these health indicators from the primary data (hospital paper-registers) recorded from January to March 2012. We examined all the data captured during this period as these data have been uploaded to the DHIMS-2 database. The differences between the values of the health indicators obtained from the primary data and that of the facility and DHIMS-2 database were used to assess the accuracy of the database while its completeness was estimated by the percentage of missing data in the primary data.About 41,000 data were assessed and in almost all the districts, the error rates of the DHIMS-2 data were less than 2.1% while the percentages of missing data were below 2%. At the regional level, almost all the health indicators had an error rate below 1% while the overall error rate of the DHIMS-2 database was 0.68% (95% C I = 0.61-0.75) and the percentage of missing data was 3.1% (95% C I = 2.96-3.24).This study demonstrated that the percentage of missing data in the DHIMS-2 database was negligible while its accuracy was close to the acceptable range for high quality data."
https://openalex.org/W2063617469,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling orchestrates a number of critical events including cell growth, differentiation, and cell survival during development. Misregulation of this pathway leads to various human diseases, specifically cancers. Endocytosis and phosphorylation of the LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), an essential co-receptor for Wnt/β-catenin signaling, play a vital role in mediating Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction. However, its regulatory mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we define the mechanisms by which LRP6 endocytic trafficking regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation. We show that LRP6 mutant with defective tyrosine-based signal in its cytoplasmic tail has an increased cell surface distribution and decreased endocytosis rate. These changes in LRP6 endocytosis coincide with an increased distribution to caveolae, increased phosphorylation, and enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We further demonstrate that treatment of Wnt3a ligands or blocking the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of LRP6 leads to a redistribution of wild-type receptor to lipid rafts. The LRP6 tyrosine mutant also exhibited an increase in signaling activation in response to Wnt3a stimulation when compared with wild-type LRP6, and this activation is suppressed when caveolae-mediated endocytosis is blocked. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms by which LRP6 endocytosis routes regulate its phosphorylation and the strength of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and have implications on how this pathway can be modulated in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2093296829,"Fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum is an important disease of wheat and barley worldwide. In a previous study on functional characterization of the F. graminearum kinome, one protein kinase gene important for virulence is orthologous to SCH9 that is functionally related to the cAMP-PKA and TOR pathways in the budding yeast. In this study, we further characterized the functions of FgSCH9 in F. graminearum and its ortholog in Magnaporthe oryzae. The ΔFgsch9 mutant was slightly reduced in growth rate but significantly reduced in conidiation, DON production, and virulence on wheat heads and corn silks. It had increased tolerance to elevated temperatures but became hypersensitive to oxidative, hyperosmotic, cell wall, and membrane stresses. The ΔFgsch9 deletion also had conidium morphology defects and produced smaller conidia. These results suggest that FgSCH9 is important for stress responses, DON production, conidiogenesis, and pathogenesis in F. graminearum. In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the ΔMosch9 mutant also was defective in conidiogenesis and pathogenesis. Interestingly, it also produced smaller conidia and appressoria. Taken together, our data indicate that the SCH9 kinase gene may have a conserved role in regulating conidium size and plant infection in phytopathogenic ascomycetes."
https://openalex.org/W2044061340,"Yeast prions are self-propagating amyloid-like aggregates of Q/N-rich protein that confer heritable traits and provide a model of mammalian amyloidoses. [PSI(+)] is a prion isoform of the translation termination factor Sup35. Propagation of [PSI(+)] during cell division under normal conditions and during the recovery from damaging environmental stress depends on cellular chaperones and is influenced by ubiquitin proteolysis and the actin cytoskeleton. The paralogous yeast proteins Lsb1 and Lsb2 bind the actin assembly protein Las17 (a yeast homolog of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and participate in the endocytic pathway. Lsb2 was shown to modulate maintenance of [PSI(+)] during and after heat shock. Here, we demonstrate that Lsb1 also regulates maintenance of the Sup35 prion during and after heat shock. These data point to the involvement of Lsb proteins in the partitioning of protein aggregates in stressed cells. Lsb1 abundance and cycling between actin patches, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol is regulated by the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored proteins pathway and Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination. Heat shock-induced proteolytic processing of Lsb1 is crucial for prion maintenance during stress. Our findings identify Lsb1 as another component of a tightly regulated pathway controlling protein aggregation in changing environments."
https://openalex.org/W2011472119,"Injury to the peripheral nerve induces dramatic changes in terms of cellular composition that are reflected on RNA quality and quantity, making messenger RNA expression analysis very complex. Several commonly used housekeeping genes are regulated following peripheral nerve injury and are thus not suitable for quantitative real-time PCR normalization; moreover, the presence of pseudogenes in some of them impairs their use. To deal with this problem, we have developed a new method to identify new stable housekeeping genes based on publicly available microarray data on normal and injured nerves. Four new candidate stable genes were identified and validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis on nerves during the different phases after nerve injury: nerve degeneration, regeneration and remyelination. The stability measure of these genes was calculated with both NormFinder and geNorm algorithms and compared with six commonly used housekeeping genes. This procedure allowed us to identify two new and highly stable genes that can be employed for normalizing injured peripheral nerve data: ANKRD27 and RICTOR. Besides providing a tool for peripheral nerve research, our study also describes a simple and cheap procedure that can be used to identify suitable housekeeping genes in other tissues and organs."
https://openalex.org/W2086956229,"Antibody-based technology is the main method for diagnosis and treatment of snake bite envenoming currently. However, the development of an antibody, polyclonal or monoclonal, is a complicated and costly procedure. Aptamers are single stranded oligonucleotides that recognize specific targets such as proteins and have shown great potential over the years as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. In contrast to antibodies, aptamers can be selected in vitro without immunization of animals, and synthesized chemically with extreme accuracy, low cost and high degree of purity. In this study we firstly report on the identification of DNA aptamers that bind to β-bungarotoxin (β-BuTx), a neurotoxin from the venom of Bungarus multicinctus. A plate-SELEX method was used for the selection of β-BuTx specific aptamers. After 10 rounds of selection, four aptamer candidates were obtained, with the dissociation constant ranged from 65.9 nM to 995 nM measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Competitive binding assays using both the fluorescently labeled and unlabeled aptamers revealed that the four aptamers bound to the same binding site of β-BuTx. The best binder, βB-1, bound specifically to β-BuTx, but not to BSA, casein or α-Bungarotoxin. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and enzyme-linked aptamer assay demonstrated that βB-1 could discriminate B. multicinctus venom from other snake venoms tested. The results suggest that aptamer βB-1 can serve as a useful tool for the design and development of drugs and diagnostic tests for β-BuTx poisoning and B. multicinctus bites."
https://openalex.org/W1994186085,"Fbxo45 is an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase, which specifically targets proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Fbxo45 ablation results in defective neuronal differentiation and abnormal formation of neural connections; however, the mechanisms underlying these defects are poorly understood. Using an unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomic screen, we show here that N-cadherin is a novel interactor of Fbxo45. N-cadherin specifically interacts with Fbxo45 through two consensus motifs overlapping the site of calcium-binding and dimerization of the cadherin molecule. N-cadherin interaction with Fbxo45 is significantly abrogated by calcium treatment. Surprisingly, Fbxo45 depletion by RNAi-mediated silencing results in enhanced proteolysis of N-cadherin. Conversely, ectopic expression of Fbxo45 results in decreased proteolysis of N-cadherin. Fbxo45 depletion results in dramatic reduction in N-cadherin expression, impaired neuronal differentiation, and diminished formation of neuronal processes. Our studies reveal an unanticipated role for an F-box protein that inhibits proteolysis in the regulation of a critical biological process."
https://openalex.org/W2100192722,"In the context of genetics and breeding research on multiple phenotypic traits, reconstructing the directional or causal structure between phenotypic traits is a prerequisite for quantifying the effects of genetic interventions on the traits. Current approaches mainly exploit the genetic effects at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to learn about causal relationships among phenotypic traits. A requirement for using these approaches is that at least one unique QTL has been identified for each trait studied. However, in practice, especially for molecular phenotypes such as metabolites, this prerequisite is often not met due to limited sample sizes, high noise levels and small QTL effects. Here, we present a novel heuristic search algorithm called the QTL+phenotype supervised orientation (QPSO) algorithm to infer causal directions for edges in undirected phenotype networks. The two main advantages of this algorithm are: first, it does not require QTLs for each and every trait; second, it takes into account associated phenotypic interactions in addition to detected QTLs when orienting undirected edges between traits. We evaluate and compare the performance of QPSO with another state-of-the-art approach, the QTL-directed dependency graph (QDG) algorithm. Simulation results show that our method has broader applicability and leads to more accurate overall orientations. We also illustrate our method with a real-life example involving 24 metabolites and a few major QTLs measured on an association panel of 93 tomato cultivars. Matlab source code implementing the proposed algorithm is freely available upon request."
https://openalex.org/W1985126799,"In frequently burned ecosystems, many plants persist by repeated resprouting from basal or belowground buds. This strategy requires that plants reach a balance between biomass loss and recovery, which depends on the shape of the relationship between pre- and post-fire size. Previous analyses of this relationship, however, have focused on the size of the largest stem, which ignores the importance of the multi-stem growth habit that is common in pyrogenic ecosystems. We hypothesized that the presence of multiple stems causes a substantial shift in the relationship between pre- and post-fire size and in the relationship between pre-fire size and size recovery. We measured the height and basal diameter, then calculated volume and biomass, of all stems of six tree species before and nine months after complete removal of aboveground biomass via coppicing. The number of resprouts was correlated with the original number of stems for four species. For all species, the relationship between pre-coppicing and resprout size fit a positive curvilinear function, and the shape of this curve did not differ for maximum and total stem size. Smaller individuals recovered a larger proportion of their pre-coppicing size than larger individuals, but the shape of the size recovery curves were the same regardless of whether the analysis was performed with all stems or only the largest stem. Our results indicate that measuring only the largest stem of multi-stemmed individuals is sufficient to assess the ability of individuals to recover after complete loss of aboveground biomass and persist under frequent burning."
https://openalex.org/W2046704686,"Neuronal morphogenesis is implicated in neuronal function and development with rearrangement of cytoskeletal organization. Ezrin, a member of Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) proteins links between membrane proteins and actin cytoskeleton, and contributes to maintenance of cellular function and morphology. In cultured hippocampal neurons, suppression of both radixin and moesin showed deficits in growth cone morphology and neurite extensions. Down-regulation of ezrin using siRNA caused impairment of netrin-1-induced axon outgrowth in cultured cortical neurons. However, roles of ezrin in the neuronal morphogenesis of the cultured neurons have been poorly understood. In this report, we performed detailed studies on the roles of ezrin in the cultured cortical neurons prepared from the ezrin knockdown (Vil2(kd/kd)) mice embryo that showed a very small amount of ezrin expression compared with the wild-type (Vil2(+/+)) neurons. Ezrin was mainly expressed in cell body in the cultured cortical neurons. We demonstrated that the cultured cortical neurons prepared from the Vil2(kd/kd) mice embryo exhibited impairment of neuritogenesis. Moreover, we observed increased RhoA activity and phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), as a downstream effector of RhoA in the Vil2(kd/kd) neurons. In addition, inhibition of Rho kinase and myosin II rescued the impairment of neuritogenesis in the Vil2(kd/kd) neurons. These data altogether suggest a novel role of ezrin in the neuritogenesis of the cultured cortical neurons through down-regulation of RhoA activity."
https://openalex.org/W2068801609,"Purpose Transdifferentiation of human Tenon fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and subsequent deposition of extracellular matrix is a key step in the scarring after glaucoma filtration surgery. The p38 signaling pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation, and its upstream regulators and downstream molecules are widely distributed in the eye. We aimed to investigate the role of p38 in the activation of Tenon fibroblasts and that of the anti-fibrotic mechanism of rosiglitazone in the modulation of the p38 signaling pathway. Methods Cultured Tenon fibroblasts were stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Activation of p38 was examined by western blot analysis. Rosiglitazone and blocking of the p38 signaling pathway by SB203580 were used to antagonize stimulation by TGF-β1. Fibroblast motility was examined by wound closure assay; alpha-smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, and collagen type I were determined by qPCR and western blot. Expression and localization of alpha-smooth muscle actin were determined by immunofluorescence staining. Results Phosphorylated p38 was upregulated in fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-β1, and this effect was substantially inhibited by rosiglitazone. Proliferation and migration of fibroblasts were suppressed by rosiglitazone and SB203580. Expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, and collagen type I were decreased at the mRNA and protein levels by rosiglitazone and SB203580. However, the inhibitory effect of SB203580 on transcription and protein expression was weaker than that of rosiglitazone. Similar phenomena were found on immunofluorescence microscopy of alpha-smooth muscle actin. Conclusions The p38 signaling pathway mediates the TGF-β1-induced transdifferentiation of human Tenon fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Rosiglitazone can exert anti-fibrotic activity by interfering with the TGF-β/p38 signaling pathway and might be useful for modulating scar formation after glaucoma filtration surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1974040640,"Oncogenic K-Ras represents the most common molecular change in human lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The presence of K-Ras mutation is associated with a poor prognosis, but no effective treatment strategies are available for K-Ras -mutant NSCLC. Epidemiological studies report higher lung cancer mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes. Here, we use a mouse model of K-Ras-mediated lung cancer on a background of chronic hyperglycemia to determine whether elevated circulating glycemic levels could influence oncogenic K-Ras-mediated tumor development. Inducible oncogenic K-Ras mouse model was treated with subtoxic doses of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce chronic hyperglycemia. We observed increased tumor mass and higher grade of malignancy in STZ treated diabetic mice analyzed at 4, 12 and 24 weeks, suggesting that oncogenic K-Ras increased lung tumorigenesis in hyperglycemic condition. This promoting effect is achieved by expansion of tumor-initiating lung bronchio-alveolar stem cells (BASCs) in bronchio-alveolar duct junction, indicating a role of hyperglycemia in the activity of K-Ras-transformed putative lung stem cells. Notably, after oncogene K-Ras activation, BASCs show upregulation of the glucose transporter (Glut1/Slc2a1), considered as an important player of the active control of tumor cell metabolism by oncogenic K-Ras. Our novel findings suggest that anti-hyperglycemic drugs, such as metformin, may act as therapeutic agent to restrict lung neoplasia promotion and progression."

https://openalex.org/W2095017644,"ERdj3, a mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp40/DnaJ family member, binds unfolded proteins, transfers them to BiP, and concomitantly stimulates BiP ATPase activity. However, the requirements for ERdj3 binding to and release from substrates in cells are not well understood. We found that ERdj3 homodimers that cannot stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP (QPD mutants) bound to unfolded ER proteins under steady state conditions in much greater amounts than wild-type ERdj3. This was due to reduced release from these substrates as opposed to enhanced binding, although in both cases dimerization was strictly required for substrate binding. Conversely, heterodimers consisting of one wild-type and one mutant ERdj3 subunit bound substrates at levels comparable with wild-type ERdj3 homodimers, demonstrating that release requires only one protomer to be functional in stimulating BiP ATPase activity. Co-expressing wild-type ERdj3 and a QPD mutant, which each exclusively formed homodimers, revealed that the release rate of wild-type ERdj3 varied according to the relative half-lives of substrates, suggesting that ERdj3 release is an important step in degradation of unfolded client proteins in the ER. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments revealed that the binding of QPD mutant homodimers remained constant as opposed to increasing, suggesting that ERdj3 does not normally undergo reiterative binding cycles with substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2088716168,"Olfactory adaptation is a fundamental process for the functioning of the olfactory system, but the underlying mechanisms regulating its occurrence in intact olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are not fully understood. In this work, we have combined stochastic computational modeling and a systematic pharmacological study of different signaling pathways to investigate their impact during short-term adaptation (STA). We used odorant stimulation and electroolfactogram (EOG) recordings of the olfactory epithelium treated with pharmacological blockers to study the molecular mechanisms regulating the occurrence of adaptation in OSNs. EOG responses to paired-pulses of odorants showed that inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and phosphatases enhanced the levels of STA in the olfactory epithelium, and this effect was mimicked by blocking vesicle exocytosis and reduced by blocking cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and vesicle endocytosis. These results suggest that G-coupled receptors (GPCRs) cycling is involved with the occurrence of STA. To gain insights on the dynamical aspects of this process, we developed a stochastic computational model. The model consists of the olfactory transduction currents mediated by the cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels and calcium ion (Ca(2+))-activated chloride (CAC) channels, and the dynamics of their respective ligands, cAMP and Ca(2+), and it simulates the EOG results obtained under different experimental conditions through changes in the amplitude and duration of cAMP and Ca(2+) response, two second messengers implicated with STA occurrence. The model reproduced the experimental data for each pharmacological treatment and provided a mechanistic explanation for the action of GPCR cycling in the levels of second messengers modulating the levels of STA. All together, these experimental and theoretical results indicate the existence of a mechanism of regulation of STA by signaling pathways that control GPCR cycling and tune the levels of second messengers in OSNs, and not only by CNG channel desensitization as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W1982784487,"Delays in treatment of in-hospital stroke (IHS) adversely affect patient outcomes. We hypothesised that early referral and specialist management of IHS patients will improve outcomes at 90 days. Baseline characteristics, assessment delays, thrombolysis eligibility, 90-day functional outcomes and all-cause mortality were compared between IHS patients referred for specialist stroke management within 3 hours of symptom onset (early referrals) and later referrals. Patients were identified from a prospective stroke registry between January 2009 and December 2010. Inclusion criteria were primary admission with a non-stroke diagnosis, onset of new neurological deficits after admission and early ischaemic changes on CT or MR imaging. Eighty four (4.6%) of 1836 stroke patients had IHS (mean age 74 year; 51% male, median NIHSS score 10). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between 53 (63%) early and 31 (37%) late referrals. Thrombolysis was performed in 29 (76%) of the 37/78 (47%) potentially eligible patients; 7 patients were excluded because specialist referral was delayed beyond 4.5 hours despite symptom recognition within 3 hours of onset. Early referral improved functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at 90 days 40% v 7%, p = 0.001) and was an independent predictor of mRS 0-2 at 90 days after adjusting for age, pre-morbid function, primary cause for hospital admission and stroke severity [OR 1.13 (95% C.I. = 1.10-1.27), p = 0.002]. Early referral and specialist management of IHS patients that includes thrombolysis is associated with better functional outcomes at 90 days."
https://openalex.org/W1991223680,"One of the primary functions of music is to convey emotion, yet how music accomplishes this task remains unclear. For example, simple correlations between mode (major vs. minor) and emotion (happy vs. sad) do not adequately explain the enormous range, subtlety or complexity of musically induced emotions. In this study, we examined the structural features of unconstrained musical improvisations generated by jazz pianists in response to emotional cues. We hypothesized that musicians would not utilize any universal rules to convey emotions, but would instead combine heterogeneous musical elements together in order to depict positive and negative emotions. Our findings demonstrate a lack of simple correspondence between emotions and musical features of spontaneous musical improvisation. While improvisations in response to positive emotional cues were more likely to be in major keys, have faster tempos, faster key press velocities and more staccato notes when compared to negative improvisations, there was a wide distribution for each emotion with components that directly violated these primary associations. The finding that musicians often combine disparate features together in order to convey emotion during improvisation suggests that structural diversity may be an essential feature of the ability of music to express a wide range of emotion."

Antenatal and neonatal data were compared between groups. The control group (1300) was composed of the four singleton vaginal deliveries that immediately followed each birth injury. A multivariable logistic regression model, with backward elimination, was constructed in order to find independent risk factors associated with BPI and CF. A subgroup analysis involved comparison of features of BPI cases with or without associated shoulder dystocia.During the study period, the total number of vaginal deliveries was 44092. The rates of CF, BPI and shoulder dystocia during the study period were 0,6%, 0,16% and 0,29%, respectively. In the logistic regression model, shoulder dystocia, GDM, multiparity, gestational age >42 weeks, protracted labor, short second stage of labor and fetal birth weight greater than 4250 grams increased the risk of CF independently. Shoulder dystocia and protracted labor were independently associated with BPI when controlled for other factors. Among neonates with BPI whose injury was not associated with shoulder dystocia, five (12.2%) sustained permanent injury, whereas one neonate (4.5%) with BPI following shoulder dystocia sustained permanent injury (p = 0.34).BPI not associated with shoulder dystocia might have a higher rate of concomitant CF and permanent sequelae."

The presence of MPL gene mutations is a critical diagnostic criterion for these diseases. Here, we developed a rapid, simple, and cost-effective method of detecting two major MPL mutations, MPLW515L/K, in a single PCR assay; we termed this method DARMS (dual amplification refractory mutation system)-PCR. DARMS-PCR is designed to produce three different PCR products corresponding to MPLW515L, MPLW515K, and all MPL alleles. The amplicons are later detected and quantified using a capillary sequencer to determine the relative frequencies of the mutant and wild-type alleles. Applying DARMS-PCR to human specimens, we successfully identified MPL mutations in MPN patients, with the exception of patients bearing mutant allele frequencies below the detection limit (5%) of this method. The MPL mutant allele frequencies determined using DARMS-PCR correlated strongly with the values determined using deep sequencing. Thus, we demonstrated the potential of DARMS-PCR to detect MPL mutations and determine the allele frequencies in a timely and cost-effective manner."

Despite high prevalence of stress among patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, little is known about whether and how stress exerts an effect on the course of hepatitis B.Eighty patients with chronic hepatitis B(CHB) completed the Perceived Stress Scale-10(PSS-10) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI). Fresh whole blood was subject to flow cytometry for lymphocytes count. Plasma samples frozen at -80 °C were thawed for cytokines, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and virus load. These patients were grouped into high or low perceived stress, state anxiety and trait anxiety groups according to the scale score. Sociodemographic, disease-specific characteristics, lymphocytes count and cytokines were compared.Firstly, a negative association between ALT and stress (t = -4.308; p = .000), state anxiety (t = -3.085; p = .003) and trait anxiety (t = -4.925; p = .000) were found. As ALT is a surrogate marker of hepatocytes injury, and liver injury is a consequence of immune responses. Next, we tested the relationship between stress/anxiety and lymphocytes. No statistical significance were found with respect to counts of total T cells, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, NK cell, and B cell count between high and low stress group. Type-2 cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) level was significantly higher in high stress group relative to lower counterpart (t = 6.538; p = 0.000), and type-1 cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) level shown a decreased tendency in high stress group (t = -1.702; p = 0.093). Finally, INF-γ:IL-10 ratio displayed significant decrease in high perceived stress(t = -4.606; p = 0.000), state anxiety(t = -5.126; p = 0.000) and trait anxiety(t = -4.670; p = 0.000) groups relative to low counterparts.Our data show stress is not related to the lymphocyte cells count in CHB patients, however, stress induces a shift in the type-1/type-2 cytokine balance towards a type-2 response, which implicated a role of psychological stress in the course of HBV related immune-pathogenesis."

Different conformational changes in the channel pore have been described during channel opening and closing; however, the relative importance of these changes to the process of gating the pore is not known. We have used patch clamp recording to identify high affinity Cd2+ bridges formed between pairs of pore-lining cysteine residues introduced into different transmembrane α-helices (TMs). Seven Cd2+ bridges were identified forming between cysteines in TMs 6 and 12. Interestingly, each of these Cd2+ bridges apparently formed only in closed channels, and their formation stabilized the closed state. In contrast, a single Cd2+ bridge identified between cysteines in TMs 1 and 12 stabilized the channel open state. Analysis of the pattern of Cd2+ bridge formation in different channel states suggests that lateral separation and convergence of different TMs, rather than relative rotation or translation of different TMs, is the key conformational change that causes the channel pore to open and close.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 2The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorABCATP-binding cassetteMSDmembrane-spanning domainNBDnucleotide-binding domainTMtransmembrane α-helix. a phosphorylation-regulated, nucleotide-gated Cl− channel found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types (1.Lubamba B.

CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, with an archetypal architecture of two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), each made up of six transmembrane α-helices (TMs) and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (see Fig. 1). CFTR also contains a unique cytoplasmic regulatory domain. Opening and closing of phosphorylated CFTR channels are controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis by a dimer of the two NBDs; this is presumed to result in the opening and closing of a gate within the MSDs that allows or prevents the transmembrane movement of Cl− and other small anions (2.Hwang T.-C.

The channel pore is lined by a subset of the TMs, with TMs 1, 6, and 12 playing particularly important functional roles (2.Hwang T.-C. Kirk K.L.

Functional architecture of the CFTR chloride channel.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). At the functional level, the pore is divided into a central narrow region flanked by wider inner and outer vestibules (3.Linsdell P. Functional architecture of the CFTR chloride channel.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The contributions of different TMs, and specific amino acid side chains coming from different TMs, to each of these functionally distinct, two-dimensional regions of the pore has been reviewed recently (3.Linsdell P. Functional architecture of the CFTR chloride channel.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, the three-dimensional structure of the pore is less well defined experimentally. Three-dimensional atomic homology models of CFTR have been generated based on related, non-ion channel ABC proteins (4.Mornon J.-P. Lehn P. Callebaut I.

Functional architecture of the CFTR chloride channel.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2014; 31: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the pore is not static but presumably changes as the channel opens and closes. Indeed, different conformational changes of the pore during channel gating have been proposed (2.Hwang T.-C. Kirk K.L. The CFTR ion channel: gating, regulation, and anion permeation.Cold Spring Harb.

However, how the relative positions of these TM changes in three-dimensional space during channel gating have not previously been investigated.

Li M.-S. Qi. J. Linsdell P. Regulation of conductance by the number of fixed positive charges in the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR chloride channel pore.J. Gen.

J. 2012; 103: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used the oxidizing agent copper(II)-o-phenanthroline to show that disulfide bonds can be formed between cysteine side chains introduced into different TMs, and we used this information to infer the relative proximity of residues in these different TMs lining the inner vestibule of the pore (13.Wang W.

Physiol. 2010; 135: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, because these disulfide bonds are essentially irreversible under non-reducing conditions, this approach has several disadvantages, such as the potential for disulfide bonds to form during rare or unnatural channel conformations when normally distant cysteine side chains transiently approach close together. Furthermore, the irreversible nature of disulfide bonds makes it difficult to investigate state-dependent changes in the proximity of pairs of cysteine side chains. An alternative approach is to use weaker Cd2+ bridges that are more likely to catch the channel in native conformations (19.Webster S.M. Del Camino D. Dekker J.P. Yellen G.

Tracking a complete voltage-sensor cycle with metal-ion bridges.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8552-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An additional advantage is that these weaker, reversible interactions can break and reform, allowing channel gating to proceed relatively normally (22.Henrion U. Renhorn J. Börjesson S.I. Nelson E.M. Schwaiger C.S. Bjelkmar P. Wallner B. Lindahl E. Elinder F. Tracking a complete voltage-sensor cycle with metal-ion bridges.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8552-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and so potentially providing information on the relative propensity of Cd2+ bridges to form in different gating states. In the present study, we have investigated the potential of Cd2+ to form metal bridges between nearby pore-lining cysteine side chains introduced into TMs 1, 6, and 12 lining a localized region of the inner vestibule of the channel pore close to an anionic blocker-binding site (17.Zhou J.-J. Li M.-S. Qi. J. Linsdell P. Regulation of conductance by the number of fixed positive charges in the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR chloride channel pore.J. Gen.

J. 2012; 103: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In particular, we have taken advantage of the dynamic nature of Cd2+ bridges to associate the formation of these bridges with different channel conformational states. Our results show that Cd2+ bridges form selectively between a limited number of cysteine pairs in TMs 6 and 12, suggesting a relative alignment of these two TMs. Interestingly, each of these bridges appears to form only in closed channels, and they stabilize the channel in the closed state. In contrast, a single identified Cd2+ bridge between TMs 1 and 12 stabilized the channel in the open state. These results support a model in which relative lateral movement of different TMs toward and away from each other in the inner vestibule, rather than helical rotation or translation of individual TMs, is required for the channel to open and close. Experiments were carried out in baby hamster kidney cells transiently transfected with CFTR. In this study, we have used a human CFTR variant in which all cysteines had been removed by mutagenesis (as described in Ref. 23.Mense M. Vergani P. White D.M. Altberg G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C.

Both intracellular (bath) and extracellular (pipette) solutions contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonate, pH 7.4. Current traces were filtered at 100 Hz using an eight-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 250 Hz, and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). CFTR current amplitudes were monitored during brief voltage deflections (to ±50 mV) from a holding potential of 0 mV applied every 6 s (10.Wang W. El Hiani Y. Rubaiy H.N. Linsdell P.

In some cases, the identity of CFTR currents in inside-out patches was confirmed by their sensitivity to the specific inhibitor CFTRinh-172 (5 µm). Different concentrations of CdCl2 were applied directly to the cytoplasmic face of inside-out patches from stock solutions made up in normal intracellular solution. In those cases where exposure to Cd2+ caused inhibition of current amplitude, concentration-inhibition relationships were fitted by the equation.

Combination of each single cysteine mutant from each TM then gave a total of 28 double-cysteine mutants containing one cysteine in TM6 and one cysteine in TM12 within the putative inner vestibule of the pore. Cys-less CFTR itself was weakly inhibited by the addition of millimolar concentrations of Cd2+ to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 2, A and B), presumably acting in a cysteine-independent manner. All 11 single cysteine mutants tested were more strongly inhibited by Cd2+ (Fig. 2, A and B), with estimated Ki values in the range of 70–250 µm (Fig. 3). This suggests that Cd2+ is able to bind to each of these introduced cysteine side chains (29.Choi L.-S. Mach T. Bayley H.

https://openalex.org/W2022835419,"Background Clinical scores can be of aid to predict early mortality after admission to a medical admission unit. A developed scoring system needs to be externally validated to minimise the risk of the discriminatory power and calibration to be falsely elevated. We performed the present study with the objective of validating the Simple Clinical Score (SCS) and the HOTEL score, two existing risk stratification systems that predict mortality for medical patients based solely on clinical information, but not only vital signs. Methods Pre-planned prospective observational cohort study. Setting Danish 460-bed regional teaching hospital. Findings We included 3046 consecutive patients from 2 October 2008 until 19 February 2009. 26 (0.9%) died within one calendar day and 196 (6.4%) died within 30 days. We calculated SCS for 1080 patients. We found an AUROC of 0.960 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.932 to 0.988) for 24-hours mortality and 0.826 (95% CI, 0.774–0.879) for 30-day mortality, and goodness-of-fit test, χ2 = 2.68 (10 degrees of freedom), P = 0.998 and χ2 = 4.00, P = 0.947, respectively. We included 1470 patients when calculating the HOTEL score. Discriminatory power (AUROC) was 0.931 (95% CI, 0.901–0.962) for 24-hours mortality and goodness-of-fit test, χ2 = 5.56 (10 degrees of freedom), P = 0.234. Conclusion We find that both the SCS and HOTEL scores showed an excellent to outstanding ability in identifying patients at high risk of dying with good or acceptable precision."
https://openalex.org/W2013432458,"Learning disabilities (LDs) are the most common psychiatric disorders in children. LDs are classified either as ""Specific"" or ""Learning Disorder Not Otherwise Specified"". An important hypothesis suggests a failure in general domain process (i.e., attention) that explains global academic deficiencies. The aim of this study was to evaluate event-related potential (ERP) patterns of LD Not Otherwise Specified children with respect to a control group. Forty-one children (8-10.6 years old) participated and performed a semantic judgment priming task while ERPs were recorded. Twenty-one LD children had significantly lower scores in all academic skills (reading, writing and arithmetic) than twenty controls. Different ERP patterns were observed for each group. Control group showed smaller amplitudes of an anterior P200 for unrelated than related word pairs. This P200 effect was followed by a significant early N400a effect (greater amplitudes for unrelated than related word pairs; 350-550 ms) with a right topographical distribution. By contrast, LD Not Otherwise Specified group did not show a P200 effect or a significant N400a effect. This evidence suggests that LD Not Otherwise Specified children might be deficient in reading, writing and arithmetic domains because of their sluggish shifting of attention to process the incoming information."

https://openalex.org/W2091340868,"Cys loop receptors are pentameric arrangements of independent subunits that assemble into functional ion channels. Each subunit shows a domain architecture. Functional ion channels can be reconstituted even from independent, nonfunctional subunit domains, as shown previously for GlyRα1 receptors. Here, we demonstrate that this reconstitution is not restricted to α1 but can be transferred to other members of the Cys loop receptor family. A nonfunctional GlyR subunit, truncated at the intracellular TM3-4 loop by a premature stop codon, can be complemented by co-expression of the missing tail portion of the receptor. Compared with α1 subunits, rescue by domain complementation was less efficient when GlyRα3 or the GABAA/C subunit ρ1 was used. If truncation disrupted an alternative splicing cassette within the intracellular TM3-4 loop of α3 subunits, which also regulates receptor desensitization, functional rescue was not possible. When α3 receptors were restored by complementation using domains with and without the spliced insert, no difference in desensitization was found. In contrast, desensitization properties could even be transferred between α1/α3 receptor chimeras harboring or lacking the α3 splice cassette proving that functional rescue depends on the integrity of the alternative splicing cassette in α3. Thus, an intact α3 splicing cassette in the TM3-4 loop environment is indispensable for functional rescue, and the quality of receptor restoration can be assessed from desensitization properties."
https://openalex.org/W2024296735,"Plum bark necrosis stem pitting-associated virus (PBNSPaV), a member of the genus Ampelovirus in the family Closteroviridae, infects different Prunus species and has a worldwide distribution. Yet the population structure and genetic diversity of the virus is still unclear. In this study, sequence analyses of a partial heat shock protein 70 homolog (HSP70h) gene and coat protein (CP) gene of PBNSPaV isolates from seven Prunus species grown in China revealed a highly divergent Chinese PBNSPaV population, sharing nucleotide similarities of 73.1-100% with HSP70h gene, and 83.9-98.6% with CP gene. Phylogenetic analysis of HSP70h and CP sequences revealed segregation of global PBNSPaV isolates into four phylo-groups (I-IV), of which two newly identified groups, II and IV, solely comprised Chinese isolates. Complete genome sequences of three PBNSPaV isolates, Pch-WH-1 and Pch-GS-3 from peaches, and Plm-WH-3 from a plum tree, were determined. The three isolates showed overall nucleotide identities of 90.0% (Pch-GS-3) and 96.4% (Pch-WH-1) with the type isolate PL186, and the lowest identity of 70.2-71.2% with isolate Nanjing. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we report evidence of significant recombination in the HSP70h gene of PBNSPaV variant Pch2 by using five programs implemented in RDP3; in addition, five codon positions in its CP gene (3, 8, 44, 57, and 88) were identified that appeared to be under positive selection. Collectively, these results indicate a divergent Chinese PBNSPaV population. In addition, our findings provide a foundation for elucidating the epidemiological characteristics of virus population."
https://openalex.org/W2055930668,"Salmonella Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen, which causes typhoid fever and remains a global health problem in the developing countries. Although previously reported host expression datasets had identified putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets of typhoid fever, the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenesis remains incompletely understood.We used five gene expression datasets of human peripheral blood from patients suffering from S. Typhi or other bacteremic infections or non-infectious disease like leukemia. The expression datasets were merged into human protein interaction network (PIN) and the expression correlation between the hubs and their interacting proteins was measured by calculating Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) values. The differences in the average PCC for each hub between the disease states and their respective controls were calculated for studied datasets. The individual hubs and their interactors with expression, PCC and average PCC values were treated as dynamic subnetworks. The hubs that showed unique trends of alterations specific to S. Typhi infection were identified.We identified S. Typhi infection-specific dynamic subnetworks of the host, which involve 81 hubs and 1343 interactions. The major enriched GO biological process terms in the identified subnetworks were regulation of apoptosis and biological adhesions, while the enriched pathways include cytokine signalling in the immune system and downstream TCR signalling. The dynamic nature of the hubs CCR1, IRS2 and PRKCA with their interactors was studied in detail. The difference in the dynamics of the subnetworks specific to S. Typhi infection suggests a potential molecular model of typhoid fever.Hubs and their interactors of the S. Typhi infection-specific dynamic subnetworks carrying distinct PCC values compared with the non-typhoid and other disease conditions reveal new insight into the pathogenesis of S. Typhi."
https://openalex.org/W1966001461,"Background We found the first evidence of the efficacy of a herbal treatment with myrrh, dry extract of chamomile flowers, and coffee charcoal for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the impact of the herbal treatment on the CD4+ T-cell compartment, which is essential for both the induction of UC and the maintenance of tolerance in the gut, is not well understood. Aim To analyze the frequency and functional phenotype of CD4+ T cells and of immune-suppressive CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells (Tregs) in healthy control subjects, patients with UC in remission, and patients with clinical flare of UC. Methods Patients in clinical remission were treated with either mesalazine or the herbal preparation for 12 months. The frequencies of whole CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD25med effector T cells, and Tregs and the expression of Foxp3 within the CD4+CD25hig Tregs were determined by flow cytometry at 6 time points. We determined the suppressive capability of Tregs from healthy control subjects and from patients in remission or clinical flare. Results A total of 79 patients (42 women, 37 men; mean age, 48.5 years; 38 with clinical flare) and 5 healthy control subjects were included in the study. At baseline the frequencies of whole CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD25med effector cells, and Tregs did not differ between the two treatment groups and the healthy control subjects. In addition, patients with UC in sustained clinical remission showed no alteration from baseline after 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 months of either treatment. In contrast, CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD25medeffector T cells, and Tregs demonstrated distinctly different patterns at time points pre-flare and flare. The mesalazine group showed a continuous but not statistically significant increase from baseline to pre-flare and flare (p = ns). In the herbal treatment group, however, the percentage of the CD4+ T cells was lower at pre-flare than at baseline. This decrease was completely reversed after flare, when a significant increase was seen (CD4+CD25med pre-flare/flare p = 0.0461; CD4+CD25high baseline/flare p = 0.0269 and pre-flare/flare p = 0.0032). In contrast, no changes in the expression of Foxp3 cells were detected within the subsets of CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells. Of note, no alterations were detected in the suppressive capability of CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors, from patients in remission, or from patients with clinical flare. Conclusions In patients with UC experiencing acute flare, the CD4+ T compartment demonstrates a distinctly different pattern during treatment with myrrh, chamomile extract, and coffee charcoal than during treatment with mesalazine. These findings suggest an active repopulation of regulatory T cells during active disease. Trial Registration EU Clinical Trials Register 2007-007928-18/DE"
https://openalex.org/W1992572522,"Background Cancer rates in Africa are projected to double by 2030 due to aging and increased exposure to cancer risk factors, including modifiable risk factors. We assessed adherence to 5 modifiable cancer risk factors across 18 African countries. Methods Data on adults 18 years and older were obtained from the 2002–2004 World Health Survey. Adherence to current World Cancer Research Fund guidelines on smoking, alcohol, body weight, physical activity, and nutrition was assessed. Adherence scores ranged from 0 (no guideline met) to 5 (all guidelines met). Determinants of adherence were assessed using multivariable linear regression adjusted for individual and country level characteristics. Results Across all countries, adherence to the guidelines among adults was high for smoking (72%–99%) and alcohol (85%–100%), but low for body weight (1.8%–78%), physical activity (3.4%–84%) and nutrition (1.4%–61%). Overall adherence score ranged from 2.32 in Mali to 3.72 in Comoros. In multivariable models, residing in low versus high SES households was associated with reduced adherence by 0.24 and 0.21 points for men and women respectively after adjusting for age, gender, education, and marital status (p<0.001). Every % increase in GDP spent on health was associated with increased adherence by 0.03 in men and 0.09 in women (p<0.001). Conclusions The wide variation in adherence to cancer prevention guidelines observed across countries and between population sub-groups suggests the need for targeted public health efforts to improve behaviors related to body weight, physical activity and nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2033411601,"GAT-1 is a sodium- and chloride-coupled GABA transporter and a member of the neurotransmitter:sodium:symporters, which are crucial for synaptic transmission. The structure of bacterial homologue LeuT shows a thin extracellular gate consisting of a charge and an aromatic pair. Here we addressed the question of whether mutation of the aromatic and charge pair residues of GAT-1 has similar consequences. In contrast to charge pair mutants, significant radioactive GABA transport was retained by mutants of the aromatic pair residue Phe-294. Moreover, the magnitude of maximal transport currents induced by GABA by these mutants was comparable with those by wild type GAT-1. However, the apparent affinity of the nonconserved mutants for GABA was reduced up to 20-fold relative to wild type. The voltage dependence of the sodium-dependent transient currents of the Phe-294 mutants was similar to that of the wild type. On the other hand, the conserved charge pair mutant D451E exhibited a right-shifted voltage dependence, indicating an increased apparent affinity for sodium. In further contrast to D451E, whereas the extracellular aqueous accessibility of an endogenous cysteine residue to a membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent was increased relative to wild type, this was not the case for the aromatic pair mutants. Our data indicate that, in contrast to the charge pair, the aromatic pair is not essential for gating. Instead they are compatible with the idea that they serve to diminish dissociation of the substrate from the binding pocket."
