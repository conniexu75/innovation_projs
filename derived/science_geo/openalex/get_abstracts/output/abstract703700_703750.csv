https://openalex.org/W4308045442,"Despite notable scientific and medical advances, broader political, socioeconomic and behavioural factors continue to undercut the response to the COVID-19 pandemic1,2. Here we convened, as part of this Delphi study, a diverse, multidisciplinary panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization, government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories to recommend specific actions to end this persistent global threat to public health. The panel developed a set of 41 consensus statements and 57 recommendations to governments, health systems, industry and other key stakeholders across six domains: communication; health systems; vaccination; prevention; treatment and care; and inequities. In the wake of nearly three years of fragmented global and national responses, it is instructive to note that three of the highest-ranked recommendations call for the adoption of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches1, while maintaining proven prevention measures using a vaccines-plus approach2 that employs a range of public health and financial support measures to complement vaccination. Other recommendations with at least 99% combined agreement advise governments and other stakeholders to improve communication, rebuild public trust and engage communities3 in the management of pandemic responses. The findings of the study, which have been further endorsed by 184 organizations globally, include points of unanimous agreement, as well as six recommendations with >5% disagreement, that provide health and social policy actions to address inadequacies in the pandemic response and help to bring this public health threat to an end."
https://openalex.org/W4308099893,"Targeted protein degradation is a novel pharmacology established by drugs that recruit target proteins to E3 ubiquitin ligases. Based on the structure of the degrader and the target, different E3 interfaces are critically involved, thus forming defined ‘functional hotspots’. Understanding disruptive mutations in functional hotspots informs on the architecture of the assembly, and highlights residues susceptible to acquire resistance phenotypes. Here we employ haploid genetics to show that hotspot mutations cluster in substrate receptors of hijacked ligases, where mutation type and frequency correlate with gene essentiality. Intersection with deep mutational scanning revealed hotspots that are conserved or specific for chemically distinct degraders and targets. Biophysical and structural validation suggests that hotspot mutations frequently converge on altered ternary complex assembly. Moreover, we validated hotspots mutated in patients that relapse from degrader treatment. In sum, we present a fast and widely accessible methodology to characterize small-molecule degraders and associated resistance mechanisms. Coupling haploid genetics with deep scanning mutagenesis, Hanzl et al. identified functional hotspots in E3 ubiquitin ligases that are selectively required for different proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glue degraders and found mutated in relapsing patients."
https://openalex.org/W4308045236,"Spatial transcriptomics reveals the spatial context of gene expression, but current methods are limited to assaying polyadenylated (A-tailed) RNA transcripts. Here we demonstrate that enzymatic in situ polyadenylation of RNA enables detection of the full spectrum of RNAs, expanding the scope of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics to the total transcriptome. We demonstrate that our spatial total RNA-sequencing (STRS) approach captures coding RNAs, noncoding RNAs and viral RNAs. We apply STRS to study skeletal muscle regeneration and viral-induced myocarditis. Our analyses reveal the spatial patterns of noncoding RNA expression with near-cellular resolution, identify spatially defined expression of noncoding transcripts in skeletal muscle regeneration and highlight host transcriptional responses associated with local viral RNA abundance. STRS requires adding only one step to the widely used Visium spatial total RNA-sequencing protocol from 10x Genomics, and thus could be easily adopted to enable new insights into spatial gene regulation and biology."

https://openalex.org/W4308194484,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of healthcare services worldwide, raising the need to develop novel tools to provide rapid and cost-effective screening and diagnosis. Clinical reports indicated that COVID-19 infection may cause cardiac injury, and electrocardiograms (ECG) may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for COVID-19. This study aims to utilize ECG signals to detect COVID-19 automatically. We propose a novel method to extract ECG signals from ECG paper records, which are then fed into one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to learn and diagnose the disease. To evaluate the quality of digitized signals, R peaks in the paper-based ECG images are labeled. Afterward, RR intervals calculated from each image are compared to RR intervals of the corresponding digitized signal. Experiments on the COVID-19 ECG images dataset demonstrate that the proposed digitization method is able to capture correctly the original signals, with a mean absolute error of 28.11 ms. The 1D-CNN model (SEResNet18), which is trained on the digitized ECG signals, allows to identify between individuals with COVID-19 and other subjects accurately, with classification accuracies of 98.42% and 98.50% for classifying COVID-19 vs. Normal and COVID-19 vs. other classes, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves a high-level of performance for the multi-classification task. Our findings indicate that a deep learning system trained on digitized ECG signals can serve as a potential tool for diagnosing COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4308196510,"Renal fibrosis, a common pathological manifestation of virtually all types of chronic kidney disease (CKD), ultimately predisposes patients to end-stage renal disease. However, there is no effective therapy for renal fibrosis. Our earlier studies proved that RIP3-mediated necroptosis might be an important mode of renal tubular cell death in rats with chronic renal injury. Under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found morphological changes in the necrosis of human renal tissue, and the percentage of necrotic cells increased significantly in patients with stages 2 and 3a CKD. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that the percentages of TUNEL+/RIP3+ double-positive and TUNEL+/MLKL+ double-positive tubular epithelial cells in renal tubules of patients with stages 2 and 3a CKD were significantly increased compared to those in control patients without renal disease. Immunohistochemistry analyses of renal biopsy specimens from patients with CKD revealed RIP3, MLKL, and p-MLKL upregulation in patients with stages 2 and 3a CKD, suggesting that necroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells in CKD patients occurs, and the peak of necroptosis was in stages 2 and 3a CKD. We showed that profibrotic factor proteins (TGF-β1, Smad2 and Smad3) and fibroblast activation markers (α-SMA and Vimentin) were specifically upregulated in stage 2 and 3a CKD patients. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that the percentage of necroptotic renal tubular epithelial cells was positively correlated with TGF-β1 and collagen-I. We also showed that RIP1/3 or MLKL inhibitors decreased the expression of RIP3, MLKL, TGF-β1, and Smad3 in HK-2 cells treated with TNF-α. FGF-2, α-SMA, Vimentin and FN were overexpressed in the hRIFs cultured with the supernatant of necroptotic HK-2 cells, whereas necroptosis blockers (Nec-1s, GSK'872 and NSA) and TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway antagonists (LY364947 and SIS3) reduced FGF-2, α-SMA, Vimentin and FN levels. Collectively, necroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells in CKD patients occurs, and the peak of necroptosis was in stages 2 and 3a CKD. Renal tubular epithelial cell necroptosis mediates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in patients with chronic kidney disease, which is related to the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4308210158,"Painful crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) are associated with increased plasma cytokines levels, including endothelin-1 (ET-1). Reduced red cell magnesium content, mediated in part by increased Na+/Mg2+ exchanger (NME) activity, contributes to erythrocyte K+ loss, dehydration and sickling in SCD. However, the relationship between ET-1 and the NME in SCD has remained unexamined. We observed increased NME activity in sickle red cells incubated in the presence of 500 nM ET-1. Deoxygenation of sickle red cells, in contrast, led to decreased red cell NME activity and cellular dehydration that was reversed by the NME inhibitor, imipramine. Increased NME activity in sickle red cells was significantly blocked by pre-incubation with 100 nM BQ788, a selective blocker of ET-1 type B receptors. These results suggest an important role for ET-1 and for cellular magnesium homeostasis in SCD. Consistent with these results, we observed increased NME activity in sickle red cells of three mouse models of sickle cell disease greater than that in red cells of C57BL/J6 mice. In vivo treatment of BERK sickle transgenic mice with ET-1 receptor antagonists reduced red cell NME activity. Our results suggest that ET-1 receptor blockade may be a promising therapeutic approach to control erythrocyte volume and magnesium homeostasis in SCD and may thus attenuate or retard the associated chronic inflammatory and vascular complications of SCD."
https://openalex.org/W4307903176,"Loss of functional fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome, the leading form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that controls neuronal mRNA localization and translation. FMRP is thought to inhibit translation elongation after being recruited to target transcripts via binding RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) within the coding sequence. Here, we directly test this model and report that FMRP inhibits translation independent of mRNA G4s. Furthermore, we found that the RGG box motif together with its natural C-terminal domain forms a noncanonical RNA-binding domain (ncRBD) that is essential for translational repression. The ncRBD elicits broad RNA-binding ability and binds to multiple reporter mRNAs and all four homopolymeric RNAs. Serial deletion analysis of the ncRBD identified that the regions required for mRNA binding and translational repression overlap but are not identical. Consistent with FMRP stalling elongating ribosomes and causing the accumulation of slowed 80S ribosomes, transcripts bound by FMRP via the ncRBD cosediment with heavier polysomes and were present in puromycin-resistant ribosome complexes. Together, this work identifies a ncRBD and translational repression domain that shifts our understanding of how FMRP inhibits translation independent of mRNA G4s."

https://openalex.org/W4308168687,"Background Toxoplasma gondii is one of the world’s most common parasites. Primary infection of the mother during pregnancy can lead to transmission to the fetus with risks of brain and eye lesions, which may cause lifelong disabilities. France instituted a national program based on monthly retesting of susceptible pregnant women to reduce the number of severe cases through prompt antenatal and postnatal treatment and follow-up. Objective To evaluate the ability of the French prenatal retesting program to reduce the lifetime costs of congenital toxoplasmosis. Methods We measured and then compared the costs and benefits of screening vs. not screening using decision-tree modelling. It included direct and indirect costs to society of treatment and care, and the lifetime lost earnings of children and caregivers. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out. Findings Total lifetime costs per live born child identified as congenitally infected were estimated to be €444 for those identified through prenatal screening vs €656 for those who were not screened. Estimates were robust to changes in all costs of diagnosis, treatment, and sequelae. Interpretation Screening for the prevention of the congenital T . gondii infection in France is cost saving at €212 per birth. Compared with no screening, screening every pregnant woman in France for toxoplasmosis in 2020 would have saved the country €148 million in addition to reducing or eliminating the devastating physical and emotional suffering caused by T . gondii . Our findings reinforce the conclusions of other decision-analytic modelling of prenatal toxoplasmosis screening."
https://openalex.org/W4308193252,"Coastal benthic communities in temperate regions have been influenced by climate change, including increasing sea-surface temperature. Nevertheless, scleractinian coral Alveopora japonica Eguchi, 1968, is thriving in shallow subtidal hard bottoms around Jeju Island, off the southern coast of Korea. The presence of this corals has negatively impacted subtidal kelp populations in Jeju Island. However, there is no study to document how the presence or absence of this coral relates to other benthic communities. This study investigated the benthos in three shallow subtidal sites (Shinheung (SH), Bukchon (BC), and Seongsan (SS)) in northern Jeju using underwater photography. Macro-benthic organisms appearing on a 1 × 20 m line transect installed at depths of 5, 10, and 15 m at each site were analyzed. Results showed that of the three sites investigated, A . japonica colonies were most abundant at BC, accounting for 45.9% and 72.8% of the total transect area at 10 m and 15 m, respectively. At SS, A . japonica occupied 15.3% of the total area at 15 m and less than 1% at 5 m and 10 m. The same at SH accounted for 10% of the total area at 5 m, and less than 1% at 10 m and 15 m. Dead and bleached colonies accounted for 1.2–11.5% and 1.8–5.7%, respectively, at 5, 10, and 15 m at three sites. At SS, canopy-forming brown algae Ecklonia cava and Sargassum spp. accounted for 20.2 and 24.3% of the total transect area, respectively, at 5 m depth. In contrast, the percent cover of E . cava and Sargassum spp. at SH and BC ranged from 0.1 to 1.8%, respectively. Moreover, non-geniculate coralline algae dominated the subtidal substrate at SH, ranging between 60.2 and 69% at 15 and 10 m. The low cover of A . japonica in SS (at 5 m) coincided with a high percent cover of canopy-forming brown algae. However, canopy-forming brown algae were rare at all depths at SH and BC and were dominated instead by coralline algae and the scleractinian corals. This study, by utilizing a non-destructive method, provides a baseline qualitative and quantitative information for understanding the site and depth-dependent distribution of A . japonica and algal populations, which is important to understand climate change related changes in benthic communities in Jeju and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W4308193408,"Caring for an aging society is a problem facing many countries including Thailand. This cross-sectional study investigated caregiver burden and related predictive factors among 69 caregivers who had older family members with physical disabilities. Burden Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref Thai (QOL), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ), Barthel Activity of Daily Living Index (ADL), and Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL) assessments were used in addition to demographic data. Thirteen caregivers (18.8%) reported no caregiver burden, 30 (43.5%) reported low-moderate burden, 21 (30.4%) reported moderate-high burden and 5 (7.2%) reported high burden. Using Fisher’s Exact Test the factors found to be significantly associated to caregiver burden were: categorical age of the caregiver (p = .000), education level of the caregiver (p = .002), relationship to the care recipient (p = .009), categorical income level of the caregiver (p = .041), QOL of the caregiver (p = .001) and ADL status of the care recipient (p = .003). Forward stepwise linear regression model revealed three factors which were PHQ score (β = .543, p &lt; .000), ADL score (β = -.341, p = .001) and hours of care/week (β = .227, p = .017).

https://openalex.org/W4308193558,"Open-label (honestly prescribed) placebos are an ethical way to evoke placebo effects in patients. As part of a mixed-methods study, we conducted in-depth interviews with eight menopausal women who underwent and benefitted from open-label placebo treatment in a randomized-controlled trial of hot flushes. Data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. We found that the women had low expectations about the placebo treatment yet endorsed what they referred to as “hope” and openness to “see what happens”. Recording hot flushes via the symptom diary was viewed as a valuable opportunity for self-examination and appraising outcomes. Receiving relief from the placebo treatment empowered women and enhanced their sense of control and agency. In summary, participants’ initial openness towards placebos, their hopes to get better, monitoring symptoms closely, and taking the initiative to address symptoms were components of a positive open-label placebo experience."

https://openalex.org/W4308168670,"The role of individual and sociocultural factors contributing to drowning risk for young adults is complex and poorly understood. This study examined the relationship between behaviour in and around waterways and: 1) alcohol consumption; 2) resistance to peer influence; 3) sensation-seeking; 4) perception of risk among people aged 15-24 in Western Australia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted at three time-points with a convenience sample. Predictor variables included: Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT_C); Resistance to Peer Influence; Brief Sensation Seeking scale; Benthin's Perception of risk. Pearson chi-squared tests determined the association between demographic and predictor variables. Logistic regression explored influence of potential predictor variables on behaviour in and around water. The final sample (n = 730) participants, consisted of females (n = 537, 74.5%), metropolitan dwelling (n = 616, 84.4%), and attended university (n = 410, 56.9%). Significant associations were found for those who swum after drinking alcohol compared with those that had not by age, gender, education. For every 1-unit increase in AUDIT-C participants were 60% more likely to swim after drinking (OR 95% CI 1.60 1.44-1.78). Participants who considered an adverse event serious were 15% less likely to have swum after drinking alcohol (OR 0.85 95% CI 0.73-0.99). The complex relationship between social participation in activities in and around waterways, higher drowning rates, propensity for risk, and the meaning young adults attach to risk locations and practices present unique challenges for drowning prevention research. Findings should be used to improve the awareness and education components of future youth water safety strategies in high-income settings."
https://openalex.org/W4308192781,"Immobilization osteopenia is a major healthcare problem in clinical and social medicine. However, the mechanisms underlying this bone pathology caused by immobilization under load-bearing conditions are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate sequential changes to the three-dimensional microstructure of bone in load-bearing immobilization osteopenia using a fixed-limb rat model.Eight-week-old specific-pathogen-free male Wistar rats were divided into an immobilized group and a control group (n = 60 each). Hind limbs in the immobilized group were fixed using orthopedic casts with fixation periods of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Feeding and weight-bearing were freely permitted. Length of the right femur was measured after each fixation period and bone microstructure was analyzed by micro-computed tomography. The architectural parameters of cortical and cancellous bone were analyzed statistically.Femoral length was significantly shorter in the immobilized group than in the control group after 2 weeks. Total area and marrow area were significantly lower in the immobilized group than in the control group from 1 to 12 weeks. Cortical bone area, cortical thickness, and polar moment of inertia decreased significantly after 2 weeks. Some cancellous bone parameters showed osteoporotic changes at 2 weeks after immobilization and the gap with the control group widened as the fixation period extended (P &lt; 0.05).The present results indicate that load-bearing immobilization triggers early deterioration of microstructure in both cortical and cancellous bone after 2 weeks."

No previous studies have been conducted to assess job satisfaction for community pharmacists in Vietnam. Objective This research was conducted to develop and validate an instrument used to measure community pharmacists’ job satisfaction in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Methods and results A total of 351 pharmacists participated in this survey. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.2.0. The final instrument (VIJS) has 34 items divided into six factors which were determined via a parallel analysis (including physical working conditions, work nature, income and other benefits, management policies and managers, relationships with coworkers and customers, and learning and advancement opportunities). VIJS’s internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.97, Omega total = 0.98, split-half reliability = 0.985, and composite reliability&gt;0.8). Two-week test-retest reliability results (intraclass correlation coefficient for the overall instrument: 0.97, for six factors: 0.865–0.938) demonstrated the consistency of the VIJS when the same test was repeated on the same sample (62 pharmacists) at different points in time. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis was employed to assess the construct validity. The VIJS was a good fit to a six-factor model (Chisq/df = 2.352, Comparative Fit Index = 0.937, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.929, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.042, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.062). VIJS’s good convergent and discriminant validity was demonstrated via Average Variance Extrated&gt;0.5 and the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio of correlations&lt;0.85.

https://openalex.org/W4308193764,"Introduction The correlates of quality of life originating from the demographic characteristics, comorbidities and sources of social support among persons living with tuberculosis remain underreported. The aim of this study was to examine the correlates of quality of life among persons living with tuberculosis within Greater Accra, Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was used to assess the correlates of quality of life among 250 randomly sampled persons living with tuberculosis. Quality of life was assessed with the Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire and correlates were derived using Spearman rho correlations. Chi-square analyses assessed associations among respondent characteristics. Results All four quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social relationship and environmental) of persons living with tuberculosis were positively correlated. Furthermore, receiving social support from family or friends correlated positively with respondents’ quality of life. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and receiving social support mainly from work colleagues or religious institutions correlated negatively with respondents’ quality of life domains. Other correlates of quality of life included age, pleuritis with pleural effusion, number of dependants and distance to tuberculosis treatment centres. Social support from family and friends corresponded with better quality of life among persons living with tuberculosis. Conclusion The quality of life domains of persons living with tuberculosis are interrelated and can be enhanced by social support. Healthcare providers should involve the significant others of persons living with tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and pleuritis with pleural effusion in their care to promote patients’ quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4308193986,"Mobile robot path planning has attracted much attention as a key technology in robotics research. In this paper, a reformative bat algorithm (RBA) for mobile robot path planning is proposed, which is employed as the control mechanism of robots. The Doppler effect is applied to frequency update to ameliorate RBA. When the robot is in motion, the Doppler effect can be adaptively compensated to prevent the robot from prematurely converging. In the velocity update and position update, chaotic map and dynamic disturbance coefficient are introduced respectively to enrich the population diversity and weaken the limitation of local optimum. Furthermore, Q-learning is incorporated into RBA to reasonably choose the loudness attenuation coefficient and the pulse emission enhancement coefficient to reconcile the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, while improving the local search capability of RBA. The simulation experiments are carried out in two different environments, where the success rate of RBA is 93.33% and 90%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of the results of success rate, path length and number of iterations, RBA has better robustness and can plan the optimal path in a relatively short time compared with other algorithms in this field, thus illustrating its validity and reliability. Eventually, by the aid of the Robot Operating System (ROS), the experimental results of real-world robot navigation indicate that RBA has satisfactory real-time performance and path planning effect, which can be considered as a crucial choice for dealing with path planning problems."
https://openalex.org/W4308209700,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that mediates visual function in the retina and diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness; however, the role of dopamine in retinal vascular dysfunction in DR remains unclear. Here, we report a mechanism of hyperglycemic memory (HGM)-induced retinal microvascular dysfunction and the protective effect of dopamine against the HGM-induced retinal microvascular leakage and abnormalities. We found that HGM induced persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and fission, and adherens junction disassembly and subsequent vascular leakage after blood glucose normalization in the mouse retinas. These persistent hyperglycemic stresses were inhibited by dopamine treatment in human retinal endothelial cells and by intravitreal injection of levodopa in the retinas of HGM mice. Moreover, levodopa supplementation ameliorated HGM-induced pericyte degeneration, acellular capillary and pericyte ghost generation, and endothelial apoptosis in the mouse retinas. Our findings suggest that dopamine alleviates HGM-induced retinal microvascular leakage and abnormalities by inhibiting persistent oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4307903228,"Self-association of WT β2-microglobulin (WT-β2m) into amyloid fibrils is associated with the disorder dialysis related amyloidosis. In the familial variant D76N-β2m, the single amino acid substitution enhances the aggregation propensity of the protein dramatically and gives rise to a disorder that is independent of renal dysfunction. Numerous biophysical and structural studies on WT- and D76N-β2m have been performed in order to better understand the structure and dynamics of the native proteins and their different potentials to aggregate into amyloid. However, the structural properties of transient D76N-β2m oligomers and their role(s) in assembly remained uncharted. Here, we have utilized NMR methods, combined with photo-induced crosslinking, to detect, trap, and structurally characterize transient dimers of D76N-β2m. We show that the crosslinked D76N-β2m dimers have different structures from those previously characterized for the on-pathway dimers of ΔN6-β2m and are unable to assemble into amyloid. Instead, the crosslinked D76N-β2m dimers are potent inhibitors of amyloid formation, preventing primary nucleation and elongation/secondary nucleation when added in substoichiometric amounts with D76N-β2m monomers. The results highlight the specificity of early protein-protein interactions in amyloid formation and show how mapping these interfaces can inform new strategies to inhibit amyloid assembly."

https://openalex.org/W4308192743,"Aims Worldwide, loneliness is one of the most common psychological phenomena among older adults, adversely affecting their physical and mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to assess changes in the prevalence of loneliness in the two timeframes (first and second waves of COVID-19 in Bangladesh) and identify its correlates in pooled data. Methods This repeated cross-sectional study was conducted on two successive occasions (October 2020 and September 2021), overlapping with the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The survey was conducted remotely through telephone interviews among 2077 (1032 in the 2020-survey and 1045 in the 2021-survey) older Bangladeshi adults aged 60 years and above. Loneliness was measured using the 3-item UCLA Loneliness scale. The binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with loneliness in pooled data. Results We found a decline in the loneliness prevalence among the participants in two survey rounds (51.5% in 2021 versus 45.7% in 2020; P = 0.008), corresponding to 33% lower odds in the 2021-survey (AOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54–0.84). Still, nearly half of the participants were found to be lonely in the latest survey. We also found that, compared to their respective counterparts, the odds of loneliness were significantly higher among the participants without a partner (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20–2.08), with a monthly family income less than 5000 BDT (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.58–3.47), who lived alone (AOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.34–3.51), with poor memory or concentration (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.23–2.03), and suffering from non-communicable chronic conditions (AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23–1.95). Various COVID-19-related characteristics, such as concern about COVID-19 (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 0.94–1.73), overwhelm by COVID-19 (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.14–2.06), difficulty earning (AOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.54–2.59), and receiving routine medical care during COVID-19 (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.61–2.68), and perception that the participants required additional care during the pandemic (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 2.27–3.79) were also associated with significantly higher odds of loneliness. However, the odds of loneliness were significantly lower among the participants with formal schooling (AOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57–0.89) and with a family of more than four members (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60–0.96). Conclusions The current study found a decreased prevalence of loneliness among Bangladeshi older adults during the ongoing pandemic. However, the prevalence is still very high. The findings suggest the need for mental health interventions that may include improving social interactions increasing opportunities for meaningful social connections with family and community members and providing psychosocial support to the vulnerable population including older adults during the pandemic. It also suggests that policymakers and public health practitioners should emphasise providing mental health services at the peripheral level where the majority of older adults reside."

A nonsynonymous variant (S427L) in the retinoic acid receptor-γ (RARG) gene has been associated with ACT. This variant causes reduced RARG activity, which is hypothesized to lead to increased susceptibility to ACT through reduced activation of the retinoic acid pathway. This study explored the effects of activating the retinoic acid pathway using a RAR-agonist, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in human cardiomyocytes and mice treated with doxorubicin. In human cardiomyocytes, ATRA induced the gene expression of RARs (RARG, RARB) and repressed the expression of topoisomerase II enzyme genes (TOP2A, TOP2B), which encode for the molecular targets of anthracyclines and repressed downstream ACT response genes. Importantly, ATRA enhanced cell survival of human cardiomyocytes exposed to doxorubicin. The protective effect of ATRA was also observed in a mouse model (B6C3F1/J) of ACT, in which ATRA treatment improved heart function compared to doxorubicin-only treated mice. Histological analyses of the heart also indicated that ATRA treatment reduced the pathology associated with ACT. These findings provide additional evidence for the retinoic acid pathway's role in ACT and suggest that the RAR activator ATRA can modulate this pathway to reduce ACT."
https://openalex.org/W4308192967,"Globally, frontline health care providers are among the most affected population group by the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowing the factors contributing to the transmission of COVID-19 infection among frontline health care providers is essential for implementing tailored control measures and protecting this vital population group. This study aimed to estimate the proportion and to identify factors associated with COVID-19 infection among medical doctors in Sudan. A web-based survey was used to collect data from medical doctors who were working in Sudan during the study period. Data were analyzed using SPSS® version 25; Descriptive analysis in terms of means (SD) for continuous variables, frequencies, and percentages with 95% CI for the categorical variable was conducted. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression for associations between the outcome variables (risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection and ever tested positive for COVID-19 infection) and independent variables (socio-demographic and infection control standards) were also performed. Out of 352 valid responses, 13.6% had tested positive for COVID-19 infection at least once during the pandemic. More than one-third have identified colleagues as the main sources of infection compared to 21% of patients (p-value &lt; 0.04). Doctors who received training on COVID-19 were 60% less likely to have positive tests for COVID-19 (p-value &lt;0.03), while lack of PPE and hand hygiene utilities had no statistically significant associations with testing positive for COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, a significant proportion of doctors have contracted COVID-19 infection from their colleagues. This calls for restricting infection control practices at hospitals, doctor's doormats, and any other shared places that allow day-to-day interaction between doctors and their colleagues. Also, urgent need for training doctors on COVID-19 infection control practices as it has been identified as the key protective factor."
https://openalex.org/W4308192982,"Objectives To examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the demographic and clinical characteristics, in-hospital care, and outcomes of long-term care residents admitted to general medicine wards for non-COVID-19 reasons. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of long-term care residents admitted to general medicine wards, for reasons other than COVID-19, in four hospitals in Toronto, Ontario between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. We used an autoregressive linear model to estimate the change in monthly admission volumes during the pandemic period (March-December 2020) compared to the previous two years, adjusting for any secular trend. We summarized and compared differences in the demographics, comorbidities, interventions, diagnoses, imaging, psychoactive medications, and outcomes of residents before and during the pandemic. Results Our study included 2,654 long-term care residents who were hospitalized for non-COVID-19 reasons between January 2018 and December 2020. The crude rate of hospitalizations was 79.3 per month between March-December of 2018–2019 and 56.5 per month between March-December of 2020. The was an adjusted absolute difference of 27.0 (95% CI: 10.0, 43.9) fewer hospital admissions during the pandemic period, corresponding to a relative drop of 34%. Residents admitted during the pandemic period had similar demographics and clinical characteristics but were more likely to be admitted for delirium (pandemic: 7% pre-pandemic: 5%, p = 0.01) and were less likely to be admitted for pneumonia (pandemic: 3% pre-pandemic: 6%, p = 0.004). Residents admitted during the pandemic were more likely to be prescribed antipsychotics (pandemic: 37%, pre-pandemic: 29%, p &lt;0.001) and more likely to die in-hospital (pandemic:14% pre-pandemic: 10%, p = 0.04) Conclusions and implications Better integration between long-term care and hospitals systems, including programs to deliver urgent medical care services within long-term care homes, is needed to ensure that long-term care residents maintain equitable access to acute care during current and future public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4308193033,"Background In Italy, abortion services are public: therefore, health Institutions should provide clear and easily readable web-based information. We aimed to 1) assess variation in abortion services utilisation; 2) analyse the readability of institutional websites informing on induced abortion; 3) explore whether easier-to-read institutional websites influenced the correct fruition of abortion services. Methods We identified from the 2021 administrative databases of Tuscany all women having an abortion, and–among them–women having an abortion with the certification provided by family counselling centres, following the pathway established by law. We assessed variation in total and certified abortion rates by computing the Systematic Component of Variation. We analysed the readability of the Tuscan health authorities’ websites using the readability assessment tool READ-IT. We explored how institutional website readability influenced the odds of having certified abortions by running multilevel logistic models, considering health authorities as the highest-level variables. Results We observed high variation in the correct utilization of the abortion pathway in terms of certified abortion rates. The READ-IT scores showed that the most readable text was from the Florence Teaching Hospital website. Multilevel models revealed that higher READ-IT scores, corresponding to more difficult texts, resulted in lower odds of certified abortions. Conclusions Large variation in the proper fruition of abortion pathways occurs in Tuscany, and such variation may depend on readability of institutional websites informing on induced abortion. Therefore, health Institutions should monitor and improve the readability of their websites to ensure proper and more equitable access to abortion."

The special formation process of agarwood is closely related to external injury and fungal infection. In this study, we demonstrate that infection of Aquilaria sinensis by Fusarium oxysporum , a soilborne fungus that causes vascular wilt diseases in diverse plants, induces agarwood formation. Based on these findings, an efficient method, termed F . oxysporum infection-induced formation of agarwood (FOIFA), was developed for the rapid production of quality agarwood. The agarwood formed in response to F . oxysporum infection was similar in structure and chemical composition to wild agarwood according to TLC (Thin-layer chromatography), HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography), and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) analyses, except that the contents of alcohol-soluble extract, chromones, and essential oils (mainly sesquiterpenes) were higher in the formed agarwood."

https://openalex.org/W4308193807,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 has created an enormous workload for laboratories worldwide resulting in a restriction at the time of massive testing. Pool testing is a strategy that reduces time and costs. However, beyond the detection of infectious diseases in blood banks, this approach is rarely implemented in routine laboratories. Therefore, what was learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pool testing should represent an opportunity to increase diagnostic capabilities. The present work, carried out in the context of a diagnostic laboratory of a public hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, represents a contribution to this end. The main limitation of pool testing is the risk of false negatives that could have been identified by individual tests. These limitations are the dilution of samples with a low virus load during pooling and that the integrity of the sample may be affected by the quality of the sample collection. Fortunately, both limitations coincide with the main strengths of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). ddPCR is a third-generation PCR that splits the amplification into thousands of droplets that work in parallel, increasing sensitivity and resistance to inhibitors. Therefore, ddPCR is particularly useful for pool testing. Here we show how to factor between test sensitivity and savings in test time and resources. We have identified and optimized critical parameters for pool testing. The present study, which analyzed 1000 nasopharyngeal samples, showed that the pool testing could detect even a single positive sample with a CT value of up to 30 in pools of 34 samples. This test was performed using three different standard extraction methods, the simplest being heating only, which resulted in substantial savings of extraction reagents in addition to PCR reagents. Moreover, we show that pooling can be extended to use saliva, which is less invasive and allows self-collection, reducing the risk for health personnel."
https://openalex.org/W4308194122,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our society and human well-being in various ways. In this study, we investigate how the pandemic has influenced people’s emotions and psychological states compared to a pre-pandemic period using real-world data from social media. Method We collected Reddit social media data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight universities. We applied the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) to learn text embedding from the Reddit messages, and leveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph attention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. Finally, we applied model stacking to combine the prediction probabilities from RoBERTa and GAT to yield the final classification on sentiment. With the model-predicted sentiment labels on the collected data, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to estimate the effects of pandemic and in-person teaching during the pandemic on sentiment. Results The results suggest that the odds of negative sentiments in 2020 (pandemic) were 25.7% higher than the odds in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with a p -value &lt; 0.001; and the odds of negative sentiments associated in-person learning were 48.3% higher than with remote learning in 2020 with a p -value of 0.029. Conclusions Our study results are consistent with the findings in the literature on the negative impacts of the pandemic on people’s emotions and psychological states. Our study contributes to the growing real-world evidence on the various negative impacts of the pandemic on our society; it also provides a good example of using both ML techniques and statistical modeling and inference to make better use of real-world data."

The second one is its accelerated version with momentum factors. For sub-network of denoiser, we embed the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) in previous U-Net for adaptive feature refinement. Experiments on image denoising and deblurring demonstrate that competitive performances in quality and efficiency are gained by compared with several state-of-the-art networks for image restoration.

https://openalex.org/W4308194460,"The present work discusses the laminar boundary layer flow of an electrically conducting Casson fluid due to a horizontal perforated sheet undergoing linear shrinking/stretching with mass transpiration. Navier’s slip and second-order slip conditions are also imposed on the flow. The system is subjected to a transverse magnetic field. The non-Newtonian flow under consideration obeys the rheological equation of state due to the Casson model. The PDEs governing the bounder layer flow is reduced to a nonlinear boundary value problem in ODEs by utilizing appropriate similarity transformations and are expressed analytically. The similarity solution is found to be a function of the Casson parameter, magnetic parameter, mass suction/injection parameter, and the first/second-order slip parameters. Such a solution is either unique, or dual solutions exist in a region defined by the mass transfer induced slip parameter. The results of the present work are found to be an increase of the magnetic effects resulting in expansion of the unique solution region and contraction of the dual solution region for the flow due to the induced Lorentz force. In the unique solution region, an increase in magnitudes of mass suction induced slip and the first/second-order slip parameters result in a reduction of the wall shear stress in the shrinking sheet, while the wall shear stress with mass suction increases with the Casson and the magnetic effects. Similar results exist for the stretching sheet case with mass suction. However, only unique similarity solutions exist only for the case of stretching sheets with mass injection. The current work is a generalization of the classical works of Crane (1970) and Pavlov (1974) for a stretching sheet. Mass suction/injection induced slip enhances and achieves a dominant flow driven by reversing the flow direction of the moving sheet, which allows an adjacent flow against the sheet. The findings have possible industrial applications in fluid-based systems including stretchable/shrinkable things, automated cooling systems, power generation, microelectronics, and present new results to the problem."
https://openalex.org/W4308194555,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to be able to modulate immune responses, possess tissue-protective properties, and exhibit healing capacities with therapeutic potential for various diseases. The ability of MSCs to secrete various cytokines and growth factors provides new insights into autoimmune-diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects the lining of synovial joints, causing stiffness, pain, inflammation, and joint erosion. In recent years, MSCs-based therapies have been widely proposed as promising therapies in the treatment of RA. However, the mechanism involved in disease-specific therapeutic effects of MSCs on RA remains unclear. To clarify the mechanism involved in effects of MSCs on RA, proteomic profiling was performed using an RA mouse model before and after treatment with MSCs. In this study, treatment efficacy of human umbilical cord blood-mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) was confirmed using a type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Results of measuring incidence rates of arthritis and clinical arthritis index (CAI) revealed that mice administrated with hUCB-MSCs had a significant reduction in arthritis severity. Proteins that might affect disease progression and therapeutic efficacy of hUCB-MSC were identified through LC-MS/MS analysis using serum samples. In addition, L-1000 analysis was performed for hUCB-MSC culture medium. To analysis data obtained from LC-MS/MS and L-1000, tools such as ExDEGA, MEV, and DAVID GO were used. Results showed that various factors secreted from hUCB-MSCs might play roles in therapeutic effects of MSCs on RA, with platelet activation possibly playing a pivotal role. Results of this study also suggest that SERPINE1 and THBS1 among substances secreted by hUCB-MSC might be key factors that can inhibit platelet activation. This paper is expected to improve our understanding of mechanisms involved in treatment effects of stem cells on rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W4308209824,"Testis-specifically expressed genes are important for male reproduction according to their unique expression patterns. However, the functions of most of these genes in reproduction are unclear. Here, we showed that mouse 4930590J08Rik was a testis-specifically expressed gene. 4930590J08Rik knockout mice exhibited a delay in the first wave of spermatogenesis and a reduction of cauda epididymal sperm. Furthermore, knockout spermatozoa exhibited defective acrosome reactions and decreased progressive motility, which led to impaired in vivo fertilization. Transcriptome analysis of testes revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes in knockout testes were associated with metabolic processes. 4930590J08Rik knockout sperm exhibited oxidative phosphorylation deficiency and were highly dependent on increased anaerobic glycolysis to compensate for ATP demands. Taken together, the 4930590J08Rik-disrupted mouse partially mimics the phenotypes of human asthenospermia and oligozoospermia, which provides a new model for further understanding the pathogenesis of idiopathic male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W4307901397,"T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) is a negative regulator of T-cell receptor and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and implicated in cancer and autoimmune disease. TC-PTP activity is modulated by an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region (IDR) and suppressed in cells under basal conditions. In vitro structural studies have shown that the dynamic reorganization of IDR around the catalytic domain, driven by electrostatic interactions, can lead to TC-PTP activity inhibition; however, the process has not been studied in cells. Here, by assessing a mutant (378KRKRPR383 mutated into 378EAAAPE383, called TC45E/A) with impaired tail-PTP domain interaction, we obtained evidence that the downmodulation of TC-PTP enzymatic activity by the IDR occurs in cells. However, we found that the regulation of TC-PTP by the IDR is only recapitulated in vitro when crowding polymers that mimic the intracellular environment are present in kinetic assays using a physiological phosphopeptide. Our FRET-based assays in vitro and in cells confirmed that the effect of the mutant correlates with an impairment of the intramolecular inhibitory remodeling of TC-PTP by the IDR. This work presents an early example of the allosteric regulation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase being controlled by the cellular environment and provides a framework for future studies and targeting of TC-PTP function."

https://openalex.org/W4308168668,"The processes that initiate and sustain sediment transport which contribute to the modification of aeolian deposits in Mars' low-density atmosphere are still not fully understood despite recent atmospheric modelling. However, detailed microscale wind flow modelling, using Computational Fluid Dynamics at a resolution of &lt;2 m, provides insights into the near-surface processes that cannot be modeled using larger-scale atmospheric modeling. Such Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations cannot by themselves account for regional-scale atmospheric circulations or flow modifications induced by regional km-scale topography, although realistic fine-scale mesoscale atmospheric modeling can. Using the output parameters from mesoscale simulations to inform the input conditions for the Computational Fluid Dynamics microscale simulations provides a practical approach to simulate near-surface wind flow and its relationship to very small-scale topographic features on Mars, particularly in areas which lack in situ rover data. This paper sets out a series of integrated techniques to enable a multi-scale modelling approach for surface airflow to derive surface airflow dynamics at a (dune) landform scale using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment derived topographic data. The work therefore provides a more informed and realistic Computational Fluid Dynamics microscale modelling method, which will provide more detailed insight into the surface wind forcing of aeolian transport patterns on martian surfaces such as dunes."
https://openalex.org/W4308193083,"Despite the popular notion that power motivations are associated with aggression and antisocial behavior, this study tested the hypothesis that activating power motivations can promote prosocial behavior. Because previous research has shown that public prosocial behavior is associate with reputation and status, this study examined how making prosocial decisions publicly or privately moderates the relationship between power motivations and prosocial behavior. One hundred and forty participants were randomly assigned to watch 20 min of either The Experiment (power motivation arousal) or a documentary called Beautiful China (control condition). A modified version of the dictator game was used to measure prosocial behavior. Participants were instructed to allocate an amount of money between themselves and a stranger girl in need, in the presence of the experimenter (the experimenter registers donation amount) or in the absence of the experimenter (the donation was put in a closed envelope). The results showed that individuals in the power motivation arousal group increased their help when their reputation was under scrutiny due to the experimenter’s presence. In the private condition (experimenter is absent), power motivation is not related to prosocial behavior. The contrasting behavioral reactions resulting from the presence or absence of the experimenter are discussed in terms of reputation gain and competitive altruism."
https://openalex.org/W4308193142,"Ventricular diastolic mechanical properties are important determinants of cardiac function and are optimized by changes in cardiac structure and physical properties. Oncorhynchus masou masou is an anadromous migratory fish of the Salmonidae family, and several ecological studies on it have been conducted; however, the cardiac functions of the fish are not well known. Therefore, we investigated ventricular diastolic function in landlocked (masu salmon) and sea-run (cherry salmon) types at 29–30 months post fertilization. Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography showed that the atrioventricular inflow waveforms of cherry salmon were biphasic with early diastolic filling and atrial contraction, whereas those of masu salmon were monophasic with atrial contraction. In addition, end-diastolic pressure–volume relationship analysis revealed that the dilatability per unit myocardial mass of the ventricle in cherry salmon was significantly suppressed compared to that in masu salmon, suggesting that the ventricle of the cherry salmon was relatively stiffer (relative ventricular stiffness index; p = 0.0263). Contrastingly, the extensibility of cardiomyocytes, characterized by the expression pattern of Connectin isoforms in their ventricles, was similar in both types. Histological analysis showed that the percentage of the collagen accumulation area in the compact layer of cherry salmon increased compared with that of the masu salmon, which may contribute to ventricle stiffness. Although the heart mass of cherry salmon was about 11-fold greater than that of masu salmon, there was no difference in the morphology of the isolated cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the heart of the cherry salmon grows by cardiomyocyte proliferation, but not cell hypertrophy. The cardiac physiological function of the teleosts varies with differences in their developmental processes and life history. Our multidimensional analysis of the O . masou heart may provide a clue to the process by which the heart acquires a biphasic blood-filling pattern, i.e., a ventricular diastolic suction."

Women with ARDs want their motherhood identities and associated preferences to be taken into account in decisions about their healthcare. The aim of this study was to explore the interplay between illness and motherhood identities of women with ARDs during preconception decision making.Timeline-facilitated qualitative interviews with women diagnosed with an ARD [18-49 years old]. Participants were purposively sampled based on the following three criteria: thinking about getting pregnant, currently pregnant, or had young children. Interviews were thematically analysed.Twenty-two women were interviewed face-to-face [N = 6] or over the telephone [N = 16]. Interview length ranged from 20 minutes to 70 minutes, with a mean length of 48 minutes. Three main themes were identified: prioritisation, discrepancy, and trade-off. Difficulties in balancing multiple identities in healthcare encounters were reported. Women used 'self-guides' as a reference for priority setting in a dynamic process that shifted as their level of disease activity altered and as their motherhood identity became more or less of a focus at a given point in time. Women's illness and motherhood identities did not present in isolation but were intertwined.Findings highlight the need for holistic person-centred care that supports women with the complex and emotive decisions relating to preconception decision-making.

https://openalex.org/W4308193422,"With the explosive growth of data, how to efficiently cluster large-scale unlabeled data has become an important issue that needs to be solved urgently. Especially in the face of large-scale real-world data, which contains a large number of complex distributions of noises and outliers, the research on robust large-scale real-world data clustering algorithms has become one of the hottest topics. In response to this issue, a robust large-scale clustering algorithm based on correntropy (RLSCC) is proposed in this paper, specifically, k-means is firstly applied to generated pseudo-labels which reduce input data scale of subsequent spectral clustering, then anchor graphs instead of full sample graphs are introduced into spectral clustering to obtain final clustering results based on pseudo-labels which further improve the efficiency. Therefore, RLSCC inherits the advantages of the effectiveness of k-means and spectral clustering while greatly reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, correntropy is developed to suppress the influence of noises and outlier the real-world data on the robustness of clustering. Finally, extensive experiments were carried out on real-world datasets and noise datasets and the results show that compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, RLSCC can improve efficiency and robustness greatly while maintaining comparable or even higher clustering effectiveness."

We examine the level and distribution of unrealized fertility in LMICs across three geographical regions. We also examine the role of sex preference and other factors associated with unrealized fertility. Data and methods We used Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for women age 44–48 in 36 countries from the three geographical regions of Western and Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. We conducted descriptive analysis to examine the distribution of unwanted fertility and unrealized fertility, and fit adjusted logistic regressions of unrealized fertility. The main variables are number of living children (including by sex) and the sex composition of children. Other variables included education, marital status, age at first childbirth, wealth quintile, place of residence, exposure to family planning messages, contraceptive use, and country. Results Unrealized fertility was highest in Western and Central Africa, followed by Eastern and Southern Africa. In all regions, there was a decrease in unrealized fertility with an increasing number of children. Findings for sex preference varied with little sex preference in the African regions, and some limited evidence of preference for sons in South and Southeast Asia. In most regions, higher levels of education, higher wealth quintile, and use of contraceptive methods were associated with decreased unrealized fertility. Conclusion Family planning programs and messages should consider regional and socioeconomic differences in unrealized fertility in order to give women and families the right to achieve the family size they desire regardless of their status."
https://openalex.org/W4308194112,"Research has documented robust associations between greater disgust sensitivity and (1) concerns about disease, and (2) political conservatism. However, the COVID-19 disease pandemic raised challenging questions about these associations. In particular, why have conservatives-despite their greater disgust sensitivity-exhibited less concern about the pandemic? Here, we investigate this ""conservatism-disgust paradox"" and address several outstanding theoretical questions regarding the interrelations among disgust sensitivity, ideology, and pandemic response. In four studies (N = 1,764), we identify several methodological and conceptual factors-in particular, an overreliance on self-report measures-that may have inflated the apparent associations among these constructs. Using non-self-report measures, we find evidence that disgust sensitivity may be a less potent predictor of disease avoidance than is typically assumed, and that ideological differences in disgust sensitivity may be amplified by self-report measures. These findings suggest that the true pattern of interrelations among these factors may be less ""paradoxical"" than is typically believed."
https://openalex.org/W4308194264,"The response of a cell population is often delayed relative to drug injection, and individual cells in a population of cells have a specific age distribution. The application of transit compartment models (TCMs) is a common approach for describing this delay. In this paper, we propose a TCM in which damaged cells caused by a drug are given by a single fractional derivative equation. This model describes the delay as a single equation composed of fractional and ordinary derivatives, instead of a system of ODEs expressed in multiple compartments, applicable to the use of the PK concentration in the model. This model tunes the number of compartments in the existing model and expresses the delay in detail by estimating an appropriate fractional order. We perform model robustness, sensitivity analysis, and change of parameters based on the amount of data. Additionally, we resolve the difficulty in parameter estimation and model simulation using a semigroup property, consisting of a system with a mixture of fractional and ordinary derivatives. This model provides an alternative way to express the delays by estimating an appropriate fractional order without determining the pre-specified number of compartments."
https://openalex.org/W4308194468,"We propose rTopicVec, a supervised topic embedding model that predicts response variables associated with documents by analyzing the text data. Topic modeling leverages document-level word co-occurrence patterns to learn latent topics of each document. While word embedding is a promising text analysis technique in which words are mapped into a low-dimensional continuous semantic space by exploiting the local word co-occurrence patterns within a small context window. Recently developed topic embedding benefits from combining those two approaches by modeling latent topics in a word embedding space. Our proposed rTopicVec and its regularized variant incorporate regression into the topic embedding model to model each document and a numerical label paired with the document jointly. In addition, our models yield topics predictive of the response variables as well as predict response variables for unlabeled documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of our models through experiments on two regression tasks: predicting stock return rates using news articles provided by Thomson Reuters and predicting movie ratings using movie reviews. Results showed that the prediction performance of our models was more accurate in comparison to three baselines with a statistically significant difference."
https://openalex.org/W4308194481,"Despite emergency ambulance services playing a pivotal role in accessibility to life-saving treatments in Malaysia, there are still numerous gaps in knowledge in terms of their utilization and cost. This leads to current policies on procurement, maintenance, and allocation being predicated on historical evidence and expert opinions. This study thus aims to analyse the cost and utilization of ambulance services in selected public health facilities in Malaysia.A cross-sectional study was employed involving 239 ambulances from selected hospitals and clinics. Ambulance service utilization was based on the number of trips, distance and duration of travel obtained from travel logbooks. A mixed top-down and activity-based costing approach was used to estimate the monthly cost of ambulance services. This constituted personnel, maintenance, fuel, overhead, consumables, ambulance, and medical equipment costs. The utilization and costs of ambulance services were further compared between settings and geographical locations.The average total cost of ambulance services was MYR 11,410.44 (US$ 2,756.14) for hospitals and MYR 9,574.39 (US$ 2,312.65) for clinics, albeit not significantly different. Personnel cost was found to be the main contributor to the total cost, at around 44% and 42% in hospitals and clinics, respectively. There was however a significant difference in the total cost in terms of the type and age of ambulances, in addition to their location. In terms of service utilization, the median number of trips and duration of ambulance usage was significantly higher in clinics (31.88 trips and 58.58 hours) compared to hospitals (16.25 trips and 39.25 hours).The total cost of ambulance services was higher in hospitals compared to clinics, while its utilization showed a converse trend. The current findings evidence that despite the ambulance services being all under the MOH, their operating process and utilization reflected an inherent difference by setting."
