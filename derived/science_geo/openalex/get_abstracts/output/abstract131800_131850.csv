https://openalex.org/W1991248271,"Growth and repair of skeletal muscle are normally mediated by the satellite cells that surround muscle fibers. In regenerating muscle, however, the number of myogenic precursors exceeds that of resident satellite cells, implying migration or recruitment of undifferentiated progenitors from other sources. Transplantation of genetically marked bone marrow into immunodeficient mice revealed that marrow-derived cells migrate into areas of induced muscle degeneration, undergo myogenic differentiation, and participate in the regeneration of the damaged fibers. Genetically modified, marrow-derived myogenic progenitors could potentially be used to target therapeutic genes to muscle tissue, providing an alternative strategy for treatment of muscular dystrophies."

However, many of its biological effects are due to binding to unidentified receptors on the cell surface. SPP activated the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)–coupled orphan receptor EDG-1, originally cloned as Endothelial Differentiation Gene – 1 . EDG-1 bound SPP with high affinity (dissociation constant = 8.1 nM) and high specificity. Overexpression of EDG-1 induced exaggerated cell-cell aggregation, enhanced expression of cadherins, and formation of well-developed adherens junctions in a manner dependent on SPP and the small guanine nucleotide binding protein Rho."

The crystal structures at 2.1 and 2.5 angstrom resolution of reconstituted human topoisomerase I comprising the core and carboxyl-terminal domains in covalent and noncovalent complexes with 22–base pair DNA duplexes reveal an enzyme that “clamps” around essentially B-form DNA. The core domain and the first eight residues of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme, including the active-site nucleophile tyrosine-723, share significant structural similarity with the bacteriophage family of DNA integrases. A binding mode for the anticancer drug camptothecin is proposed on the basis of chemical and biochemical information combined with these three-dimensional structures of topoisomerase I–DNA complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2067332276,"The three-dimensional structure of a 70-kilodalton amino terminally truncated form of human topoisomerase I in complex with a 22–base pair duplex oligonucleotide, determined to a resolution of 2.8 angstroms, reveals all of the structural elements of the enzyme that contact DNA. The linker region that connects the central core of the enzyme to the carboxyl-terminal domain assumes a coiled-coil configuration and protrudes away from the remainder of the enzyme. The positively charged DNA-proximal surface of the linker makes only a few contacts with the DNA downstream of the cleavage site. In combination with the crystal structures of the reconstituted human topoisomerase I before and after DNA cleavage, this information suggests which amino acid residues are involved in catalyzing phosphodiester bond breakage and religation. The structures also lead to the proposal that the topoisomerization step occurs by a mechanism termed “controlled rotation.”"

Ablation of murine PML protein by homologous recombination revealed that PML regulates hemopoietic differentiation and controls cell growth and tumorigenesis. PML function was essential for the tumor-growth–suppressive activity of retinoic acid (RA) and for its ability to induce terminal myeloid differentiation of precursor cells. PML was needed for the RA-dependent transactivation of the p21 WAF1/CIP1 gene, which regulates cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation. These results indicate that PML is a critical component of the RA pathway and that disruption of its activity by the PML-RARα fusion protein may be important in APL pathogenesis."

The CD1d1 crystal structure revealed a large hydrophobic binding site occupied by a ligand of unknown chemical nature. Mass spectrometry and metabolic radiolabeling were used to identify cellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol as a major natural ligand of CD1d1. CD1d1 bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol through its phosphatidylinositol aspect with high affinity. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol or another glycolipid could be a candidate natural ligand for CD1d1-restricted T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048404789,"Activation of stress-activated protein kinases, including the p38 and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), have been associated with the onset of cardiac hypertrophy and cell death in response to hemodynamic overload and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Upon infection of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes with recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing a wild type and a constitutively active mutant of MKK7 (or JNKK2), JNK was specifically activated without affecting other mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases and p38. Specific activation of the JNK pathway in cardiac myocytes induced characteristic features of hypertrophy, including an increase in cell size, elevated expression of atrial natriuretic factor, and induction of sarcomere organization. In contrast, co-activation of both JNK (by MKK7) and p38 (by MKK3 or MKK6) in cardiomyocytes led to an induction of cytopathic responses and suppression of hypertrophic responses. These data provide the first direct evidence that activation of JNK alone is sufficient to induce characteristic features of cardiac hypertrophy, thereby supporting an active role for the JNK pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The cytopathic response, as a result of co-activation of both JNK and p38, may contribute to the loss of contractile function and viability of cardiomyocytes following hemodynamic overload and cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.

These studies support the hypothesis that p38 may mediate the hypertrophic process in vivo and contribute to the myocyte apoptosis that is observed in post-ischemic hearts as well as end stage failing hearts (14MacLellan W.R.

In a separate study, activated MEKK-1, an upstream activator of JNK, has been shown to be able to activate some of the characteristic features of hypertrophy in neonatal cardiomyocytes (13Zechner D.

However, because PE treatment and the activated MEKK-1 also activate other MAP kinases, including ERK and p38, the specific function of JNK in cardiac hypertrophy is still not yet clear. Recently, several groups have reported the cloning of a new MAP kinase kinase, MKK7 (also named JNKK-2), which is able to specifically activate the JNK pathway without affecting ERK and p38 activities (16Tournier C.

Our results show that specific activation of the JNK pathway in cardiac myocytes is sufficient to induce characteristic features of hypertrophy. Furthermore, co-activation of JNK and p38 pathways in cardiac myocytes leads to cytopathic responses in cardiac myocytes and induction of cell death. These results support the hypothesis that both JNK and p38 play pivotal roles in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and that combined effects of JNK and p38 may contribute to the pathophysiological process of heart failure.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have analyzed the direct effects of JNK activation in cardiac myocytes by overexpressing a specific upstream activator, MKK7 using recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. We have shown that wild type and activated MKK7 specifically activate JNK activity without affecting ERK and p38 activities. Specific activation of JNK in cardiac myocytes induced a hypertrophic response characterized by an increase in cell size, the induction of ANF expression, and enhanced organization of sarcomere structure. This result suggests that specific activation of JNK is sufficient to initiate a hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes. However, we cannot rule out the involvement of p38 in such a response because there are still significant p38 basal level activities in the cultured cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1). Co-activation of JNK and p38 in cardiac myocytes, however, failed to synergize in their hypertrophic effects. Instead, this led to induction of cytopathic responses and cell death.JNK activity is quickly activated by pressure-overload in transverse aortic constriction treated animals followed by activation of p38 at a later time point.3 Combined with the results from this study, a model can be hypothesized where the activation of JNK may contribute directly to the development of hypertrophy at the earlier time points of pressure overload. In the setting of long term hemodynamic stress, both JNK and p38 activities are activated that lead to dysfunction and death of the myocytes. This hypothesis needs to be tested in vivo by creating transgenic animals with altered stress-activated protein kinases activities in heart and studying their effects on cardiac functions using miniaturized physiological technology (9Christensen G.

One of these proteins, subunit 5a (S5a), has been shown to bind ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates and free polyubiquitin chains. Using deletional analysis, we have identified in the carboxyl-terminal half of human S5a, two independent polyubiquitin binding sites whose sequences are highly conserved among higher eukaryotic S5a homologs. The sites are approximately 30-amino acids long and are separated by 50 intervening residues. When expressed as small fragments or when present in full-length S5a molecules, the sites differ at least 10-fold in their apparent affinity for polyubiquitin chains. Each binding site contains 5 hydrophobic residues that form an alternating pattern of large and small side chains, e.g. Leu-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu, and this pattern is essential for binding ubiquitin chains. Based on the importance of the alternating hydrophobic residues in the binding sites and previous studies showing that a hydrophobic patch on the surface of ubiquitin is essential for proteolytic targeting, we propose a model for molecular recognition of polyubiquitin chains by S5a.

Ubiquitin is a small, highly conserved eukaryotic protein that can be covalently attached to a variety of cellular proteins including itself (1Hershko A. J. Biol.

Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin may serve several functions. Addition of monomers of ubiquitin to histones or insect actin appears to affect the higher order structure of chromatin or flight muscle, respectively (4Ball E. Karlik C.C. Beall C.J. Saville D.L.

Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin has been proposed to serve a novel nonproteolytic role in the regulated activation of Iκβα kinase (7Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). However, the best characterized function of ubiquitin is to promote the degradation of proteins to which it is attached especially when substrates are bound to a polyubiquitin chain rather than individual ubiquitin moieties (8Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains are formed by isopeptide linkages involving the C-terminal glycine (Gly76) of one ubiquitin and a lysine ε amino group on another. A β-galactosidase fusion protein covalently attached to a polyubiquitin chain consisting of 8–12 ubiquitins linked by Gly76–Lys48 isopeptide bonds is degraded approximately 10 times more rapidly than the monoubiquitylated substrate (8Chau V.

The 26 S protease, which was discovered by its ability to degrade ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates (9Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2400-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is now known to be formed from two particles, the 19 S regulatory complex (10Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

The regulatory complex confers substrate recognition and energy dependence upon the 26 S enzyme, and the proteasome provides proteolytic activities. Although the 26 S protease has been shown to degrade native unmodified ornithine decarboxylase (16Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), this enzyme of polyamine metabolism is the only non-ubiquitin dependent substrate so far identified. By contrast the 26 S protease has been implicated in the degradation of scores of substrates modified by ubiquitin (17Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 18Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). It seems, therefore, that polyubiquitin chains function as a general degradation signal, and, as such, they play key roles in a variety of regulatory events. For example, polyubiquitin recognition is required for degradation of many short lived and abnormal proteins (19Ciechanover A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is also required at many stages in the cell cycle (20King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) and in the elimination of specific proteins during DNA repair (21Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L.

Indeed, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has been implicated in processes as diverse as antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (23Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K.

Wasserman S.A. Gatti M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Discovering how polyubiquitin chains are recognized by the 26 S protease is central to understanding a number of regulatory mechanisms. We previously identified a subunit (S5a) of the regulatory complex that binds ubiquitylated lysozyme and free polyubiquitin chains (27Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the preference of the 26 S protease for substrates attached to polyubiquitin chains, S5a selects for longer polyubiquitin species and has little apparent affinity for ubiquitin monomers (27Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The discovery that Saccharomyces cerevisiae S5a is not an essential protein provides clear evidence that additional ubiquitin recognition components must be present in the 26 S protease (30van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, S5a is currently the only subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex shown to bind polyubiquitin chains, and recent experiments suggest that polyubiquitin chain recognition by the 26 S protease is substantially similar to recognition by isolated S5a. 2Beal, R. E., Toscano-Cantaffa, D., Young, P., Rechsteiner, M., and Pickart, C. (1998) Biochemistry, in press. 2Beal, R. E., Toscano-Cantaffa, D., Young, P., Rechsteiner, M., and Pickart, C. (1998) Biochemistry, in press. Thus, the S5a protein provides a general model for studying recognition of polyubiquitin chains by a 26 S protease component. S5a retains the ability to bind ubiquitin chains even after it has been separated on a SDS-acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. These properties of S5a led us to propose that readily renatured and repeated binding regions in S5a confer the ability to select for longer polyubiquitin chains (31Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In support of the repeated motif model, the inferred amino acid sequences of S5a from fly, plant, and human encode conserved repeated motifs within their sequences (32Haracska L. Udvardy A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34Ferrell K. Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As a direct test for the presence of repeated polyubiquitin binding sites, we have carried out deletional mapping of the human S5a protein. These studies identify two regions of the protein able to bind polyubiquitin chains and provide evidence that the two sites bind polyubiquitin cooperatively. The human S5a cDNA containing a ten histidine NH2-terminal tag (34Ferrell K. Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was cloned into a pET-26b vector (Novagen). The resulting plasmid construct expressed a protein consisting of the entire S5a protein plus an NH2-terminal 21-amino acid histidine fusion peptide. The amino acid residues are numbered using the original S5a methionine as the origin. For generation of NH2-terminal deletions, 5′ PCR primers were designed with NdeI restriction sites at selected internal methionine codons within the S5a coding region. NH2-terminal deletion PCR products were generated using the NdeI 5′ primers with 3′ PCR primers containing a convenient restriction site. Restriction digestion, insertion into pET-26b, and expression in Escherichia coli resulted in protein products fused to the NH2-terminal histidine tag sequence and lacking NH2-terminal S5a sequence. Generation of C-terminal deletions involved a PCR reaction using a 5′ PCR primer upstream of the pET-26b promoter sequence and a 3′ primer containing a new stop codon followed by a BamHI restriction site. The C-terminal deletion PCR products were recloned into the expression pET-26b vector using the XbaI restriction site within the promoter sequence of the vector and a unique downstreamBamHI site. Expression of the plasmid constructs resulted in protein products containing the entire NH2 terminus of S5a including the histidine tag but lacking the C-terminal sequence. Constructs that contained both C-terminal and NH2-terminal deletions were created by using the NH2-terminal deletion plasmids as PCR template sequences and the 5′ promoter PCR oligomer and the 3′ stop codon oligomers as primers. These were recloned back into pET-26b as described for the C-terminal deletions. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the constructions. Expressed deletional constructs were also confirmed by mass spectrometry. In all cases the apparent mass matched that expected for the designed recombinant protein. Site-directed mutations within the two polyubiquitin binding sites were generated using the Mutagene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (version 2) purchased from Bio-Rad (35Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar, 36Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was generated by infection with R408 helper phage. The absence of unintended mutations in the constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. The expressed mutant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen). Plasmids containing S5a constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 30 °C, and expression was induced by the addition of 300 μm to 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside followed by 2 h incubation at 30 °C. Approximately 300 ml of bacterial culture was harvested and lysed with a French press in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40. Polypeptides were immobilized by metal chelate chromatography on Ni-NTA beads or spin columns (Qiagen) using the NH2-terminal histidines present on the recombinant proteins. Polyubiquitin chain mixtures consisting either of dimers to >15 ubiquitins or monomers to ≥5 ubiquitins were labeled with 125I as described previously (37Pickart C.M. Kasperek E.M. Beal R. Kim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7115-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyubiquitin chains were homopolymeric with successive ubiquitins linked by Lys48–Gly76 isopeptide bonds. For the binding assay, 600 μl of bacterial extract was centrifuged through a Ni-NTA column and then washed with TBS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The labeled ubiquitin chains were added to 1% milk protein and centrifuged through the column at 4 °C followed by two additional TBS washes. Bound polyubiquitin chains were released from the column by centrifuging 600 μl of 8 m urea through the columns. The distribution of 125I-polyubiquitin was determined by direct γ counting of both columns and wash fractions. A final wash with 300 mm imidazole displaced the S5a polypeptides from the Ni-NTA columns. The polyubiquitin chains were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The quantity of immobilized S5a polypeptides was measured by a Coomassie protein assay (Pierce) and by relative staining after SDS-PAGE. For binding assays a BL21(DE3) extract lacking expressed S5a polypeptide was used as a negative control. For binding studies using Ni-NTA beads, the S5a polypeptides were initially incubated with the beads followed by incubation with polyubiquitin chains for 0.5–2 h and rinsed twice for 10–15 min with TBS buffer at 4 °C. The chains were released from the beads by adding SDS sample buffer. Assays for polyubiquitin chain binding to proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose filters were performed as described previously (27Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High molecular weight polyubiquitylated125 I-lysozyme and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were prepared as described previously (38Hough R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2391-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitylated125 I-lysozyme conjugates were preincubated for 10 min with purified S5a or S5a fragments at room temperature and then mixed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.8, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Proteolysis was measured by the appearance of trichloroacetic acid soluble 125I (38Hough R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2391-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations for the small polyubiquitin binding site (PUbS) polypeptides and S5a were determined using a modified Biuret method, ESL from Boehringer Mannheim. To determine the apparent stability of S5a fragments in reticulocyte lysate, the polypeptides were added to conjugate degradation assay mixtures containing all the components just described except for125I-lysozyme conjugates. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane at various times. The nitrocellulose filters were then incubated with125I-polyubiquitin chains, and the relative binding activity of S5a or the PUbS was determined by phosphorimage analysis of125I-polyubiquitin bound to the Dot-blots. Western blots of 26 S protease subunits separated on two-dimensional gels revealed that anti-S5a reacted with the full-length subunit as well as with smaller species. The isoelectric points of the smaller S5a immunoreactive species conformed to those expected from progressive C-terminal deletions of the intact S5a protein. As a test for polyubiquitin binding to these smaller fragments, we separated subunits of the regulatory complex by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred them to a nitrocellulose filter, and incubated the filter with 125I-polyubiquitin chains or antisera specific for S5a. Full-length S5a and two of the smaller immunoreactive polypeptides bound polyubiquitin chains. The most abundant S5a fragment, however, did not bind polyubiquitin chains, and it did not produce amino acids upon Edman degradation indicating that it comprised the amino-terminal portion of the subunit (data not shown). From these initial results we suspected that the C-terminal half of S5a contained polyubiquitin binding site(s). Hence, we used PCR to produce two fragments of S5a that divided the protein roughly in half. Recombinant human S5a containing an NH2-terminal histidine tag has polyubiquitin binding properties equivalent to the S5a subunit isolated from the 26 S protease (34Ferrell K. Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) allowing us to purify histidine-tagged full-length or truncated S5a molecules on Ni-NTA beads and to test directly for 125I-polyubiquitin chain binding. The initial recombinant fragments confirmed that residues Met196–Lys377 of S5a bound polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 1 A), whereas NH2-terminal residues Met1–Ser211did not. Further deletional mapping identified two distinct binding sites for polyubiquitin chains within the C-terminal half of S5a. We call the two regions PUbS with residues Met196–Ala241 defined as PUbS1 and residues Met263–Asp307 defined as PUbS2 (see Fig. 1 B). Several regions of equivalent length or longer around the two PUbS did not bind polyubiquitin chains (e.g.residues Met224–Ser279, Met293–Leu342, Met329–Lys377, or Met107–Ser223). Full-length S5a protein selects for long polyubiquitin chains (27Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29660-29663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The chain length selection properties of each PUbS were examined by incubating 125I-polyubiquitin chains with equal amounts of S5a, PUbS1, or PUbS2 immobilized on Ni-NTA beads. Bound chains were then eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). All three molecules selected for longer polyubiquitin chains. Whereas PUbS2 and S5a showed appreciable apparent affinity for ubiquitin-tetramers and trimers, PUbS1 had reduced apparent affinity for these shorter species. In these experiments the recombinant proteins were present on the beads at less than 10% saturation. Moreover, varying the density of bound PUbS on the Ni-NTA beads over a 9-fold range did not alter the chain length distribution except for a very slight increase in the longest chains observed at higher peptide concentrations (data not shown). Although these results support the assumption that selection for polyubiquitin molecules does not require spanning of chains between multiple PUbS molecules bound to the beads, this possibility cannot be ruled out. Full-length S5a inhibits ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugate degradation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates providing a way to compare the PUbS that requires the S5a fragments to bind polyubiquitin chains in solution and thereby remove concern about possible polyubiquitin chain spanning. At 2 μm, full-length S5a significantly inhibited conjugate degradation; PUbS2 and PUbS1, by contrast, had only minimal effect at this concentration (Fig. 3 A). Varying the levels of the three proteins produced clear inhibition of conjugate degradation by each with a 10-fold difference in potency between S5a and PUbS2 and a 100-fold difference between S5a and PUbS1 (Fig. 3 B). The NH2-terminal half of S5a (Met1–Val208) did not inhibit conjugate degradation at concentrations up to 100 μm. Upon prolonged incubation PUbS1 and PUbS2 inhibited conjugate degradation to a lesser extent. This apparently reflects their degradation or modification in reticulocyte lysate since their binding activities decreased with half-lives of ∼15 min. Full-length S5a, on the other hand, was stable in lysate (data not shown). Therefore, inhibition by the PUbSs might reflect both their intrinsic affinity for polyubiquitin chains and their stability in the reticulocyte lysate. The deletion mapping in Fig. 1 identified two polyubiquitin binding sites in subunit S5a. However, additional sites could exist that require the intact protein for proper function. To examine this possibility and to measure the relative affinities of PUbS1 and PUbS2 for polyubiquitin chains, we mutated residues within each site. As shown below, each PUbS is centered on 3 large hydrophobic residues that alternate with alanines, and mutation of the bulky aliphatic side chains to alanines eliminates polyubiquitin binding. For PUbS1, Leu216, Leu218, and Leu220were converted to alanines; in PUbS2 Ile287, Tyr289, and Met291 were converted to alanines. In addition, a full-length S5a protein was constructed with alanine tracts at both sites. These three mutated versions of S5a and the wild-type protein were then tested for their ability to bind polyubiquitin chains. It is evident from the autoradiogram in Fig. 3 C that the doubly mutated S5a did not bind polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 3 C, lane 3), indicating either that additional polyubiquitin binding sites are not present within the native subunit or that such sites depend on functional PUbS1 and/or PUbS2 for activity. The autoradiogram in Fig. 3 C also clearly shows that whereas inactivation of PUbS1 moderately decreased ubiquitin chain binding to full-length S5a, alanine substitutions in PUbS2 produced dramatically reduced chain binding. Because comparison of circular dichroism spectra between wild-type S5a and the mutant S5a with alanine substitutions at both sites revealed no detectable changes, the loss of chain binding should not be attributed to a general structured perturbation of the mutated 5a subunit. These striking differences between full-length S5a proteins with either PUbS1 or PUbS2 inactivated were also apparent when chain binding was assayed by Ni-NTA beads or when the blotted proteins were probed with ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates rather than polyubiquitin chains (data not shown). At low concentrations, e.g. 40 ng on the blot, wild-type S5a retained 7-fold more polyubiquitin than expected from the sum of the independent sites, and this result suggests that PUbS1 and PUbS2 bind polyubiquitin chains cooperatively. We also determined whether each full-length version of S5a could inhibit 125I-lysozyme-Ub conjugate degradation in reticulocyte lysate. Confirming the data in Fig. 3 B, wild-type S5a was a potent inhibitor, and the recombinant protein bearing Ala substitutions at both PUbSs was inactive (Fig. 3 D). The fact that wild-type S5a inhibited conjugate degradation 10-fold better than S5a proteins with alanine tracts at PUbS1 or PUbS2 is additional evidence for cooperative interactions between the two sites. If the sites functioned independently, wild-type S5a would, at best, only be a 2-fold better inhibitor. It is apparent in Fig. 3 D that full-length S5a proteins with Ala tracts at PUbS1 or PUbS2 were equally good inhibitors. This result is surprising because when expressed as fragments PUbS2 is a much better inhibitor than PUbS1 (Fig. 3 B), and in the context of the full-length S5a protein, PUbS2 binds polyubiquitin chains with higher apparent affinity than does PUbS1 (Fig. 3 C). Possibly when S5a is present in a crude lysate, PUbS2 is partially masked, and this accounts for the unexpectedly poor inhibition by the S5a construct with PUbS1 inactivated. Because PUbS1 is present and highly conserved in all known S5a sequences, it was chosen to estimate the minimal sequence required for binding polyubiquitin chains. Polypeptides containing either the NH2-terminal half (Met107–Ser223) or the C-terminal half (Met224–Ser279) of this region failed to associate with polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the minimal binding site encompasses a significant portion of amino acids Met196 through Ala241. Two further deletions fixed the C-terminal boundary of PUbS1 to within 6 residues since a construct containing residues Met1–Gln231 bound polyubiquitin chains, whereas residues Met1–Glu225 did not (Fig. 1 A). Mapping the NH2-terminal boundaries of PUbS1 and PUbS2 was performed using a series of synthetic peptides with Ala240 from S5a as the C-terminal anchor for PUbS1 and Glu304 as the C terminus of PUbS2. Equivalent amounts of peptides were immobilized on Ni-NTA matrix using the histidine extensions and then incubated with polyubiquitin chains. The bound125I-polyubiquitin chains were eluted, quantitated, and displayed on an SDS-PAGE gel to determine their chain length distributions. As seen in Fig. 4, PUbS2 synthetic peptides retained more labeled chains than the PUbS1 series. The differences between PUbS1 and PUbS2 synthetic peptides were less than observed with the S5a mutants in Fig. 3 C, and this is likely due to the large amounts of synthetic peptides employed in Fig. 4. For both series of peptides, the presence of amino acids NH2-terminal to the hydrophobic region (LALAL or IAYAM) increased the amount of polyubiquitin bound. For PUbS1, the sequence of the amino acids did not appear to be of major importance since scrambling the NH2-terminal sequence of PUbS1 did not reduce chain binding significantly. However, the scrambled version showed little selection for Ub tetramers over trimers. Both PUbS1, Met196–Ala240, and the scrambled NH2-terminal sequence bound ∼150,000 cpm, but the ratio of bound trimer to tetramer (Ub3/Ub4) for the scrambled version was 1.4 very close to ratio of 1.9 in the starting chain mixture. By contrast the Ub3/Ub4 ratio was 0.4 for the wild type sequence. The combined use of internal deletions and synthetic peptides demonstrated that about 30 residues from each PUbS are required for polyubiquitin binding. Sequence alignment reveals that both sites contain a stretch of 5 residues in which large hydrophobic side chains alternate with alanines (Fig. 5). To determine the importance of the alternating pattern of hydrophobic re"

We previously identified the Rho targets: protein kinase N, Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), and the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase. Here we purified MBS-interacting proteins, identified them as adducin, and found that MBS specifically interacted with adducinin vitro and in vivo. Adducin is a membrane-skeletal protein that promotes the binding of spectrin to actin filaments and is concentrated at the cell-cell contact sites in epithelial cells. We also found that Rho-kinase phosphorylated α-adducin in vitro and in vivo and that the phosphorylation of α-adducin by Rho-kinase enhanced the interaction of α-adducin with actin filaments in vitro. Myosin phosphatase composed of the catalytic subunit and MBS showed phosphatase activity toward α-adducin, which was phosphorylated by Rho-kinase. This phosphatase activity was inhibited by the phosphorylation of MBS by Rho-kinase. These results suggest that Rho-kinase and myosin phosphatase regulate the phosphorylation state of adducin downstream of Rho and that the increased phosphorylation of adducin by Rho-kinase causes the interaction of adducin with actin filaments.

Rho is a small GTPase that exhibits both GDP/GTP binding and GTPase activities. Rho has GDP-bound inactive (GDP·Rho) and GTP-bound active (GTP·Rho) forms, which are interconvertible by GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase reactions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin.

When cells are stimulated with certain extracellular signals such as lysophosphatidic acid, GDP·Rho is thought to be converted to GTP·Rho, which binds to specific targets and then exerts its biological functions. Rho participates in signaling pathways that regulate actin cytoskeletons such as stress fibers and in cell-substratum adhesions such as focal adhesions in fibroblasts (3Ridley A.J. Hall A.

We recently showed that MBS is accumulated at cell-cell contact sites apart from myosin fibers in polarized MDCK epithelial cells, whereas MBS is colocalized with myosin fibers in REF52 fibroblasts (31Inagaki N. Nishizawa M. Ito M. Fujioka M. Nakano T. Tsujino S. Matsuzawa K. Kimura K. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To understand the function of MBS at cell-cell contact sites, we attempted to identify MBS-interacting molecules other than Rho and myosin. We have purified MBS-interacting proteins with molecular masses of about 85, 110, 115, 120, and 125 kDa and identified them as α-, β-, and γ-adducin. Adducin is a membrane skeletal protein that was first purified from human erythrocytes based on calmodulin binding activity (32Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin associates with F-actin and spectrin-F-actin complexes to promote the association of spectrin with F-actin (33Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Adducin also caps the fast growing end of actin filaments (34Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol.

Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is likely that adducin participates in the assembly of the spectrin-actin network of erythrocytes and epithelial cells. Adducin is composed of α and β or α and γ subunits closely related in amino acid sequence and domain organization (36Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Each adducin subunit has three distinct domains as follows: an amino-terminal head domain, connected by a neck domain to a carboxyl-terminal tail domain (36Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The tail domain of β-adducin binds mainly to Ca2+/calmodulin (40Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which inhibits both the ability of adducin to recruit additional spectrin to adducin-spectrin-F-actin complexes (33Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the ability of adducin to cap actin filaments (34Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Adducin is also a substrate for PKC and PKA (35Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J.

Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13875-13878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of β-adducin by PKC or PKA inhibits the calmodulin binding of β-adducin. The phosphorylation of adducin by PKA reduces the activity of adducin to associate with F-actin and spectrin-F-actin complexes and to promote the binding of spectrin to F-actin. Phosphorylation by PKC has little effect on these activities (40Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that MBS interacts with adducin bothin vitro and in vivo and that myosin phosphatase and Rho-kinase regulate the phosphorylation state of adducin. We also found that the phosphorylation of adducin by Rho-kinase results in the interaction of adducin with F-actin. cDNA of rat Notch1 was kindly provided by Dr. M.

The cells expressing HA-α-adducin were suspended in homogenizing buffer (20 mmTris/HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm A-PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied onto a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). After the column was washed, the proteins were eluted with a linear concentration gradient of NaCl (0–600 mm) in Buffer A. HA-α-adducin was eluted with about 200 mm NaCl. The membrane extract of bovine brain gray matter, 190 g, was prepared (17Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The membrane extract (16 ml) was passed through a 2.5-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia) to remove endogenous GST (17Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K.

One-tenth of the pass-through fraction was loaded onto a 0.25-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column containing GST-MBS-ANK, GST-Notch-ANK, or GST. After washing the columns with 0.825 ml of Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl three times, the bound proteins were coeluted with the respective GST fusion proteins by the addition of 0.825 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione three times. To prepare affinity purified MBS-ANK interacting proteins for peptide sequencing, the pass-through fraction (16 ml) was loaded onto a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column containing 24 nmol of GST-MBS-ANK. The proteins were eluted by the addition of 10 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione, and fractions of 1 ml each were collected. The same procedures were repeated three times. The affinity purified p85, p110, p115, p120, and p125 were dialyzed three times against distilled water and concentrated by freeze-drying. The concentrated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (46Iwamatsu A.

The immobilized beads were incubated with 8 μg of HA-α-adducin in 300 μl of Buffer A containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with 116 μl (3.3 volumes) of Buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with GST-MBS-ANK, GST-MBS-C, and GST by the addition of 116 μl (3.3 volumes) of Buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione three times. The second eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected by silver staining.

COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin. For the transfection of DNA, COS7 cells were seeded at the density of 1.7 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and cultured overnight. Rabbit anti-rat MBS pAb and rabbit anti-human α-adducin pAb were generated by use of GST-MBS-N and GST-α-adducin. MDCK cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. After being washed with PBS, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of extraction Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm A-PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was removed from the dishes with a rubber policeman, incubated in a 1.5-ml tube for 15 min, and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of anti-α-adducin Ab or 2 μg of control rabbit IgG. The immunocomplex was then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL 4B (Pharmacia). The immunocomplex was washed five times with the extraction Buffer A containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, then eluted by boiling in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-MBS Ab as described (47Harlow E. Lame D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain of Rho-kinase (421–701 aa) was produced and purified as GST fusion protein (GST-COIL). Rabbit anti-Rho-kinase pAb was generated by use of GST-COIL. For anti-MBS Ab, MDCK cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and treated with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. For anti-α-adducin Ab and anti-Rho-kinase Ab, MDCK cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with anti-MBS Ab, anti-Rho-kinase Ab, or anti-α-adducin Ab overnight at room temperature. Then MDCK cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig Ab. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were examined using a Zeiss axiophoto microscope or a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The kinase reaction for Rho-kinase was carried out in 50 μl of the kinase buffer (50 mmTris/HCl at pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1–20 GBq/mmol), purified enzyme, and 2.4 μg of HA-α-adducin with 1 μm GTPγS·GST-RhoA, GDP·GST-RhoA, or GST. After an incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled bands were visualized and estimated by an image analyzer (BAS-2000, Fuji, Tokyo). HA-α-adducin (7 μg of protein) was phosphorylated with GST-CAT (3 μg of protein) in 200 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.1 μm calyculin A with or without ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. F-actin was mixed with HA-α-adducin phosphorylated as above in Buffer B (30 mmHepes at pH 7.4, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.5 mm ATP) for 2 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, 50 μl of each reaction mixture was layered onto a 100-μl sucrose barrier (20% (w/v) sucrose in Buffer B) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants and pellets were separated and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-α-adducin Ab. HA-α-adducin (300 ng of protein) was phosphorylated with GST-CAT (120 ng of protein) in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 nm staurosporine. Native myosin phosphatase (5–75 ng) was preincubated in 30 μl of reaction mixture (30 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.55 mm EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mm CoCl2, 5–75 ng of myosin phosphatase) with or without 100 μmATPγS and GST-CAT (80 ng of protein) for 15 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 nmstaurosporine. The phosphatase reaction was then performed in 50 μl of the reaction mixture containing 300 ng of 32P-labeled HA-α-adducin for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then boiled in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The32P-labeled band corresponding to HA-α-adducin was visualized and estimated with an image analyzer. As a control experiment, 32P-labeled MLC was used as the substrate of myosin phosphatase. To express HA epitope-tagged α-adducin, the cDNA encoding human α-adducin (1–642 aa) was inserted into the KpnI site of pEF-BOS-HA. The transfection of plasmids into COS7 cells was carried out by the standard DEAE-dextran method (17Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). The plasmid pEF-BOS-HA-α-adducin was transfected with or without pEF-BOS-myc-CAT. The transfected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. The cells were then labeled with 18.5 MBq of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h and lysed with 0.3 ml of extraction Buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 μm calyculin A, 10 μm A-PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. HA-α-adducin was then immunoprecipitated from the soluble supernatant. The washed immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE for peptide mapping. HA-α-adducin was phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in vitro as described above. HA-α-adducins phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo were isolated by SDS-PAGE and digested with trypsin. Two-dimensional peptide mappings were performed with silica gel thin layer plates as described (48Naka M. Nishikawa M. Adelstein R.S. Hidaka H. Nature. 1983; 306: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated peptides were visualized by autoradiography. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as the reference protein as described (50Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). To detect MBS- interacting molecules, bovine brain membrane extract was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column on which GST, GST-MBS-ANK, or GST-Notch-ANK was immobilized. The proteins bound to the affinity columns were then coeluted with GST or GST fusion proteins by the addition of glutathione. Proteins with molecular masses of about 85 kDa (p85), 110 kDa (p110), 115 kDa (p115), 120 kDa (p120), and 125 kDa (p125) were detected in the glutathione eluate from the GST-MBS-ANK affinity column but not detected from the GST or the GST-Notch-ANK affinity column (Fig. 1 A). To identify the p85, p110, p115, p120, and p125, they were subjected to amino acid sequencing as described (46Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences derived from p85, p110, p115, p120, and p125 were determined. The amino acid sequences are KIDHAGFSPHAA (derived from p85), KGLSQMTTSADTDVDT, KGVSCSEVTASSL, QRPHEVGSVXWAG, KIFHLQAACEIQVSALSSAGG (derived from p115), KIREQNLQDIK, KHSDVEAPA, and KEDGHRTSTSAVPNL (derived from p110, p120, and p125). The peptide sequence of p85 was almost identical to that of human and rat γ-adducin. The peptide sequences of p115 were almost identical to that of human β-adducin. The peptide sequences of p110, p120, and p125 were almost identical to that of human α-adducin. p110 and p120 were probably degradation products of p125. p110, p120, and p125 were recognized by anti-α-adducin antibody, whereas p85 and p115 were weakly recognized by this antibody (Fig. 1 B). Adducin is a membrane-cytoskeletal protein localized at the spectrin-actin junction that was first purified from human erythrocytes based on calmodulin binding activity (32Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the molecular masses of α-, β-, and γ-adducins are estimated to be about 110, 104, and 80 kDa (38Dong L.

Nore1 has no significant sequence similarity to known mammalian proteins and lacks an identifiable catalytic domain, but contains sequence motifs that predict DAG_PE binding and SH3 domain binding.

The small GTP-binding protein Ras (Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras) plays a central role in transmitting proliferative and differentiation signals downstream of cell surface receptors in mammalian cells. Ras has been demonstrated to relay signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (1Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev.

Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The understanding of the biochemical mechanism by which Ras transmits signals in higher eucaryotic cells has been greatly clarified in recent years. Ras is located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane; activation of cell surface receptors promotes the exchange of Ras-GDP for GTP, thereby converting Ras to the active state. This activation results from GTP-induced conformational change, wherein two discrete Ras segments, called switch I (or the effector domain loop aa 32–40) and switch II (aa 60–72) exhibit a significant displacement as compared with the GDP-bound state. This conformational change renders Ras able to interact effectively with its downstream effectors or targets (4Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The first Ras effectors in mammalian cells to be identified are the protein kinases of the Raf family. GTP-bound Ras directly binds Raf primarily through an interaction between the switch I region and amino-terminal segment on Raf (amino acids 50–150). The ability of Raf to bind to Ras in a GTP-dependent manner,in vitro and in situ, is the cardinal biochemical evidence in support of Raf's role as a direct effector of Ras (5Avruch J. Zhang X.-F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The Raf-MEK-Erk pathway is the best characterized Ras effector pathway and is required for transformation of rodent fibroblasts by oncogenic Ras (6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). However, In recent years, many observations have indicated that Ras transmits signals into multiple effector pathways. For instance, constitutively active Ras and Raf both transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts, but only constitutively active Ras, but not Raf, can transform rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1), thus pathways besides the Raf-MEK-Erk pathway need to be activated to transform RIE-1 cells (7Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similarly, in PC-12 cells, activated Raf induces the expression of only a subset of genes which can be induced by oncogenic Ras or nerve growth factor (8D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An elegant study demonstrated that in Hela cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, the increase in Ras-GTP charging achieved immediately after release from mitosis is much less than a second phase of Ras activation that occurred some 5 h later, in mid-G1. Interestingly, only the first phase of Ras activation was accompanied by Erk activation, whereas the latter, much stronger Ras activation occurred without significant Erk activation (9Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The biologic significance of Ras activation in mid-G1 phase, and the nature of the effectors recruited by activated Ras at that time is entirely unknown.Following on the discovery of Raf as the initial Ras effector in higher eucaryotic cells, a number of candidate Ras effectors have been proposed based on the ability of these polypeptides to bind to Ras through its effector loop, and in a GTP-dependent fashion, including PI 3-kinase, members of the Ral-GDS family, Rin 1, AF-6, diacylglycerol kinases, PKC-ζ, MEKK1, etc. The standing of these polypeptides as candidate Ras effectors has been reviewed (10Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to look for novel proteins that directly interact with Ras. We describe here the identification of a potential new Ras effector, which we have named Nore1.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out to identify potential new Ras effectors in mammalian cells. One million yeast transformants coexpressing a V12 Ras bait plasmid and a cDNA library prepared from activated mouse T cells were screened. Twenty strong positives were obtained, which showed both interaction-dependent growth on selective media and interaction-dependent expression of Lac-Z activity. DNA sequencing revealed that 18 of the 20 positives were either mouse A-Raf or c-Raf-1. Two positive clones both encoded a 2.5-kb cDNA representing a new gene, which was named Nore1 (novel Ras effector). Although the sequence indicated that an incomplete open reading frame had been recovered, we made use of the yeast two-hybrid system to examine the specificity of the interaction of Nore1 with two Ras-related proteins Rap1b and RalA, and two well defined Ras effector domain mutants, Ras 12VΔ34,38A or Ras 12V38N, which are defective in binding known Ras effectors like Raf (12Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Rap1b and RalA belong to the Ras subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins (13Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); Rap1 (A and B) has identical sequence to Ras in the region corresponding to the Ras effector domain (aa 32–40) and binds to several previously identified Ras effectors like Raf, PI 3-kinase and Ral-GDS, whereas RalA does not bind to these polypeptides. Nore1 interacts with wild type Ras but not with Ras 12VΔ34,38A and Ras 12V38N. Nore1 also interact with Rap1b, but not with RalA (Table I). Thus, the interactions of Nore1 with these Ras-related proteins parallels closely the pattern exhibited by other well established Ras effectors.Table ITwo-hybrid interactions of Nore1 with Ras mutants and Ras-related proteinsCoexpression of GAL4 DNA binding domain Nore1-(188–413) fusion with GAL4 activation domain fused to:v-Rasc-Rap1bRas[Δ34A38]Ras[N38]RalARaf-1BlueBlueWhiteWhiteWhiteWhite Open table in a new tab The 2.5-kb Nore1 cDNA insert was used as the hybridization probe to isolate the entire cDNA from a mouse brain cDNA library. A 3018-base pair cDNA was isolated. The cDNA sequence around the first ATG matches the Kozak consensus sequence for a translational start. The open reading frame from this methionine includes 413 amino acids, as shown in Fig. 1 A, yielding a highly basic polypeptide (pI = 9.41) with a predicted molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. One obvious structural feature of Nore1 is the presence of a cysteine-histidine-rich segment typical of a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester (DAG_PE) binding site (14Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) (aa 118–165, H-X13-C-X2-C-X10-C-X2-C-X4-H-X2-C-X7-C). Nore1 also has a proline-rich region in its amino-terminal region, with five PXXP sequences (aa 17–20, PEPP; aa 31–34. PPPP; aa 34–37, PARP; aa 77–80, PVRP; and aa 105–108, PQDP), which are possible SH3 domain binding sites (15Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). A search of the GeneBank™ using BLASTP command found that a Caenorhabditis elegansgene product called T24F1.3 has significant homology to Nore1. Fig. 1 B shows the sequence similarity; the most significant homology between the two proteins is in their carboxyl-terminal regions. T24F1.3 has been suggested previously to contain a Ras/Rap association domain (RA domain) (16Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), located at aa 396–496. This domain is within the region most closely related in sequence to Nore1.Nore1 mRNA abundance and complexity in murine tissues was examined by Northern blot (Fig. 2 A). A single mRNA generally about 3.1 kb was detected in most mouse tissues, although some size variation is noted. The highest levels are observed in brain, liver, and spleen, with barely detectable levels in heart.Figure 2Expression of Nore1 mRNA in mouse tissues and immunoreactive Nore1 polypeptides in rat tissues and cell lines. A, expression of Nore1 mRNA in mouse tissues. A 220-base pair cDNA fragment (nucleotides 90–310) was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming method and used for probing Nore1 mRNA from various mouse tissues. The mouse multiple tissue blot was purchased from CLONTECH. B, protein expression of Nore1 in rat tissues. C, protein expression of Nore1 in cell lines. Cell lysates were all prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Affinity-purified anti-Nore1 antibodies were used to probe the membrane. Bands were visualized by the ECL method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A polyclonal antibody was raised against a carboxyl-terminal fragment of Nore1 (aa 188–413) and purified by affinity chromatography using the recombinant antigen. Immunoblot of extracts prepared from different rat tissue is shown in Fig. 2 B. A single immunoreactive band at 46 kDa is seen in a brain extract, which is in agreement with the predicted size of the polypeptide encoded by Nore1 cDNA isolated from the mouse brain library. A similar 46-kDa band is also seen in other tissues, including lung and testis. In addition, however, prominent immunoreactive bands at other molecular masses are seen in most tissues, and some tissues lack a 46-kDa band entirely (e.g. skeletal muscle, heart, spleen, and liver). All tissues but brain show a major 65-kDa band, and two bands around 55 kDa are also seen in lung, spleen, testis, and liver. The 65- and 55-kDa bands may represent isoforms of Nore1, the existence of which is suggested by the partial cDNAs isolated from a variety of cDNA libraries (data not shown). Alternatively, these bands may reflect polypeptides unrelated to Nore1, except for the presence of sequence epitopes recognized by the polyclonal antibodies to Nore1. The anti-Nore1 antibody also immunoblotted a single polypeptide in an extract prepared from C. elegans. This band is approximately 74 kDa, as compared with the molecular mass of T24F1.3 gene product of 69.1 kDa. The murine brain Nore1 cDNA was tagged at the Nore1 amino terminus with an HA epitope and expressed transiently in COS cells. As seen in Fig. 2 C. HA-Nore1 shows the expected size of 46 kDa by immunoblot with anti-Nore1 antibodies. Extracts prepared from several cell lines were subjected to Nore1 immunoblot; of the cell lines examined, only BC3H1, a vascular smooth muscle-like line derived from a radiation-induced murine brain tumor, shows a single band at 46 kDa. A band of similar size is seen in several other cell lines, including RIE-1 (rat intestinal epithelial), MCF-7 (human breast cancer), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney), and KB (human oral carcinoma); however, immunoreactive polypeptides of 55 kDa (RIE-1, MCF-7, HEK 293, and KB) and 65 kDa (RIE-1, HEK 293, and KB), are as or more abundant in these cell lines, and some lines show only bands other than the 46-kDa polypeptide (e.g. Huh-7, 40 kDa; L6, 55 kDa). We preabsorbed the affinity-purified anti-Nore1 antibodies with an excess amount of recombinant Nore1-(188–413) for 1 h and used this preabsorbed antibodies to probe the blots used in Fig. 2,B and C, and we did not see the predominant bands at 46, 55, and 66 kDa, suggesting that these bands in both figures are probably specific.A GST-Nore1-(188–413) fusion protein (corresponding to the Nore1 polypeptide encoded in the initial cDNA isolate) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Procaryotic recombinant c-Ha-Ras was loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS, and various amounts were mixed with a fixed amount of GST-Nore1-(188–413) or GST as control. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, GST or GST fusion proteins and any associated proteins were recovered by addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed and eluted into SDS sample buffer; proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed for Ras using a monoclonal anti-Ras antibody. GST -Nore1-(188–413), but not GST binds Ras, and considerably more Ras-GTPγS is bound than Ras-GDP-β-S (Fig. 3). These results establish that the effector loop-dependent interaction between Nore1 and Ras identified by two-hybrid techniques reflects the direct binding of the two proteins and that the binding between Nore1 and Ras is GTP-dependent.Figure 3Specific, GTP-dependent interaction of purified recombinant Nore1 and Ras polypeptides in vitro. V12-Ras protein purified from bacterial expression was loaded with either GTPγS or GDPβS. The loaded Ras proteins were incubated with GST or GST-Nore1-(188–413). Glutathione-Sepharose beads were used to pull down the Ras-Nore1-(188–413) complexes. Ras protein was detected using the pan-Ras antibody-2 (Oncogene Science) in the Western blot shown above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then attempted to detect an interaction between Nore1 and Ras in mammalian cells and to determine whether this binding was dependent on Ras activation in situ. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GST-Nore1 and HA-tagged c-Ha-Ras. Forty-eight hours later, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF or TPA for various times, extracted into buffer containing Triton X-100, and HA-Ras was recovered using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5. The washed immunoprecipitates were eluted into SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with affinity-purified anti-GST polyclonal antibodies. As seen in Fig. 4 A, GST-Nore1 was specifically pulled down with HA-c-Ha-Ras, but only after the cells were treated with EGF or TPA; the expression of HA-c-Ha-Ras and of GST-Nore1 was uniform throughout. Thus, Nore1 is not detectably associated with Ras in serum-starved COS cells; however, within 5 min after stimulation by EGF (or TPA), Nore1 associates specifically with Ras; this association diminishes by 15 min after EGF addition and is largely reversed by 40 min, probably reflecting the down-regulation of Ras activation after EGF treatment.Figure 4EGF and TPA stimulated association of Nore1 with Ras in transfected COS-7 cells and in nontransfected KB cells. A, EGF and TPA stimulated association of Nore1 with Ras in transfected COS-7 cells. pEBG-Nore1 together with PMT2-HA or PMT2-HA-c-Ha-Ras were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Transfected cells were first serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) or TPA (100 nm) for the time indicated. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate HA-c-Ha-Ras or HA alone. B, EGF stimulated association of endogenous Nore1 with endogenous Ras in KB cells. Confluent KB cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for various time. Triton X-100-soluble cell extracts were prepared, and the moloclonal anti-Ras antibody Y13-238 were used to immunoprecipitate Ras proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next attempted to detect an in situ association between endogenous Ras and endogenous Nore1, under conditions where the levels of the two polypeptides are not increased artificially by transient overexpression. We chose to examine the human oral carcinoma cell line KB, because Nore1 expression is readily detectable, and these cells express substantial numbers of EGF receptors. KB cells grown to 80% confluence were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with EGF for various times. Triton X-100-soluble cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the monoclonal anti-Ras antibody, Y13-238, which are known to enable isolation of Ras-Raf complexes. The Ras immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with the lysis buffer, eluted into SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunobloted with the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Nore1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 B, although equal amounts of endogenous Ras were recovered in all samples, the Ras immunoprecipitates contain immunoreactive Nore1 only after treatment of the cells with EGF. The time course of Ras-Nore1 association after EGF treatment in KB cells is more sustained than that observed in COS-7 cells. This may reflect different time course of down-regulation of Ras activation in those cells. Interestingly, only the 46-kDa (and not the equally abundant 55-kDa) immunoreactive Nore1 polypeptide is recovered with c-Ras.In summary, we have identified Nore1, a potential new Ras effector or target, using the yeast two-hybrid screen with Ras as bait. We show that Nore1 can bind Ras directly in vitro using purified recombinant Ras and Nore1 polypeptides. The Ras/Nore1 associationin vitro depends strongly on Ras being in the GTP-bound form. We show that with yeast two-hybrid assay, Nore1 interacts with Ras 12V but not two transformation defective effector loop mutants, Ras 12VΔ34,38A and Ras 12V38N. This profile of interaction with Ras is identical to that exhibited by known and potential Ras effectors, including Raf, PI 3-kinase, Ral GDS, Rin1, and AF-6. We also show that the Ras/Nore1 association occurs in vivo following EGF and TPA activation of Ras in COS-7 cells overexpressing Ras and Nore1. Finally, it is clear that a stimulus-dependent association of endogenous Ras and Nore1 occurs following EGF receptor activation in KB cells. To our knowledge, Nore1 is the only other candidate mammalian Ras effector, other than Raf, wherein the endogenous polypeptide has been demonstrated to associate with Ras in vivo following receptor activation. Taken together, these properties indicate that Nore1 is very likely to be a physiologic Ras effector. The small GTP-binding protein Ras (Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras) plays a central role in transmitting proliferative and differentiation signals downstream of cell surface receptors in mammalian cells. Ras has been demonstrated to relay signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (1Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev.

The understanding of the biochemical mechanism by which Ras transmits signals in higher eucaryotic cells has been greatly clarified in recent years. Ras is located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane; activation of cell surface receptors promotes the exchange of Ras-GDP for GTP, thereby converting Ras to the active state. This activation results from GTP-induced conformational change, wherein two discrete Ras segments, called switch I (or the effector domain loop aa 32–40) and switch II (aa 60–72) exhibit a significant displacement as compared with the GDP-bound state. This conformational change renders Ras able to interact effectively with its downstream effectors or targets (4Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The first Ras effectors in mammalian cells to be identified are the protein kinases of the Raf family. GTP-bound Ras directly binds Raf primarily through an interaction between the switch I region and amino-terminal segment on Raf (amino acids 50–150). The ability of Raf to bind to Ras in a GTP-dependent manner,in vitro and in situ, is the cardinal biochemical evidence in support of Raf's role as a direct effector of Ras (5Avruch J. Zhang X.-F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The Raf-MEK-Erk pathway is the best characterized Ras effector pathway and is required for transformation of rodent fibroblasts by oncogenic Ras (6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). However, In recent years, many observations have indicated that Ras transmits signals into multiple effector pathways. For instance, constitutively active Ras and Raf both transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts, but only constitutively active Ras, but not Raf, can transform rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1), thus pathways besides the Raf-MEK-Erk pathway need to be activated to transform RIE-1 cells (7Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similarly, in PC-12 cells, activated Raf induces the expression of only a subset of genes which can be induced by oncogenic Ras or nerve growth factor (8D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An elegant study demonstrated that in Hela cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, the increase in Ras-GTP charging achieved immediately after release from mitosis is much less than a second phase of Ras activation that occurred some 5 h later, in mid-G1. Interestingly, only the first phase of Ras activation was accompanied by Erk activation, whereas the latter, much stronger Ras activation occurred without significant Erk activation (9Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The biologic significance of Ras activation in mid-G1 phase, and the nature of the effectors recruited by activated Ras at that time is entirely unknown. Following on the discovery of Raf as the initial Ras effector in higher eucaryotic cells, a number of candidate Ras effectors have been proposed based on the ability of these polypeptides to bind to Ras through its effector loop, and in a GTP-dependent fashion, including PI 3-kinase, members of the Ral-GDS family, Rin 1, AF-6, diacylglycerol kinases, PKC-ζ, MEKK1, etc. The standing of these polypeptides as candidate Ras effectors has been reviewed (10Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to look for novel proteins that directly interact with Ras. We describe here the identification of a potential new Ras effector, which we have named Nore1. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out to identify potential new Ras effectors in mammalian cells. One million yeast transformants coexpressing a V12 Ras bait plasmid and a cDNA library prepared from activated mouse T cells were screened. Twenty strong positives were obtained, which showed both interaction-dependent growth on selective media and interaction-dependent expression of Lac-Z activity. DNA sequencing revealed that 18 of the 20 positives were either mouse A-Raf or c-Raf-1. Two positive clones both encoded a 2.5-kb cDNA representing a new gene, which was named Nore1 (novel Ras effector). Although the sequence indicated that an incomplete open reading frame had been recovered, we made use of the yeast two-hybrid system to examine the specificity of the interaction of Nore1 with two Ras-related proteins Rap1b and RalA, and two well defined Ras effector domain mutants, Ras 12VΔ34,38A or Ras 12V38N, which are defective in binding known Ras effectors like Raf (12Zhang X.-F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Rap1b and RalA belong to the Ras subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins (13Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); Rap1 (A and B) has identical sequence to Ras in the region corresponding to the Ras effector domain (aa 32–40) and binds to several previously identified Ras effectors like Raf, PI 3-kinase and Ral-GDS, whereas RalA does not bind to these polypeptides. Nore1 interacts with wild type Ras but not with Ras 12VΔ34,38A and Ras 12V38N. Nore1 also interact with Rap1b, but not with RalA (Table I). Thus, the interactions of Nore1 with these Ras-related proteins parallels closely the pattern exhibited by other well established Ras effectors.Table ITwo-hybrid interactions of Nore1 with Ras mutants and Ras-related proteinsCoexpression of GAL4 DNA binding domain Nore1-(188–413) fusion with GAL4 activation domain fused to:v-Rasc-Rap1bRas[Δ34A38]Ras[N38]RalARaf-1BlueBlueWhiteWhiteWhiteWhite Open table in a new tab"

https://openalex.org/W2083179606,"The B-isoform of human progesterone receptors (PR) contains three activation functions (AF3, AF1, and AF2), two of which (AF1 and AF2) are shared with the A-isoform. AF3 is in the B-upstream segment (BUS), the far N-terminal 164 amino acids of B-receptors; AF1 is in the 392-amino acid N-terminal region common to both receptors; and AF2 is in the C-terminal hormone binding domain. B-receptors are usually stronger transactivators than A-receptors due to transcriptional synergism between AF3 and one of the two downstream AFs. We now show that the N terminus of PR common to both isoforms contains an inhibitory function (IF) located in a 292-amino acid segment lying upstream of AF1. IF represses the activity of A-receptors but is not inhibitory in the context of B-receptors due to constraints imparted by BUS. As a result, IF inhibits AF1 or AF2 but not AF3, regardless of the position of IF relative to BUS. IF is functionally independent and strongly represses transcription when it is fused upstream of estrogen receptors.

Transcriptional control in response to extracellular signals involves the binding of regulatory proteins to specific enhancer elements of target genes.

O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). Progesterone receptors (PR) are members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-inducible transcription factors. These are structurally complex proteins containing multiple functional domains, including a highly conserved central DNA-binding domain (DBD), a moderately well conserved C-terminal hormone-binding domain (HBD), and a poorly conserved, N-terminal region whose function is largely unknown (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). There are two naturally occurring isoforms of PR.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11945-11949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to AFs, some transcription factors also contain inhibitory domains (IDs) that modulate the activity of the AFs. Such IDs have been identified by deletion mutagenesis that generate proteins with enhanced transcriptional activities. Examples include members of the AP1 family c-Jun (15Baichwal V.R. Park A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), c-Fos, and the related protein, FosB (16Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); ATF-2, a member of the ATF/cAMP regulatory element-binding protein subfamily of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP)-containing transcription factors (17Li X.-Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); and the lymphoid-specific transcription factor, Oct-2a (18Friedl E.M. Matthias P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An ID has also been found in the proto-oncogene c-Myb, which plays a key role in hematopoesis (19Dubendorff J.W. Whittaker L.J. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, IDs have been characterized in two yeast transcription factors: PHO4, which is regulated by phosphate levels (20Jayarman P.-S. Hirst K. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2192-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and ADR1, which regulates glycerol metabolism genes (21Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no ID has been described in the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. The IDs are structurally distinct from the AFs that they regulate (15Baichwal V.R. Park A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Brown H.J.

In some cases, inhibition is transferable to heterologous AFs, suggesting that the IDs are functionally independent. For example, when fused to the Escherichia coli polypeptide B42, the inhibitory regions of ADR1 repress transcription (21Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the IDs of c-Myb and c-Jun can inhibit the activity of VP16, a potent transactivator (15Baichwal V.R. Park A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Dubendorff J.W. Whittaker L.J. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Inhibition by other IDs, however, is restricted to either the cognate AFs or a certain subset of AFs. For example, the bZIP domain of ATF-2 inhibits the related AFs of ATF-2 and E1a but not the acidic AF of VP16 or the glutamine-rich AF of Sp1 (17Li X.-Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, the N-terminal ID of c-Fos specifically silences the HOB1 subset of AFs found in c-Fos and c-Jun but not other phosphorylation-dependent AFs such as that found in cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (16Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because A-receptors are weak transactivators compared with B-receptors and are trans-dominant inhibitors of other nuclear receptors, we postulated that A-receptors contain inhibitory sequences distinct from the three defined AFs and that these sequences are inoperative in B-receptors. We sought this inhibitory function (IF) in a previously uncharacterized 292-amino acid region of the A-receptor N terminus. In this paper we have compared the activity of several PR constructs that either contain or lack IF. We show that IF expresses a novel inhibitory function, distinct from the AFs, that inhibits AF1 and AF2 but not AF3. Therefore, IF removal converts A-receptors from weak into strong transactivators. Additionally, IF is transferable and suppresses estrogen receptor (ER) activity when it is cloned upstream of ER. Complementary DNAs, hPR2 and hPR1, encoding human A- and B-receptors, respectively, and HEGO, encoding human estrogen receptors, cloned into pSG5 (4Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), were gifts from P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France). Construction of BUS-DBD, N-terminal B (NTB)-DBD, N-terminal A (NTA)-DBD, DBD-HBD, and BUS-DBD-HBD expression vectors, all containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), was described in Sartorius et al.

NTA-ΔIF was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of PR nucleotide (nt) sequences 2109–2678 encoding AF1, DBD, and the NLS (4Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). The 5′-sense primer contained an EcoRI site, a Kozak consensus sequence (22Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar), and ATG initiation codon. The 3′-antisense primer contained a STOP codon and BglII site (5Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pSG5 digested withEcoRI/BglII. A-ΔIF was made by digesting NTA-ΔIF with BbsI/BglII and isolating the larger fragment, which contains pSG5 sequences, AF1, and the DBD N terminus upstream of the BbsI site. This was used as a recipient for ligation of the BbsI/BglII fragment from BUS-DBD-HBD, which contains the DBD C terminus, NLS, and HBD. For B-ΔAF1 a fragment encoding sequences upstream of AF1 (fragment 1) was made by amplification of hPR1 sequences using a 5′-sense primer (nt 1855–1878) containing an MluI site and a 3′-antisense primer (nt 2096–2116) containing a SalI site. Fragment 2, which spans sequences from the 3′ border of AF1 to the end of the HBD, was made with a 5′-sense primer (nt 2385–2404) containing aSalI site and a 3′-antisense primer (nt 3525–3545) containing a BglII site (5Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The two fragments were combined with an MluI/BglII vector-containing fragment (fragment 3) derived from hPR1. All three fragments were ligated to produce B-ΔAF1. A-ΔAF1 was made from B-ΔAF1 by removing anEcoRI/BamHI fragment, filling in overhanging ends, and ligating the blunt ends. For NTB-ΔAF1, fragment 4, which spans sequences from the 3′ end of AF1 through the NLS, was amplified from NTB-DBD using the 5′-sense primer for fragment 2 containing a SalI site and a 3′-antisense primer (nt 2646–2678) containing a BglII site, coding sequences homologous to the 3′ end of NTB-DBD and a STOP codon (5Sartorius C.A.

PCR fragments 1 and 4 were combined with the MluI/BglII vector-containing fragment 3 and ligated. IF-BUS-DBD was made by amplification of IF (spanning nt 1239–2108) from hPR1 using primer pairs containing EcoRI sites. BUS-DBD-NLS was amplified from BUS-DBD with a 5′-sense primer containing an EcoRI site and a 3′-antisense primer containing a BglII site and STOP codon (5Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The two fragments were ligated and digested withMluI/BglII. The larger fragment was cloned into the vector-containing fragment derived from NTA-DBD digested with MluI/BglII. IF-NLS was made by amplification of IF using a 5′-sense primer containing aBamHI site and a 3′-antisense primer containing anEcoRI site. This fragment was cloned into pSG5–2TK digested with EcoRI and BamHI. pSG5–2TK was made by digesting pSG5 with EcoRI and BglII and inserting an oligo linker containing a Kozak consensus sequence (22Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar),BglII site, the PR NLS, multi-cloning sites forBamHI, SmaI, and EcoRI, and three STOP codons. IF-ER was made by amplification of ER coding sequences (nt 233–2020) (23Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) using primer pairs containing EcoRI sites. The resulting fragment was ligated into the IF-NLS expression vector at the EcoRI site. cDNA sequences were verified by dideoxy (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or automated fluorescent sequencing (Cancer Center Sequencing Core Lab, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO), and protein expression was verified by immunoblotting. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), thymidine kinase (tk-CAT) and ERE2-TATAtk-CAT reporters were gifts from P. Chambon. For PRE2-TATAtk-CAT, two copies of the tyrosine aminotransferase progesterone response element (PRE) were cloned upstream of a truncated fragment (−60/+51) of the tkgene as described previously (9Tung L.

Whole-cell 0.5 m KCl extracts were prepared from COS cells transiently transfected with the expression vectors described. The expressed PR fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% or 10% SDS-containing denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Protein blots were probed with our anti-PR monoclonal antibodies, AB-52 and B-30 (24Estes P.A. Suba E.J. Lawler-Heavner J. Wei L.L. Toft D.O. Horwitz K.B. Edwards D.P.

For detection of ER or IF-ER, the anti-ER antibody SRA 1,000 was used (StressGen, Victoria, BC). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (11Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.P. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in 10 ml of minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% twice charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (DCC-MEM). Duplicate plates were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 2 μg of the reporter plasmid, variable amounts (indicated in the figures) of the receptor expression vectors, 3 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotechnology Inc.) to correct for transfection efficiency, and Bluescribe (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) carrier plasmid for a total of 20 μg/plate (11Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.P. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h later, the medium was changed to 7.5% DCC-MEM, and cells were either left untreated or were incubated with 10 nm of the synthetic progestin R5020 (Roussel UCLAF, France) or 17β-estradiol, for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested, and lysates were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and analyzed for CAT activity by TLC as described previously (9Tung L. Mohammed M.K. Hoeffler J.P. Takimoto G.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard deviations of phosphorimaging (Image Quant, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) data were determined using Microsoft Excel, version 5.0 (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA) for the number of sets indicated in the figure legends. A series of expression vectors was constructed in which each region of PR that contains an AF was fused, either alone or in combination with another AF, to the PR DBD-NLS (5Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Additionally, the constructs contained or lacked IF, the 291 amino acids lying upstream of AF1. IF was also cloned upstream of full-length ER. The detailed structure of all the constructs is shown in Fig. 1. Expression of the receptor proteins was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of whole-cell extracts derived from COS cells (Fig. 2). They range in size from 191 to 933 amino acids and are all well expressed. The presence of multiple bands for some constructs, particularly ones that contain BUS (Fig. 2 A, lane 8, for example), is due to phosphorylation (5Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Takimoto G.S. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tasset D.M. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13308-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this multiple banding pattern is amplified by removal of the HBD (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 8) and is reduced by juxtaposition of IF upstream of BUS (Fig. 2, compare lane 6 in A and lane 1 in B). Each of the receptors shown in Fig. 2 binds to a perfect palindromic PRE in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). To search for an inhibitory function, an A-receptor variant was constructed (A-ΔIF) that lacks the N-terminal 292 amino acids located upstream of AF1 (Fig. 1). This previously uncharacterized domain, designated IF (amino acids 165–455), although common to both receptor isoforms, has the potential to function differently when free at the N terminus of A-receptors but constrained by BUS in B-receptors. Strikingly, on the PRE2-TATAtk promoter (Fig. 3 A) or on the MMTV promoter (Fig. 3 B), deletion of IF converts A-receptors from weak into strong transactivators equivalent to B-receptors. However, unlike B-receptors, but like A-receptors, A-ΔIF displays strong “self-squelching” behavior. Therefore, as the concentration of A-ΔIF is increased, the high levels of CAT activity fall. Fig. 3 shows that IF contains a potent inhibitory function that suppresses the activity of A-receptors. However, because B-receptors, which also contain IF sequences, are strong transactivators, we postulated that IF does not influence AF3 but that its inhibitory effects are restricted to AF1 and/or AF2 (Fig. 4). To test this hypothesis, constructs were made that contained each AF alone, with or without IF (Fig. 1). Dose-response data using PRE2-TATAtk-CAT are shown in Fig. 4 for AF1 (NTA-DBD) with (+) and without (−) IF (Fig. 4 A); AF2 (DBD-HBD) with (+) and without (−) IF (Fig. 4 B); and AF3 (BUS-DBD) with (+) and without (−) IF (Fig. 4 C) compared with full-length B-receptors. Analogous to its role in full-length A-receptors, we find that IF has its strongest effect on AF1 and AF2 at low receptor concentrations. Deletion of IF strongly increases AF1-dependent transcription (Fig. 4 A, 100 ng) but its inhibitory effects on AF1 can be overcome at higher concentrations because of the failure of NTA-DBD to self-squelch. Note that NTA-DBD is the only A-receptor construct that does not self-squelch (not shown). These and other data (Fig. 4 B and not shown) suggest that the HBD is required for this property. Deletion of IF from an AF2-containing HBD construct also converts a weak transactivator into a stronger one at low concentrations (Fig. 4 B). At higher concentrations, however, the influence of self-squelching abolishes AF2 activity. Thus, the HBD mediates two opposing activities: a stimulatory AF2 function and an inhibitory self-squelching function. IF can suppress the former but has no effect on the latter. We speculate that IF inhibition of AF1 and AF2 is additive in full-length A-receptors, accounting for their weak activity at all concentrations. Neither the inhibitory function of IF nor the self-squelching activity of the HBD operates in B-receptors. Removal of IF does not enhance AF3 activity at low concentrations (Fig. 4 C) nor does it effect AF3 at higher concentrations, and, like full-length B-receptors (Fig. 3), the B-receptor derivatives BUS-DBD-HBD or B-ΔAF1 do not self-squelch despite presence of the HBD (data not shown). Several possible mechanisms can be invoked for auto-inhibition of A-receptors by IF. One is binding of a repressor at IF. However, we find that overexpression of an IF-NLS construct does not squelch the putative repressor (not shown). Another possible mechanism is steric hindrance of AF1 and AF2 by IF due to the latter's upstream position. To test this hypothesis, IF was cloned upstream of AF3. We reasoned that if IF acts by steric hindrance in A-receptors, then perhaps juxtaposition of IF upstream of BUS would inhibit AF3 activity. To that end, IF-BUS-DBD was constructed and compared with NTB-ΔAF1 (BUS-IF-DBD) on PRE2-TATAtk-CAT (Fig. 4 D). The only difference between these two constructs is the position of IF relative to AF3. BUS-DBD was used as a control. At all concentrations tested, the two IF-containing constructs had equivalent transcriptional activity. Therefore, BUS appears to be insensitive to the inhibitory effects of IF, regardless of the position of IF. In addition, we find that IF has no effect in other B-receptor derivatives. Specifically, constructs containing AF2 plus AF3 (B-ΔAF1 and BUS-DBD-HBD) had identical transcriptional profiles with and without IF (not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that IF does not act simply by steric hindrance of any AF to which it is linked; rather IF inhibition is specific for AF1 and AF2. We therefore asked whether IF could suppress AF1 and AF2 of another member of the steroid receptor family. Inhibitory domains, like activation domains, can be discrete and modular. To determine whether IF effects were transferable, we tested the ability of IF to inhibit the heterologous AFs of ER. ERs contain AF1 and AF2 and, in this respect, structurally resemble A-receptors (14McDonnell D.P. Goldman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11945-11949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tasset D. Tora L. Fromental C. Scheer E. Chambon P.

Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). However, ER have no sequences homologous to IF. To test the effects of IF on ER, an IF-ER chimera was constructed (Fig. 1) in which IF was cloned upstream of ER. Fig. 5 Ashows transcription by wild-type ER or IF-ER of the ERE2-TATAtk-CAT reporter in the absence (open symbols) or presence of 10 nm17β-estradiol (solid symbols). CAT activity induced by ER is maximal at 0.1 μg of the expression vector and then decreases at higher concentrations due to self-squelching. This has previously been described (7Bocquel M.-T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14McDonnell D.P. Goldman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11945-11949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the same cDNA concentrations, IF cloned upstream of ER markedly reduces transcription. Fig. 5 (B and C) compares the transcriptional efficacy of ER and IF-ER when the two are expressed at similar protein levels. We find that IF-ER is expressed at lower efficiency than ER. Thus, 1 μg of the IF-ER expression vector and 0.1 μg of HEGO produce equivalent amounts of immunoreactive protein (Fig. 5 B). Note that the expected molecular mass of ER is 65 kDa and that of IF-ER is 97 kDA. Fig. 5 C shows that at these equivalent protein concentrations, wild-type ER strongly activate transcription, whereas little or no transcription is produced by IF-ER. We conclude that when IF is transferred upstream of ER, it silences ER-dependent transcription. This paper describes a novel, transferable inhibitory function, designated IF, which lies in the 292-amino acid N-terminal region upstream of the PR AF1 but operates only in the context of A-receptors. Why progesterone target tissues contain two receptor isoforms remains an intriguing physiological puzzle. They were first described in chick oviducts (29Schrader W.T. O'Malley B. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then in human cells (2Horwitz K.B. Alexander P.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 2195-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In humans, the two proteins are the products of a single gene that has two promoters, from which at least nine messages, two of which are A-receptor specific, are transcribed (30Wei L.L. Gonzalez-Aller C. Wood W.M. Miller L.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An internal AUG present in some messages may also encode A-receptors (30Wei L.L. Gonzalez-Aller C. Wood W.M. Miller L.A. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, there is complex regulatory control over protein levels of the two isoforms, the details of which are still unclear. In initial studies using breast cancer cell lines, the two isoforms were found in approximately equimolar amounts (3Krett N.L. Wei L.L. Francis M.D. Nordeen S.K. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M. Horwitz K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that their relative levels are under tight developmental and hormonal control in chicken oviducts (31Spelsberg T.C. Halberg F. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Boyd-Leinen P.A. Fournier D. Thomas C.S.

Biol. 1993; 47: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and preliminary data in the human uterus also show a discordance, with A:B ratios ranging between 50:1 and 2:1 during the menstrual cycle due to large excursions in the levels of B-receptors (35Wiehle, R. D., Mangal, R., Poindexter, A. N., III, Weigel, N. L., The 77th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Washington, D. C., June 14–17, 1995, 1995, 224, The Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD.Google Scholar). In breast cancers 25% of tumors have a significant excess of A-receptors (36Graham J.D. Yeates C. Balleine R. Harvey S.S. Milliken J.S. Bilous A.M. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5063-5068PubMed Google Scholar). Given the functional transcriptional differences between the two isoforms, their unequal distribution in tissues and tumors could be biologically important. For example, an excess of B-receptors in the uterus may mark those patients at greatest risk of developing tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancers (37Miller M.M. James R.A. Richer J.K. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Much of the work devoted to understanding regulation of transcription by steroid receptors has focused on AFs and their stimulatory actions. However, transcriptional inhibition may be equally important as a way of preventing or terminating activation. Studies that deal with inhibition have focused on composite DNA elements and invoke mechanisms in which receptor occupancy at one DNA site interferes with transcription by an activator at an adjoining site (38Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 39Renkawitz R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 192-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of an activator by a repressor and recruitment of corepressors are other silencing mechanisms (40Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that negative signaling elements can exist in the receptor molecule itself. We show that IF markedly suppresses the transcriptional activity of AF1 and AF2 of A-receptors (Fig. 4). The ability of IF to also strongly suppress AF1 plus AF2 of ER (Fig. 5) suggests that its inhibitory mechanisms involve general steroid receptor-related processes. It is tempting to speculate that IF prevents the binding of key AF1 or AF2 transcriptional coregulators that are shared by all steroid receptors (40Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). However the inability of soluble IF (i.e. IF-NLS) to squelch such activity suggests that IF acts structurally, perhaps through intramolecular contacts. Our data show that the inhibitory activity can be transferred to the cognate AFs of ER. In that respect, IF resembles the bZIP domain of ATF-2 and the N-terminal ID of c-Fos (16Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Li X.-Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whether IF can also suppress heterologous AFs remains to be determined. B-receptors also contain the IF element, but its repressor activity appears to be constrained by BUS, which is located further upstream. Therefore, IF specifically inhibits AF1 and AF2 of PR but not AF3 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, IF cannot inhibit AF3 regardless of its position relative to BUS (Fig. 4, C and D). We have previously demonstrated that AF3 transcriptional activity is unusual in that it is critically dependent on the presence of the PR DBD. In gel mobility shift studies, BUS-DBD binds to a PRE only if a bivalent monoclonal antibody is added, which appears to supply a dimerization function. The possibility exists that BUS and the DBD of PR are linked through intramolecular contacts so that the mechanisms of AF3 action may be quite different from those of AF1 and AF2. There is now compelling evidence that alterations in the three-dimensional structure of steroid receptors modifies their transcriptional behavior. Most of that work comes from analyses of the HBD. For example, using protease accessibility as a probe for receptor structure, it has been shown that PR (41Vegeto E. Allan G.F. Schrader W.T. Tsai M.-J. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and ER (42Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 814-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) assume altered conformational states when the HBD is occupied by agonists or antagonists. More recently, crystallographic analyses of the HBDs of unliganded RXRα (44Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375 (1995): 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) and liganded retinoic acid receptor γ (45Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) have yielded information about the position of residues critical to the function of AF2. These studies also show that binding of ligand alters the conformation of the HBD, which, depending on the ligand, may be interpreted as a positive or negative signal by the transcriptional machinery (41Vegeto E. Allan G.F. Schrader W.T. Tsai M.-J. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The present studies focus on the PR N terminus to explain functional differences between the two isoforms. As yet, nothing is known about the three-dimensional structure of the N termini of any nuclear receptor. This region is, however, structurally the most divergent among members of this family of proteins, suggesting that each receptor will take on unique N-terminal conformations that determine its specificity. We postulate that structural differences between the N termini of the two PR isoforms, due to the presence or absence of BUS, influence the functional role of IF. We are grateful to Pierre Chambon for the gift of pSG5-hPR1, hPR2, and MMTV-CAT, to David Toft for the gift of α266 antibody, to Roussel UCLAF for R5020, and to our colleague David Bain for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2054804874,"Voyager stereoimages of Euboea Montes, Io, indicate that this mountain formed when a large crustal block was uplifted 10.5 kilometers and tilted by approximately 6 degrees. Uplift triggered a massive slope failure on the northwest flank, forming one of the largest debris aprons in the solar system. This slope failure probably involved relatively unconsolidated layers totaling approximately 2 kilometers in thickness, overlying a rigid crust (or lithosphere) at least 11 kilometers thick. Mountain formation on Io may involve localized deep-rooted thrust faulting and block rotation, due to compression at depth induced during vertical recycling of Io's crust."
https://openalex.org/W2020724252,"We have assessed five signal transduction pathways to determine the role each might play in the malignant transformation of mammary epithelium initiated by neu, heregulin/NDF, TGFα, v-Ha-ras and c-myc in transgenic mice. The study involves a molecular and pharmacologic assessment of Erk/MAP kinase, Jnk/SAP kinase, PI 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and the Src-related kinases Lck and Fyn. Our results indicate that oncogenes capable of transforming mammary gland epithelium activate and require specific signal transduction pathways. For example, mammary tumors initiated by neu, v-Ha-ras and c-myc have high levels of active Erk/MAP kinase and their anchorage independent growth is strongly inhibited by PD098059, an inhibitor of Mek/MAP kinase kinase. By contrast, Erk/MAP kinase activity is weak in tumors initiated by TFGα and heregulin/NDF and the corresponding cell lines are not growth inhibited by PD098059. Similarly, PI 3-kinase is strongly activated in neu, TGFα and heregulin/NDF initiated tumor cell lines, but not in c-myc or v-Ha-ras initiated tumor cell lines. The anchorage independent growth of all these tumor cell lines are, however, inhibited by the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294001. Further illustrating this oncogene-based specificity, PP1, a specific inhibitor of the Src-like kinases, Lck and Fyn, blocks anchorage-independent cell growth only in the TGFα initiated mammary tumor cell line. Taken together with additional observations, we conclude that certain oncogenes reliably require the recruitment/activation of specific signal transduction pathways. Such specific relationships between the initiating oncogene and a required pathway may reflect a direct activating effect or the parallel activation of a pathway that is a necessary oncogenic collaborator for transformation in the mammary gland. The work points to a molecular basis for targeting therapy when an initiating oncogene can be implicated; for example, because of amplification, increased expression, genetic alteration, or heritable characteristics."

Four clones corresponded to genes induced specifically in the SCN by light, all of which showed gating of induction by the circadian clock. Among these genes are c- fos and nur77 , two of the five early-response genes known to be induced in the SCN by light, and egr-3 , a zinc finger transcription factor not previously identified in the SCN.

https://openalex.org/W1967730199,"The middle domain of plasma histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG) contains unusual tandem pentapeptide repeats (consensus G(H/P)(H/P)PH) and binds heparin and transition metals. Unlike other proteins that interact with heparin via lysine or arginine residues, HPRG relies exclusively on histidine residues for this interaction. To assess the consequences of this unusual requirement, we have studied the interaction between human plasma HPRG and immobilized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) using resonant mirror biosensor techniques. HPRG binding to immobilized heparin was strikingly pH-sensitive, producing a titration curve with a midpoint at pH 6.8. There was little binding of HPRG to heparin at physiological pH in the absence of metals, but the interaction was promoted by nanomolar concentrations of free zinc and copper, and its pH dependence was shifted toward alkaline pH by zinc. The affinity of HPRG for various GAGs measured in a competition assay decreased in the following order: heparin > dermatan sulfate > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate A. Binding of HPRG to immobilized dermatan sulfate had a midpoint at pH 6.5, was less influenced by zinc, and exhibited cooperativity. Importantly, plasminogen interacted specifically with GAG-bound HPRG. We propose that HPRG is a physiological pH sensor, interacting with negatively charged GAGs on cell surfaces only when it acquires a net positive charge by protonation and/or metal binding. This provides a mechanism to regulate the function of HPRG (the local pH) and rationalizes the role of its unique, conserved histidine-proline-rich domain. Thus, under conditions of local acidosis (e.g. ischemia or hypoxia), HPRG can co-immobilize plasminogen at the cell surface as well as compete for heparin with other proteins such as antithrombin. The middle domain of plasma histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG) contains unusual tandem pentapeptide repeats (consensus G(H/P)(H/P)PH) and binds heparin and transition metals. Unlike other proteins that interact with heparin via lysine or arginine residues, HPRG relies exclusively on histidine residues for this interaction. To assess the consequences of this unusual requirement, we have studied the interaction between human plasma HPRG and immobilized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) using resonant mirror biosensor techniques. HPRG binding to immobilized heparin was strikingly pH-sensitive, producing a titration curve with a midpoint at pH 6.8. There was little binding of HPRG to heparin at physiological pH in the absence of metals, but the interaction was promoted by nanomolar concentrations of free zinc and copper, and its pH dependence was shifted toward alkaline pH by zinc. The affinity of HPRG for various GAGs measured in a competition assay decreased in the following order: heparin > dermatan sulfate > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate A. Binding of HPRG to immobilized dermatan sulfate had a midpoint at pH 6.5, was less influenced by zinc, and exhibited cooperativity. Importantly, plasminogen interacted specifically with GAG-bound HPRG. We propose that HPRG is a physiological pH sensor, interacting with negatively charged GAGs on cell surfaces only when it acquires a net positive charge by protonation and/or metal binding. This provides a mechanism to regulate the function of HPRG (the local pH) and rationalizes the role of its unique, conserved histidine-proline-rich domain. Thus, under conditions of local acidosis (e.g. ischemia or hypoxia), HPRG can co-immobilize plasminogen at the cell surface as well as compete for heparin with other proteins such as antithrombin.

FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on its interactions with various ligands, HPRG has been proposed to be a regulator of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the immune response and to play a role in zinc transport. In vitro HPRG binds components of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, including heparin (3Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3803-3808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plasminogen (4Lijnen H.R. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10214-10222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fibrinogen (5Leung L.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); cells, viz. T-cells (6Saigo K. Shatsky M. Levitt L.J. Leung L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8249-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), macrophages (7Chang N.S. Leu R.W. Rummage J.A. Anderson J.K. Mole J.E. Immunology. 1992; 77: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar), and platelets (8Lerch P.G. Nydegger U.E. Kuyas C. Haeberli A. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 70: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); and small ligands, such as transition metal ions and heme (9Morgan W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 535: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No hypothesis of the function of HPRG has been able to rationalize these numerous interactions or explain how the activity of HPRG may be regulated in vivo. The most noteworthy feature of HPRG is a very high content of histidine, 13 mol %, concentrated in the central His-Pro-rich domain which contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence (GHHPH) repeated in tandem 12 times in human HPRG (10Koide T. Foster D. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the sequences GHPPH and GPPPH repeated 18 times in the rabbit protein (11Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the ionic charge of HPRG is exquisitely sensitive to pH in the range of pH 6–7, and an electrophoretic titration curve of rabbit HPRG showed that protonation of histidine side chains spans the physiological pH range, with the maximum change occurring between pH 6.5 and 7 (11Borza D.B. Tatum F.M. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Considering these observations, surprisingly little attention has been given to the effect of pH on the structure and function of HPRG. Histidine residues in the His-Pro-rich domain of HPRG mediate interactions with heparin (12Burch M.K. Blackburn M.N. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7477-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), transition metals, and heme (13Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1496-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Binding of HPRG to heparin and the subsequent neutralization of heparin's anticoagulant effect have obvious pharmacological interest. An analysis of proteins from normal human plasma that bound to immobilized heparin indicated that HPRG was the only protein likely to inhibit anticoagulant activity by direct competition with antithrombin (14Zamniit A. Pepper D.S. Dawes J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although several plasma proteins display this ability in purified systems. Interaction of heparin with heparin-binding proteins is largely electrostatic but requires lysine or arginine side chains in other known cases. It is thus noteworthy that histidine residues are responsible for HPRG binding to heparin, and this leads to the immediate prediction that protonation of histidine side chains at low pH or binding of transition metals such as zinc, which also bestows positive charge on the His-Pro-rich domain, will strengthen heparin binding to HPRG. Indeed, inhibition by HPRG of the heparin-catalyzed thrombin-antithrombin reaction is modulated by pH (15Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or zinc (16Kluszynski B.A. Kim C. Faulk W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13541-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the stoichiometry of the heparin-HPRG interaction is shifted from 1:1 to 1:2 at low pH or in the presence of zinc and copper (12Burch M.K. Blackburn M.N. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7477-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we characterize directly and quantitatively the modulation by pH and transition metals of HPRG-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions, and we propose a new paradigm of the function of HPRG based on these data. We suggest that the unique, conserved His-Pro-rich domain is a pH sensor, providing a plausible mechanism for regulating HPRG's activity and an approach to understanding its physiological role. In this model, when the local pH drops (e.g. in ischemia or hypoxia) histidine side chains of HPRG are protonated, the His-Pro-rich domain becomes positively charged, and hence HPRG binds strongly to negatively charged GAGs on cell surfaces. As a consequence ligands of HPRG such as plasminogen can be co-immobilized at the cell surface, and other GAG-binding proteins like antithrombin may be displaced. Porcine intestinal mucosa heparin, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates A and C were purchased from Sigma, and low molecular mass (5 kDa) heparin was from Calbiochem. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-heparin conjugate (Sigma) contained an average of 3.4 mol of heparin/mol of BSA coupled to the amino groups of the protein via the reducing ends. Bovine aorta dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DSPG) was purchased from Becton Dickinson. Other commercial reagents were the highest quality available, and all buffers and stock solutions were prepared with water treated with a Barnstead Nanopure system. Human HPRG was isolated from human plasma (Kansas City Community Blood Center) by metal-chelate affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetate (NTA) agarose. 2C. Saez and W. T. Morgan, submitted for publication. Briefly, 10 volumes of human plasma containing 5 mm imidazole were applied to 1 volume of Ni-NTA agarose and washed sequentially with 1 volume each of 20 and 80 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5m sodium chloride, followed by 1 volume of 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, containing 0.15 msodium chloride. HPRG was then eluted with 250 mmimidazole, pH 7.5. In the absence of the low pH wash, human HPRG preparations exhibited proteolytic fragments upon storage. HPRG containing fractions were pooled, made 1 mm in EDTA to remove traces of metals introduced during the purification procedure, concentrated with Amicon centricon tubes, extensively dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and frozen in aliquots at −90 °C. Rabbit HPRG was isolated as described (17Lamb-Wharton R.J. Morgan W.T. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit HPRG antibodies were purified by passing the IgG fraction of polyclonal goat antiserum through an affinity column of rabbit HPRG immobilized on AffiGel-15 (Bio-Rad; 8 mg HPRG/ml gel), followed by elution with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and immediate neutralization with Tris base. Plasminogen and antithrombin were purified by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose (18Castellino F.I. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 90: 365-378Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and heparin-agarose (19Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1983; 50: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), respectively. GAGs were coupled to hydrophobic, flat amino-silane cuvettes (Affinity Sensors, Paramus, NJ). Before coupling, these cuvettes exhibited no nonspecific binding of HPRG under any experimental condition used in this paper, in contrast to virgin carboxyl-dextran cuvettes which bound HPRG nonspecifically below pH 6.3 and therefore were not used. Heparin-BSA or DSPG at 0.2 mg/ml in 15 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm sodium chloride were allowed to react for 30 min with cuvettes previously activated with polymeric glutaraldehyde as suggested by the manufacturer. Coupling using the lysine side chains of the protein moiety optimized immobilization since the GAG moiety was not affected and ligand heterogeneity was reduced. The binding capacity of GAG surfaces for HPRG varied with pH. For instance, although there was no detectable HPRG binding to heparin-BSA at pH 8, maximal binding of an estimated 1.0–1.8 molecules of HPRG per heparin chain was achieved at pH 5.3 (the lower value assumes no heparin contribution to the refractive index of the conjugate and the higher value assumes an equal contribution of heparin and albumin). Dermatan sulfate at 4 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride was coupled to amino-silane cuvettes via its reducing ends by reductive amination in the presence of 50 mm sodium cyanoborohydride. This surface yielded results similar to those obtained with immobilized DSPG although its maximum binding capacity for HPRG was somewhat lower. Binding data were collected with a thermostatted IAsys resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors). All experiments were carried out at 23 °C and maximum stirring rate in Pipes-buffered saline (PiBS), 10 mm Pipes, 140 mm sodium chloride, 0.005% Tween 20. The buffer also contained 0.2 mm NTA except when other chelators were used as described in the text or figure legends. The various metal salts were added to yield the calculated free metal concentrations noted (see below). Pipes was chosen since it can be used in the pH range 5.5–7.5 and does not interact appreciably with transition metals. After each binding/dissociation cycle, the GAG surface was regenerated by a brief wash (5–15 s) with 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 9.5, 1m sodium chloride, 0.2 mm EDTA. Further demonstrating the specificity of interaction, excess soluble heparin completely inhibited binding of HPRG to immobilized heparin. Most experiments were carried out using both human and rabbit HPRG, and no significant differences were found. The results shown are those obtained with the human protein, unless otherwise indicated. Chelators were used to buffer the metal ion concentration throughout this work since, in the presence of a metal buffer, the free metal concentration can be (a) controlled to prevent undesirable side effects; (b) varied over a broad range by changing the chelator and the metal:chelator ratio; (c) calculated from the stability constants; and (d) made less dependent on the presence of HPRG since the metal ion is in large excess and mostly complexed with the chelator. Free metal ion concentrations were calculated as described (20Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Buffers for pH and Metal Ion Control. 2nd Ed. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1983: 94-102Google Scholar), using the stability constants and pKa values from the same reference. In the presence of an excess of ligands like NTA or citrate that form 1:1 complexes with metals, pM = −log M ≅ log β − log αL − log([M]T/([L]T − [M]T)), where pM is the negative log of the free metal ion concentration; β is the stability constant of the metal-chelator complex; αL is [L]T/[L] ≅ 1 + exp(pKa − pH) and accounts for ligand protonation, and the subscript T denotes the total concentration of metal or ligand used. A pH-independent metal buffer system (20Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Buffers for pH and Metal Ion Control. 2nd Ed. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1983: 94-102Google Scholar) was prepared by adding an excess of calcium chloride (1 mm) to 0.2 mm NTA, and under these conditions: [M]/[M]T ≅ βCa(([Ca]T − [L]T)/βM ([L]T− [M]T)). Generally in biosensor experiments the ligand “A” is in great excess over immobilized ligand “B.” Thus, the ideal binding progress curve for monovalent binding (assuming no transport limitation and homogeneous binding sites) can be described by the integrated rate equation as follows: Rt = Req(1 − exp(−kon t)), whereRt is the baseline-corrected biosensor response,Req is the response at equilibrium, and kon is the pseudo-first order on-rate (21Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Since kon = ka [A] +kd, the linear plot of kon versus [A] has the association and dissociation rate constants, ka and kd, as the slope and the y intercept, respectively. The equilibrium constant (Kd) can be obtained as the ratio kd/ka or by fitting the equilibrium response “R” to a binding isotherm: r = Rmax[A]/(Kd + [A]), whereRmax represents the total binding sites. The amount of HPRG bound at equilibrium to immobilized heparin at physiological ionic strength was markedly influenced by pH (Fig. 1 A). A plot of the amount of HPRG bound at equilibrium versus pH resembles an acid-base titration curve with human HPRG having a pKa of 6.8, near that of histidine (Fig. 1 B). HPRG treated with excess diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) to chemically modify histidine residues (22Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) does not bind, supporting the importance of histidine in the interaction with heparin (12Burch M.K. Blackburn M.N. Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7477-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Binding of heparin-BSA to immobilized HPRG also showed marked pH dependence with a mid-point at pH 6.5 (not shown). In contrast, binding of antithrombin to heparin was much less dependent on pH (Fig. 1 B) and exhibited a lower maximum binding, probably due to the preference of antithrombin for a specific pentasaccharide sequence, whereas HPRG is more indiscriminate. To examine HPRG binding to heparin under conditions more like those found in vivo, rabbit serum (diluted 20-fold) was added to the immobilized heparin cuvette at different pH values, followed by affinity purified anti-rabbit HPRG IgG (which does not bind in the absence of serum) (Fig. 2). An increase in signal due to the specific binding of IgG to HPRG already bound to heparin is observed at pH 6.7 and to a limited extent at, but not above, pH 7.0, in good agreement with the results obtained with the purified system (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Binding of rabbit serum proteins to immobilized heparin at different pH values. Serum was diluted 20-fold in PiBS-NTA, and then affinity purified anti-rabbit HPRG IgG was added at the time indicated by the arrow. Binding to immobilized heparin-BSA was measured as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The influence of various transition metal ions on HPRG binding to heparin in the presence of iminodiacetate buffer at physiological pH is depicted in Fig. 3 A. Transition metals bound by HPRG augment the affinity of the protein for heparin at physiological pH. Zinc and copper, 10–20 μm in plasma, are more effective than nickel or cobalt, whereas metals not bound by HPRG (9Morgan W.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 535: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) like manganese, calcium, and magnesium (not shown) do not promote HPRG binding to heparin. The effects of metals on the binding of HPRG to heparin were also assessed in the presence of citrate or NTA (Fig. 3 B), since the formation of a 1:1 metal-chelator complex simplifies the computation of free metal concentration and since the amount of HPRG-metal complex formed ultimately depends on the concentration of free metal and the affinity of the interaction. The importance of the free metal concentration is demonstrated by the position of the curves representing zinc-mediated binding. Although the Zn(II) concentrations yielding equal HPRG binding in the different buffers were within 0.3 log units (a factor of 2), the corresponding total zinc concentrations differed by more than 60-fold (between 1.2 and 75 μm). It is also notable that the concentration of free metal required to produce half-maximal binding of HPRG to heparin is about 1 nm for copper and 10 nm for zinc, well below the previously published affinity of HPRG for these metals, 10 μm (23Morgan W.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We attribute this difference to the electrostatic concentration of divalent cations in the vicinity of the negatively charged heparin surface. Treatment of HPRG with excess DEPC abolishes both the pH- and zinc-dependent interactions, indicating that histidine residues are necessary for both. In fact, the two binding modes appear to be facets of the same phenomenon, as suggested by experiments carried out at various pH and zinc concentrations (Fig. 4). At pH 6.5, when most of the histidine residues are protonated, binding of HPRG to heparin is maximal, and the presence of zinc has no further effect. Conversely, at pH 7.4 most of the histidine residues are unprotonated, and binding to heparin is directly dependent on zinc concentration. At intermediate pH values, both protonation of histidine and binding of zinc each contribute to the net positive charge of HPRG, and the overall effect is a shift of the binding curves to more alkaline pH which is proportional to the metal concentration. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the HPRG-heparin interaction were determined at experimental pH and free Zn(II) values that yielded the same amount of bound HPRG, viz. about half of the maximum binding capacity. In addition to analyzing individual progress curves by conventional means, Kd values were measured using an equilibrium titration method (Fig. 5 A) that simplifies the experimental design and requires smaller amounts of protein (24Hall D.R. Winzor D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar affinities were measured by both equilibrium methods (Table I), and the Kd values from pH-induced (37–44 nm) and metal-induced (45–53 nm) binding experiments were not significantly different. These results are in excellent agreement with Kdvalues previously determined by fluorescence titrations, 53–57 nm (15Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 60 nm (12Burch M.K. Blackburn M.N. Morgan W.T.

Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The plot for zinc-dependent binding of HPRG to heparin is linear, yielding ka and kd values of 4.5 × 105m−1 s−1 and 2.5 × 10−2 s−1, respectively. The Kd values obtained by kinetic and thermodynamic means were in agreement and are very close to those obtained for the interaction between heparin and acidic fibroblast growth factor (26Mach H. Volkin D.B. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Linhardt R.J. Fromm J.R. Loganathan D. Mattsson L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5480-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In neither case could kd be measured directly from the dissociation phase due to rebinding. The relative affinities of HPRG for various GAGs were assessed by competition experiments, in which HPRG was added to solutions containing increasing concentrations of GAGs in PIBS buffer at pH 6.8 (Fig. 6). The concentration of GAG at which 50% of HPRG binding to immobilized heparin is inhibited is proportional to the affinity of HPRG for the added GAG. It can be shown that the relative amount of HPRG bound is given by the following:B/Bmax = (1 + [HPRG]/Khep)/(1 + [HPRG]/Khep + [GAG]/KGAG). Since the concentration of HPRG used (50 nm) was approximately equal to its affinity for immobilized heparin, Khep, 50% inhibition by a GAG was exerted at a concentration about twice the affinity of HPRG for that GAG, KGAG. Consistent with the electrostatic nature of the HPRG-GAG interaction, heparin, a highly sulfated form of heparan sulfate, binds to HPRG more strongly than any other GAG tested. The inhibition experiments yielded an affinity of HPRG for heparin of about 60 nm, comparable with the Kd obtained directly, and the affinity for the low molecular weight heparin was somewhat lower, about 300 nm. Dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate (with average mass 12 and 10 kDa, respectively) had affinities of 8 and 16 μm, respectively, whereas chondroitin sulfates A and C did not interact significantly with HPRG, despite having similar charge densities. The GAGs bound by HPRG (heparin, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate) all contain iduronic acid, a residue thought to enhance protein binding by increasing conformational flexibility of GAGs (27Casu B. Petitou M. Provasoli M. Sinay P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In view of the strong pH and zinc dependence of HPRG binding to heparin, how these factors affect the interaction between HPRG and GAGs which occur on cell surfaces was of interest. Dermatan sulfate, the most effective competitor of HPRG binding to heparin tested, was immobilized onto amino silane cuvettes either by reductive amination via its reducing ends or via lysine side chains in dermatan sulfate proteoglygan (DSPG). As shown in Fig. 7 A, the interaction between HPRG and DSPG was also pH-dependent, with the mid-points of the titration curve at pH 6.5 for human HPRG and at pH 6.3 for rabbit HPRG both being somewhat lower than seen for the HPRG-heparin interaction (pH 6.8, Fig. 1 B). Binding of both human and rabbit HPRG to immobilized dermatan sulfate exhibited a mid-point at pH 6.5, and the titration curve was somewhat broader than for DSPG (data not shown). The acidic shift of the titration curves of HPRG binding to a dermatan sulfate surface relative to a heparin surface is not surprising in view of the electrostatic nature of the interaction: since dermatan sulfate has a lower negative charge density than heparin, a larger increase in the positive charge of HPRG is needed and is achieved at lower pH. The effect of zinc on the binding of HPRG to DSPG was also examined using a pH-independent metal buffer (Fig. 7 A). Although zinc shifted the pH dependence of the interaction toward alkaline pH, the concentrations required for this effect were an order of magnitude higher than those seen with immobilized heparin (Fig. 4). For example, a free Zn(II) concentration of 250 nm was required to achieve half-maximal binding of human HPRG to DSPG in PiBS buffer at pH 6.8 (data not shown), i.e. 25-fold higher than that needed for heparin binding. Several of the following explanations for the reduced zinc influence are possible: first, since a larger positive charge is needed on HPRG to bind to DSPG, saturation of lower affinity zinc binding sites may be required; second, zinc coordinates with unprotonated histidine residues so that the affinity of HPRG for zinc decreases with pH; third, since the degree of saturation of HPRG with zinc may depend not only on the bulk concentration of free zinc but also on the electrostatically concentrated zinc near the negatively charged surface, the latter effect would be smaller with the less charged GAGs. Interestingly, the binding of both human and rabbit HPRG to DSPG and to dermatan sulfate showed strong positive cooperativity (Fig. 7 B), with a Hill coefficient of about 3.5. This effect was also apparent in the shape of the association curves, which increased almost linearly with time and precluded a classic kinetic analysis of the binding data. The concentration of human HPRG yielding half-maximal binding was about 50 nm on dermatan sulfate immobilized by reductive amination and about 70 nm on DSPG (Fig. 7 B). The cooperativity may well be caused by a change in the conformation of dermatan sulfate induced upon binding the first HPRG molecules, e.g. an “opening” of the GAG structure to make it more accessible for binding subsequent HPRG molecules. An important question is whether HPRG bound to surface GAGs may in turn bind and co-immobilize other ligands. For instance, HPRG immobilized onto nickel chelate plates, but not soluble HPRG, strongly accelerates plasminogen activation by tissue plasminogen activator (28Borza D.-B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5718-5726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 A shows that plasminogen indeed specifically associates with heparin-bound HPRG in a manner that is completely and selectively inhibited by ε-aminocaproic acid (an inhibitor of the plasminogen-HPRG interaction). These GAG-HPRG-plasminogen “sandwiches” can form since the binding sites of HPRG for heparin (the His-Pro-rich domain) and plasminogen (the N/C domain) are different (28Borza D.-B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5718-5726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Control experiments confirmed that plasminogen binding to the heparin surface is mediated by HP"

Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in more than half of human cancers. Of 5000 mutations documented, about 85% are missense mutations and greater than 95% are found in the DNA-binding core domain. Ectopic expression of wild type p53 in cells with p53 null mutations suppresses cell growth; expression of oncogenic forms does not (1Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, oncogenic forms of p53 inhibit the ability of wild type p53 to stimulate reporter genes (2Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Human tumors frequently express large amounts of p53 antigen. Mice homozygous for p53 null mutations develop normally but show a high tumor incidence (3Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.S. McArthur Jr, M.J. C. A.M. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). These and other results suggest that although p53 null mutations are oncogenic, oncogenicity is most frequently due to dominant negative mutations that result in production of a defective p53 that interferes with the function of wild type p53. It is becoming increasingly clear that cancer results from defects in cell cycle control. Our understanding of cell cycle control derives largely from work first initiated in yeast. All eucaryotic cells have cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviation used is: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase. 1The abbreviation used is: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase. that initiate and orchestrate the transition from one cell cycle compartment to the next. In addition to CDKs, all cells have checkpoint systems that prevent CDKs from initiating the next cell cycle phase until critical processes in the current phase are complete (4Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). One major checkpoint mechanism is mediated by a set of proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which bind and inactivate CDKs. In both yeast and mammalian systems, initiation of S phase is delayed when G1 cells are UV-irradiated. In mammalian cells lacking p53 (or in cells with dominant negative p53), the delay in S phase does not occur, and cells enter S phase with damaged DNA. If wild type p53 is present, the cells enter S phase only when the damage is repaired, or, if the damage is too severe, the cells undergo apoptosis. The discovery that p53 stimulates transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene CIP1, which encodes a G1 cyclin/CDK inhibitor, in response to DNA damage provides a molecular understanding of the basis for S phase delay. The CIP1 upstream region contains a p53-binding site, and accumulation of Cip1 activity and cell cycle arrest in irradiated cells requires wild type p53 (5Dulik V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Although yeast does not contain a p53 gene, the similarity of cell cycle control mechanisms and transcriptional mechanisms in all eucaryotic organisms prompted investigators to ask whether human p53 was active in yeast. p53 binds the consensus RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY (6Funk W.D.

Reporter genes equipped with multiple copies of the consensus site are stimulated by ectopic expression of p53 not only in mammalian cells (2Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22556-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) screened for yeast mutations that created a requirement for human p53. They identified a gene, termed RFP1 (requires fifty-threeprotein), that results in cell cycle arrest at G2/M when inactivated. Thiagalingam et al. (8Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6062-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) screened for yeast mutations that prevented p53 transactivation of a p53-responsive LacZ reporter gene. Using one of the obtained mutants, they identified a high copy suppressor, termed PAK1(p53activatingkinase), that encoded a protein with protein kinase motifs. They did not establish that Pak1 actually phosphorylated p53. Nigroet al. (10Nigro J.M. Sikorski R. Reed S.I. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) investigated whether overexpression of p53 blocked cell cycle progression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a high copy plasmid and a galactose-inducible promoter they did not observe significant inhibition of growth by p53. However, by using a protease-deficient strain and by cotransforming with a plasmid encoding the human CDK p34cdc2, they showed that human p53 strongly inhibited yeast growth. Although human p34cdc2 was required to see strong growth inhibition by p53, it did not affect the phosphorylation state of p53 protein, suggesting that p34cdc2 acted indirectly, presumably by phosphorylating other yeast proteins. The above studies were done with the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. A recent study, done with the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, prompted our investigation of the involvement of thioredoxin reductase in p53 activity. Casso and Beach (11Casso D. Beach D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 518-529PubMed Google Scholar) found that high level expression of p53 in S. pombe arrested cell growth. A mutant circumventing growth arrest was identified, and the wild type gene, a homolog of thioredoxin reductase, was cloned by complementation. To determine whether the S. pombe results reflected a conserved mechanism whereby the ability of p53 to stimulate transcription requires thioredoxin reductase activity, the effect of deleting the thioredoxin reductase gene on p53-dependent reporter gene expression was investigated in the evolutionarily distant organism S. cerevisiae. The results showed that the transactivating activity of p53 in budding yeast also required thioredoxin reductase. The data suggest that p53 may be subject to redox regulation. Yeast strain MY301 (mat-a ade2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 Δtrr1:HIS3 bar1) was derived by crossing MY199 (12Machado A.K. Morgan B.A. Merrill G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17045-17054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to W303–1 (13Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and serially backcrossing Δtrr1:HIS3 segregants to W303–1 or SY2626 (a bar1 derivative of W303-1). Inheritance of the Δtrr1:HIS3 allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis and hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. MY301 was temperature-sensitive for growth and auxotrophic for methionine. Yeast carrying effector and reporter plasmids were derived and grown at 25 °C in minimal medium consisting of yeast nitrogen broth, 2% glucose, and required supplements. pRS314, pRS315, and pRS316 are ARS/CEN vectors marked respectively with TRP1, LEU2, and URA3 (14Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing thioredoxin reductase (pRS316-TRR1) was derived by inserting a 2.3-kilobase pairEcoRI fragment containing the TRR1 coding region and flanking regions into pRS316. The plasmid expressing human p53 from the yeast PGK promoter (pRS314-p53, formerly called pRS314-PGK-SN) and the plasmid carrying the p53-responsive reporter gene (pRS315-β-gal, formerly called pRS315-PG-β-gal) were obtained from S. Thiagalingam et al. (8Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6062-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described by Kippert (15Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Let. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) using the liquid nitrogen freezing/sodium lauroyl sarcosinate method. Results are expressed as nmol o-nitrophenol generated per 30-min incubation normalized to 107 cells (1 A420 = 222 nmol o-nitrophenol/ml). Values are the means ± the S.D. of the indicated number of transformants each assayed in quadruplicate. Cells (109) were washed with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), and the cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were disrupted by grinding frozen pellets, with frequent additions of liquid nitrogen, in a mortar with a pestle until less than 5% intact cells remained. Disrupted cells were diluted with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 140 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 40 mm EDTA, pH 6.8), heated to 100 °C for 3 min and centrifuged (12,000 ×g) for 15 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined by the Bradford method (16Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Total yeast proteins (8 μg) were resolved on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with p53 (DO-1) mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-β-galactosidase mouse monoclonal antibody (Promega) at dilutions of 1:10,000. Decorated proteins were visualized using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Life Science) with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. X-ray films of the blots were scanned and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Prompted by the work implicating thioredoxin reductase in the growth-inhibitory and transactivational action of p53 in S. pombe (11Casso D. Beach D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 518-529PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of thioredoxin reductase gene mutations on p53 transcriptional activity in S. cerevisiae. A plasmid encoding a p53-responsive LacZ reporter gene (pRS315-β-gal) and an effector plasmid encoding human p53 under the control of the constitutive PGK promoter (pRS314-p53) were introduced into strains that carried either a wild type (TRR1) or a null (Δtrr1) allele of the gene encoding thioredoxin reductase. Table Isummarizes the results of the β-galactosidase assays. Reporter gene expression was high in transformants of the TRR1 strain. In contrast, Δtrr1 transformants had more than 10-fold lower but nevertheless detectable levels of β-galactosidase activity. Furthermore, reporter gene activity required p53 expression because β-galactosidase activity could not be detected in transformants of either the wild type strain or the null mutant strain when the p53-effector plasmid was replaced with the empty pRS314 vector.Table IDeletion of TRR1 inhibits p53-dependent reporter gene expressionStrainGenotypePlasmid1-aIn addition to the indicated plasmid, all transformants contained the p53-responsive LacZ reporter plasmid pRS315-β-gal.β-Galactosidase activityW303TRR1pRS314-p53487 ± 212 (10)1-bNumber of transformants assayed.W303TRR1pRS314not detected (4)MY301Δtrr1pRS314-p53 43 ± 9 (4)MY301Δtrr1pRS314not detected (4)1-a In addition to the indicated plasmid, all transformants contained the p53-responsive LacZ reporter plasmid pRS315-β-gal.1-b Number of transformants assayed. Open table in a new tab We next investigated whether the TRR1 gene carried on a single copy plasmid could rescue strong reporter gene expression in the Δtrr1 strain. Either a plasmid expressing thioredoxin reductase (pRS316-TRR1) or the empty vector (pRS316) was introduced together with p53-expressing effector (pRS314-p53) and p53-responsiveLacZ reporter (pRS315-β-gal) plasmids into the null mutant strain. The results of the β-galactosidase assays are summarized in Table II. Ectopic expression of thioredoxin reductase from the single copy TRR1 gene carried on the plasmid restored high levels of β-galactosidase activity in transformants of the Δtrr1 strain. When the plasmid expressing thioredoxin reductase was replaced with the empty pRS316 vector, more than 10-fold lower reporter gene expression was again found in transformants of the null mutant strain. Therefore, p53-dependent reporter gene expression required a functional S. cerevisiae thioredoxin reductase gene.Table IIEctopically supplied thioredoxin reductase restores p53-dependent reporter gene expression in MY301 (Δtrr1) yeastPlasmid2-aIn addition to the indicated plasmid, all transformants contained the p53-expressing effector plasmid pRS314-p53 and the p53-responsive LacZ reporter plasmid pRS315-β-gal.β-Galactosidase activitypRS316-TRR1205 ± 80 (4)2-bNumber of transformants assayed.pRS31615 ± 8 (3)2-a In addition to the indicated plasmid, all transformants contained the p53-expressing effector plasmid pRS314-p53 and the p53-responsive LacZ reporter plasmid pRS315-β-gal.2-b Number of transformants assayed. Open table in a new tab The observation that p53 cannot transactivate a p53-responsive reporter gene in yeast lacking thioredoxin reductase could have two basic explanations. In the absence of thioredoxin reductase, either the steady state levels of p53 protein could be reduced or the activity of p53 itself could be inhibited. To invesigate the effect of the Δtrr1 mutation on the amount of p53 protein in S. cerevisiae, p53 levels were determined by immunoblot analysis as shown in Fig. 1 A. The wild typeTRR1 strain transformed with (lanes 1–3) or without (lane 4) the p53-expressing effector plasmid served respectively as positive and negative controls for the Western blot assay. Quantitative densitometry established that two Δtrr1 transformants lacking thioredoxin reductase (lanes 6 and 8) had just as high or higher p53 protein levels as two other Δtrr1 transformants ectopically expressing thioredoxin reductase (lanes 5 and 7). Because p53 protein levels clearly remained unaffected in the absence of thioredoxin reductase, it is the ability of p53 to act as a transcriptional activator, not the amount of p53 proteinper se, that is down-regulated in the Δtrr1mutant. To exclude the possibility that the lack of thioredoxin reductase in the Δtrr1 strain might interfere with assays for the enzymatic activity of β-galactosidase, the levels of β-galactosidase protein were also determined by immunoblot analysis as shown in Fig. 1 B. Quantitative densitometry established that the two Δtrr1 transformants ectopically expressing thioredoxin reductase (lanes 1 and 3) had more than 10-fold higher β-galactosidase protein levels than the two other Δtrr1 transformants lacking thioredoxin reductase (lanes 2 and 4), in good agreement with the enzymatic assays (Table II). The results presented here show that transactivation of a β-galactosidase reporter gene by human p53 was markedly inhibited in a S. cerevisiae Δtrr1 mutant lacking thioredoxin reductase. Ectopic expression of thioredoxin reductase from a single copy plasmid in the Δtrr1 mutant circumvented the inhibition and restored strong p53-dependent transactivation. Inhibition of reporter gene expression was not due to diminished amounts of p53 protein. Because thioredoxin reductase was also found necessary for p53 activity in S. pombe (11Casso D. Beach D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 518-529PubMed Google Scholar), an organism estimated to be separated evolutionarily from S. cerevisiae by one billion years, the thioredoxin reductase requirement likely reflects a conserved mechanism also operating in humans. Thioredoxin reductase is a protein disulfide reductase. Our results thus suggest that p53 can form disulfides and that these disulfides must be reduced in order for the protein to function as a transcription factor. Recent biochemical experiments have shown that the pharmacological application of oxidizing and reducing agents can modulate the biological activities of murine (17Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and human (18Verhaegh G.W. Richard M.-J. Hainaut P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5699-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) p53. In particular, treatment of p53 with reducing agents enhances sequence-specific DNA binding (17Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Human p53 is a tetrameric phosphoprotein. The 393-residue polypeptide contains five conserved regions (I-V) that are nearly identical in all vertebrates analyzed. Biochemical and reverse genetic experiments have defined three functional domains. The proline-rich, acidic N-terminal domain (residues 1–43) contains conserved region I, has been shown to interact with TATA-binding protein, and is involved in transcriptional activation. The large, central core domain (residues 100–300) contains conserved regions II–V, is involved in DNA binding, and is the location of almost all oncogenic p53 mutations. The basic C-terminal domain (residues 320–360) contains nuclear localization signals and is involved in p53 tetramerization. X-ray diffraction and NMR structures of the core domain and oligomerization domain, respectively, have been determined (19Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar, 20Clore G.M. Omichinski J.G. Sakaguchi K. Zambrano N. Sakamoto H. Apella E. Gronnenborn A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The core domain is tightly folded and resembles NF-κB in having nine β structures arranged in two sheets. A tetrahedrally coordinated zinc atom holds two loops, L2 and L3, such that a critical Arg residue in L3 contacts bases in the minor groove. A loop-sheet-helix structure contacts bases in the major groove. As depicted in Fig. 2, the core domain of human p53 has five surface cysteines. If a particular Cys-to-Ser mutation were to result in a p53 protein that no longer required thioredoxin reductase for activity, it would constitute strong evidence that the cysteine normally resident at the site is prone to oxidation and that thioredoxin reductase keeps the cysteine reduced and the protein active. The role of cysteine residues in the regulation of murine p53 activity has been investigated by Rainwater et al. (17Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cys-to-Ser mutations at Cys173 or Cys239 (corresponding to human Cys176 and Cys242) abolish DNA binding, transactivation of reporter gene expression, and tumor suppression. These two cysteines are critical for coordinating zinc and stabilizing the structures of loops L2 and L3. In contrast, Cys-to-Ser mutations at Cys179 or Cys274 (corresponding to human Cys182 and Cys277) have little or no effect on the biological activities of p53, but these mutants were not further tested to see if treatment with reducing agents was still required for enhanced sequence-specific DNA binding of p53. Evidence for redox control of p53 activity has broad implications. At present, it is not clear how the activity of p53 is regulated. Redox regulation offers a new paradigm for control of transcription factor activity that compliments other mechanisms involving phosphorylation (21Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18165-18174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and acetylation (22Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Reduction of disulfides might be part of the mechanism by which p53 is activated as a transcription factor by DNA damage. Alternatively, oxidation of thiols may be part of the mechanism by which p53 is inactivated once damaged DNA has been repaired and it is appropriate for cells to enter S phase. Evidence suggestive of redox control of transcription factor activity has been obtained for NF-κB (23Toledano M.B. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The three elementary forms of this enzyme are the neuronal (NOS-I or nNOS), endothelial (NOS-III or eNOS), and inducible (NOS-II or iNOS) isoforms. Heme, FMN, FAD, CaM, and H4B are essential as cofactors, and NADPH and O2 are essential as co-substrates for all the NOS isoforms. Each subunit of the homodimeric NOS proteins is composed of three modules: a heme-containing catalytic domain, a consensus CaM binding sequence, and an FMN-, FAD-, and NADPH binding domain with strong sequence similarity to cytochrome P450 reductase (6Bredt D.S.

H4B is required for ·NO synthesis by all three proteins, but its role in the catalytic process remains unclear (9Mayer B. Werner E.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Clear differences exist in the Ca2+ and CaM dependence of the three NOS isoforms. The binding of CaM to nNOS and eNOS, the two constitutive isoforms, is Ca2+-dependent and reversible (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), whereas the binding of CaM to iNOS is essentially a Ca2+-independent, irreversible process (12Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic activities of nNOS and eNOS are regulated by cellular Ca2+-levels, whereas the activity of iNOS is insensitive to the Ca2+ concentration and is primarily regulated by the rate at which the protein is synthesized (12Cho H.J.

In addition to the heme, CaM, and reductase domains common to all the isoforms, nNOS has an additional N-terminal domain thought to be involved in subcellular targeting (13Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 102-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), and eNOS is unique in that it has myristoylation and palmitoylation sites that target it to the membrane (15Liu J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11691-11694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of the NOS isoforms differ considerably, regardless of whether activity is measured as ·NO formation or cytochrome c reduction. Regardless of which of these two parameters is measured, the activities of iNOS and nNOS are considerably higher than that of eNOS. Thus, in our hands, the Vmax values for ·NO formation by recombinant iNOS (17Gerber N.C. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), nNOS (18Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and eNOS (19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were found to be ∼800, ∼400, and ∼130 nmol min−1 mg−1, respectively, and the rates of electron transfer to cytochrome c in the presence of CaM and Ca2+ were ∼45,000, ∼44,000, and ∼1,800 nmol min−1 mg−1, respectively. In each case, the reductase domain was able to transfer electrons to cytochrome c at a rate much greater than the maximum rate of ·NO production, although the nature of the rate-limiting step(s) in ·NO formation and the reason(s) for the differences in the catalytic activities of the isoforms are unclear. The reduction of cytochromec by nNOS and eNOS occurs in the absence of CaM and Ca2+, but the rate is greatly stimulated by the binding of these cofactors (20Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of iNOS, the cytochromec reductase activity is not Ca2+-dependent. Expression of truncated eNOS and nNOS proteins consisting only of the CaM binding and reductase domains has confirmed that the CaM/Ca2+ activation of electron transfer to cytochrome c does not require the heme domain (22McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

The specific protein interactions that result in quasi-irreversible binding of CaM to iNOS but not nNOS or eNOS have not been defined. Chimeras in which mouse iNOS residues 503–532 were exchanged with the equivalent residues 725–754 of rat nNOS differed from the parent proteins in that both required an intermediate concentration of Ca2+ to bind CaM and produce ·NO (25Ruan J. Xie Q. Hutchinson N. Cho H. Wolfe G.C. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22679-22686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, truncation analysis of iNOS suggested that residues within the sequence 484–726 that lie outside the canonical CaM binding sequence are required for Ca2+-independent CaM binding. In an independent study, Venema et al. (26Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6435-6440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) replaced the CaM binding domain of murine iNOS with that of bovine eNOS and vice versa. The NOS activity of the iNOS chimera proved to be partially Ca2+-dependent, whereas the eNOS chimera was CaM-independent but completely Ca2+-dependent. These results again suggest that the tight, essentially Ca2+-independent binding of CaM requires interactions in addition to those provided by the consensus iNOS CaM binding sequence. In contrast, surface plasmon resonance studies of the binding to CaM of peptides derived from the CaM binding domains of nNOS and iNOS led to the conclusion that the affinity of iNOS for CaM resides entirely in the CaM binding canonical sequence (27Zoche M. Bienert M. Beyermann M. Koch K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8742-8747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To identify contributions of the individual domains of the NOS polypeptide to (a) the differences in the rates of ·NO production by the three isoforms, (b) the basis for the Ca2+-independent binding of CaM in iNOS, and (c) the effects of l-Arg and H4B on electron transfer rates, we constructed, expressed, and purified two chimeric proteins. In these chimeric proteins, the heme and CaM binding domains were contributed by either eNOS or iNOS, and the reductase domain by nNOS. Bovine eNOS (7Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Zeng D.

Snyder (Johns Hopkins University), respectively. A mouse iNOS cDNA was provided by Stephen Black (University of California, San Francisco). The mouse iNOS was cloned into the pCWori vector and expressed and purified as described for the human hepatic iNOS isoform (17Gerber N.C. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The human CaM gene (28Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was provided by Emanuel E. Strehler (Mayo Foundation). Enzymes used in DNA manipulation were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). l-Arg was from Aldrich, H4B was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), and HEPES was buffer from Fisher. Bradford protein assay kits were from Bio-Rad. Recombinant human CaM was purified from Escherichia coli by published procedures (28Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DNA purification kits and Ni2+-NTA agarose were purchased from QIAGEN (Chatsworth, CA). BL21 competent cells were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were from Sigma. One of the chimeric proteins was constructed by subcloning a PCR-generated fragment from pBluescriptKS/eNOS (7Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Zeng D. Durieux M.E. D'Angelo D.D. Lynch K.R. Peach M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15274-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into a mutant pBluescriptSK/nNOS cDNA. The eNOS fragment was obtained by PCR amplification using VentRDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) possessing a 3′ to 5′ proofreading exonuclease activity for higher fidelity than was available with Taq polymerase. The eNOS cDNA coding for amino acids Met-1 to Ser-528 was amplified using primer 1 (5′-GC CCCAGCCATATG GCAAAC TTGAAA AGCGTG GGTCAG GA), which introduced a 5′ NdeI site at the starting methionine (in boldface) and a G2A mutation for increased expression, and primer 2 (5′-CGGCC GGTCTC GCTAGC GTACAG GATG), which introduced a 3′NheI splice site. The nNOS cDNA (6Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar) was mutated using the Transformer Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH); selection primer 3 (5′-GTC GACGGT ATTAAT AAGCTT GATATC), which converted a unique ClaI site in pBluescriptSK to a unique AseI site; and primer 4 (5′-CTG AAGGAC ACAGATCATATG GAAGAG AACACG), which introduced a 5′NdeI site at the starting methionine. Simultaneously, the NheI splice point was created using mutagenesis primer 5 (5′-G ACCATT CTCTAC GCTAGC GAGACA GGCAAA TCAC), which resulted in a T761S mutation and yielded pBluescriptSK/nNOSNheI761. Sequence alignment using the GAP program (29Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package, Version 8.0. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar) revealed that this amino acid is located in a stretch that is identical between nNOS and eNOS (Table I) and therefore was not expected to grossly affect the properties of the chimera. Indeed, the mutation is silent regarding the eNOS sequence and is a conservative mutation from threonine for nNOS. The chimeric gene construct was made by subcloning the NdeI-NheI eNOS fragment into pBluescriptSK/nNOS-NheI761. A 3′ XbaI site in the multiple cloning domain was utilized to subclone the entireNdeI/XbaI chimeric gene into a pCWori expression plasmid that also possessed an insert coding for an N-terminal His6 tag to aid in purification.Table ISequence at the splice sites in the parent and chimeric proteinsProteinSplice point sequencenNOS755ATILYATET763eNOS522ATILYASET530iNOS533ATVLFATET541EHC/NR522ATILYASET530IHC/NR533ATVLFATET541 Open table in a new tab The IHC/NR construction was analogously produced from PCR-generated IHC from pBluescript/iNOS and PCR primers AGTCT CACAT ATGGC TTGCC CGTGC AAGTT TCTGT TCAA and CGGGC GTCGC TAGCA AAGAG GACTG TGGC to generateNdeI and NheI terminal restriction sites, respectively. The NheI splice site introduces a silent mutation at the conserved T539 of iNOS, which is homologous to Thr-761 of nNOS. Subcloning was then performed as for EHC/NR. The His6proteins were expressed in protease-deficient BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and purified as described previously (30Hühmer A.F.R. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Schöneich C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c reduction and NADPH oxidation rates were measured at 37 °C on a Cary 1E spectrometer equipped with a Lauda circulating bath using the extinction coefficients ε550 nm = 21 mm−1cm−1 and ε340 nm = 6200m−1 cm−1, respectively. NOS activity was measured at 37 °C as the ·NO-dependent conversion of ferrous to ferric methemoglobin (31Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient of Δε401–411 of 60 mm−1 cm−1. Exogenous cofactors, when added, were 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 1 mm Ca2+, and a 3-fold molar excess of CaM over NOS monomer. For EGTA inhibition experiments, the EGTA stock solution was adjusted to pH 7.5 before addition. The values of Km and Vmax were determined for the EHC/NR chimera purified on ADP-agarose and CaM-Sepharose columns in the absence of H4B and l-Arg. For the IHC/NR chimera, the CaM-Sepharose column could not be used because CaM is already tightly bound to IHC/NR due to coexpression of CaM with the chimera. Imidazole was omitted from all buffers to avoid contamination of the final pure protein with bound imidazole. Buffer D 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml antipain) was used to elute the protein from the Ni2+-NTA column. After re-binding to ADP-Sepharose, the bound protein was washed with at least 5 column volumes of Buffer D. The purification was then continued as described earlier. Size exclusion chromatography was performed by FPLC on an HR200 Superdex (Pharmacia 10/30) column at room temperature using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min of running buffer composed of 10% glycerol plus 150 mm phosphate-buffered saline and 2 mm dithiothreitol. When applicable, H4B was added to the protein solution to a concentration of 100 μm. The running buffer contained 5 μmH4B. To explore the electron transfer mechanism in NOS, we constructed two chimeras in each of which the heme and CaM binding domains of one NOS isoform were fused to the reductase domain of a second isoform. In one chimera, the eNOS heme and CaM binding domains were fused with the nNOS reductase domain (EHC/NR), and in the other, the iNOS heme and CaM binding domains were fused to the nNOS reductase domain (IHC/NR). The splice points for the chimeras were chosen to minimize whatever structural perturbations might arise from a change in the amino acid at the splice site and were located at regions with high primary sequence identity between isoforms, as determined by the GAP program from the GCG software package (29Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package, Version 8.0. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar). The splice points, indicated by boldface type, are shown in Table I. The sequences of the splice points for the EHC/NR and IHC/NR chimeric proteins share the sequence of at least one of the parent isoforms, with no additions or deletions, and therefore no direct structural perturbation due to the splicing was expected. The chimeric proteins were expressed in E. coli under the same conditions used to express the wild-type proteins (17Gerber N.C. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Because there is no H4B or CaM in E. coli, the proteins are expressed in the absence of these cofactors, although the absence of CaM can be remedied by coexpression of the human CaM gene in the bacterial cells (17Gerber N.C.

As the chimeras were tagged with a polyhistidine peptide, their purification was achieved, as was done previously for the wild-type eNOS (19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and iNOS isoforms (17Gerber N.C. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), by affinity chromatography first on a Ni2+-NTA column and subsequently on a 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column (Fig. 1). The proteins were purified in either the presence or absence of H4B, yielding proteins that were designated, for example, H4B(+)EHC/NR and H4B(−)EHC/NR, respectively. For the EHC/NR chimera, the final protein yield was 5 mg, and the specific activity was 500 nmol min−1 mg−1. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the protein (Fig. 1,lane 4) indicated that the protein was obtained in a highly purified state. Furthermore, the molecular mass of the protein indicated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (∼130 kDa) was consistent with the calculated EHC/NR molecular mass of 133 kDa. The active IHC/NR chimera could only be obtained when it was co-expressed with CaM. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of CaM-coexpressed IHC/NR showed that the molecular mass of the purified protein was consistent with the calculated mass of 138 kDa (Fig. 1,lane 8). The presence of H4B during the purification of EHC/NR or IHC/NR had no significant effect on the final protein yield. H4B(+)EHC/NR and H4B(−)EHC/NR are spectroscopically nearly indistinguishable. The only detectable difference is a slightly broader peak in the H4B-free protein (not shown). The Soret band at λmax = 400 nm is similar to that of wild-type eNOS and nNOS (32Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and indicates that the protein is primarily high spin. Addition of H4B and l-Arg converts the low spin shoulder to high spin. CaM-coexpressed H4B(+)IHC/NR possesses a spectrum similar to that of EHC/NR. However, CaM-coexpressed H4B(−)IHC/NR exhibited a red-shifted Soret band at λmax = 418 nm similar to that found for H4B(−)iNOS (17Gerber N.C. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem.

Ortiz de Montellano, unpublished results. indicate that these proteins are primarily low spin. Addition of 100 μm H4B produced nearly equal populations of high and low spin heme, and addition of 1 mml-Arg continued the trend toward a high spin heme. Dithionite reduction of both chimeric proteins in the presence of CO produced the expected 444 nm absorbance maximum of the ferrous-CO complexes. Dimer formation is required for catalytic ·NO production (37Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because dimer formation might be affected by altered protein contacts in the chimeras, the ability of both EHC/NR and IHC/NR to form dimers was evaluated. FPLC size exclusion chromatography showed that dimers were present in both H4B(+) and H4B(−) EHC/NR independent of whether the samples were preincubated with H4B and of whether H4B was added to the FPLC elution buffers (Fig. 2). Nearly all (>90%) of the heme-containing protein was present as the dimer, with approximately 30% of the total protein in the monomeric state. With respect to this H4B-independent dimerization, EHC/NR behaved very similarly to wild-type human eNOS (19Rodrı́guez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, heme-containing but H4B-free IHC/NR eluted from the gel filtration Sephadex column as both a monomer and a dimer (Fig. 2, A and B). Although quantitation is difficult due to the similar retention times of the monomer and dimer, the proportion of dimer increased for both the heme-containing (compare Fig. 2, A and B) and heme-free protein (compare Fig. 2, C and D) when the analysis was carried out in the presence of H4B. In this regard, IHC/NR behaves like native iNOS, which was shown earlier to exhibit similar H4B-dependent dimerization behavior (37Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), although we saw considerable dimerization even for H4B- andl-Arg-free iNOS (Fig. 2). The dimerization properties of the chimeras thus resemble those of the parent that contributes the heme and CaM domains. To evaluate the ability of the reductase and heme domains in the chimeras to interact productively and to determine whether CaM binding involves contacts with the protein outside the putative CaM binding domain, we measured the cytochrome c reduction and NOS activities of the chimeric proteins. For both chimeras, the omission of H4B during protein purification did not affect enzyme activity if the proteins were reconstituted with the cofactor. Exogenous flavins were required to achieve maximal activities for both chimeras, which suggests, as for the native isoforms (39Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that some flavin loss occurred during purification despite the presence of flavins in the purification buffers. The cytochrome c reductase activity of EHC/NR was as high as that of wild-type nNOS (Table II). CaM stimulated the EHC/NR cytochrome c reduction rate, as it does for the wild-type isoforms, but the magnitude of the enhancement was greater for the chimera than for the wild-type proteins. In the presence of exogenous flavins, the CaM-dependent enhancement for the chimera was 20–60-fold, whereas the enhancement under similar conditions for eNOS and nNOS was ∼10-fold. The cytochrome c reductase activity of CaM-coexpressed IHC/NR was only slightly lower than that of wild-type nNOS or iNOS (Table II).Table IIActivities of nNOS, iNOS, eNOS, EHC/NR, and IHC/NRProteinCa2+/CaM2-aExogenously added to assay system in addition to NADPH, H4B, and l-Arg.Reductase activity2-bAs measured by the rate of cytochrome c reduction.NOS activity2-cAs measured by the hemoglobin assay for · NO.min−1min−1nNOS−6300+706096eNOS−670+67016iNOS (CaM-coexpressed)+5880105EHC/NR−980+601063IHC/NR (CaM-coexpressed)−473087+459083+Ca2+ only4770872-a Exogenously added to assay system in addition to NADPH, H4B, and l-Arg.2-b As measured by the rate of cytochrome c reduction.2-c As measured by the hemoglobin assay for · NO.

For IHC/NR, l-Arg Km = 9.2 μm and Vmax = 630 nmol min−1 mg−1; these values compare well withKm = 12 μm and Vmax = 800 nmol min−1mg−1 for recombinant hepatic iNOS purified in this laboratory (17Gerber N.C.

https://openalex.org/W2064349679,"The mammaglobin gene encodes a novel secreted protein whose corresponding mRNA is frequently up-regulated in human breast cancer. In non-malignant tissues, expression is also strictly limited to the mammary epithelium. To better understand the mechanisms controlling these patterns of expression, we have isolated the human mammaglobin gene and performed an initial assessment of its promoter activity. Mammaglobin gene architecture is very similar to that of a family of related genes that includes uteroglobin and rat prostatein subunits C1, C2, and C3. However, the mammaglobin gene itself is not well conserved phylogenetically. The human mammaglobin gene is localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization to chromosome 11 band q13, a genomic region frequently amplified in breast neoplasia. The sequence of proximal 1 kb of mammaglobin promoter contains several potential transcriptional control elements and directs high-level expression of a transfected reporter construct in human breast tumor cell lines. However, comparable levels of reporter gene expression are also seen in non-mammary human cell lines. These data suggest that, unlike related gene family members, the striking breast-specific expression and tumor-associated overexpression of mammaglobin is mediated by complex transcriptional control at more distal sequence elements."
https://openalex.org/W2003697881,"We have previously reported that ursolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene acid, inhibited the invasion of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells by reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Since the chemical structure of ursolic acid is very similar to that of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, we investigated whether ursolic acid acts through the glucocorticoid receptor. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 is thought to be regulated similarly with matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 as containing common 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate responsible region, where AP-1 proteins can bind. Dexamethasone has been studied to repress the 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 through a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated manner. In Northern blot analysis, we found that ursolic acid reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 induced by 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate. Similarly, ursolic acid down-regulated 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate-induction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene in the same manner of dexamethasone. RU486, a potent glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, was used for identifying that ursolic acid-induced down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression is mediated by its binding to glucocorticoid receptor. The effect of ursolic acid on the matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression was blocked by RU486, suggesting that ursolic acid acts via a glucocorticoid receptor in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that ursolic acid increased glucocorticoid receptor fraction in the nucleus, although it decreased the synthesis of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA. In addition, ursolic acid did not decrease the expression of c-jun and DNA-binding activity of AP-1 to its cognate sequences. Taken together, we suggest that ursolic acid may induce the repression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by stimulating the nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptor, and the translocated glucocorticoid receptor probably down-modulating the trans-activating function of AP-1 to 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate responsible element of matrix metalloproteinase-9 promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W2067220774,"We report the molecular cloning and expression of a phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> from bovine testis. The open reading frame encoded an 875-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 97,576 daltons and a pI of 5.61. The sequence included a region similar to a lipase consensus sequence containing the putative active site serine and also included a potential, coiled-coil-forming region. Expression of the open reading frame in COS1 cells resulted in a 20–44-fold increase in phosphatidic acid phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity over that of control cells. Mutation of the putative active site serine (amino acid 540) demonstrated that it was essential for this increase in enzyme activity. Northern blot analysis revealed at least five different messages with the highest overall message levels in mature testis, but detectable message in all tissues examined. Two possible alternately spliced regions in the open reading frame also were identified. Finally, a search of the data base identified six related proteins: a potential counterpart of the phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, two putative lipases in yeast, and three proteins separately encoded by the <i>Drosophila</i> retinal degeneration B gene and its mouse and human homologues."

These substrates are not efficiently carboxylated by the bovine microsomal γ-glutamyl carboxylase, suggesting differences in specificities between the Conus and the mammalian enzyme. However, the role of propeptide in enhancing the efficiency of carboxylation is maintained. The vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues was originally discovered as a novel post-translational modification in the blood coagulation cascade (1Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar); some of the key clotting factors such as prothrombin must be γ-carboxylated in order for proper blood clotting to occur. Somewhat later, this post-translational modification was also found in certain bone proteins (2Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification was restricted to these rather specialized mammalian systems until a very unusual peptide, conantokin-G, was described from the venom of the predatory marine snail, Conus geographus (3McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conantokin-G is a 17-amino acid peptide that inhibits the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (4Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Ramilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Unlike most Conus peptides, which are multiply disulfide-bonded, conantokin-G has no disulfide cross-links but has 5 residues of γ-carboxyglutamate residues; this remains the highest density of γ-carboxyglutamate found in any functional gene product characterized to date. Most of the biologically active components of the Conusvenom are multiply disulfide bonded peptides (the conotoxins). These have been shown to be initially translated as prepropeptide precursors, which are then post-translationally processed to yield the mature disulfide-cross-linked conotoxin. Conantokin-G differs strikingly from most conotoxins not only in having γ-carboxyglutamate residues, but also because it has no disulfide cross-links. We report below an analysis of a cDNA clone encoding the conantokin-G precursor. Furthermore, we establish the probable function of one region of the precursor that is excised during the maturation of the functional conantokin-G peptide. The presence of γ-carboxyglutamate in a non-mammalian system was initially controversial because vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamate residues had primarily been thought to be a highly specialized mammalian innovation. However, we have found that conantokin-G is only one member of a family of peptides; a variety of other conantokins have been found including conantokin-T and conantokin-R from two other fish-hunting cone snails (5Haack J.A.

All three peptides have a high content of γ-carboxyglutamate (4–5 residues). γ-Glutamyl carboxylase has been purified from mammalian sources (7Wu S.-M. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1993; 90: 8372-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that, as is the case in the mammalian system, the carboxylation reaction in Conus venom ducts absolutely requires vitamin K, and the net carboxylation increases greatly in the presence of high concentrations of ammonium sulfate. In these respects, the mammalian and the Conusγ-carboxylation venom systems are very similar (11Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The propeptides of vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins share extensive sequence similarity. This sequence is believed to interact with the carboxylase and constitutes the γ-carboxylation recognition sequence (γ-CRS). 1The abbreviations used are: γ-CRS, γ-carboxylation recognition sequence; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamate. 1The abbreviations used are: γ-CRS, γ-carboxylation recognition sequence; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Gla, γ-carboxyglutamate. In this report, we analyze the conantokin-G precursor sequence for potential γ-CRS sequences. The results described below identify a sequence present in the −1 to −20 region of the conantokin-G prepropeptide, which when covalently linked to the N-terminal of the substrate stimulates carboxylation by the Conus enzyme. Conus radiatus venom ducts were obtained from Dr. L. J. Cruz (University of the Philippines). Vitamin K (phytonadione) was from Abbot Laboratories, and NaH14CO3 55 mCi/mmol from NEN Life Science Products. Bovine microsomes were a gift from Dr. D. W. Stafford (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Conus microsome preparation from frozen venom ducts of C. radiatus was performed as described by Stanley et al. (11Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Carboxylase assay using 1 μg of Conusmicrosomal protein per assay was performed as follows: Conusmicrosomes were solubilized in 0.7% CHAPS/0.7% phosphatidyl choline/1.5 m NaCl for 20 min on ice. Final reactions were done in a total volume of 125 μl containing solubilized microsomes and a final concentration of reagents as follows: 25 mmMOPS, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, 0.2% phosphatidyl choline, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, 5 μCi of NaH14 CO3, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 222 μm reduced vitamin K (prepared as described by Ref. 12Buitenhuis H.C.

Substrate and inhibitor concentrations are indicated in the legends to the figures and tables. For experiments with bovine microsomes, 380 μg of microsomal protein was present in each reaction. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and were quenched by the addition of 75 μl of 1 n NaOH. 160 μl of the quenched reaction mixture was transferred to 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and boiled to remove unincorporated 14CO2. After cooling, 5 ml of Ecolite (NEN Life Science Products) was added, and the 14CO2 incorporated was determined in a Beckman LS 9800 counter. The amount of microsomal proteins present in the various experiments are indicated under “Results.” All reported values are averages of three independent determinations. Peptides were synthesized on a 357ACT peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry strategy. The peptides were cleaved from the solid support by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/ethanedithiol/thioanisole (90/5/2.5/2.5 by volume) and purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The integrity of the peptides were verified by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Experiments were done in triplicate, and the data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism from GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Isolation of conantokin-G cDNA was as follows. A cDNA library from C. geographus, in a pUC plasmid derivative, was plated out in duplicate and probed with end-labeled degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the mature toxin sequences. Hybridization was done in 3 m tetramethyl ammonium chloride (Aldrich), 0.1 m Na2HPO4, 0.001m EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.6% SDS, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA for 24 h at 48 °C. Washes were done at room temperature in 3 m tetramethyl ammonium chloride, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2% SDS for 15 min and 1 h at 50 °C in a solution of the same composition. The filters were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min each. The filters were then exposed to x-ray films. Double stranded DNA from purified clones were sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain terminating method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone encoding conantokin-G was identified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The clone was sequenced in both strands, and the nucleotide sequence obtained is shown in Fig. 1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the open reading frame encoded by this cDNA clone and the post-translational modifications that take place to yield the mature peptide are also indicated in the figure. The cDNA sequence predicts the presence of a valine residue at position 5 of the mature conantokin-G sequence. However, active peptide isolated from the venom contains leucine at this position. Using oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the cDNA as primers, we have also isolated the leucine containing cDNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification of total venom duct cDNA. We have used leucine containing conantokin-G peptides in our experiments. The sequencing data reveal that the conantokin-G precursor is generally organized in a typical Conus prepropeptide motif, with the mature peptide encoded at the C-terminal end. As expected, all γ-carboxyglutamate residues are encoded by the codons for glutamate. At the C-terminal end of the predicted open reading frame are codons encoding -Asn-Gly-Lys-Arg-Stop, which signals processing to a C-terminal Asn-NH2. Immediately adjacent to Gly1 of the mature conantokin-G is a typical proteolytic signal (Ala-Arg) for Conusprepropeptides. Proteolysis after the Arg residue would excise the N-terminal prepro-region of 80 amino acids containing a signal sequence of 21 amino acids at the N terminus. (However, at this point, we do not know the order of cleavage of the signal sequence and propeptide sequences.) In contrast to previously described signal sequences for conotoxins, the signal sequence for the conantokin-G precursor lacks a Cys residue (14Colledge C.J. Hunsperger J.P. Imperial J.S. Hillyard D.R. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A noteworthy feature of the prepropeptide is the relatively long intervening pro-region (59 amino acids). Among precursors of smallConus peptides (under 30 amino acids in length) sequenced to date, this is the longest pro-region that has been characterized so far. As we establish below, this 59-amino acid pro-region contains a γ-carboxylation recognition sequence that presumably plays a critical role in the conversion of Glu to Gla. In the case of mammalian proteins that undergo γ-carboxylation, the γ-CRS is contained in a 18-amino acid sequence (16-amino acid sequence in the case of bone peptides) immediately N-terminal to the mature peptide sequence (15Pan L.C.

Open table in a new tab The concentration dependence for the carboxylation of peptides 1 and 3 (Table I) are shown in Fig. 2. The apparent Km for E.Con-G is 3400 ± 215 μm, and that for −20.Pro-E.Con-G is 28 ± 3 μm. The results clearly indicate that covalent linkage of the propeptide sequence −20 to −1 makes E.Con-G into an efficient substrate (note that the −20 to −1 sequence has no Glu residues that would be substrates for carboxylation). Similar observations were made when the −20 to −1 peptide was covalently linked to FLEEL (Table I). The apparent Km for peptide 3 is less than that of peptide 2, suggesting that propeptide sequences between −20 and −11 also interact with the carboxylase (Table I). We then investigated the effect of the addition of pro (−20 to −1) in trans, on the carboxylation of FLEEL, E.Con-G, −10.Pro-E.Con-G, and −20.Pro-E.Con-G. We also determined the effect of addition of Pro(−20 to −11) and Pro(−11 to −1) on the carboxylation of −10.Pro-E.Con-G. Inspection of the Km values in Table I clearly indicates that substrates in which the propeptide sequences −20 to −1 are covalently linked to the N terminus are efficient substrates for carboxylation. In the case of both E.Con-G and FLEEL, the Km decreases by 2 orders of magnitude. Pro(−20 to −1) stimulates the carboxylation of both FLEEL and E.Con-G when added in trans, but the effects are quite small: ∼25% enhancement in the case of E.Con-G and 40% for FLEEL. Pro(−40 to −21) and Pro(−60 to −41) have no effect on the carboxylation of FLEEL or E.Con-G (data not shown). Propeptide sequence −20 to −1 is an inhibitor for the carboxylation of −10.Pro-E.Con-G (Fig. 3 and Table I) and −20.Pro-E.Con-G. The IC50 of Pro(−20 to −1) is very similar to Pro(−30 to −1), suggesting that the interaction of the propeptide with the carboxylase in the region between −30 and −1 is probably limited to −20 to −1. Pro(−40 to −21) and Pro(−60 to −41) did not inhibit carboxylation of −10.Pro-E.Con-G even at concentrations 100-fold greater. We also investigated the effect of alanine substitutions of the basic amino acids in the propeptide.−20GKDRLTQMKRILKQRGNKAR−1GEEELY-NH2, a 26-amino acid peptide containing propeptide sequences −20 to −1 of conantokin-G was used as the wild type substrate. Individual peptides in which KR at positions −12 and −11, KQR at positions −8, −7, and −6, NK at positions −4 and −3, and NK-R at positions −4, −3, and −1 were substituted by alanine were used as substrates in the carboxylation reaction. Carboxylation reactions were done at a substrate concentration of 40 μm, the apparentKm of carboxylation for the wild type substrate. Alanine substitutions in the context of the remaining propeptide sequences had little effect (<10%) on carboxylation. We examined the ability of bovine microsomes to use −20.Pro-E.Con-G as substrate for γ-carboxylation. As shown in Table II, although this peptide is an excellent substrate for the Conus enzyme, it is extremely poor for the mammalian enzyme.Table IICarboxylation by bovine and Conus microsomesAdditions14CO2incorporatedpmolBovine microsomes Endogenous1 FLEEL (1.2 mm)249 −20.Pro-E.Con-G (0.28 mm)3Conusmicrosomes Endogenous11 FLEEL (1.2 mm)818 −20.Pro-E.Con-G (0.28 mm)2741 Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated that the γ-carboxylated 17-amino acidConus peptide conantokin-G is initially translated as a prepropeptide of 100 amino acids. In general, the organization of the conantokin-G precursor is similar to that previously reported for disulfide-rich conotoxins from Conus venoms. The mature peptide is found in a single copy at the C-terminal end of the precursor. Before maturation of the peptide, a number of post-translational processing events have to take place (Fig. 1). These events include the γ-carboxylation of five glutamate residues, C-terminal amidation of asparagine-17 following excision of the C-terminal tripeptide, and a proteolytic event between Arg−1 and Gly1. One notable feature of the conantokin-G prepropeptide is the length of the intervening region between the signal sequence and the mature peptide. The 59 amino acids in the intervening pro-region is the longest so far reported for any Conus venom peptide. We have demonstrated one potential function of this extended region: the presence of a γ-carboxylation recognition sequence for the Conus venom duct γ-glutamyl carboxylase in the −1 to −20 region. In mammalian blood coagulation and bone Gla proteins, γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues is carried out by a vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. A conserved motif (16Price P.A. Fraser J.D. Metz-Virca G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) γ-carboxylation recognition sequence in the propeptide sequence binds the γ-carboxylase and is required for a polypeptide substrate to be a high affinity target for the γ-carboxylase. In the experiments described above, we carried out an analysis using segments of the conantokin-G prepropeptide to identify potential sites that might serve as γ-carboxylase recognition signals for the Conus enzyme. The results reveal that a γ-carboxylation recognition sequence is included in the −1 to −20 region of the conantokin-G prepropeptide. This appears to increase the affinity of the Conuscarboxylase by approximately 2 orders of magnitude under the assay conditions used. Knobloch and Suttie (18Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (19Cheung A. Engelke J.A. Sanders C. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that the propeptide sequences of Factors IX and X at micromolar concentrations stimulated the carboxylation of oligopeptide substrates, suggesting a probable positive allosteric effector role. In addition, the propeptide at micromolar concentrations acted as a competitive inhibitor of carboxylation of a substrate whose sequences were based on residues −18 to +10 of prothrombin (20Ulrich M.M.W. Furie B. Jacobs M.R. Vermeer C. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the Conuspropeptide (−20 to −1) inhibits the carboxylation of propeptide-containing substrates, (i.e. −10.Pro-E.Con-G and −20.Pro.E.Con-G). However, we were unable to observe equivalent, strong stimulation of carboxylation of FLEEL and E.Con-G by the Conus propeptide. The relevant propeptide sequence (−20 to −1) for conantokin-G, human Factors IX (21Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) are shown in Table III. Except for the presence of a hydrophobic residue at position −16, the conantokin-G sequence does not appear to share the conserved features of the mammalian propeptides (16Price P.A. Fraser J.D. Metz-Virca G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Phenylalanine is present at position −16 in all the propeptide sequences except in gas6 and protein S, in which it is leucine as in the case of Con-G. In addition, isoleucine is present at position −10 of Con-G in place of a conserved alanine residue. Besides, positions −6 and −7, which are always hydrophobic for the mammalian propeptide sequences, are basic and polar residues, respectively, for Con-G. This suggests differences between the recognition specificities of the mammalian and Conus enzymes. A preliminary characterization of the amino acids important for recognition by the Conusenzyme has been carried out. The individual basic amino acids in the propeptide region −20 to −1 can be replaced by alanine without significantly affecting the apparent Km for carboxylation. The importance of hydrophobic residues in the mammalian γ-CRS suggests that they may also be important for the Conus carboxylase, and this role needs to be investigated.Table IIIPropeptide sequences of γ-carboxylated Conus and mammalian peptidesPro-Con-GGKDRLTQMKRILKQRGNKARhFIXTVFLDHENANKILNRPKRhFXSLFIRREQANNILARVTRhPTHVFLAPQQARSLLQRVRR Open table in a new tab What is the role of the γ-CRS −? Does it merely tether the substrate to the carboxylase, or does it play additional roles in the γ-carboxylation reaction? How do multiple carboxylations occur on a single substrate molecule? Does the γ-CRS set a limit to the distance at which γ-carboxylation will take place? Is the γ-CRS sufficient for the fidelity of carboxylation, or are additional membrane components necessary? These are some of the questions that need to be addressed to understand the mechanism of action of γ-glutamyl carboxylase. The orientation in which a Glu presents itself to the active site of the carboxylase may determine whether it will be carboxylated. In the case of Con-G not all the Glu residues are γ-carboxylated (Glu2 is not carboxylated, whereas Glu3 and Glu4 are carboxylated). The solution structures of Con-G and Con-T as determined by CD and NMR spectroscopy (24Skjaebaek N. Nielsen K.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also determined the structure of the metal-free conformer of conantokin-G by NMR spectroscopy. In all these structures, the Gla residues are on the same side of the conantokin structure; this would allow a membrane-bound enzyme to carry out efficient carboxylation of Glu residues oriented in the same direction with optimum stereochemistry. In the discussion above, we have emphasized the differences in the γ-carboxylation recognition signal sequences in the mammalian and Conus systems. These differences may be due to the large evolutionary distance between the two species. However, there is an underlying general similarity between the two enzymes: the catalytic reaction they carry out, their cofactor requirements, and a recognition signal (albeit differing in sequence) in the −1 to −20 propeptide region. It will be important to purify the Conus enzyme and characterize it to determine the relationship between the two enzymes.

Nuclear run-on studies demonstrated that TGF-β1 is a potent stimulator of IL-11 gene transcription. TGF-β1 also stimulated the luciferase activity in cells transfected with reporter gene constructs containing nucleotides −728 to +58 of the IL-11 promoter. Studies with progressive 5′ deletion constructs and site-specific mutations demonstrated that this stimulation was dependent on 2 AP-1 sites between nucleotides −100 and −82 in the IL-11 promoter. Mobility shift assays demonstrated that TGF-β1 stimulated AP-1 protein-DNA binding to both AP-1 sites. Supershift analysis demonstrated that JunD was the major moiety contributing to AP-1-DNA binding in unstimulated cells and that c-Jun-, Fra-1-, and Fra-2-DNA binding were increased whereas JunD-DNA binding was decreased in TGF-β1-stimulated cells. The sequence in the IL-11 promoter that contains the AP-1 sites also conferred TGF-β1 responsiveness, in a position-independent fashion, on a heterologous minimal promoter. Thus, TGF-β1stimulates IL-11 gene transcription via a complex AP-1-dependent pathway that is dependent on 2 AP-1 motifs between nucleotides −100 and −82 that function as an enhancer in the IL-11 promoter.

In keeping with the biologic importance of IL-11, a number of investigators have studied its sites of production and the regulation of these responses. These studies demonstrated that IL-11 is produced by a variety of stromal cells in response to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, histamine, eosinophil major basic protein, and respiratory tropic viruses (7Maier R.

A prominent finding in our studies of fibroblasts (18Elias J.A. Zheng T. Whiting N.L. Trow T.K. Merrill W.W. Zitnik R. Ray P. Alderman E.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2421-2429PubMed Google Scholar), epithelial cells (19Elias J.A. Zheng T. Einarsson O. Landry M. Trow T. Rebert N. Panuska J. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and studies by others of chondrocytes and synoviocytes (7Maier R. Ganu V. Lotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21527-21532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been the importance of TGF-β moieties in the stimulation of IL-11 production. These studies also demonstrated that TGF-β1stimulation of IL-11 protein production is associated with proportionate changes in IL-11 mRNA accumulation and, in our studies, IL-11 gene transcription (18Elias J.A. Zheng T. Whiting N.L. Trow T.K. Merrill W.W. Zitnik R. Ray P. Alderman E.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2421-2429PubMed Google Scholar). The IL-11 promoter has been cloned and the cis-elements and trans-acting factors that regulate the levels of basal IL-11 production have been identified by our laboratories (21Yang L. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the demonstrated importance of gene transcription in the stimulation of IL-11 production, the cis-elements and trans-acting factors that mediate the transcriptional activation of IL-11 have not been investigated. To further our understanding of the regulation of IL-11, studies were undertaken to characterize the transcriptional elements utilized by TGF-β1 in the stimulation of IL-11. These studies identify two activating protein-1 (AP-1) motifs between −100 and −82 in the IL-11 promoter that are essential for TGF-β-induced IL-11 transcriptional activation. They also demonstrate that this stimulation is associated with complex alterations in the composition of the AP-1 subunits that bind to these sites and that DNA which contains these AP-1 elements confers TGF-β1 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter. Lastly they demonstrate that this mechanism is stimulus-specific since respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) stimulates IL-11 transcription via a different mechanism. A549 human alveolar epithelial-like cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (22Zhu Z. Tang W. Ray A. Wu Y. Einarsson O. Landry M.L. Gwaltney Jr., J. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). At confluence, varying concentrations of recombinant human TGF-β1 (1–10 ng/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis) or medium controls were added, and the cells were incubated for up to 48 h. At the desired points in time, supernatants were removed and stored at −20 °C, and nuclei were harvested for further usage (see below). The relative rates of gene transcription were assessed using modifications of protocols previously described by our laboratory (22Zhu Z. Tang W. Ray A. Wu Y. Einarsson O. Landry M.L. Gwaltney Jr., J. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 23Elias J.A. Lentz V. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar, 24Elias J.A. Lentz V.

A549 cells were incubated for 16 h under control conditions, with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or after infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at a multiplicity of infection of 3 as described previously (17Einarsson O. Geba G.P. Zhu Z. Landry M. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Elias J.A. Zheng T. Whiting N.L. Trow T.K. Merrill W.W. Zitnik R. Ray P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22261-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (3 × 107 per condition) were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 μm dithiothreitol (DTT), 300 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100). The nuclei were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of storage buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C until further utilized. Nylon membranes were prepared carrying 20 μg each of isolated cDNA fragments encoding IL-11 (a gift of Dr. Paul Schendel, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) and pUC18 without a cDNA insert (a control for nonspecific hybridization) using a slot-blotting apparatus (MINI-FOLD II, Schleicher & Schuell) and baked in a vacuum oven (80 °C for 2 h). When ready, nuclei were thawed on ice and pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 s, and in vitro transcription and RNA labeling were carried out in transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 400 μm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP) in the presence of 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) and 20% glycerol at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was followed with a cold chase with 1 μl of 100 mm UTP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was then terminated by incubating with stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with 200 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I and 750 units/ml RNasin (Boehringer Mannheim) at 30 °C for 15 min. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and washed with alcohol. Dried RNA pellets were dissolved in equal volumes of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8), and radioactivity was determined by the mean of duplicate countings of 1-μl aliquots. Hybridization was performed by incubating each membrane with equal numbers of counts of radiolabeled RNA. The membranes were then washed at high stringency, and binding was evaluated using autoradiography. A549 cells were incubated for 16 h with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). The supernatants were then removed, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) affinity based methodology as described (26Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5173) Google Scholar, 27Edmonds M. Vaughan Jr., M. Nakazato H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Primer extension was then performed using a radiolabeled 20-base complementary synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to oligonucleotides −11 to +9 with respect to the translation start site. The 5′ end of the resulting IL-1 mRNA was defined using the Moloney murine leukemia virus primer extension system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer. In this system the 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide hybridized with the IL-11 mRNA and was utilized as a primer by the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase which, in the presence of deoxynucleotides, synthesized cDNA until the 5′ end of the mRNA was reached. The extended product was then resolved on an 8% urea/polyacrylamide sequencing gel along with a known DNA sequence ladder. A 786-bp PvuII fragment of the human IL-11 promoter was previously isolated and cloned in our laboratories (21Yang L. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter fragment contained the sequences between −728 and +58 relative to the transcription start site defined above. It was cloned into the SmaI site of the luciferase reporter gene vector pXP2-luc (ATCC) to generate the construct pXP2-IL-11-728. Two techniques were used to generate a series of 5′ deletions of the pXP2-IL-11-728 parent construct. When appropriate restriction sites were present, they were utilized to generate deletion mutants. This approach was utilized with the AvaII site at −324 and the HinfI site at −96. In both cases, the −728 to +58 fragment of the IL-11 promoter was subjected to enzyme digestion, and the desired fragment was recloned into the vector pXP2-luc using standard approaches. When appropriate restriction sites were not available Bal-31 exonuclease digestion was employed to introduce deletions. This technique takes advantage of the fact that Bal-31 degrades both the 5′ and 3′ ends of double-stranded DNA without inserting internal cleavages (28Sambrook J. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatie T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, BamHI-linearized parent construct pXP2-IL-11-324 was incubated with Bal-31 exonuclease for varying periods. BamHI linkers (New England Biolabs, catalogue number 1071, Beverly, MA) were then added, and the DNA was subjected to BamHI/XhoI double digestion. The DNA fragments with the various 5′ deletions were then separated by electrophoresis, electroeluted, and ligated intoBamHI/XhoI-linearized pXP2-luc vector. Clones from the subsequent transformation were screened for insert size, and DNA sequencing was used to verify junction sequences for all clones that were chosen for further utilization. Through the combined efforts of both approaches, a series of constructs were prepared whose 5′ ends extended from −728 to −81. In all cases, the 3′ end was +58 relative to the transcription initiation site. Mutation of the AP-1 sites in the parent IL-11 promoter was performed using the Muta-Gene M13 In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad, catalog number 170-3580) based on Kunkel's method (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar, 30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). The 382-bp BamHI/XhoI fragment of IL-11 promoter was excised from pXP2-IL-11-324 and subcloned into M13 phage. The recombinant phage DNA was then transformed into bacterial strainEscherichia coli CJ236 (dut−, ung−, thi−, and relA−) to generate uracil-containing single-stranded DNA. Such single-stranded DNA was allowed to anneal to mutagenic primer, and second strand DNA was synthesized with T7 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. When transformed into bacterial strain MV1190(dut+, ung+), uracil-containing single-stranded DNA template was degraded, and only newly synthesized mutation-bearing second strand DNA would propagate. The wild type and mutated AP-1 sequences are as follows: wild type 5′ (distal) AP-1, 5′-TGAGTCA-3′; mutated 5′ (distal) AP-1, 5′-TGAcgaA-3′; wild type 3′ (proximal) AP-1, 5′-TGTGTCA-3′; mutated 3′ (proximal) AP-1, 5′-TGTcgaA-3′. All of the AP-1 mutation constructs underwent DNA sequencing to verify the site and extent of the induced alterations. A 156-bp BamHI/XhoI fragment from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) minimal promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct ptk-CAT (31Ray A. LaForge K.S. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Anuradha Ray (Yale University, New Haven) and subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pXP2-luc reporter gene construct to generate ptk-XP2. Two oligonucleotides (5′-GAT CCG AGG GTG AGT CAG GAT GTG TCA GGC CGA AGC TT-3′ and 5′-GAT CAA GCT TCG GCC TGA CAC CTG ACT CAC CCT CG-3′) were then synthesized and annealed to form a 38-bp DNA duplex with sticky ends compatible with the BamHI site (5′ of herpes simplex virus tk promoter) in ptk-XP2. This insert contains a 27-bp DNA sequence of the IL-11 promoter (−103 to −77 relative to transcription start site) that contains both the 5′ and 3′ AP-1 sites. This double-stranded DNA sequence was then cloned into ptk-XP2 in the correct (sense) (pIL11(+)tk-XP2) and reverse (antisense) (pIL11(−)tk-XP2) directions. DNA sequencing was performed to verify the sequence and orientation of DNA insertion. A549 cells were seeded at 40–50% confluence and incubated overnight in DMEM with high glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously by our laboratory (22Zhu Z. Tang W. Ray A. Wu Y. Einarsson O. Landry M.L. Gwaltney Jr., J. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM alone or in DMEM supplemented with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). In experiments where RSV was utilized the A549 cells were incubated for 90 min with RSV (multiplicity of infection = 3) or appropriate medium control, washed, and then incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. At the end of these incubations, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was assessed on a Lumat luminometer using the Luciferase Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI). In all transfections the construct pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was also included to control for transfection efficiency. The β-galactosidase activity in unstimulated and stimulated cell lysates was characterized using the CPRG method as described previously by this laboratory (22Zhu Z. Tang W. Ray A. Wu Y. Einarsson O. Landry M.L. Gwaltney Jr., J. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase levels were then used to standardize the measurements of luciferase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared using modifications of the techniques of Schreiber et al. (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Unstimulated, TGF-β1-stimulated, and RSV-infected A549 cells were prepared as noted above. At the desired points in time, the cells (107 per condition) were mechanically detached, suspended in Tris-buffered saline freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), pelleted at 4 °C, and resuspended, and swollen in solution A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT with freshly added protease inhibitors as above) for 15 min on ice. Membrane lysis was accomplished by adding 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 followed by vigorous agitation. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 μl of solution B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT and freshly added protease inhibitors as above), and agitated vigorously at 4 °C for 15 min. The membrane debris was discarded, and the nuclear extracts were snap-frozen in small aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined using the DC Protein Assay System (Bio-Rad). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were used in these experiments. For the sake of simplicity, only the top strand DNA sequences are illustrated here. Four oligonucleotide probes were synthesized using the oligonucleotide synthesis facility at Yale University. They include the following: (i) wild type 5′ AP-1 sequence in the IL-11 promoter (5′ AP-1) (5′-GGGAGGGTGAGTCAGGATGTG-3′); (ii) mutated 5′ AP-1 (5′-GGGAGGGTGAcgaAGGATGTG-3′); (iii) wild type 3′ AP-1 sequence in the IL-11 promoter (3′ AP-1) (5′-AGTCAGGATGTGTCAGGCCGGCCC-3′); and (iv) mutated 3′ AP-1 (5′-AGTCAGGATGTcgaAGGCCGGCCC-3′). Four other oligonucleotides were obtained from commercial sources (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). They included the following: (i) a classic AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′); (ii) an AP-2 oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′); (iii) an AP-3 oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGTGGGACTTTCCACAGATC-3′); and (iv) an SP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGATC-3′). EMSAs were performed using the techniques of Schreiber et al. (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides and end-labeling using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled probes were purified by push-column chromatography, diluted with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) to the desired concentration, and incubated with equal aliquots of nuclear extract (2–5 μg) and 2 μg of poly[dI-dC]·poly[dI-dC] in a total volume of 20 μl at room temperature for 1 h. Resolution was accomplished by electrophoresing 10 μl of the reaction solution on vertical 6% native polyacrylamide gels containing 2% glycerol using 25% TBE buffer (22.3 mm Tris-HCl, 22.3 mmboric acid, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Binding was assessed via autoradiography. Supershift assays were used to determine which members of the AP-1 family were involved in TGFβ1-stimulation of IL-11 gene transcription. In these studies EMSA were performed as described above except that isotype matched rabbit polyclonal antibodies against AP-1 proteins or control preimmune antiserum were included during the 1-h radiolabeled probe-extract incubation period. All of the antibodies that were used were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). They included antibodies that react with all Jun family members (Pan-Jun) (catalogue number SC-44X), JunB (catalogue number 46X), JunD (catalogue number SC-74X), c-Jun (catalogue number SC822X); all Fos family members (pan-Fos) (catalogue number SC-253X), c-Fos (catalogue number SC-52X), FosB (catalogue number SC-48X), Fra-1 (catalogue number SC-605X), and Fra-2 (catalogue number SC604X). RSV (A-2 strain) was obtained from the ATCC. Stock virus was prepared in permissive cell lines and titered, and A549 cells were infected with the virus as described previously by this laboratory (17Einarsson O. Geba G.P. Zhu Z. Landry M. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Elias J.A. Zheng T. Einarsson O. Landry M. Trow T. Rebert N. Panuska J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22261-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that TGF-β1 is a potent stimulator of IL-11 gene transcription in lung fibroblasts (18Elias J.A. Zheng T. Whiting N.L. Trow T.K. Merrill W.W. Zitnik R. Ray P. Alderman E.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2421-2429PubMed Google Scholar) and that TGF-β1and RSV stimulate A549 alveolar epithelial cell IL-11 protein production and mRNA accumulation (17Einarsson O. Geba G.P. Zhu Z. Landry M. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Elias J.A. Zheng T. Einarsson O. Landry M. Trow T. Rebert N. Panuska J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22261-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if both stimuli augment IL-11 gene transcription in A549 cells, nuclear run-on assays were performed, and the levels of IL-11 gene transcription were evaluated at base line, after TGF-β1 stimulation and after RSV infection. At base line, the levels of IL-11 gene transcription in A549 cells were near the limits of detection with our assay (Fig. 1). In contrast, both TGF-β1 and RSV caused significant increases in IL-11 gene transcription (Fig. 1). Prior to initiating studies designed to define the stimulation-responsive cis-elements in the IL-11 promoter, primer extension analysis was used to characterize the transcription initiation site in TGF-β1-stimulated A549 cells. A single transcription initiation site was detected. This start site was 154 bp upstream of the ATG (data not shown) and is within 1–2 bases of the start site previously described in unstimulated PU-34 primate bone marrow fibroblasts by our laboratories (21Yang L. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin to characterize the mechanism by which TGF-β1stimulates IL-11 gene transcription, transient transfection assays were performed with a promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct containing IL-11 promoter elements between nucleotides −728 and +58 (relative to the transcription start site). The levels of luciferase activity in A549 cells were evaluated at base line and after TGF-β1stimulation. As can be seen in Fig. 2, only a modest level of luciferase activity was able to be detected in unstimulated A549 cells. In contrast, TGF-β1 was an impressive, dose-dependent stimulator of the promoter activity of this construct (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that the −728 to +58 fragment of the IL-11 promoter contains TGF-β1-responsive sequences. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that RSV also stimulates A549 cell IL-11 production and mRNA accumulation (17Einarsson O. Geba G.P. Zhu Z. Landry M. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,19Elias J.A. Zheng T. Einarsson O. Landry M. Trow T. Rebert N. Panuska J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22261-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies noted above demonstrate that this stimulation is, at least in part, transcriptionally mediated. To determine if the cis-elements in the IL-11 promoter that respond to TGF-β1also respond to RSV, we compared the ability of these two stimuli to stimulate the −728 to +58 IL-11 promoter-luciferase construct. As noted above, TGF-β was a potent stimulator of this construct. In contrast, RSV, an equally potent stimulator of IL-11 transcription in the run-on assays, did not stimulate this construct in an impressive fashion (data not shown). Thus, the response elements between −728 and +58 in the IL-11 promoter are at least partially stimulus-specific since they respond vigorously to TGF-β1 but not vigorously to RSV. To define further the cis-element(s) in the IL-11 promoter that responds to TGF-β1, intrinsic restriction sites and Bal-31 digestion were employed to obtain IL-11 promoter fragments that contain progressively larger 5′ deletions. These promoter constructs were then cloned into our luciferase reporter construct, and their responsiveness to TGF-β1 was assessed. Constructs whose 5′ end extended from −728 to −81 were generated and tested. The parent (−728 to +58) and all of the 5′ deletion constructs did not express significant levels of luciferase activity in unstimulated A549 cells. TGF-β1, however, was a potent stimulator of IL-11 promoter-driven luciferase activity in the parent construct (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 5′ deletions extending from −728 to −100 did not significantly alter TGF-β1 responsiveness (Fig. 3). In contrast, deletions past −100 markedly diminished T"

Many functions have been attributed to it, but its primary role remains a puzzle. In the current study, we stably transfected cultures of MA-10 Leydig cells with either control or 18-kDa PBR antisense knockout plasmids. The antisense knockout vector was driven by the human enkephalin promoter, which contains two cAMP response elements, such that cAMP treatment of transfected cells could superinduce 18-kDa PBR antisense RNA transcription and, hence, down-regulate endogenous 18-kDa PBR mRNA levels. Control and knockout MA-10 cell lines were then compared at the level of receptor binding, thymidine incorporation, and steroid biosynthesis. Eighteen-kilodalton PBR knockout reduced the maximal binding capacity of tritium-labeled PBR ligands, and the affinity of receptors to the ligands remained unaltered. Additionally, 24-h accumulation of progesterone was lower in the knockout cells. Exposure of the two cell types to 8-bromo-cAMP resulted in a robust increase in steroid production. However, a complex pattern of steroid accumulation was observed, in which further progestin metabolism was indicated. The later decline in accumulated progesterone as well as the synthesis of androstenedione were different in the two cell types. At the level of cell proliferation, reduction of 18-kDa PBR mRNA showed no effect. Thus, we conclude that the 18-kDa PBR may have a more important role in steroidogenesis than in proliferation in this Leydig cell line.

Steroidogenic cells express high levels of PBR, and in such cells the PBR have been associated with steroidogenesis (4Papadopoulos V. Endocr.

Other studies have demonstrated a role of PBR in the regulation of cell proliferation in different cell lines (2Krueger K.E. Papadopoulos V. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Neurochem. 1989; 53: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The 18-kDa PBR gene is composed of four exons, which can express up to two splicing variants of mRNA (21Lin D. Chang Y.J. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. Genomics. 1993; 18: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By down-regulating mRNA levels, one can effectively reduce the amount of 18-kDa PBR protein locally expressed. One approach to depleting the 18-kDa PBR expression is the antisense knockout method (22Weisinger G. Zinder O. Simantov R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the relative importance of PBR as a regulator of steroidogenesis and cell proliferation in MA-10 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCellsThe MA-10 cell line, originally cloned from the solid M548OP mouse tumor Leydig cells, was a kind gift of Dr. Mario Ascoli (Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA). MA-10 cell cultures were incubated as described previously (23Barkey R.J. Weiss-Messer E. Hacham H. Herscovich S. Ber R. Amit T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine, containing 20 mm HEPES buffer, 15% horse serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (all purchased from Beit-Ha'emek Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). MA-10 transfected cells were grown in similar medium, except for the use of 7.5% horse serum and 7.5% fetal calf serum, instead of 15% horse serum. In the experiments in which steroidogenesis was assessed, serum-free medium was used (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium, containing 15 mmHEPES buffer, 2.4 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.1 IU/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.1 mg/ml glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (all from Beit-Ha'emek)).Plasmid ConstructionThe cDNA encoding the 18-kDa PBR consists of four exons ligated within a Bluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Karl E. Krueger (Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.). The antisense vectors were prepared by subcloning the 460-base pairDraI–PvuII exon 3 and 4 fragments of the 18-kDa PBR subunit gene. It was placed into the HincII site of the pENKAT12 plasmid in the antisense orientation with respect to the human enkephalin promoter (pENKPBR-A) (see Fig. 1). The human enkephalin promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct (Fig. 1) showed relatively high levels of basal expression in MA-10 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the same promoter-driven construct was inducible by cAMP analogues (24Comb M. Birnberg N.C. Seasholtz A. Herbert E. Goodman H.M. Nature. 1986; 323: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar).Stable Transfection of MA-10 CellsThe transfection was performed as described previously (22Weisinger G. Zinder O. Simantov R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated a day before transfection (5 × 105 cells/90-mm2 tissue culture dish). On the following day 15 μg of antisense knockout plasmid was routinely cotransfected with 3 μg of the neomycin-resistant plasmid pMC1 NEO poly(A) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In control experiments, the plasmid pENKAT12 was used with pMC1 neo poly(A). Four hours after the transfection, the cells were subjected to glycerol shock for 90 s. The day after transfection, G418 (neomycin analogue) selection (300 μg/ml) was initiated and maintained for 3 weeks, at the end of which time cell colonies were counted and categorized by colony size. The cells were then plated and subjected to different functional assays. Control and 18-kDa PBR mRNA knockout cells were dubbed EnKat and anti-18-kDa PBR cells, respectively.[3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 Binding Assays[3H]PK 11195 (90 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and [3H]Ro 5-4864 (84.5 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were used for binding studies, as described previously (25Awad M. Gavish M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped from 90-mm2 culture dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 5 min. Then the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min.Binding assays contained 400 μl of cell membrane (0.03–0.1 mg of protein/ml) in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 1 μm unlabeled PK 11195 (Pharmuka Laboratories, Gennevilliers, France) or Ro 5-4864 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), up to a final volume of 500 μl. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, samples were filtered under vacuum over Whatman GF/B filters and washed three times with 3 ml of phosphate buffer. Filters were placed in vials containing 4 ml of xylene-Lumax (3:1, v/v; Lumax was purchased from Lumac, Schaesberg, The Netherlands) and counted for radioactivity in a β-scintillation counter after 12 h.The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from saturation curves of [3H]PK 11195 and [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding, using Scatchard analysis.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisRNA was isolated from each of the tissues by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 162: 156-199Crossref Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). RNA (10–50 μg) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and then transferred to Nytran-N (Schleicher & Schuell). After prehybridization for 2 h, membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with32P-labeled DNA probes (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using a 781-base pairEcoRI PBR cDNA fragment. To control for RNA loading variability, membranes were subsequently reprobed with32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA, using a 1600-base pair PstI glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment (28Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Marty L. Dani C. Panabieres F. El Sabouty S. Fort P. Jeanteur P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6951-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). After washing twice with 2 × SSC and 1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C, membranes were exposed for 15 min to a phosphor-imaging screen and analyzed by a phosphor imager (model BAS 1000 MacBos; Fujix, Japan), as well as to x-ray film (Kodak XAR) for 1–3 days at −80 °C.Cell ProliferationCell CountCells were plated in 24-well dishes (5 × 104 cells/well), trypsinized, and counted visually using a hemocytometer every 24 h over a 6-day period (with and without trypan blue staining). The count determined the doubling time and viability of EnKat and anti-PBR cells.Thymidine IncorporationCell cultures at high density were incubated for 4 days without a change of medium. Cells were then trypsinized and plated in 24-well plates (5 × 104cells/well). One hour later, cells were exposed to a benzodiazepine receptor ligand: clonazepam (with very low affinity for PBR), Ro 5-4864 (with very high affinity for the isoquinoline carboxamide-binding protein and voltage-dependent anion channel of the PBR), or the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK 11195 (with high affinity for the isoquinoline carboxamide-binding protein of the PBR).The ligands were dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of ligands in the wells varied over a wide range (10−4 to 10−10m), and the final concentration of Me2SO in all wells was 1%. Subjection to the ligands was immediately followed by the addition of 25 μl of [3H]methyl thymidine (5 Ci/mmol; Rotem Industries, Beer Sheva, Israel) to a final concentration of 1 μm. Cells were incubated for 16 or 26 h, and then each well was washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, and incubated overnight with 500 μl of 1 n NaOH. From each well, 300 μl of extract was put into a vial with 4 ml of scintillation solution and counted in a β-counter.Steroid BiosynthesisCells were plated in 24-well plates (2 × 105cells/well) and incubated overnight. On the following day, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of serum-free medium and then incubated overnight with 1 ml of serum-free medium. A second wash with 2 ml of serum-free medium was performed on the following day, and cells were incubated with 1 ml of serum-free medium for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. Sometimes, 1 mm of 8-bromo-cAMP (Sigma) was added to each well. At the end of each incubation period, media were collected from all wells, and steroids were measured by radioimmunoassay. Progesterone, 20α-dihydroprogesterone (20α- DHP), and estrone were estimated as described by Bauminger et al. (29Bauminger S. Kohen F. Linder H.R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1974; 5: 739-747Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and for androstenedione determination a commercial kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX) was used.Where steroid concentrations are presented (Figs. 4 and 5),n is the total number of similarly treated wells, collected in 1–4 independent experiments. When results from 2–4 experiments were combined, normalization was first conducted within each experiment: Values from individual wells were divided by the mean steroid concentration observed for EnKat cells at 8 h in the same experiment. This mean value was defined as 1, 100, or 1000, so that it would be close to the absolute value (expressed as ng/ml) of this mean.Figure 4Progesterone accumulation in the media of EnKat and anti-18-kDa PBR cells incubated in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 1 mm8-bromo-cAMP.

This exogenous RNA would hybridize with endogenous 18-kDa PBR mRNA, effectively preventing it from replenishing 18-kDa PBR protein. Any important effects 18-kDa PBR might have should then be distinguishable by comparing the particular function of interest in cells containing the 18-kDa PBR antisense vector compared with parallel cultures transfected with control vectors. This study was carried out similarly to previous studies in which the focus was on other genes (22Weisinger G. Zinder O. Simantov R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).To determine whether MA-10 cells receiving the knockout and control vectors would express 18-kDa PBR differently, receptor-binding studies were carried out. Indeed, an approximately 50% reduction in the binding of [3H]PK 11195 was observed in cells expressing the knockout vector, compared with control. We believe that the reason the effect was not complete was that the promoter used to drive the transcription of antisense 18-kDa PBR RNA was not, in untreated MA-10 cells, as strong a promoter as others for this cell type. According to a number of studies, the isoquinoline-binding site may overlap with the benzodiazepine-binding site, but it is not identical (31Gavish M. Bar-Ami S. Weizman R. Giesen-Crouse E. Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors. Academic Press, London1993: 209-234Google Scholar, 32Awad M. Gavish M. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Benavides J.

Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The latter may also reside on the 32-kDa voltage-dependent anion channel, a subunit of the PBR complex (31Gavish M. Bar-Ami S. Weizman R. Giesen-Crouse E. Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors. Academic Press, London1993: 209-234Google Scholar). To address this issue, we compared the binding of the PBR-specific ligand [3H]Ro 5-4864 in these modified cells. In our hands (see Fig. 2, D–F), no significant difference in binding was found between control and 18-kDa PBR subunit knockout cultures. This indicates that, while the 18-kDa PBR subunit is necessary for PBR isoquinoline binding, it may not be absolutely essential for PBR-specific benzodiazepine binding. This could be explained either by the overlapping benzodiazepine/isoquinoline-binding site hypothesis (as mentioned above (31Gavish M. Bar-Ami S. Weizman R. Giesen-Crouse E.

To confirm the findings, we also counted cells of both types over five doubling periods. Our data very clearly showed that there were no overt differences between control and knockout cultures following any of the treatments presented in Fig. 3, as well as without drug addition. This would indicate that the 18-kDa PBR subunit is probably not involved in the regulation of Leydig cell proliferation. In the same series of experiments, a very significant inhibition of cell proliferation was observed at the highest concentration of the drugs used (10−4m). This was observed for control as well as knockout cultures and with PBR-specific drug treatments as well as central benzodiazepine receptor-specific treatments. These effects may be nonspecific, since 10−4m is a very high concentration. Alternatively, these data are consistent with the putative presence of another type of benzodiazepine receptor that does not contain the 18-kDa PBR subunit. Such a notion has already been suggested, in theory (15Gorman A.M.C. O'Beirne G.B. Regan C.M. Williams D.C. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 849-855Cro"
https://openalex.org/W2098494136,"Glycolysis in the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei provides a convenient context for studying the prospects for using enzyme inhibitors as antiparasitic drugs. As the recently developed model of this system (Bakker, B. M., Michels, P. A. M., Opperdoes, F. R., and Westerhoff, H. V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3207–3215) contains 20 enzyme-catalyzed reactions or transport steps, there are apparently numerous potential targets for drugs. However, as most flux control resides in the glucose-transport step, this is the only step for which inhibition can be expected to produce large effects on flux, and in the computer model such effects prove to be surprisingly small (although larger than those obtained by inhibiting any other step). It follows that there is little prospect of killing trypanosomes by depressing their glycolysis to a level incapable of sustaining life. The alternative is to use inhibition to increase the concentration of a metabolite sufficiently to interfere with the viability of the organism. For this purpose, only uncompetitive inhibition of pyruvate export proves effective in the model; in all other cases studied, the effects on metabolite concentrations are little more than trivial. This observation can be explained by the fact that nearly all of the metabolite concentrations in the system are held within relatively narrow ranges by stoichiometric constraints.

This observation can be explained by the fact that nearly all of the metabolite concentrations in the system are held within relatively narrow ranges by stoichiometric constraints. Detailed information exists about metabolism in a wide variety of organisms, but there has been little success in designing moleculesab initio to realize specific metabolic objectives. For drugs intended to correct metabolic deficiencies, this is perhaps not surprising, but even drugs intended to eliminate particular pathogenic organisms (in principle, a much easier objective, as there must be many different ways of killing a healthy organism, even if there are extremely few ways of restoring an unhealthy one to health) mostly have rather broad specificity or they have been found more by chance than design. In this paper, we examine why the level of success has been so low, taking the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei as an example. It is attractive for study because it is the causative agent of a major disease, African sleeping sickness, because its metabolism has been well studied, and because the kinetic properties of its glycolytic enzymes are known in as much detail as is available for any organism, thanks mainly to the efforts of Opperdoes and colleagues (for reviews, see Refs. 1Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Hannaert V. Michels P.A.M. J. Bioenerg.

The glycolytic pathway is an attractive target because the predominant bloodstream form of T. bruceihas no energy resources, and relies entirely on rapid glycolysis for its energy supply. Indeed, the ability to kill trypanosomes by halting glycolysis was demonstrated 20 years ago (5Clarkson Jr., A.B. Brohn F.H. Science. 1976; 194: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Nature. 1977; 265: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glycolysis in T. brucei has recently been the subject of a detailed kinetic model (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) that allows numerical testing of the likely metabolic consequences of inhibiting particular enzymes. Such testing is apparently not usually done, partly because suitable models are not available for many other organisms, but more particularly because it is commonly regarded as unnecessary, as it is assumed that delivering a specific inhibitor of a selected enzyme to the appropriate location will produce metabolic effects. This attitude is well illustrated by a recent supplement toNature entitled “Intelligent Drug Design”; this contains a general introduction (8Petsko G.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 7-9PubMed Google Scholar), as well as articles on combinatorial chemistry (9Verdine G.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 11-13PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hogan Jr., J.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 17-19PubMed Google Scholar), improvements in screening procedures (11Broach J.R. Thorner J. Nature. 1996; 384: 14-16PubMed Google Scholar), antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (12Matteucci M.D. Wagner R.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 20-22PubMed Google Scholar), and methods of determining three-dimensional structures (13Blundell T.R. Nature. 1996; 384: 23-26PubMed Google Scholar). These are important aspects of drug design, but the entire supplement neither mentions the words “metabolic” and “metabolism” nor shows any recognition that intelligent drug design must involve some consideration of the metabolic effects of the drugs once they have been designed. The easiest inhibitors to design are substrate analogs, because they are likely to bind specifically to the active sites of the same enzymes as the substrates they resemble, and commonly act as competitive inhibitors. Unfortunately, as a strategy for designing pharmacologically active molecules, this approach is doomed to almost certain failure, because most such molecules do not bind much tighter than the substrates, and so it is difficult or impossible to deliver them to the target enzyme at concentrations that greatly exceed their inhibition constants. Concentrations similar to or lower than the inhibition constants are almost totally ineffective, because an organism can easily overcome competitive inhibition by increasing the substrate concentration enough to restore the rate to that in the absence of the inhibitor (14Cornish-Bowden A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); the increase in substrate concentration necessary for this is typically around 2-fold. There are two basic metabolic methods of killing an organism. Either the flux through an essential metabolic pathway can be decreased to the point where life is no longer possible, or a metabolite concentration can be increased to toxic levels. Although both of these are likely to involve enzyme inhibition, they are not the same, because depressing fluxes need not be accompanied by large changes in metabolite concentration, and enormous increases in metabolite concentration can occur with almost imperceptible changes in flux. The former will normally require a tight-binding inhibitor of an enzyme with a significant flux control coefficient, whereas the latter is most effectively achieved with an uncompetitive inhibitor of an enzyme with a small flux control coefficient. Many successful pesticides and drugs are tight-binding inhibitors, but these are difficult to design because of the need to deliver and maintain concentrations at least 1000-fold higher than the inhibition constants. A few pesticides are uncompetitive inhibitors, the best-known example being the herbicideN-phosphonomethylglycine, commonly known as glyphosate or Roundup, an uncompetitive inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (15Boocock M.R. Coggins J.R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The model of trypanosomal glycolysis developed by Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) provides an excellent starting point for assessing effects of inhibition in whole pathways, as not only is a large amount of detailed kinetic information embedded in it, but also because the model gives an excellent account of the known properties of intact trypanosomes. One apparent exception to this generalization, the prediction that there is significant glycerol production under aerobic conditions despite some experimental suggestions to the contrary, may, as discussed below, reflect problems with the experiments rather than with the model. Glycolysis occurs in trypanosomes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Most of the reactions, together with those that transform dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glycerol, occur in a special organelle known as the glycosome. The stoichiometry implies the existence of four distinct pools of conserved metabolites, of which three are obvious from inspection; the sums [ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP] are constant both in the cytosol and in the glycosome, and the sum [NAD] + [NADH] in the glycosome is likewise constant. The fourth relationship, however, is not easy to deduce without mathematical analysis of the kind pioneered by Reder (16Reder C. J. Theor. Biol. 1988; 135: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). ρ{[glycerol3P]c+[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]c}+[glycerol3P]+[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]+[glucose6P]+Equation 1 [fructose6P]+2[fructose1,6P2]+[glyceraldehyde3P]+[1,3­P2­glycerate]+2[ATP]+[ADP]=constant Here and elsewhere in this paper, the subscript crefers to concentrations of species in the cytosol, and concentrations without subscripts refer to species in the glycosome. The volume ratio ρ is the ratio of the cytosolic and glycosomal volumes, estimated to be 22.3 (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It enters the relationship because, although in single-compartment systems one may loosely regard the total concentration as being conserved, it is really mass that is conserved. The simpler expression in single-compartment systems is allowed only because then there is an exact proportionality between concentration and mass. As the conservation relationships are automatically recognized and taken into account by the modeling program (see below), one might regard them as a complication that did not require discussion. However, the fact that all of the metabolites in the glycosome, apart from glucose, glycerol, inorganic phosphate, and 3-phosphoglycerate, are subject to conservation constraints places severe limits on the enzymes that may be profitable targets for drug design, as we discuss below. It is important therefore to recognize the nature of the relationship shown in Equation 1. Although most of the phosphorylated metabolites in the glycosome form part of it, 3-phosphoglycerate does not, and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate has a coefficient of 1 in the equation even though it contains two phosphate groups. In fact, the conserved moiety is that part of the internal phosphate pool that is not accounted for by entry of inorganic phosphate and export of 3-phosphoglycerate. All of the processes in the model apart from the aldolase reaction and the consumption of ATP for growth (see below) are either equilibria or can be expressed by introducing the kinetic constants listed in Table I into the following generic equation (in a few cases with exponents or additional terms, as noted in the footnotes to the table). v=V+S1S2Ks1Ks2−V−P1P2Kp1Kp21+S1Ks1+P1Kp11+S2Ks2+P2Kp2Equation 2 Table IKinetic constantsProcess: S1+ S2 = P1 +P2V+V−Ks1Ks2Kp1Kp2mmmmmmmmGlucose transport,1-aFor glucose transport there is an additional term αS1 P1/(Ks1 Kp2) in the denominator of Equation 2, with α = 0.75./Glcx = Glc106.2106.222Hexokinase, ATP + Glc = ADP + Glc6P62500.1160.10.126∞Hexose-P isomerase, Glc6P = Fru6PEquilibrium withP1/S1 = 0.29Phosphofructokinase,1-bS1 and Ks1 are raised to the power 1.2 in Equation 2./Fru6P + ATP = FruP2 + ADP78000.820.026∞∞Aldolase, FruP2 = Gla3P + DHAPSee Equations 3 and 4 in the textTriose-P isomerase, DHAP = Gla3PEquilibrium withP1/S1 = 0.045Glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase, Gla3P + NAD = GbisP + NADH14709800.150.450.10.023-P-glycerate kinase, GbisP + ADP = 3PG + ATP64018.50.050.11.620.29P-Glycerate mutase, enolase, PEP transport, 3PG = PEPcEquilibrium withP1/S1 = 1.25Pyruvate kinase,1-cS1 and Ks1 are raised to the power 2.5 in Equation 2, and Ks1 is given by 0.34 · (1 mm + [ATP]c/0.57 + [ADP]c/0.64).

With three exceptions, these definitions result in kinetic equations identical to those given by Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For the mitochondrial oxidation of glycerol 3-phosphate, however, we have used the results of Eisenthal and Panes (17Eisenthal R. Panes A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181 (correction (1985) FEBS Lett. 190, 185): 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to include an explicit dependence of rate on oxygen concentration. Our equation gives exactly the behavior assumed by Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) at the extremes of aerobiosis and anaerobiosis, but it also takes account of the observed effects of intermediate oxygen concentrations (17Eisenthal R. Panes A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181 (correction (1985) FEBS Lett. 190, 185): 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In view of the considerations discussed below under “The Transition from Aerobic to Anaerobic Conditions,” we also prefer not to assume zero activity for glycerol kinase in aerobic conditions, and thus use the kinetic constants given in Table I at all oxygen concentrations. The third exception is pyruvate kinase, which Bakker et al.(7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) treated as irreversible, with the kinetic constants shown in Table I, quite reasonably so in the conditions they studied, in view of the large equilibrium constant and the low steady-state concentration of pyruvate. However, as we shall be studying effects of inhibiting pyruvate export, and it is impossible for pyruvate to accumulate to very high levels without producing any mass action effects on the earlier steps, we need to allow for reversibility, however slight, of the pyruvate kinase reaction. We have therefore set the equilibrium constant K to 3 × 105, calculated from the value of ΔG°′ = −7.5 kcal mol−1 (18Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Worth, New York1975: 431Google Scholar), and in the absence of experimental information have approximatedKpyruvate and KATP byKPEP and KADP, respectively. v=V[PEP]cKPEP[ADP]cKADP1−[pyruvate]c[ATP]cK[PEP]c[ADP]c[PEP]cKPEP+[pyruvate]cKpyruvateh−11+[PEP]cKPEP+[pyruvate]cKPyruvateh1+[ADP]cKADP+[ATP]cKATPEquation 5 This equation gives exactly the kinetics defined in Table I when the two product concentrations are zero, and it gives a rate of zero under any equilibrium conditions. The need to satisfy both of these requirements simultaneously accounts for the apparently excessive complexity of the equation, which is written in accordance with the principles discussed elsewhere (19Hofmeyr J.-H.S. Cornish-Bowden A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar). Steady states for the model as defined in the previous section were calculated by means of the program Gepasi 3.01, described (in an earlier version) by Mendes (20Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar). 1The Gepasi software is available via the World Wide Web (http://gepasi.dbs.aber.ac.uk/softw/gep3dwld.html). Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M.

We have checked that Gepasi gives the same numerical results as those reported (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol.

Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 89-93PubMed Google Scholar), but this proved incapable of handling a model of the required complexity. Bakker et al. (24Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Westerhoff H.V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) resides in glucose transport when the transporter has the level of activity measured in the bloodstream form of T. brucei, and we have confirmed that this is correct. We have also examined the changes in control distribution that result from allowing for the reverse reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. Although the fact that this reaction is far from equilibrium under all ordinary conditions would suggest that taking account of its reversibility would have a trivial effect, the change is rather more than trivial; the flux control coefficient for pyruvate transport is exactly zero in the conditions considered by Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M.

BioThermoKinetics Press, Amsterdam1996: 136-142Google Scholar), but it assumes the second largest value when the reverse pyruvate kinase reaction is taken into account. Nonetheless, it remains true that glucose transport has the largest share of flux control and that no other process has a major share. Bakkeret al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) assumed that glycerol kinase had no activity in aerobic conditions. They introduced this discontinuity into their model to obtain a zero efflux of glycerol under those conditions. The question of glycerol production from glucose is one that has been addressed by several groups of workers. Simple consideration of the metabolic scheme shown in Fig. 1 might be taken as predicting the production of 2 mol of pyruvate/mol of glucose consumed under aerobic conditions, and 1 mol each of pyruvate and glycerol/mol of glucose used under anaerobiosis (1Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, glycerol/pyruvate ratios in the range 0.1–0.4 have been observed under aerobic conditions (17Eisenthal R. Panes A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181 (correction (1985) FEBS Lett. 190, 185): 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Ryley J.F. Biochem.

J. 1962; 85: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similar results were found by Fairlamb and Bowman (28Fairlamb A.H. Bowman I.B.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1980; 49: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), who ascribed the presence of glycerol in aerobic incubations of trypanosomes with glucose to experimental artifacts. In all these investigations, measurements were performed under fully aerobic or fully anaerobic conditions, the latter including anaerobiosis simulated by inhibition of glycerophosphate oxidase by salicylhydroxamic acid. However, a systematic study (17Eisenthal R. Panes A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181 (correction (1985) FEBS Lett. 190, 185): 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of the ratio of glycerol and pyruvate effluxes over a range of oxygen concentrations from zero to 0.25 mm showed that the efflux of glycerol does not fall to zero in aerobic conditions, but stabilizes at about 10% of the efflux of pyruvate, exactly as the model of Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) would predict if glycerol kinase had the same activity in aerobic as in anaerobic conditions. We have therefore made a detailed comparison between the experimental data and the model with glycerol kinase active, and find a high degree of agreement (Fig. 2). Even if the curve were a best-fit curve, one could consider the fit quite adequate, but given that it is calculated independently from the data (apart from the fact that the same experimental data were the source of the KO2 value defined in Table I), the fit is essentially perfect. With glycerol kinase active in all conditions, therefore, the model accounts not only for the behavior at the extremes of oxygen concentration but also for the transition between the two. It is a striking illustration of the robustness of the model that it proves able to predict behavior that was not taken into account during its construction. Bakker et al. (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) partially justified their assumption that glycerol kinase is inactive under aerobic conditions by pointing out that a very low external glycerol concentration would be sufficient to inhibit glycerol efflux completely. We have confirmed that this is true, but point out that unless this external concentration happened to have precisely the right value it would bring the efflux not necessarily to zero but to some other value, which could be either positive or negative. At higher external glycerol concentrations, it can act as an alternative substrate to glucose for aerobic metabolism, not only in the model but also experimentally (27Ryley J.F. Biochem. J. 1962; 85: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Bakker et al. (24Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Westerhoff H.V. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Wijker J.E. Sluse F.E. Kholodenko B.N. BioThermoKinetics of the Living Cell. BioThermoKinetics Press, Amsterdam1996: 136-142Google Scholar) found the step with the highest degree of control over trypanosome growth to be glucose transport, and we have confirmed that this remains true if the reversibility of pyruvate kinase is taken into account, although its flux control coefficient in this case (0.34) is too small for it or any other reaction to be regarded as rate-limiting. It follows that, if the objective of designing a drug is to prevent trypanosomes from achieving a viable metabolic flux, then the only realistic candidate for the step to be inhibited is glucose transport, although it has so little control that one cannot be optimistic that a large depression of growth can be produced by inhibiting it. Inhibition of any other step can be expected to have even less effect on the metabolic flux unless the degree of inhibition is very high. Use of the model to simulate the effects of inhibiting glucose transport confirmed these expectations; for example, the presence of a competitive inhibitor at a concentration equal to its inhibition constant, simulated by adding a term equal to unity to the denominator of the rate equation, produced a flux through glucose transport of 79% of the uninhibited flux, but the growth flux, i.e. the net production of ATP, decreased only to about 85% of the uninhibited value. This result has depressing implications for the prospects of lowering a flux to a non-viable level as a strategy for pest control. First, it is clear that for decreasing the flux only glucose transport will do; inhibiting any other step is likely to be futile unless the level of inhibition that can be achieved is high enough to eliminate the enzyme activity virtually completely and permanently. Second, the effects of inhibiting glucose transport are not impressive. Decreasing the growth flux by 15% is unlikely to eliminate the trypanosomes unless the inhibition can be maintained for a substantial period. A mitigating feature may be that flux control coefficients do not remain constant when the conditions are altered, and, as Bakkeret al. (24Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Westerhoff H.V. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Wijker J.E. Sluse F.E. Kholodenko B.N. BioThermoKinetics of the Living Cell. BioThermoKinetics Press, Amsterdam1996: 136-142Google Scholar) pointed out, a step that appears to have insignificant control in normal conditions may acquire sufficient control in special circumstances to be a worthwhile target for inhibitors. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether this approach can work in practice, or even in the computer model. An alternative strategy to decreasing the carbohydrate flux would be to cause a metabolite concentration to rise to catastrophic levels. At first sight, the fact that nearly all of the steps in the model have very little control over flux suggests that there are many candidates for enzymes that could be inhibited to produce an uncontrolled accumulation of their substrates. In fact, the choice is far more restricted than it may appear because the numerous conservation relationships mean that very few metabolite concentrations can rise in an uncontrolled manner. Pyruvate transport is one of the few processes that is not involved in conservation relationships. Although it has a flux control coefficient of zero (24Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Westerhoff H.V. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Wijker J.E. Sluse F.E. Kholodenko B.N. BioThermoKinetics of the Living Cell. BioThermoKinetics Press, Amsterdam1996: 136-142Google Scholar) in the model as originally described (7Bakker B.M. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. Westerhoff H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3207-3215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), this rises to about 0.2 when pyruvate kinase is made reversible. This is still low enough to suggest that it responds approximately to inhibition like a constant-flux enzyme. Earlier studies (14Cornish-Bowden A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. 2nd Ed. Portland Press, London1995: 247-249Google Scholar) of such enzymes showed that competitive inhibition causes the substrate concentration to rise linearly, being doubled by an inhibitor concentration equal to the inhibition constant; by contrast, uncompetitive inhibition produces an infinite substrate concentration (i.e. no steady state exists) at a finite inhibitor concentration. To put this more concretely, consider the inclusion in the kinetics of pyruvate transport of a term allowing for inhibition by a hypothetical uncompetitive inhibitor, Iu, with inhibition constantKiu. v=V[pyruvate]Kpyruvate+[pyruvate](1+[Iu]/Kiu)Equation 6 This may be transformed into the following form (cf.Equation 10.11 of Ref. 29Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. 2nd Ed. Portland Press, London1995: 247-249Google Scholar) to give the pyruvate concentration as a function of inhibitor concentration when the flux is constant. [Pyruvate]=KpyruvateVv−1−[Iu]KiuEquation 7 Because the computation indicated that this process is well over half-saturated, only a small value of [Iu]/Kiu is needed to drive the system into instability. Now, it may be argued that impressive as this effect of uncompetitive inhibition may be it has little practical usefulness, as uncompetitive inhibitors are not common and are difficult to design. However, there is no objection to the presence of a competitive component,i.e. mixed inhibition will work just as well as uncompetitive, the only requirement being that the inhibitor concentration must exceed some small factor of the inhibition constant for the uncompetitive component; whether or not a competitive component is also present, and its magnitude if it is present, is almost irrelevant. As illustrated in Fig. 3, this simplified analysis based on the kinetics of one irreversible enzyme gives results that are approximately but not exactly correct. In the case of competitive inhibition of pyruvate transport, there is virtually no decrease in flux for [I]/Kic values up to 1, and consequently the curve showing the dependence of the pyruvate concentration on the inhibitor concentration is indistinguishable by eye from a straight line. For other types of inhibition, the flux decreases appreciably as the degree of inhibition increases; consequently, although the pyruvate concentration does rise extremely steeply, the slope does not continue increasing indefinitely (seeinset to Fig. 3). Indeed, the pyruvate concentration itself must eventually level out when the entire system approaches equilibrium. However, the equilibrium concentration of pyruvate is far higher than could ever be reached in practice, and so it remains true that even in a complete system with reversible kinetics inhibition by an uncompetitive or mixed inhibitor can produce toxic levels of substrate at low inhibitor concentrations. The model upon which this analysis is based is a metabolic one, and does not take into account transcription and translation. However, the high glycolytic flux in the predominant long slender (bloodstream) form of T. bruceimeans that metabolic effects will be manifested far more rapidly than events depending on protein synthesis. A similar conclusion is likely to apply also to possible host-parasite interactions, e.g.at the immunological level, but this will have to be confirmed by studies in vivo. Inhibition of other steps produced much less dramatic results than those illustrated in Fig. 3, regardless of the type of inhibition. At first sight this was surprising, as the elementary theory (14Cornish-Bowden A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggested that uncompetitive inhibition of any enzyme with little control over flux would produce very large increases in the substrate concentration. The results will be illustrated by some data for hexokinase, although similar ones were obtained with other apparently promising candidates, such as aldolase. To allow for various possible modes of inhibition of hexokinase, its kinetic equation was rewritten as follows. v=V[ATP]KATP[Glc]KGlc1+ιc,ATP+[ATP](1+ιu,ATP)KATP+[ADP]KADP1+ιc,Glc+[Glc](1+ιu,Glc)KGlcEquation 8 In this equation ιc,ATP, ιu,ATP, ιc,Glc, and ιu,Glc are dimensionless inhibition terms allowing for competitive or uncompetitive inhibition with respect to ATP and with respect to glucose (each can be regarded as a concentration divided by the appropriate inhibition constant). When all are set to zero, Equation 8 gives identical kinetics to Table I. Effects of assigning non-zero values are shown in Table II.Table IIEffects of inhibiting hexokinaseInhibition conditions[Glc][ATP][Glc6P][ADP]Glucose transportGrowth fluxmmmmmmmmNo inhibition0.045171.0110.44071.66973.80135.0ιc,ATP = 0.50.046221.0190.44041.67073.75134.9ιc,ATP = 100.065331.1790.43441.67272.90134.2ιu,ATP = 0.20.048921.0420.43951.67273.63134.8ιu,ATP = 201.7883.7420.18380.154828.0955.98ιc,Glc = 0.20.051591.0640.43861.67373.51134.7ιc,Glc = 100.21802.3230.39581.26966.58127.2ιu,Glc = 0.20.048331.0370.43971.67173.66134.9ιu,Glc = 201.8083.7440.18200.152627.7855.36 Open table in a new tab Although some non-trivial effects on both concentrations and the flux are visible in the table, they are far smaller than those seen in Fig. 3, and occur at much higher levels of inhibition, because none of the relevant concentrations can increase in an uncontrolled manner. The concentration of glucose 6-phosphate is constrained by Equation 1, and those of ATP and ADP are constrained both by Equation 1 and by the general conservation of adenine nucleotides. Their concentrations cannot therefore increase by more than small factors. Although glycosomal glucose does not appear in Equation 1 or the other conservation relationships, its concentration is also constrained by the fact that it cannot rise above the concentration of glucose in the host bloodstream, which means that it cannot increase by more than a factor of about 90. Analogous studies were also made of some other enzymes, such as aldolase, that appeared to have non-negligible flux control, with similar results. Our analysis of effects of inhibiting particular steps in trypanosomal glycolysis has several implications for antimetabolite drugs in general, because little of it depends on specific characteristics of the model considered. First of all, destroying a parasite by decreasing its metabolic flux to a level that cannot sustain life is a less attractive option than it may appear at first sight. Unless a specific irreversible inhibitor is available that can decrease an enzyme activity to zero, the effects of inhibition on flux are usually much smaller than studies on the isolated enzyme may suggest. This is because few enzymes have flux control coefficients close to unity, and the effect of a low inhibitor concentration on the flux in an integrated system is therefore always smaller than the effect on the isolated enzyme. Although the flux control coefficient of almost any enzyme increases as it is inhibited, the increase is gradual, and, as illustrated for glucose transport in the trypanosome, inhibiting even the enzyme with the highest flux control coefficient is likely to produce disappointing results. Increasing the concentration of a metabolite to toxic levels by uncompetitive inhibition (or mixed inhibition with a perceptible uncompetitive component) is also not straightforward, for more than the obvious reason that uncompetitive inhibitors are not easy to find or design. Although this strategy works very effectively if applied to an appropriate enzyme or transporter (illustrated with pyruvate transport in Fig. 3), the choice of appropriate enzymes is far more limited than it may appear at first sight, because the inhibited step must have a substrate whose concentration is not limited by the stoichiometry of the network. For the model illustrated in Fig. 1, such stoichiometric considerations exclude nearly all of the steps, because nearly all of the intermediates are involved in one or more conservation relationships. Even glucose, although not part of one of these relationships, is limited by the fact that its concentration in the glycosome cannot rise above the concentration in the host bloodstream. This last limitation will be even more severe in other organisms, because few have glucose concentrations as low as that found in the glycosome of T. brucei, which has one of the highest levels of glycolytic activity known in eukaryotic cells. It follows that analyzing the stoichiometric structure of a network is not just an abstract topic of mainly theoretical interest, but has major practical implications. Without carrying out the analysis, few would realize that the concentrations of nearly all of the metabolites in Fig. 1 are constrained by stoichiometric considerations. When the stoichiometric constraints are taken into account, the only realistic candidates for inhibition are pyruvate transport, glycerol transport, and the three reactions between 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate lumped together as step 9. The last two are ruled out by the fact that they are assumed to be at equilibrium, and glycerol transport is additionally ruled out by the fact that, under aerobic conditions, it has such a low rate of efflux that some authors have doubted whether it occurs at all. Fortunately, the one remaining candidate, pyruvate transport, proved to respond to inhibition as expected. Thus, there is good reason to believe that, if an inhibitor of pyruvate transport with a sufficient uncompetitive component could be found, it would be expected to have powerful anti-trypanosomal activity. We thank Dr. Barbara Bakker for sending us a copy of her recent paper several months before it was published, and we also thank Dr. Pedro Mendes for making his program Gepasi available and for considerable help in resolving problems with its use."

During NO synthesis, NADPH-derived electrons pass through the flavins and across domains to the heme iron (4Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NOS isoforms that are expressed in neurons (nNOS) and endothelium (eNOS) bind CaM reversibly in response to elevated Ca2+levels, and this enables them to participate in biological signal cascades by coupling production of a mediator (NO) to transient rises in intracellular Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 6Forstermann U.

Our studies with nNOS show that CaM controls electron transfer at two points in the enzyme (Fig. 1, upper panel): it increases the rate at which NADPH-derived electrons transfer into the enzyme flavins (9Abu-Soud H.M.

The CaM-dependent increase in flavin reduction is associated with an enhanced rate of electron transfer from nNOS to artificial electron acceptors such as cytochrome c or ferricyanide (9Abu-Soud H.M.

Thus, our current model for CaM-nNOS interaction links acquisition of domain-specific catalytic functions to activation of electron transfer at two distinct points within nNOS (Fig. 1). To further explore this model, we utilized chimeras of CaM and a homologous Ca2+ signaling protein, cardiac troponin C (TnC). CaM and TnC show striking structural similarities (Fig. 1,lower panel): they are 50% identical at the amino acid level, and both contain 4 EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains, arranged as globular pairs separated by a long central helix (15Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this structural similarity, TnC can neither bind to nor activate nNOS (7Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of the divergence between structure and function, CaM-TnC chimeras are informative probes of the CaM-nNOS interaction (7Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8George S.E. Su Z. Fan D. Wang S. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8307-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, several CaM-TnC chimeras bound avidly to nNOS, yet failed to activate NO synthesis by the enzyme, whereas others both bound and activated. This demonstrated that enzyme binding and stimulation of NO synthesis are distinct and separable. The initial studies further established that the domain 1-domain 3 “latch” region of CaM played a critical role in inducing NO production (8George S.E. Su Z. Fan D. Wang S. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8307-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we use seven CaM-TnC chimeras to investigate 1) how CaM promotes electron transfer into the nNOS reductase domain, 2) how CaM promotes electron transfer between the reductase domain and the oxygenase domain heme iron, and 3) how CaM's promotion of electron transfer at each point correlates with its activation of two domain-specific catalytic functions (cytochrome c reduction and NO synthesis). We find that CaM-TnC chimeras differentially activate the two nNOS catalytic activities, thus providing the first evidence for CaM mutations that produce abortive or partial activation of an enzyme's function. Also, while promotion of internal electron transfer in nNOS correlated well with a given chimera's ability to activate NO synthesis, it correlated poorly with activation of cytochrome c reduction, revealing that CaM can activate reductase domain catalysis by a mechanism other than stimulating electron transfer into the domain. Rat brain nNOS was expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system and purified as described previously (16Harteneck C. Klatt P. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The recombinant nNOS reductase domain (amino acids 724–1429) containing the CaM binding site was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (12Gachhui R. Presta A.

The initial rate of NO synthesis was quantitated at 37 °C using the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay. Reactions contained nNOS (0.5–2 μg) in 40 mm BisTris propane, pH 7.4, supplemented with 5–10 μm oxyhemoglobin, 0.3 mm DTT, 1 mml-arginine, 0.1 mm NADPH, 4 μm each of FAD, FMN, and H4biopterin, 0.83 mm Ca2+, 2 μm CaM or CaM-TnC chimeras, 0.6 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, to give a final volume of 0.35 ml. In some cases, concentrations above 2 μm were used for certain CaM-TnC chimeras as noted in the text. The NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored over time as an absorbance increase at 401 nm and quantitated using a difference extinction coefficient of 38 mm−1 cm−1 (17Kelm M. Feelisch M. Spahr R. Piper H.M. Noack E.A. Schrader J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The rate of NADPH oxidation was measured at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm−1 cm−1. Reactions were run at 37 °C in cuvettes or at 25 °C in microplates and supplemented identically as in the oxyhemoglobin assay except oxyhemoglobin was omitted. Assay volumes were 0.35 ml for cuvettes and 0.15 ml for microwell plates. The NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c was measured at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1. Reactions were run in cuvettes or microplates using assay conditions as described for monitoring NADPH oxidation, except that the buffer omitted DTT and H4biopterin and contained 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.1 mm cytochrome c, and 100-fold less nNOS. Reactions were started by adding NADPH. Anaerobic spectra were recorded using septum-sealed quartz cuvettes that could be attached through a ground glass joint to a vaccum and gas train. Enzyme samples, EDTA, and CaM or CaM-TnC chimeras were placed in the cuvette and made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and equilibration with catalyst-deoxygenated nitrogen. Buffer plus additives were evacuated and gassed with nitrogen in a separate vessel. Solutions were transferred using gas-tight syringes, and cuvettes were maintained under positive pressure during spectral measurements. The kinetics of flavin reduction and CO binding were analyzed as described previously (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a stopped-flow apparatus from Hi-Tech Ltd. (model SF-51) equipped for anaerobic work. Measurements were carried out at 10 °C and initiated by rapid mixing a anaerobic solution of 100 μm NADPH (in some cases saturated with CO) with an anaerobic solution containing CaM-free, CaM-bound, or chimera-bound NOS (2 μm) in 40 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm H4biopterin, 0.3 mm DTT, 2 mml-arginine, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 μm CaM or chimeras, and 1 mmCa2+. Flavin reduction was monitored at 485 nm and CO binding monitored at 444 nm. Signal-to-noise ratios were improved by averaging at least 10 individual experiments. The time course of absorbance change was fit to single or multiple exponential equations by use of a nonlinear least square method provided by the instrument manufacturer (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of each CaM-TnC chimera to activate two nNOS reactions that depend on electron transfer to the oxygenase domain heme iron (NO synthesis and coincident NADPH oxidation) or to enhance a reductase domain-specific reaction (cytochrome c reduction) is summarized in Fig. 2. Effects on cytochrome c reduction were investigated using both full-length nNOS and the recombinant nNOS reductase domain (amino acids 724–1429; Ref. 12Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to determine if an attached oxygenase domain would affect response to each chimera. In all cases, the chimeras were present during assay at concentrations previously shown to saturate nNOS (8George S.E. Su Z. Fan D. Wang S. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8307-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of seven CaM-TnC chimeras tested, only those containing TnC domain 2, the central helix, or helix 7, activated nNOS NO synthesis to a level that approached native CaM. In contrast, chimeras substituted with TnC domains 4, 3, or 1 lost most or all of their ability to activate this reaction. The relative importance of the nonfunctional Ca2+binding site that is present in domain 1 of CaM 1TnC was probed by utilizing a chimera whose domain 1 Ca2+ binding site had been restored (CaM 1TnC BM1). This chimera supported a small but detectable activation of NO synthesis. Thus, while Ca2+binding in domain 1 appears to be essential, structural features not involved in Ca2+ binding are also required to fully activate NO synthesis. We conclude that nNOS displays a high degree of structural specificity toward CaM domains 1, 3, and possibly 4 regarding activation of NO synthesis. Our NO synthesis values were initial rate measurements using the oxyhemoglobin NO capture assay. In general, they confirm results that were obtained using a citrulline formation end point assay (7Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), with the exception of the CaM 4TnC chimera, which here showed only 13% activation of NO synthesis as compared with 45% activation relative to CaM in the previous report (7Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the basis for the difference is unclear, our current data imply that CaM domain 4 may be more important in activating NO synthesis than previously thought. Restricting the TnC domain 4 substitution to helix 7 increased the chimera's ability to activate NO synthesis such that it supported 35% activation relative to CaM. This suggests that elements in domain 4 besides helix 7 also function to activate NO synthesis (8George S.E. Su Z. Fan D. Wang S. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8307-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As is evident in Fig. 2, increased rates of NADPH oxidation above the basal level were only observed for chimeras that also activated NO synthesis, and in all cases the magnitude of NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis were close to the expected stoichiometry of 1.5 NADPH oxidized per NO formed from l-arginine. Thus, the chimeras mimicked CaM in stimulating coupled NADPH consumption, consistent with their functioning through a common mechanism that involves activating electron transfer to the heme iron (4Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Regarding cytochrome c reduction, the full-length nNOS and the nNOS reductase domain responded similarly toward each chimera, as they do toward native CaM (12Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, CaM and the chimeras both increase cytochrome c reduction by exclusively activating the nNOS reductase domain (10Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 12Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All chimeras increased nNOS cytochrome c reduction to some extent over the CaM-free value, although those containing TnC domains 2, 4, 3, or 1 stimulated progressively less reductase activity relative to CaM. Reconstituting Ca2+ binding in TnC domain 1 (i.e. CaM 1TnC BM1) enhanced cytochrome c reduction only by a factor of two, indicating that elements throughout domain 1 are important for CaM function. In general, activation of cytochrome c reduction was far less sensitive to the single domain substitutions than was NO synthesis. For example, the chimeras containing TnC domains 4, 3, or 1 all activated different degrees of cytochrome c reduction but supported either minor or no activation of NO synthesis. The divergence was most striking for CaM 3TnC, which activated 30% maximal reductase activity despite activating no NO synthesis, and for CaM 4TnC, which activated 60% maximal reductase activity versus13% maximal NO synthesis. The divergence was least striking for CaM 1TnC, which activated little cytochrome c reduction and no NO synthesis. Thus, CaM domains 3 and 4 are important for activating catalysis by the nNOS oxygenase domain (NO synthesis) but are relatively unimportant for activating reductase domain catalysis (cytochrome c reduction). In contrast, CaM domain 1 is critical for activating catalytic functions of both the nNOS oxygenase and reductase domains. Certain CaM-TnC chimeras could stimulate nNOS cytochrome creduction without activating NO synthesis. However, the converse situation (i.e. activation of NO synthesis without increasing cytochrome c reductase activity) was not observed for any chimera. Together, this provides the first evidence that CaM can control these two catalytic functions independently and argues that CaM activation of reductase domain catalysis is an associated but singularly insufficient step in activating NO synthesis. CaM is known to increase the rate at which NADPH electrons load into the nNOS flavins (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to trigger electron transfer between the flavins and heme iron (4Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We had proposed earlier that CaM' s effect on electron transfer at these two points may be the mechanism by which it enhances cytochrome c reduction and initiates NO synthesis, respectively (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stuehr D.J. Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Feldman P.L. Wang J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore examined each chimera's ability to influence electron transfer into the flavin and heme centers of nNOS. The psuedo first-order rate constants for flavin and heme iron reduction are listed in Table I, and stopped-flow traces for selected samples are illustrated in Fig. 3,A and B. NADPH-dependent heme iron reduction was not observed in CaM-free nNOS (data not shown), consistent with previous results (4Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar,14Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, heme iron reduction in CaM-bound nNOS (as measured by CO binding) 2CaM does not appear to significantly affect the nNOS heme iron environment or block ligand access (23Gerber N.C. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6285-6290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). was complete within 1 s, indicating rapid reduction occurs under these conditions. 3The rate of CO binding observed for CaM-bound nNOS under these conditions matched the rate of CO binding to ferrous nNOS, indicating that the actual rate of heme reduction may be faster than CO binding in this case. The two chimeras that failed to activate NO synthesis (CaM 3TnC and CaM 1TnC) did not support detectable heme iron reduction in the stopped-flow experiment. We also incubated these two particular nNOS-chimera complexes with NADPH for 45 min under an anaerobic CO atmosphere but still observed no CO binding, although both bound CO immediately after addition of dithionite (not shown), which directly reduces the nNOS heme iron (4Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This indicates the CaM 3TnC and CaM 1TnC chimeras are completely unable to support electron transfer between the flavin and heme centers of nNOS. Chimeras that supported a slow rate of NO synthesis (for example, 8% relative to control; CaM 1TNC BM1) or a near-normal rate (70%; CaM 2TnC) activated a slow or near-normal rate of heme iron reduction, respectively. Regarding nNOS flavin reduction, three of the chimeras tested (CaM 1TnC, CaM 3TnC, and CaM 1TnC BM1) increased the rate of flavin reduction minimally (≤5%) compared with native CaM. On the other hand, CaM 2TnC increased the rate of flavin reduction to a level approaching native CaM, while others (CaM (CH TnC) and CaM (helix 7 TnC)) increased the rate to ∼40% that of CaM.Table IObserved rate constants for NADPH-dependent flavin and heme iron reduction by nNOS-chimera complexesProteinkobs (s−1)Flavin reductionHeme iron reductionnNOS2.80nNOS/CaM333.6nNOS/CaM 1TnC3.60nNOS/CaM 1TnC BM12.90.56nNOS/CaM 2TnC291.7nNOS/CaM (CH TnC)12.32.0nNOS/CaM 3TnC4.50nNOS/CaM (helix 7 TnC)12.82.7 Open table in a new tab The stopped-flow data suggest a good correlation exists between a chimera's ability to support heme iron reduction and activate NO synthesis. It is remarkable that several chimeras supported heme iron reduction rates that were slower than with CaM and that these slower rates were associated with diminished rates of NO synthesis. Indeed, for certain chimeras (especially CaM 1TnC BM1) the rate of heme iron reduction may be sufficiently slow to become rate-limiting for NO synthesis. This would be a fundamental departure from CaM-supported NO synthesis by nNOS, where heme iron reduction is not rate-limiting (20Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,21Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because heme iron reduction is most dependent on structural elements in CaM domains 1 and 3, it is probably controlled by an interaction of nNOS with the “latch domain,” which forms from domains 1 and 3 and is important for activating NO synthesis by nNOS (7Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to the good correlation observed for heme iron reduction and NO synthesis, a chimera's ability to increase the rate of flavin reduction did not always correlate well with stimulation of nNOS catalysis (cytochrome c reduction or NO synthesis). For example, the CaM 3TnC chimera caused less than a 5% increase in flavin reduction rate, but still elevated cytochrome c reduction 45% relative to CaM without activating heme iron reduction or NO synthesis. A similar situation held for Cam 1TnC BM1. Overall, the data show that activation of reductase domain-specific catalysis (cytochromec reduction) in nNOS is possible without triggering electron transfer to the oxygenase domain, and without increasing the rate of electron transfer into the nNOS flavins. This latter conclusion was unexpected based on our model (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and means that CaM must activate reductase domain catalysis by a mechanism distinct from its increasing the rate of flavin reduction. The mechanism does not likely involve increased affinity toward cytochrome c, because cytochromec was present at ten times its Kmconcentration in our experiments and its Km is unaffected by CaM binding (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that nNOS transfers electrons directly to cytochrome c (9Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B.

This is consistent with fluorescence data that suggest CaM binding locates the flavins nearer to the surface of the reductase domain (12Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R.

Whether this conformational change is involved in triggering electron transfer to the oxygenase domain heme iron is unclear. However, the fact that the CaM 3TnC chimera supported no heme iron reduction while activating significant cytochromec reduction suggests that a distinct additional change must occur before the reductase domain can electronically interact with its natural redox partner (the oxygenase domain)."

Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, London1995: 407-417Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of glycolytic enzymes, however, gave equivocal results concerning their evolutionary origin (5Müller M. Coombs G.H. Vickerman K. Sleigh M.A. Warren A. Evolutionary Relationships among Protozoa. Chapman and Hall, Cambridge1998: 109-132Google Scholar). The terminal steps of carbohydrate breakdown take place in an unusual organelle, the hydrogenosome, which produces energy by the catabolism of pyruvate to acetate, CO2 and H2(4Coombs G.H. Müller M. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, London1995: 407-417Google Scholar). Hydrogenosomes only occur in anaerobic eukaryotes, including rumen ciliates and fungi as well as some free-living flagellates and ciliates (6Müller M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2879-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and contain enzymes such as pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and hydrogenase, which are typical of anaerobic bacteria but absent from mitochondria (4Coombs G.H. Müller M. Marr J.J. Muller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, London1995: 407-417Google Scholar, 7Bui E.T.N. Johnson P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that trichomonad hydrogenosomes may have evolved from an anaerobic prokaryotic ancestor. The recent discovery of mitochondrial-like proteins in trichomonads (2Bui E.T.N. Bradley P.J. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9651-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,8Horner D.S. Hirt R.P. Kilvington S. Lloyd D. Embley T.M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14618-14622Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and that the mechanism whereby proteins are targeted to the organelles is similar to that of mitochondria (3Häusler T. Stierhof Y.D. Blattner J. Clayton C.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 240-251PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bradley P.J. Lahti C.J. Plumper E. Johnson P.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggests, however, that hydrogenosomes and mitochondria are related and that the former may have evolved from mitochondria. Nevertheless, the anaerobic nature of hydrogenosomes and the trichomonads themselves suggests that the primitive protozoon may have acquired some features from anaerobic prokaryotes. Another metabolic feature of T. vaginalis which resembles the situation in some anaerobic prokaryotes is sulfur amino acid metabolism. Trichomonads contain high activity of methionine γ-lyase (EC 4.4.1.11), which catalyzes the α,γ-elimination reaction of methionine to α-ketobutyrate, methanethiol, and ammonia (12Thong K. Coombs G.H. Sanderson B.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Methionine γ-lyase has been detected only in anaerobic microorganisms such as Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Clostridium (14Esaki N. Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is not believed to be present in yeast, plants, or mammals (15Cooper A.J.L. Annu. Rev.

Mottram, unpublished data. 1T. D. Edlind, J. Walker, G. H. Coombs, and J. C. Mottram, unpublished data.Structurally the enzyme is related to other enzymes involved in the synthesis and interconversion, via the trans-sulfuration pathway, of cysteine and homocysteine, proteins that together comprise the γ-family of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes (20Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar).1 These catalyze γ-elimination or γ-replacement, and also β-elimination, reactions with sulfur-containing amino acids. The structural information available for members of the γ-family has been limited until recently such that their evolutionary relationships were unclear. The sequences of several genes are now available which has allowed a phylogenetic analysis,1 but only one crystal structure (cystathionine β-lyase from Escherichia coli) has been solved (21Clausen T. Huber R. Laber B. Pohlenz H.D. Messerschmidt A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 202-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the reaction mechanism elucidated (22Clausen T. Laber B. Messerschmidt A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 321-326PubMed Google Scholar). The methionine γ-lyases of Pseudomonas putida and T. vaginalis have been characterized in some detail at the biochemical level (13Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Esaki N. Soda K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Tanaka H. Esaki N. Yamamoto T.

Esaki N. Tanaka H. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 177-183Google Scholar) and, in the case of P. putida, the molecular level (26Inoue H. Inagaki K. Sugimoto M. Esaki N. Soda K. Tanaka H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1120-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Hori H. Takabayashi K. Orvis L. Carson D.A. Nobori T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2116-2122PubMed Google Scholar). They share some biochemical properties, including subunit composition and the variety of substrates that can be catabolized. The methionine γ-lyase of T. vaginalis has been purified and shown to be a tetramer that has activity not only toward methionine but also related compounds including homocysteine, cysteine, and O-acetylserine (13Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The functional significance of methionine γ-lyase activity to the parasite is uncertain, but it has been proposed that the conversion of α-ketobutyrate to propionate with the concomitant production of ATP could make an important contribution to energy metabolism and also that the methanethiol may play a role in enabling the parasite to avoid damage from the immune response of the host (28Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Biochemical Protozoology. 1991: 113-122Google Scholar). Whether trichomonads contain other enzymes of the γ-family of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes and are able to interconvert cysteine and homocysteine via the trans-sulfuration pathway are unknown. Mammals apparently lack methionine γ-lyase (17Griffith O.W. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that this difference between the parasite and host can be exploited by pro-drugs that are activated by the enzyme (29Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Parasitology. 1997; 114: S61-S80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, inhibitors are likely to be detrimental to the survival of the parasite in its host and so have potential as chemotherapeutic agents against pathogens that have methionine γ-lyase activity. This study of trichomonad methionine γ-lyase was undertaken with two main aims: to analyze the similarity of γ-family pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes of this primitive eukaryote with their bacterial homologs; and to obtain data that will, in the longer term, enable the design of drugs that exploit the presence of methionine γ-lyase in microbial pathogens. To this end we have analyzed the structure and organization of genes that encode methionine γ-lyase in T. vaginalis, expressed the genes in E. coli, examined the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzymes, and analyzed the functional importance of an active site cysteine residue. A clonal cell line (G3) of T. vaginalis was grown axenically in modified Diamond's medium as described previously (13Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in late log phase of growth (1–2 × 106/ml) and washed twice in 0.25m sucrose. DNA was isolated using a Nucleon II kit (Scotlab, Coatbridge, Scotland). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using poly(A)+ Quik columns (Stratagene). First strand cDNA for use in PCR 2The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; kb, kilobase(s); r, recombinant; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. was generated in a 50-μl reaction using 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, 100 ng of oligo(dT) primer, and 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). After synthesis the reaction was diluted to 500 μl with 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA and heated to 65 °C for 15 min. The degenerate oligonucleotide primers used for the PCR of T. vaginalismethionine γ-lyase genes were based on consensus sequences from cystathionine γ-lyase from human (30Lu Y. O'Dowd B.F. Orrego H. Israel Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), rat (31Erickson P.F. Maxwell I.H. Su L.-J. Baumann M. Glode L.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and yeast (32Ono B.I. Tanaka K. Naito K. Heike C. Shinoda S. Yamamoto S. Ohmori S. Oshima T. Toh-e A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2247-3339Crossref Google Scholar). The sequence of the 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides (using IUB codes) were: 5′-GCAAGCTTGTITGGATHGAGACICCIACNAA-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGAGCCGTTIATRTAYTTIGTNGC-3′. Inosine (I) residues were introduced at some positions of 4-fold degeneracy, and HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) were added to the 5′-ends of the oligonucleotides to facilitate cloning. The degenerate primers were used in PCRs with T. vaginalis first strand cDNA as the template. The 50-μl reaction mixture contained 5 ng of T. vaginalis cDNA, 5 ng of each of the primers, nucleotides at a final concentration of 250 μm, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The following amplification protocol was employed. An initial denaturation step of 4 min at 95 °C was followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. A final step of 5 min at 72 °C was used to complete the extension. The amplified product was cloned intoHindIII/XhoI-digested pBluescript (SK−) (Stratagene) and sequenced using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham). Sequence data were analyzed using the Wisconsin GCG sequence software. Two distinct groups of PCR products were found to have homology to yeast cystathionine γ-lyase. These were used to screen a [lamda]ZapIIT. vaginalis cDNA library as described previously (33Mallinson D.J. Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. North M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1994; 140: 2725-2735Google Scholar). Positive plaques were isolated, and the inserts were rescued with R408 helper phage into pBluescript. Two positive clones, pMGL4100 and pMGL5100, each of which hybridized to one of the 200-bp PCR products, were selected for further analysis. These cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands as described above. The 5′-ends of the mRNA transcribed from mgl1 and mgl2 were determined using a 5′-RACE System Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). For RACE-PCR, total cellular RNA from T. vaginalis (1 μg) was transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using oligo(dT) as primer. Excess dNTPs and primer were removed from the DNA, and a homopolymeric tail of dCs was added to the 3′-end. 5 μl of tailed cDNA was used for the PCRs containing the components of the 5′-RACE System Kit and a gene-specific primer. The following gene-specific primers were used: mgl1, 5′-ATCGGAGATTAAGTGATCTCCGGCC-3′; and mgl2, 5′-AACAACGTGGGAGGTGTCAAGGAC-3′. 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and then a final step of 10 min at 72 °C were applied. Products from the first round of amplification were then used as template for PCRs with a nested primer:mgl1, 5′-GCAATGGCACCCATGCCAGAAGATG-3′; and mgl2, 5′-GCAGCAATAGCACCCATGCCAGAAG-3′. The amplification protocol was the same as outlined above except that 35 cycles were carried out. The 5′-RACE products were cloned directly into pTAg vector (Ingenius) and sequenced. For inverse PCR, 1 μg of T. vaginalis genomic DNA was cleaved to completion with ClaI in a volume of 10 μl. After heat inactivation of the ClaI (68 °C for 30 min), the DNA was circularized in a 50 μl of T4 DNA ligase reaction and then purified (Wizard DNA Clean-Up, Promega) with elution in 40 μl of water. PCR was performed on 4-μl aliquots with Expand polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions; 33 cycles and an annealing temperature of 57 °C were employed. The outwardly directed primer pairs, corresponding to sequences near the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mgl1 and mgl2 coding regions, respectively, were: 5′-CATGGATGCATGCTGTTGCTG-3′ with 5′-TATTGAAGATGCCGACGAACTC-3′; and 5′-GGAAAGTGTGTCTGTATGTGTTG-3′ with 5′-GGCTGTGAGAACGTTCAGGAT-3′. Gel electrophoresis of the inverse PCR products revealed bands of approximately 2.4 and 1.6 kb (data not shown). With the addition of approximately 1.1 kb corresponding to the distance between each of the primer pairs, these product sizes agree with the ClaI fragment sizes for mgl1 and mgl2 (3.5 and 2.6 kb, respectively) observed by Southern blotting (see Fig. 2). The inverse PCR products were cloned and sequenced on both strands by primer walking. T. vaginalisgenomic DNA (2 μg) was restricted, size fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel, and blotted to Hybond N membrane as described (34Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.3-kb KpnI/SpeI fragment from pMGL4100, which contained the open reading frame for mgl1, and a 1.3-kbKpnI/SpeI fragment from pMGL5100, which was nine nucleotides short at the 5′-end of being full-length formgl2, were labeled by random priming (Stratagene). Hybridizations to T. vaginalis genomic DNA and subsequent washing steps were performed as described above for the library screen.T. vaginalis total (10 μg) and poly (A)+ (1 μg) RNA were denatured and run on a 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gel as described previously (34Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was transferred to Hybond N membrane. A 1-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment from pMGL4100 and an 800-bp EcoRI fragment from pMGL5100 were labeled by random priming. Hybridizations and washing steps were carried out under high stringency as for the Southern hybridizations. rMGL1 and rMGL2 were produced in E. coli using the pQE vectors (Qiagen). The mgl1 coding region was amplified by PCR from the cDNA clone pMGL4100 using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCCATGGCTCACGAGAGAATGAC-3′ and 5′-GCAGATCTTAAAAGAGCGTCAAGGCCC-3′. The amplified PCR product was cloned intoNcoI/BglII pQE60 to give plasmid clone pGL14. A 1.3-kb BamHI/XhoI fragment from pMGL5100 was cloned into BamHI/SalI pQE30 to give plasmid clone pGL15. This resulted in a recombinant protein containing the sequence MRGSHHHHHHGSPGLQEFGTSA at the NH2 terminus. The alanine residue is the first mgl2-encoded amino acid (see Fig. 1) and corresponds to the fourth residue of the mgl2translation product after the start methionine. rMGL1 and rMGL2 were purified from M15pREP4 E. coli after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Briefly, 50 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli containing pGL14 or pGL15 were inoculated into 400 ml of Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin and grown until they reached anA600 nm of 0.6–0.8. The cultures were then induced with 2 mm and 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, respectively, and grown for a further 2.25 h before harvesting. The E. coli were resuspended in 5 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate added to a final concentration of 20 μm. The cells were lysed by sonication and the soluble fraction recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Soluble fraction was loaded on to a 4-ml Ni2+-NTA resin column (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated with sonication buffer. After sample application, the column was washed with 30 ml of sonication buffer and with 30 ml of wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol). Recombinant protein was eluted from the column by an FPLC-generated linear gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in wash buffer over 100 min at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing rMGL1 or rMGL2 were identified byA280 and by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20% v/v glycerol, 20 μmpyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 15 μm dithiothreitol. Dialyzed rMGL1 or rMGL2 was combined 1:1 with enzyme stabilization solution (80% v/v glycerol, 40 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 30 μm dithiothreitol, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay microtiter plate method (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as standard. The production of mutated rMGL1 (C113G) and rMGL2 (C116G) was achieved using the PCR-based QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For mgl1, pGL14 was used as a template directly to give mutated plasmid pGL16. For mgl2, mutagenesis was performed on the pMGL5100 plasmid (pBS backbone) and then subsequently subcloned into pQE30 as described above for pGL15 to give pGL17. Mutagenesis was performed on both plasmids using a pair of oligonucleotide primers complementary to opposite strands of the cDNA clones, each containing a point mutation to convert the respective cysteine codon (TGC) to a glycine codon (GGC), as follows: 5′-TGCCTTTATGGCGGCACACATGCTCTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGAGAGCATGTGTGCCGCCATAAAGG-3′ (antisense). After PCR-mediated amplification, plasmids containing the desired mutations were identified by sequencing on both strands using gene-specific internal oligonucleotide primers. Production and purification of rMGL1 (C113G) (from plasmid pGL16) and rMGL2 (C116G) (from plasmid pGL17) were performed as described above. Data obtained for two independently derived mutants for each gene were comparable, and only one set of data for each is presented. The generation of polyclonal antisera in rabbits against purified rMGL1 and rMGL2 was performed using standard immunization protocols (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-138Google Scholar). A T. vaginalishomogenate was prepared by the lysis of cells in 0.25 msucrose, 0.25% Triton X-100 containing proteinase inhibitors (10 μm E-64, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 4 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, and boiling for 5 min. To prepare supernatant fraction, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer. rMGL1 and rMGL2 were prepared by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Western blot analysis was carried out as described (34Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) low fat dried milk and 10% (v/v) horse serum in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) and incubated with polyclonal preimmune or immune rabbit serum diluted (1:500) in blocking reagent. Bound antibody was detected by using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham). The activity of rMGL1 and rMGL2 toward a variety of substrates was measured by monitoring 2-ketoacid production as described (36Soda K. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or the production of hydrogen sulfide from homocysteine (13Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The breakdown of cysteine and O-acetylserine (both at 10 mm) by the two recombinant proteins was determined by assaying for the production of pyruvate as described (37Czok R. Lamprecht W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 1446-1448Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 37 °C using 0.1 m imidazole buffer, pH 6.5. Kinetic calculations were performed using the computer program Grafit (Erithacus Software). Homocysteine desulfurase activity in native polyacrylamide gels was detected by immersion at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 3.3 mmdl-homocysteine, 0.33 mm lead acetate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mmimidazole buffer, pH 6.5. The effect of propargylglycine (Sigma) was determined by immersion of the gel in 10 mmpropargylglycine in 0.1 m imidazole buffer, pH 6.5, for 5 min at 37 °C before immersion in the homocysteine desulfurase detection mixture. Native PAGE using 12% gels was the same as for SDS-PAGE except that SDS was omitted from the gel and buffers, reducing agent was omitted from the sample buffer, and the sample was not boiled. In the absence of data on the protein sequence of the trichomonad methionine γ-lyase or the gene sequence of methionine γ-lyases from other organisms, the approach we adopted to clone the trichomonad methionine γ-lyase gene was to use PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on regions of homology identified in the related enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase. This is another member of the γ-family of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes, one for which sequence information was available from yeast, rat, and human (30Lu Y. O'Dowd B.F. Orrego H. Israel Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Erickson P.F. Maxwell I.H. Su L.-J. Baumann M. Glode L.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Ono B.I. Tanaka K. Naito K. Heike C. Shinoda S. Yamamoto S. Ohmori S. Oshima T. Toh-e A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2247-3339Crossref Google Scholar). The peptide sequences chosen were VWIETPTN (5′-primer) and ATKY(M/I)NG (3′-primer). The 3′-primer corresponds to the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate binding domain, and the 5′-primer corresponds to a region highly conserved in cystathionine γ-lyase molecules and differing from other known pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes of the α-and β-elimination families (20Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). PCR using T. vaginalis first strand cDNA resulted in the amplification of 200-bp DNA fragments that were of the expected size. Cloning and sequencing of these revealed that they belonged to two independent groups, both of which had predicted peptide similarity to yeast cystathionine γ-lyase but only about 50% identity with each other. The 200-bp insert of a representative clone from each group was used to screen a T. vaginalis cDNA library. Of the clones isolated, pMGL4100 contained a 1.3-kb insert with the complete open reading frame of the methionine γ-lyase 1 gene (mgl1), whereas pMGL5100 contained a truncated gene (mgl2) missing the 5′-end including the ATG start codon. Genomic clones containing the mgl1 or mgl2 genes were isolated by inverse PCR. A 2.4-kb fragment containing part of the mgl1 gene and flanking sequence was amplified from a 3.5-kbClaI (see Fig. 2 A, lane 1) fragment, while a 1.6-kb fragment containing part of the mgl2 gene and flanking sequence was amplified from a 2.5-kb ClaI fragment (see Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Sequence data for the these PCR fragments were combined with the cDNA sequences determined from pMGL4100 and pMGL5100 to give the complete sequence of the mgl1 and mgl2 genes. 5′-RACE was used to map the putative site of initiation of transcription for mgl1 and mgl2. mgl1 and mgl2 were found to have very short 5′-untranslated regions of 13 and 14 bp, respectively. The sequences from the 5′-termini to the A of the ATG start codon were ATTTTTAGACAAC (mgl1) and ACTTTATATAAAAG (mgl2). mgl1 is predicted to encode a protein (MGL1) of 396 amino acids with a molecular mass of 42.9 kDa, and mgl2 predicts a protein (MGL2) of 398 amino acids with a molecular mass of 43.1 kDa (Fig. 1). Amino acid sequence comparison of MGL1 and MGL2 revealed that the two trichomonad proteins had 69% ident"
https://openalex.org/W2034740928,"Two mannose-binding lectins, Allium sativum agglutinin (ASA) I (25 kDa) and ASAIII (48 kDa), from garlic bulbs have been purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. The subunit structures of these lectins are different, but they display similar sugar specificities. Both ASAI and ASAIII are made up of 12.5- and 11.5-kDa subunits. In addition, a complex (136 kDa) comprising a polypeptide chain of 54 ± 4 kDa and the subunits of ASAI and ASAIII elutes earlier than these lectins on gel filtration. The 54-kDa subunit is proven to be alliinase, which is known to form a complex with garlic lectins. Constituent subunits of ASAI and ASAIII exhibit the same sequence at their amino termini. ASAI and ASAIII recognize monosaccharides in mannosyl configuration. The potencies of the ligands for ASAs increase in the following order: mannobiose (Manα1–3Man) < mannotriose (Manα1–6Manα1–3Man) ≈ mannopentaose ≪ Man9-oligosaccharide. The addition of two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end of mannotriose or mannopentaose enhances their potencies significantly, whereas substitution of both α1–3- and α1–6-mannosyl residues of mannotriose with GlcNAc at the nonreducing end increases their activity only marginally. The best manno-oligosaccharide ligand is Man9GlcNAc2Asn, which bears several α1–2-linked mannose residues. Interaction with glycoproteins suggests that these lectins recognize internal mannose as well as bind to the core pentasaccharide of N-linked glycans even when it is sialylated. The strongest inhibitors are the high mannose-containing glycoproteins, which carry larger glycan chains. Indeed, invertase, which contains 85% of its mannose residues in species larger than Man20GlcNAc, exhibited the highest binding affinity. No other mannose- or mannose/glucose-binding lectin has been shown to display such a specificity. Two mannose-binding lectins, Allium sativum agglutinin (ASA) I (25 kDa) and ASAIII (48 kDa), from garlic bulbs have been purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration.

No other mannose- or mannose/glucose-binding lectin has been shown to display such a specificity. The majority of the well characterized plant lectins have been isolated from the seeds of dicotyledonous species. But lectins of non-seed origin from other species are also emerging as promising tools chiefly because of two reasons: (i) a good number of them might contain novel sugar-binding sites; and (ii) they can provide valuable information regarding the biological roles of plant lectins, which to a large extent still remain elusive. In the recent past, there have been several reports of non-seed lectins from monocotyledonous families (1Cammue B.P.A. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1986; 169: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Van Damme E.J.M. Allen A.K. Peumans W.J.

Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1991; 30: 509-514Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), especially Amaryllidaceae. The most remarkable property of these lectins is that they show strict specificity for mannose (2Van Damme E.J.M. Allen A.K. Peumans W.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 140-144Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol.

Plant. 1988; 73: 52-57Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), unlike other mannose/glucose-binding plant lectins. Hence, they are being used extensively as affinity ligands for the purification of glycoproteins, viz. IgM, α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, and β-lipoprotein (3Van Damme E.J.M. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1991; 30: 509-514Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Shibuya N. Berry J.E. Goldstein I.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Van Damme et al. (3Van Damme E.J.M. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1991; 30: 509-514Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) examined a number of species (includingAllium sativum) from the family Alliaceae (which is taxonomically close to the family Amaryllidaceae) and found them to accumulate mannose-binding lectins. They observed that lectins from both families share many common properties like their state of oligomerization, sugar specificity, amino acid composition, and serological interaction. We note that the bulbs of the species A. sativum contain an additional lectin (other than the one(s) described by them) that differs in its quarternary structure. We found that the garlic lectins bind most avidly to invertase (which contains high mannose residues) among the glycoproteins tested. By exploiting this property, we developed a simple method to study their sugar specificities. This study reveals that the binding sites of these lectins accommodate a number of α1–2-linked mannose residues. None of the other mannose-binding lectins have been shown to exhibit this kind of specificity. Methyl-α-mannose, mannose,N-acetylmannosamine, α- and β-methylumbelliferyl mannose, glucose, methyl-α-glucose, glucosamine,N-acetylglucosamine, galactose,N-acetylgalactosamine, lactose, melibiose, maltose, altrose, talose, and Manα1–4Man were purchased from Sigma. Manα1–2Man and Manα1–3Man were obtained from Carbohydrate International. Manα1–6Man, Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Man, mannopentaose, Manβ1–4GlcNAc, GlcNAc2Man3, and N-acetyllactosamine were purchased from Dextra Laboratories (London). Man2GlcNAc, Man5GlcNAc, and Man3GlcNAc2 were obtained from Biocarb (Lund, Sweden). Man9GlcNAc2Asn was a gift from Dr. M. I. Khan (National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India). Man8GlcNAc2Asn and Man7GlcNAc2Asn prepared from quail ovalbumin were available in the laboratory from a previous study (7Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Invertase, fetuin, transferrin, IgGs, fibrinogen, α1-acid glycoprotein, and ovalbumin were products of Sigma. Soybean agglutinin and jacalin (Artocarpus integrifolia agglutinin) were prepared in the laboratory according to Swamy et al. (8Swamy M.J. Krishna Sastry M.V. Khan M.I. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1986; 261: 14621-14627Google Scholar) and Sureshkumar et al. (9Sureshkumar G. Appukuttan P.S. Debkumar B. J. Biosci. (Bangalore). 1982; 4: 257-261Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), respectively. Glucose oxidase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. Mannose was coupled to epichlorohydrin-activated Sepharose 6B following the procedure of Sundberg and Porath (10Sundberg L. Porath J. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 90: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Healthy dry bulbs of A. sativum were purchased from the local market. The bulbs were homogenized with a blender using 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (PBS). The extract was filtered and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was subjected to (NH4)2SO4 cut (70%), and centrifuged, and the protein pellet was resuspended in PBS and dialyzed extensively against PBS. The crude protein was loaded on the mannose-Sepharose column at 4 °C. The column was then washed extensively at the same temperature with PBS untilA280 nm was below 0.005. The bound protein was eluted with 0.2 m mannose in PBS at room temperature. The affinity-purified protein was dialyzed extensively initially against 20 mm PBS and finally against 50 mm PBS and concentrated using a Centricon filtration unit. The concentrated protein was then applied to a Bio-Gel P-200 column (1.8 × 110 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm PBS. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions was carried out as described by Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Molecular masses of the lectins were calculated according to the method of Weber and Osborn (12Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using lysozyme (14.2 kDa), β-lactoglobulin (18.4 kDa), trypsinogen (24 kDa), hen egg ovalbumin (45 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (68 kDa) as the standards. The proteins were visualized on the gel by Coomassie staining. A P/ACE system 2100 (Beckman Instruments) was used for capillary electrophoresis with P/ACE system software controlled by an IBM PS/2 Model 50-Hz computer. Post-run data analysis was performed on System Gold software (Beckman Instruments). A standard capillary of 27 cm length (20 cm to the detector window) × 20 μm inner diameter, designed for P/ACE cartridges, was obtained from Beckman Instruments. On-line detection was set at 280 nm with a 50 × 200-μm aperture in the P/ACE cartridge. Temperature of the capillary during electrophoresis was maintained at 25 °C. Samples were introduced by pressure injection for 5 s. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 8 kV. Proteins after separation by 15% SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following the procedure of Matsudaira (13Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Multiphor II electrophoresis system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). N-terminal analysis of the native protein was carried out on a Shimadzu automated gas-phase sequencer (Model PSQ-1) equipped with an on-line C-R4A120A Chromatopac Shimadzu phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. The native molecular masses of ASAs were determined by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-200 column (1.8 × 110 cm) calibrated with rabbit IgG, Vicia villosa agglutinin, soybean agglutinin, bovine serum albumin, hen egg ovalbumin, and pepsin. Void and inner volumes of the column were determined with blue dextran and myoglobin, respectively. Molecular masses of ASAI and ASAIII were also determined on a Bio-Gel P-60 column (8 × 90 cm) calibrated with hen egg ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, myoglobin, and bovine pancreas ribonuclease A. Protein concentration was determined following the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total neutral sugar content was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method of Dubois et al. (15Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar) using mannose as the standard. Hemagglutination was carried out at room temperature using rabbit and human erythrocytes (16Dam T.K. Sarkar M. Ghosal J. Chaudhury A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 117: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Hemagglutination inhibition tests were done by preincubating lectin (10 hemagglutinating units) with serially diluted sugars or glycoproteins in microtiter plates. Rabbit erythrocyte suspension (25 μl of 4% (v/v)) was then added to the solution, and the results were noted after 1 h. An appropriate amount of lectin was coated on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate and left overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed with 20 mm PBS and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After washing with the blocking buffer, invertase was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. The plate was then washed with PBS, and 100 μl of 50 mm sucrose solution was added to each well. After incubation for 1 h, the solutions were transferred to separate test tubes. The extent of hydrolysis of sucrose was assayed by estimating the free glucose according to the method of Nelson (17Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The sugar binding properties of ASAs were studied in detail using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (Scheme FS1). An optimum concentration of the lectin was coated on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates and left overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with 20 mmPBS, the wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequent to washing thrice with the blocking buffer, different sugars were added at varying concentrations and allowed to interact with the lectin for 1 h. A fixed concentration of invertase was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. The wells were then washed thrice with blocking buffer and once with PBS. An equal volume of 50 mm sucrose solution in 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) was added to each well. After incubation (for 1 h), glucose oxidase in the same buffer was then added to the solution to produce H2O2 from the liberated glucose. H2O2 thus generated was assayed using horseradish peroxidase and o-phenylenediamine (0.05 mg/well in 100 mm citrate buffer). The reaction was stopped by 2 n HCl, and the absorbance was recorded on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 490 nm. Earlier reports (3Van Damme E.J.M. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1991; 30: 509-514Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that dimeric proteins of 25 kDa occur in the bulbs of A. sativum. By using a modified purification procedure, we have identified an additional lectin designated as ASAIII. The affinity-purified preparation revealed three peaks upon gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-200 column with molecular masses of 136, 48, and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). Taken together, the data from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and gel filtration show that peak 3 is a heterodimer of 12.5- and 11.5-kDa subunits, whereas peak 2 is most likely a heterotetramer made up of two pairs of 12.5- and 11.5-kDa polypeptide chains, although occurrence of these subunits in other proportions cannot be ruled out.Figure 2SDS-PAGE of garlic bulb lectins resolved on a gel filtration column. The conditions for SDS-PAGE (15%) are described under “Materials and Methods” (15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions). Lane M, molecular mass markers;lane A, peak 1; lane B, peak 2 (ASAIII);lane C, peak 3 (ASAI).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 2) of peak 1 indicates that it is composed of 54-, 12.5-, and 11.5-kDa subunits, whereas peaks 2 and 3 are made up of only 12.5- and 11.5-kDa subunits. All three peaks show distinct patterns of migration when subjected to free flow capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 3), suggesting that they are distinct proteins. Peak 1 contains 6% neutral sugar, whereas peaks 2 and 3 are devoid of neutral sugars. Sequence analysis of the individual bands of SDS-PAGE showed that the 54-kDa subunit has the amino-terminal sequence KMTWTMKADEEA, which is different from the sequence of the 12.5- and 11.5-kDa subunits (RNILTNDEGLYAGQSLD), common to all three peaks. Van Damme et al. (18Van Damme E.J.M. Smeets K. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported the same amino-terminal sequence for the 12.5- and 11.5-kDa polypeptide chains (RNLLTNGEGLYAGQS), whereas Smeets et al. (19Smeets K. Van Damme E.J.M. Van Leuven F. Peumans W.J. Glycoconjugate J. 1997; 14: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), from the deduced amino acid sequences of cDNA clones, showed slightly different amino-terminal sequences for the 12.5-kDa (RNLLTNGEGLYAGQS) and 11.5-kDa (RNILRNDEGLYAGQS) polypeptide chains. Altogether, these results show that the 54-kDa band corresponds to the enzyme alliinase (cysteine-sulfoxide lyase, alliin lyase, EC 4.4.1.4), which is known to form a complex with garlic lectins (20Rabinkov A. Wilchek M. Mirelman D. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since the polypeptide chains corresponding to peaks 2 and 3 give the same sequence (RNILTNDEGLYAGQSLD), the lectins ASAI and ASAIII are made up of identical polypeptide chains that apparently differ at their carboxyl termini. The agglutinins ASAI and ASAIII interact strongly with rabbit erythrocytes, but considerably weakly with human erythrocytes, irrespective of their blood groupings. Hemagglutination inhibition studies of garlic agglutinins were carried out using a series of simple sugars and several glycoproteins. Among the monosaccharides tested, only methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside was found to be inhibitory besides mannose, although the latter was less potent as an inhibitor (Table I). Glucose, a C-2 epimer of mannose, was inactive. Methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside also did not interact. Replacement of the C-2 hydroxyl group of glucose with other groups did not alter its inhibitory property as bothN-acetyl-d-glucosamine and glucosamine were inactive. Of all the glycoproteins used in this assay, invertase was the strongest inhibitor, and the minimum amount of this enzyme needed for complete inhibition was 0.7 nm (Table I). The invertase bound to both ASAI and ASAIII was found to retain its catalytic activity.Table IInhibition of hemagglutinationSugar/glycoproteinConc for 50% inhibitionMannose150 mmα-Methylmannopyranoside12 mmGlucoseNot inhibitory up to 250 mmα-MethylglucopyranosideNot inhibitory up to 200 mmMannobiose (Manα1–3Man)14 mmMannotriose (Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Man)9 mmInvertase0.70 nmHorseradish peroxidase210 nm Open table in a new tab The strong affinity of these lectins for invertase, containing high mannose-type oligosaccharides, was instrumental in designing a sensitive enzyme-based assay to study the interaction of these lectins with various sugars (as shown in Scheme FS1) and glycoproteins. The binding of invertase to varying amounts of garlic agglutinins coated on the wells of microtiter plates was checked (Fig. 4 a). In other set of experiments, the amounts of horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase were varied, respectively, keeping the amounts of other ingredients fixed (Fig. 4, b and c). Based on these studies, the following concentrations were considered optimal for all subsequent sugar inhibition studies: 0.35 μg of lectin, 20 ng of invertase, and 3 units of glucose oxidase for ASAI and 0.2 μg of lectin, 20 ng of invertase, and 3 units of glucose oxidase for ASAIII. The amount of horseradish peroxidase was 10 ng and the concentration of sucrose was 50 mm in all experiments. Sugar inhibition assays were carried out in triplicate, and each value is an average of three experiments. The amount of sugar required for 50% inhibition was calculated from complete inhibition curves (Fig. 5), and values are listed in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III. Relative affinities of the lectins for different sugars were determined from the concentration of sugars required for 50% inhibition of the binding of invertase. Consistent with hemagglutination inhibition studies, methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside was better as an inhibitor than mannose (Tables I and II). The presence of nonpolarp-nitrophenyl aglycon in d-mannose did not improve the binding affinity, but the introduction of a nonpolar 4-methylumbelliferyl aglycon at the anomeric position in α-linkage slightly enhanced its inhibitory potency. The lectins did not bind to 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-mannopyranoside, indicating that β-linked mannose was not conducive for binding.N-Acetyl-d-mannosamine was inactive, suggesting that the axially oriented hydroxyl group of mannose cannot be substituted with a bulky acetamido group. The monosaccharide binding propensities of ASAI and ASAIII are broadly similar to other well studied mannose-binding lectins from snowdrop (4Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 728-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and daffodil and amaryllis (21Kaku H. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Goldstein I.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Of all the mannobioses tested, Manα1–3Man was the most potent inhibitor. Its potency was 12 times greater than that of mannose. Manα1–2Man and Manα1–6Man were almost eight and six times more active, respectively, over mannose. But the other mannobioses, including Manα1–4Man, were poor ligands. Among the other mannose-binding lectins, GNA recognizes only terminal Manα1–3Man, whereas NPA (daffodil) and HHA (amaryllis) prefer α1–6-linked mannose. On the other hand, ConA is known to exhibit greater affinity for Manα1–2Man (22Goldstein I.J. Hollerman C.E. Smith E.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Artocarpin (A. integrifolia mannose-binding lectin) shows higher specificity for Manα1–3Man (7Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-linked disaccharides like Manβ1–4GlcNAc and GlcNAcβ1–2Man were poor inhibitors, whereas Manβ1–6GlcNAc and GlcNAcβ1–6Man were inactive toward ASAs. The lectins did not interact with disaccharides like lactose (Galβ1–4Glc),N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1–4GlcNAc), and melibiose (Galα1–6Glc).Table IIIInhibition of ASA-invertase interaction by glycoproteinsGlycoproteinConc for 50% inhibitionASAIASAIIImmSoybean agglutinin0.0050.003Ovalbumin0.00410.0028α1-Acetylglycoprotein0.0820.069Asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein0.0110.02Fetuin0.0690.057Asialofetuin0.0120.010Transferrin0.0580.053Asialotransferrin0.00710.0075Fibrinogen0.0550.049Asialofibrinogen0.00630.0071IgG Sheep0.0730.073 Goat0.0610.042 Rabbit0.0530.049Jacalin0.0960.086 Open table in a new tab Table IIInhibition of ASA-invertase binding by oligosaccharidesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To understand the carbohydrate specificities of ASAI and ASAIII in greater detail, their binding to a carefully chosen panel of manno-oligosaccharides was then undertaken (Table II). The core structure of N-linked oligosaccharides, Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Man, was 30 times stronger an inhibitor than mannose and showed four, two, and five times more potency than Manα1–2Man, Manα1–3Man, and Manα1–6Man, respectively. The relative inhibitory potencies of mannopentaose and mannotriose were identical. Man5GlcNAc and Manα1–3Manβ1–4GlcNAc were marginally better ligands than mannopentaose and Manα1–3Man, respectively, unlike artocarpin, in which the addition of GlcNAc at the reducing end of Manα1–3Man caused a dramatic enhancement of its binding ability (7Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the α1–3- and α1–6-linked mannose residues of mannotriose were substituted with GlcNAc as in GlcNAc2Man3, no remarkable change in activity was noted. In this regard, ASAI and ASAIII bear similarity to ConA, which displays equal affinities for mannotriose and GlcNAc2Man3 (23Bhattacharyya L. Haraldsson M. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1294-1299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kaku H. Goldstein I.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but for artocarpin, the inhibitory activity is reduced by 25-fold (7Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Man3GlcNAc2 has a 5-fold higher potency relative to mannotriose. Among the manno-oligosaccharides tested, Man9GlcNAc2Asn is the best ligand, followed by Man8GlcNAc2Asn and Man7GlcNAc2Asn, indicating that the α1–2-linked mannosyl residues at the nonreducing end are highly preferred by the binding sites of these lectins. The preference of ASAI and ASAIII for the cluster of α1–2-linked mannosyl residues as in Man9GlcNAc2Asn is unique among the lectins described so far. The ability of several mannose-containing glycoproteins to inhibit the binding of ASAI or ASAIII to invertase was checked to confirm their specificities. The extent of binding of these glycoproteins was qualitatively consistent with the relative affinities exhibited by manno-oligosaccharides. The soybean lectin and ovalbumin, which bear several terminal Manα1–2Man linkages in their high mannose-containing glycan chains, emerged as the best inhibitors (26Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Lis H. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7708-7711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the sole glycan chain of the ovalbumin molecule is occupied by high mannose- or hybrid-type chains (27Tai T. Yashimata K. Ogata-Arakawa M. Koide N. Muramatsu T. Iwashita S. Inoue Y. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8569-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tai T. Yamashita K. Ito S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6687-6694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yashimata K. Tachibana Y. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3862-3869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); as expected, it displayed a fairly good binding activity, unlike GNA, which did not interact with ovalbumin. 2Ovalbumin as a glycoprotein is highly heterogeneous, and individual molecules in a population exhibit either high mannose chains that vary in the extent of mannosylation or hybrid-type chains. Some of the serum glycoproteins, viz. α1-acid glycoprotein, fetuin, transferrin, and fibrinogen, were active, although the binding affinities were substantially weaker than that of soybean agglutinin. Binding of these glycoproteins in their native structure suggests that the lectins, like NPA and HHA, could recognize internald-mannosyl residues. Alternatively, it can be said that these lectins can bind to the core pentasaccharide of N-linked glycans (Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc) even when both of the α1–3- and α1–6-mannosyl residues are substituted with NeuAcα2–3/6Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Removal of the terminal sialic acids improved the potency of these glycoproteins. The affinities of ASAI and ASAIII for jacalin and sheep IgG, which are substituted at their C-2 and C-4 hydroxyl groups of β-linked mannose by β-linked xylose and GlcNAc, respectively, are much weaker as compared with that of artocarpin. These results suggest that substitution with xylose in β1–2-linkage as in horseradish peroxidase (and jacalin) or bisection with GlcNAc in β1–4-linkage as in sheep IgG reduces their binding potencies for ASAI and ASAIII. Analyses of binding of saccharides derived from horseradish peroxidase indicate that the substitution of the β-linked mannose with xylose in β1–2-linkage compromises the binding potency to a greater extent than the substitution of reducing end GlcNAc with fucose in α1–3-linkage. Invertase carries Man9–20GlcNAc in its seven accessible glycan chains (30Trimble R.B. Maley F. Chu F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2562-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, this glycoprotein binds to ASAI and ASAIII with such an avidity that its potency surpasses the activity of all the glycoproteins tested. The high mannose-binding lectins (ASAI and ASAIII) from garlic bulbs were purified in two steps using affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Van Damme et al. (3Van Damme E.J.M. Goldstein I.J. Peumans W.J. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1991; 30: 509-514Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported a mannose-binding lectin that resembles ASAI in its subunit composition. However, it differs from ASAI reported by them in displaying the same amino-terminal sequence for both of the polypeptide chains. ASAI and ASAIII are the heterodimer and heterotetramer, respectively, of similar polypeptide chains, present in equimolar proportion, that vary slightly in their molecular masses, viz. 12.5 and 11.5 kDa, yet the N-terminal sequences of their large (12.5 kDa) and smaller (11.5 kDa)"

An increase in protein synthesis was observed after nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of PC12 cells, and this increase coincided with activation of eIF2B. Growth factor addition in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase inhibitor wortmannin showed that both NGF- and EGF-induced protein synthesis and eIF2B activation were phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH kinase dependent. The EGF-induced stimulation of protein synthesis and activation of eIF2B was dependent upon FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein, as shown with the immunosuppressant rapamycin, whereas NGF induction was partially dependent upon FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein.The activities of two kinases that act on eIF2B, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and casein kinase II, were measured to assess their potential roles in the activation of eIF2B in PC12 cells. Inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 was seen in response to both NGF and EGF and this coincided with activation of eIF2B. However, inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 was not rapamycin sensitive, in contrast to the activation of eIF2B. This indicates the involvement of another protein kinase or regulatory mechanism in the eIF2B activation. Both growth factors activated casein kinase II. However, the time course of its activation and its insensitivity to wortmannin and rapamycin suggest that casein kinase II does not play a major regulatory role in eIF2B activation under these conditions.

Translation initiates with the binding of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E to the cap structure on the mRNA (1Sonenberg N. Morgan M.A. Merrick W.C. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After assembly of the eIF4F complex by association of eIF4E with eIF4A and eIF4G, unwinding of the secondary structure of the 5′-untranslated region (3Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) facilitates the assembly of the 48 S initiation complex and by formation of the 80 S ribosomal complex. Translation initiation can be regulated at different steps (4Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Two of the initiation factors with important roles in this regulation are eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, and eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2. Both factors are present in limiting amounts in the cell. Although the amount of eIF4E present in reticulocytes is 10-fold higher than previously assumed (5Ohlmann T. Rau M. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it is lower than any other initiation factor (6Duncan R.F. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

Furthermore, in the cell types tested the amount of eIF2B is limiting compared with eIF2 (8Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol.

The activity of eIF4E is regulated in at least three ways: by its own phosphorylation state (4Pain V.M. Eur. J.

Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Changes in the phosphorylation state of eIF4E did not always correlate with the changes in overall protein synthesis (16Gierman T.M. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Pickup D.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Schnierle B.S. Moss B. Virology. 1992; 188: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Kleijn M. Voorma H.O.

Virology. 1996; 217: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This indicates that other initiation factors are involved in regulating the rate of protein synthesis. Another well known regulatory translation initiation factor is eIF2B, which can be regulated in several different ways. First, phosphorylated eIF2 is a potent competitive inhibitor of eIF2B exchange activity (8Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, allosteric effectors regulate eIF2B activity in vitro. For example, binding of NADPH to eIF2B is necessary to maintain nucleotide exchange activity (20Dholakia J.N. Mueser T.C. Woodley C.L. Parkhurst L.J. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Gross M. Rubino M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21879-21884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the activity of eIF2B can be regulated in vitro by phosphorylation of its ε-subunit (22Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). So far, three kinases have been described that can phosphorylate eIF2B in vitro, casein kinase (CK) 1The abbreviations used are: CK, casein kinase; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase-3; NGF, nerve growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FRAP, FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein; PI-3, phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH; PKB, protein kinase B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TOP, 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. I and II (22Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (23Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2B by CKI and -II enhanced eIF2B activity in contrast to phosphorylation by GSK-3, which had an inhibitory effect. Antagonism of the CKII-induced eIF2B activation by GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation has also been shownin vitro (24Singh L.P. Denslow N.D. Wahba A.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3206-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting a negative regulatory function for GSK-3. An increase in eIF2B activity has been shown in vivo after T cell stimulation (25Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11410-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), for concanavalin A-treated T lymphocytes (26Jedlicka P. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15663-15669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after glucose stimulation of isolated rat islets of Langerhans (27Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and after treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with insulin, serum, EGF, or phorbol esters (28Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Inactivation of GSK-3 has been shown to correlate with eIF2B activation in the first of these cases (25Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11410-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The role of CKI and II in the control of eIF2B in vivo has not yet been addressed. Although a number of different mechanisms for regulating translation factor activity have now been described, it is not clear what roles they play in vivo in the activation of translation by specific stimuli. In this study the roles of eIF2 and eIF2B in NGF- and EGF-treated PC12 cells were studied in relation to overall protein synthesis to determine their function in the regulation of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the signal transduction pathway involved in eIF2B activation was studied using the phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH (PI-3) kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP) inhibitor rapamycin. The activities of the two kinases, GSK-3 and CKII, potentially involved in eIF2B phosphorylation were determined. Wortmannin and NGF were from Sigma, rapamycin from Calbiochem, DF medium (a 1:1 mixture of Ham F-12 and Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium) from Life Technologies, Inc., EGF from Harlan, [3H]GDP, [35S]methionine/cysteine, and [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were grown to a confluency of 70% in DF medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were deprived of serum for 2 h before treatment with NGF (30 ng/ml) or EGF (50 ng/ml). Wortmannin (100 nm) and rapamycin (25 ng/ml) were added to the cells 10 min prior to addition of growth factors. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before harvesting. PC12 cells were grown in 24-well plates in 200 μl of medium. Cells were treated with NGF, EGF, wortmannin, and rapamycin as described above and labeled with 12.5 μCi [35S]methionine/cysteine per ml for 15 min before harvesting. Cells were harvested in 0.5% Nonidet P40, and equal amounts of protein were used for measuring protein synthesis by hot trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Cells grown in 30-mm dishes were harvested in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 4 μg leupeptin/ml, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, and 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes were formed as described (29Mehta H.B. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3438-3441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 pmol of rabbit reticulocyte eIF2 (30Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was incubated with 0.2 μCi [3H]GDP (about 15 pmol with a specific activity of 30,000 dpm/pmol) in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mm KCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 15 min at 30 °C, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP were added. The eIF2·[3H]GDP complex was added to approximately 10 μg of cell extract and incubated for another 15 min at 30 °C. The [3H]GDP-GTP exchange reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of a cold wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were rinsed three times with the same wash buffer. About 10 μg of cell extract, prepared as for the eIF2B assay, was incubated with a peptide in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (final specific activity of 880 dpm/pmol) in a volume of 25 μl. In the GSK-3 assay, 6 μg of RRAAEELDSRAGS(P)PQL peptide was used as substrate and 6 μg of RRAAEELDSRAGAPQL as a negative control (31Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the CKII assay no peptide or 6 μg of RRRDDDSDDDDD (32Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Marin O. Meggio F. Marchiori F. Borin G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was used. After 15 min at 30 °C, 10 μl of the sample was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper. The P81 paper was rinsed 5 times with 3% (v/v) phosphoric acid for the GSK-3 assay and with 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid for the CKII assay. The filters were rinsed twice with 96% ethanol, dried, and counted. Another 10 μl of the sample was analyzed by electrophoresis on Tris-Tricine gels (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 ng of cell extract was incubated with 4 μg of 80 S ribosomes, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (final specific activity of 2200 dpm/pmol), as described in Kleijn et al. (35Kleijn M. Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5%) and autoradiography. S6 phosphorylation was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). This assay was shown to be specific for p70S6K (36Chen R. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3204-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). About 50 μg of cell extract, prepared as for the eIF2B assay, was loaded on an SDS-gel and blotted to Immobilon-P. Phosphorylated eIF2α was detected with a rabbit antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α (kindly provided by Dr. G. Krause) (37DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). eIF2α was detected with a monoclonal antibody (made by Dr. Henshaw, and obtained via Dr. Sarre, Freiburg, Germany). Blots were developed with the alkaline phosphatase method. Protein synthesis in PC12 cells was monitored during NGF and EGF treatment. After 2 h of serum starvation PC12 cells were treated with the differentiation stimulus NGF or the growth stimulus EGF, and protein synthesis was followed for 90 min (Fig. 1). Both growth factors stimulated protein synthesis approximately 1.7-fold. The rate of protein synthesis still increased after 90 min of NGF treatment (Fig. 1 A), whereas EGF-induced stimulation of protein synthesis peaked between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 1 B). Similar experiments were carried out in the presence of the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the FRAP inhibitor rapamycin. Wortmannin was able to block the activation of protein synthesis by NGF as well as by EGF, indicating that PI-3 kinase is required for the increase in protein synthesis. Inhibition of FRAP by rapamycin did not influence the NGF-induced increase in protein synthesis, although a slight reduction occurred when the effect of rapamycin alone (Fig. 1 C) was included. The EGF response was reduced to the rapamycin control level. Clearly, FRAP activation is involved in growth factor-induced protein synthesis in PC12 cells. Wortmannin alone did not influence the basal level of protein synthesis. Rapamycin stimulated basal protein synthesis slightly, which is in contrast to data in which a 10–15% decrease was found during the same time period of treatment (38Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 39Terada N. Patel H.R. Takase K. Kohno K. Nairn A.C. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11477-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although the severity of inhibition differs between the cell types, an increase in protein synthesis has never previously been reported. It has been shown that phosphorylation of eIF4E occurred after stimulation with NGF, but not after addition of EGF (40Frederickson R.M. Mushynski W. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, eIF4E phosphorylation is not a general mechanism in PC12 cells to increase protein synthesis. Regulation of the availability of eIF4E by the eIF4E-binding protein PHAS-I is also influenced by growth factors (35Kleijn M. Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M.

Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a strong indication that the availability of eIF4E is involved in the NGF- and EGF-induced increase in protein synthesis. However, rapamycin abolished NGF- and EGF-induced PHAS-I phosphorylation (35Kleijn M. Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the increase in protein synthesis during NGF treatment was hardly influenced by rapamycin (Fig. 1). Apparently, other factors are also involved in the increase in protein synthesis. The activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B is regulated during treatment of cells with growth factors and other stimuli (25Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J.

This prompted us to study the eIF2B activity after treatment of PC12 cells with NGF (Fig. 2 A) and EGF (Fig. 2 B). Both NGF and EGF induced an increase in eIF2B activity. NGF increased eIF2B activity by 25% at 90 min (Fig. 2 A), and EGF induced an increase of 21% with a maximum at 60 min (Fig. 2 B), showing a correlation in kinetics with that of the increase in protein synthesis (Fig. 1). The correlation between the increase in protein synthesis and in eIF2B activity was further investigated by treating PC12 cells with either NGF or EGF in the presence of wortmannin and rapamycin (Fig. 2). The NGF-induced activation of eIF2B was completely blocked by wortmannin, whereas rapamycin reduced the NGF-induced activation of eIF2B to 50% when the results obtained with rapamycin alone were subtracted (Fig. 2,A and C). The EGF-induced activation of eIF2B was also inhibited by wortmannin, as well as by rapamycin (Fig. 2 B). The basal activity of eIF2B was not changed by wortmannin alone, whereas rapamycin caused a slight increase (Fig. 2 C). Overall, activation of eIF2B by NGF and EGF in the absence as well as the presence of wortmannin and rapamycin coincided with the effects on protein synthesis (Fig. 1). The effects of wortmannin suggest that NGF- and EGF-induced protein synthesis and eIF2B activation is regulated in a PI-3 kinase-dependent manner. Data obtained with rapamycin indicate that FRAP is involved in EGF-induced protein synthesis and eIF2B activation; the involvement in NGF signaling seems minor. An increase in eIF2B activity might occur in various ways, as described in the Introduction. One of the possible regulatory mechanisms is a decrease in the phosphorylation state of eIF2α. Therefore, we determined the phosphorylation state of eIF2α after NGF and EGF treatment. PC12 cells were treated with NGF and EGF for 0, 30, and 60 min, and cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (Fig. 3). Detection with an antibody that exclusively recognizes the phosphorylated form of eIF2α showed that eIF2α was not dephosphorylated during NGF and EGF treatment (Fig. 3,upper panel). To check whether changes in eIF2α phosphorylation could be detected using this antibody, cell extract was incubated in the absence or presence of the hemin-regulated protein kinase HRI (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). The lower panel shows that equal amounts of cell extract were loaded onto the gel. Concluding, these results showed that the increase in eIF2B activity was not caused by changes in the phosphorylation state of eIF2α. Similar results were obtained earlier (25Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S.

The EGF-induced increase in protein synthesis and activation of eIF2B was partially dependent upon the rapamycin-sensitive FRAP pathway. Therefore, we determined whether p70S6K, a FRAP-dependent kinase, might be involved in eIF2B activation. NGF induced a 3.5-fold increase in p70S6K activity, which could be blocked by wortmannin as well as by rapamycin (Fig. 4 A). The inhibitors also abolished the EGF-induced 1.5-fold increase in p70S6K activity (Fig. 4 B). However, the extent of stimulation as well as the kinetics of p70S6K activation suggest that this kinase is not involved in the activation of eIF2B. Also, stimulation of translation is apparently not exclusively due to p70S6K activation (Fig. 1). However, as increased S6 phosphorylation coincides with an increase in translation of 5′-oligopyrimidine sequence-containing mRNAs (38Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,50Thomas G. Thomas G. Luther H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it may well be that NGF as well as EGF activates translation of this class of mRNAs (discussed below). The activities of two protein kinases that can regulate eIF2B activityin vitro, GSK-3 (23Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and CKII (22Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was measured during NGF and EGF stimulation to assess their involvement in the NGF- and EGF-induced eIF2B activation. GSK-3 activity was measured using a peptide containing amino acids 531–542 from the ε-subunit of eIF2B (31Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 52Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A decrease in GSK-3 activity of 30–36% was found after EGF or NGF addition (Fig. 5). After 90 min, GSK-3 activity in NGF-treated cells was still declining (Fig. 5 A), whereas in EGF-treated cells a maximal inhibition was obtained after 60 min (Fig. 5 B). The kinetics of GSK-3 inactivation correlated with activation of eIF2B (Fig. 2), as well as with the increase in protein synthesis (Fig. 1). A correlation between changes in the activities of GSK-3 and eIF2B was also seen after T cell activation (25Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11410-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Wortmannin abolished the effects of NGF and EGF on inactivation of GSK-3 completely (Fig. 5), which indicates that GSK-3 inactivation is PI-3 kinase-dependent as previously reported. Inhibition of FRAP by rapamycin did not influence the effect of NGF or EGF on GSK-3 activity, although rapamycin inhibited eIF2B activation (Fig. 2). Treatment of the cells with the inhibitors alone did not influence GSK-3 activity (data not shown). Analysis of the peptide assays by electrophoresis (Fig. 5 C) confirmed that the eIF2Bε-peptides were labeled, and that labeling was decreased after NGF and EGF treatment. The activity of CKII was determined in a kinase assay with a peptide containing the consensus sequence of CKII (32Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both NGF and EGF stimulated the CKII activity in PC12 cells, but the kinetics of activation of CKII were quite different in the two cases (Fig. 6). EGF induced a fast but modest 1.3-fold increase in CKII activity with a maximum at 10 min, and CKII activity was back to basal level after 30 min. In contrast, NGF induced a more prolonged and substantial stimulation of CKII; the activation increased 1.5-fold up to 30 min before a slow decline of kinase activity occurred. Neither wortmannin nor rapamycin had any effect on CKII activation by NGF (Fig. 6 A) or EGF (Fig. 6 B). Regulation of protein synthesis in PC12 cells by NGF and EGF cannot solely be explained by increased eIF4E phosphorylation or PHAS-I phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF4E after NGF addition is p21ras-dependent, which does not agree with the wortmannin results, and the eIF4E phosphorylation state does not change after EGF treatment (40Frederickson R.M. Mushynski W. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, PI-3 kinase-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation has been described in 32D cells (47Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF- and EGF-induced PHAS-I phosphorylation is sensitive to rapamycin, whereas NGF-stimulated protein synthesis is grossly independent from FRAP, and only EGF-induced protein synthesis is completely dependent upon FRAP. We found three lines of evidence that suggest the involvement of eIF2B in the regulation of protein synthesis after growth factor addition. First, the kinetics of protein synthesis activation (Fig. 1) and eIF2B activation (Fig. 2) are similar. Second, the effects of wortmannin and rapamycin on protein synthesis and eIF2B activation are identical. And third, the kinetics of GSK-3 inactivation, and the influence of wortmannin on GSK-3 support the link between eIF2B activity and protein synthesis after growth factor addition. The increase in eIF2B activity after NGF or EGF treatment was not due to dephosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 3). The involvement of PI-3 kinase and FRAP in NGF- and EGF-induced activation of eIF2B suggests that eIF2B activity may be regulated through phosphorylation. This is supported by the correlation between the kinetics of GSK-3 inactivation (Fig. 5) and eIF2B activation (Fig. 2) (see also below). The activities of two kinases that are able to phosphorylate eIF2Bin vitro, GSK-3 and CKII, were studied in NGF- and EGF-treated PC12 cells. The NGF- and EGF-induced inactivation of GSK-3 (Fig. 5) coincided with activation of eIF2B. Although CKII was activated after NGF as well as after EGF addition (Fig. 6), the kinetics of activation drastically differed from the kinetics of eIF2B activation. A role for CKII in regulation of eIF2B activity in vivo is not obvious from these results, but rapid activation of CKII may be involved in the more prolonged control of eIF2B activity. An increase in CKII activity was also shown after addition of insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, EGF, and serum (53Sommercorn J. Mulligan J.A. Lozeman F.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8834-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 54Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15872-15875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Ackerman P.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7345-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the validity of some early data has recently been questioned (57Litchfield D.W. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of CKII, a serine/threonine kinase, is regulated by phosphorylation (58Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Changes in CKII have been reported in several cases and more than a hundred substrates are known for CKII. So far, no signal transduction pathways have been described that might involve CKII. Our results with wortmannin and rapamycin showed that PI-3 kinase and FRAP are not upstream components of the CKII signaling pathway. Therefore, it is unlikely that CKII is a major regulator of eIF2B in this system, despite its ability to increase eIF2B activity in vitro (22Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the effects of NGF and EGF on CKII activation are similar to those of MAPK phosphorylation (35Kleijn M. Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 59Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), transient for EGF and sustained for NGF. Two lines of evidence support a role for GSK-3 in the regulation of eIF2B. First, the time courses of NGF- and EGF-induced GSK-3 inactivation in vivo matched that of eIF2B activation. GSK-3 phosphorylation and thereby inactivation has been reported after treatment of cells with insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and EGF (23Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 60Saito Y. Vandenheede J.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 61Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). A correlation between GSK-3 inactivation and eIF2B activation has previously been shown after T cell activation (25Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11410-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). And second, the signal transduction pathway involved in eIF2B activation and GSK-3 inactivation is wortmannin sensitive. The PI-3 kinase-dependent eIF2B activation and GSK-3 inactivation is consistent with a regulatory role for GSK-3 in NGF- and EGF-induced eIF2B activation. Activation of eIF2B was partially dependent on FRAP, whereas GSK-3 inactivation was independent. This indicates that a FRAP-dependent and most likely a GSK-3-independent signaling pathway is involved in eIF2B activation. Regulation of eIF2B activity by a different kinase or phosphatase is supported by the result that GSK-3 activity did not change after glucose stimulation of the islet of Langerhans, whereas eIF2B activity did (27Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Three different protein kinases are able to phosphorylate GSK-3in vitro, namely p70S6K (62Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), MAPKAPK-1 (p90rsk) (63Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and protein kinase B (PKB) (64Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), although current evidence favors PKB as playing a major role in the physiological control of GSK-3 activity (64Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway leading to GSK-3 inactivation in PC12 cells after NGF and EGF treatment still needs to be elucidated. Rapamycin did not affect GSK-3 inactivation, which rules out a role for p70S6K in the control of GSK-3. It is unlikely that GSK-3 is inactivated via the MAPK pathway since MAPK phosphorylation was only partially inhibited by wortmannin in PC12 cells (35Kleijn M. Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas this agent completely abolished the effects of NGF and EGF on eIF2B and GSK-3. Cross et al. (64Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar) have also provided data showing that the MAPK pathway is not required for the inactivation of GSK-3 by insulin in L6 myocytes. Taken together with the data of Kleijn et al. (35Kleijn M. Korthout M.M.R. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the present findings support a role for PKB in GSK-3 inactivation, since activation of PKB, like that of eIF2B, is sensitive to wortmannin but not to rapamycin and is independent of the MAPK pathway (64Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar, 65Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of PKB in eIF2B activation has not yet been addressed. Inhibition by rapamycin of the stimulation of protein synthesis could be explained by a reduction in translation of specific mRNAs containing a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) at the 5′-end. The family of TOP mRNAs encodes ribosomal proteins, translation elongation factors, and other proteins. All these proteins play a prominent role in cell growth (38Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Recruitment of TOP mRNAs is correlated with phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 by p70S6K (38Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) in response to several mitogens (67Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). Because NGF induced a higher level of p70S6K activity (Fig. 4) one would expect translation of TOP mRNAs after NGF addition. However, p70S6K-dependent translation does not seem to play an important role in NGF-induced protein synthesis. Translation of TOP mRNAs needs to be studied after NGF and EGF treatment of PC12 cells to determine whether there is a difference in translation of these mRNAs after a differentiation (NGF) or a growth (EGF) stimulus. We thank Bridget Craddock (Bristol) for the purification of rabbit reticulocyte eIF2 and Dr. G. Krause for providing us with the antibody against phosphorylated eIF2α."

Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic mRNA transcripts, selenocysteine is encoded by a UGA codon, which conventionally serves as one of the three translation termination signals (8Burk R.F. Hill K.E.

The mechanism for this alternative reading of the genetic code differs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In bacterial cells, translation of the UGA codon in transcripts for selenoenzymes such asEscherichia coli formate dehydrogenase depends upon the SELB gene product, which specifically recognizes a short sequence element that is located immediately 3′ to the UGA and forms a hairpin secondary structure (10Ringquist S. Schneider D. Gibson T. Baron C. Böck A. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, translation of eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNA depends upon an 80–90-nucleotide sequence element in the 3′-untranslated region (11Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y.Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D.

The membranes were removed from the culture plates, blocked in BLOTTO (5× Denhardt's reagent) at room temperature for 1 h, and air dried at room temperature for 15 min. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The membranes were submerged twice for 10 min in 200 ml of HEPES binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mguanidine HCl) and then submerged twice for 5 min in the same buffer with five serial 2-fold dilutions of guanidine HCl and then HEPES binding buffer without guanidine HCl. After 30 min of incubation with BLOTTO, the filters were soaked for 5 min in “buffer K” (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm ATP and GTP) and hybridized for 2 h with 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled GPX1 SECIS RNA probe supplemented with 0.5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5 mg/mlE. coli total tRNA, 1000 unit/ml RNasin (Promega), and 0.25 mg/ml heparin sulfate. The membranes were washed twice for 1 h with buffer K and then subjected to autoradiography. Synthesis of32P-labeled RNA probes for library screening and electrophoretic mobility shift assays was performed as described previously (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human dbpB cDNAs in λgt11 plaques positive by two consecutive screenings were excised from λgt11 by NotI digestion and ligated into the NotI site of pBluescript KS. Ligation of the 1.4-kilobase pair dbpB cDNA into the His tag vector pRSET B (Invitrogen) was achieved by insertion of a SacI-PstI fragment of dbpB cDNA from pBluescript KS into pRSET B digested bySacI-PstI. Constructs of pBluescript KS (Stratagene) with inserts of wild type and mutant GPX1 SECIS sequences and pSP64 (Promega) carrying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) trans-activation response (TAR) element were developed as described previously (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously (21Newburger P.E. Dai Q. Whitney C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16171-16177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from these and from HL-60 cells by differential precipitation from guanidine HCl (22Ginsburg D. Handin R.I. Bonthron D.T. Donlon T.A. Bruns G.A.P. Latt S.A. Orkin S.H. Science. 1985; 228: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and processed by standard methods for Northern blot analysis (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar). The plasmid pRSET B (Invitrogen) containing His-tagged dbpB cDNA was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid pLysE, so that the expression of the fused gene was controlled by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.5–0.8, induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and then lysed by sonication. Recombinant His-tagged dbpB was purified by F chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Inc.) and then further purified by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Antibodies against a dbpB peptide were raised in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of human dbpB (AENSSAPEAEQGGAE) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin at an additional N-terminal tyrosine. Domain-specific anti-dbpB antibodies were purified from rabbit serum by affinity chromatography on peptide-Affi-Gel 10 affinity matrices and stored frozen at −70 °C until use. Rabbit antibody against the entire His-tagged dbpB protein was prepared (at Berkeley Antibodies, Inc., Berkeley, CA) by immunization of rabbits with recombinant protein. Concentrated rabbit polyclonal anti-dbpB IgG was prepared by precipitation of rabbit serum with 40% ammonium sulfate, followed by resuspension in buffer K and concentration by Micron (Amicon) ultrafiltration. For affinity purification of anti-dbpB IgG, an affinity column was prepared by coupling the His-tagged dbpB protein to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) following standard procedures (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-504Google Scholar); then immunoaffinity purification of the antibody was accomplished by standard methods (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-504Google Scholar). Antibodies for primary probing included antibodies to dbpB as described above as well as a mouse monoclonal antibody (T7-Tag AP conjugate system; Novagen, Inc.) recognizing the 11-amino acid epitope coded by sequences in the multicloning site of the vector pRSET B (Invitrogen, Inc.). Western blots were performed according to the protocol of the ProtoBlot Western blot AP System (Promega). Briefly, protein samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, membranes were incubated with antibody, in some cases in the absence or the presence of 5 μl of 10 mg/ml dbpB C-terminal 15-amino acid peptide or His-tagged dbpB protein. Detection of antibody-targeted protein bands was achieved by either alkaline phosphatase-mediated color development (Promega) or by horseradish peroxidase-mediated chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) after second antibody incubation with appropriately conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG. Gel shifts were performed as described previously (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For “supershift” assays, 5–10 μl of concentrated, affinity-purified anti-dbpB antibody was added to the gel shift assay mixture and incubated 20 min at 30 °C and then 20 min at 4 °C prior to loading on the gel. Two λgt11 cDNA expression libraries from human K562 and HeLa cell lines were screened with a32P-labeled synthetic RNA transcript from the SECIS region of the human cellular glutathione peroxidase gene GPX1 (4Mullenbach G.T. Tabrizi A. Irvine B.D. Bell G.I. Hallewell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This RNA probe was identical to that used for detection and characterization of SECIS binding activity in COS-1 cell extracts (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Shen Q. Leonard J.L. Newburger P.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 519-525PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 107 phage plaques were screened from each of the two libraries. Approximately 60 positive plaques were detected by binding of the radiolabeled GPX1 SECIS probe and specificity was established by secondary screening. For the secondary screening, two additional radiolabeled RNA probes were used as negative controls: a mutant GPX1 SECIS probe with a deletion of six nucleotides at the 3′ end and a probe containing the HIV TAR element found at the 5′ ends of all nascent HIV-1 transcripts. The former probe was predicted by the FOLDRNA program (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) to form an overall stem loop secondary structure identical to the native SECIS except for the loss of the second strand of the basal stem. The HIV TAR element also forms a stem loop (27Gait M.J. Karn J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 255-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) but with structural features distinct from that of the GPX1 SECIS. We had previously demonstrated by gel shift analysis that the SECIS-binding protein from COS-1 cells has a much higher affinity for the wild type than for the deletion mutant GPX1 SECIS probe and that it does not recognize the HIV TAR element (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore candidate plaques were selected by the following criteria: strong signal with the wild type GPX1 SECIS probe, weaker signal with the deletion mutant probe, and no signal with the HIV TAR probe. After secondary screening, sequencing of phage clones from the positive plaques revealed segments of dbpB cDNA in four independent clones from the K562 cDNA library and three from the HeLa cDNA library. The largest cDNA clone, containing 1.4 kilobases, was identical to the published (17Sakura H. Maekawa T. Imamoto F. Yasuda K. Ishii S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) dbpB sequence (GenBank™ accession number M24070), although it contained only 45 of the reported 120 nucleotides in the 5′-untranslated region. It encodes a 324-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 37 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence contains four arginine-rich domains (underlined in Fig. 1 A) characteristic of a group of RNA-binding proteins including HIV Tat, HIV Rev, and bacteriophage p22 antiterminator N proteins (20Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 28Lazinski D. Grzadzielska E. Das A. Cell. 1989; 59: 207-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the region from amino acids 241 to 256 shows a high level of homology to the HIV Tat domain previously shown to be essential for binding of the TAR element in viral RNA transcripts (27Gait M.J. Karn J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 255-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These features suggested that dbpB was a good candidate for the GPX1 SECIS-binding protein. Northern blot analyses of total RNA from primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages (21Newburger P.E. Dai Q. Whitney C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16171-16177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from the HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cell line (29Breitman T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) show a single transcript approximately 1.9 kilobase in length (data not shown). To characterize the GPX1 SECIS binding activity of dbpB, we prepared peptide-tagged dbpB with an N-terminal six-histidine epitope, overexpressed the construct in E. coli, and purified the His-tagged protein on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column. The purity and molecular mass were confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). The purified His-tagged protein specifically bound the GPX1 SECIS element, as demonstrated both by direct binding and by competition with the native binding activity in COS-1 cytosol extracts. In RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays, illustrated in Fig. 2, incubation of the His-tagged dbpB with radiolabeled GPX1 SECIS RNA produced a major shift of probe to a position of slower migration through the gel (seventh lane). Furthermore, addition of increasing amounts of the His-tagged protein to the assay mixtures containing probe and COS-1 extract (third through sixth lanes) caused a steady decrease in the intensity of two cytosolic gel shift bands and a concomitant increase in the intensity of a single, newly formed band with a slightly slower migration rate. In separate electrophoretic mobility shift assays (not shown), the purified His-tagged dbpB produced a gel shift with the SECIS from the rat type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase but did not interact with aGPX1 SECIS 6-nucleotide basal stem deletion probe or an HIV TAR probe, indicating that its binding is not strictly limited to the SECIS from GPX1 and that it specifically recognizes the functional form of the SECIS over nonfunctional or unrelated stem loop RNA structures. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown) confirmed that HeLa cytosol extract caused the same band retardation pattern on the nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel as that obtained with the COS-1 extract. Western blots (Fig. 3,first and second lanes) with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of dbpB showed a single protein band of approximately 48 kDa of molecular mass in cytosol extracts from both cell types. Preincubation of the antibody with the C-terminal peptide from dbpB completely eliminated the bands (Fig. 3, third and fourth lanes). The estimated size of the immunoreactive protein exceeds that predicted by the cDNA sequence and expressed in E. coli, a discrepancy most likely due to either post-translational modification in mammalian cells or truncation of the dbpB cDNA during the library construction. To establish that dbpB contributed directly to the RNA gel shift bands produced by incubation of GPX1 SECIS probe with COS-1 cell extracts, we tested whether addition of antibody to dbpB would produce a supershift due to further retardation of electrophoretic mobility by attachment of antibody to the protein-RNA complex. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of concentrated rabbit polyclonal anti-dbpB IgG raised against recombinant His-tagged dbpB resulted in the appearance of a slowly migrating supershifted band (lane 4) and in some experiments (not shown) the diminution of intensity of both gel shift bands. Addition of preimmune IgG did not produce any supershift (lane 3) nor did addition of the immune IgG without COS-1 extract (lane 6). Similar results were obtained with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-dbpB antiserum (not shown). These results indicate that dbpB-SECIS interactions contribute to the gel shift observed with COS-1 cell extracts, which we have previously demonstrated to represent specific binding to the GPX1 SECIS element (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The molecular cloning of a human SECIS-binding protein by screening a cDNA expression library with a radiolabeledGPX1 SECIS RNA probe reveals that dbpB specifically binds to the RNA structure essential for translation of selenoproteins. Historically, as the name implies, dbpB was first identified as a DNA-binding protein of unknown specificity and was cloned from a human placenta expression library using DNA fragments from an enhancer region of the human epidermal growth factor receptor gene and the promoter region of the human c-erb-2 gene (17Sakura H. Maekawa T. Imamoto F. Yasuda K. Ishii S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). dbpB is a member of the EFIA/dbpB/YB-1 family of DNA-binding proteins, whose members share, along with DNA-binding protein A (30Kudo S. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a highly conserved region of 100 amino acids highly homologous to the E. coli cold shock domain (31Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although dbpB has previously had no known function, it binds to the leukosialin (CD43) promoter (30Kudo S. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); in addition, a binding protein clone “BP-8,” which is virtually identical to dbpB, binds two functionally significant homopyrimidine sites that form intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) structures upstream from the human γ-globin genes (19Horwitz E.M. Maloney K.A. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14130-14139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enhancer factor IA is a trans-acting factor that binds to the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat enhancer and promoter at two inverted CCAAT box motifs (32Ozer J. Faber M. Chalkley R. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y box-binding members of the family include YB-1, a protein that recognizes the Y box (inverted CCAAT motif) of the HLA-DR α chain gene (18Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zacheis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), as well as two Xenopus CCAAT-binding transcription factors, FRGY1 and FRGY2 (33Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); the former is 83% homologous to dbpB. At least two other members of the EFIA/dbpB/YB-1 family also bind RNA and are involved in translational regulation. FRGY2 binds RNA at basic regions distinct from the cold shock domains (34Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5582-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The major core protein of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (p50) is also a member of the Y box family (35Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and appears to function primarily as a nonspecific, probably translationally inhibitory, RNA-binding protein. Many RNA-binding proteins are bifunctional, with other roles including transcriptional regulation, like the EFIA/dbpB/YB-1 family, as well as enzymatic activities. The homeodomain DNA-binding protein bicoid also recognizes and binds to discrete target sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of mRNA encoding the opposing homeodomain protein caudal, leading to its translational suppression (36Dubnau J. Struhl G. Nature. 1996; 379: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 37Rivera-Pomar R. Niessing D. Schmidt-Ott U. Gehring W.J. Jackle H. Nature. 1996; 379: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The enzyme aconitase plays dual roles as a Krebs cycle catalyst and as the binding protein that regulates translation and stability of ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNAs by specific attachment to stem loop structures in their untranslated regions (38Philpott C.C. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). RNA binding activities have also been reported for the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (40Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 259: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), enoyl-CoA hydratase (41Nakagawa J. Waldner H. Meyer-Monard S. Hofsteenge J. Jenö P. Moroni C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and glutamate dehydrogenase (42Preiss T. Sang A.E. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M.A. Lightowlers R.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). dbpB probably represents the smaller of the two previously identified binding proteins with estimated molecular masses of 55 and 65 kDa identified by UV-cross-linking and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Shen Q. McQuilkin P.A. Newburger P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30448-30452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The other band could contain a complex of dbpB with other binding proteins (such as those discussed below) or could represent retardation of the SECIS probe by DNA-binding protein A, a closely related polypeptide that contains the homologous cold shock domain and arginine-rich motifs as dbpB and thus probably cross-reacts with the polyclonal anti-dbpB antibody. dbpB may also be the same as the 48-kDa protein identified by antibodies in serum of chronic autoimmune hepatitis patients and shown to bind selenocysteine tRNA (43Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9739-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). If so, then its function in selenoprotein synthesis could be to bring the SECIS and selenocysteine tRNA together to help form a structure that facilitates translation in place of chain termination. Functionally, dbpB probably participates as part of a complex of proteins or nucleoproteins that utilize the SECIS element to permit the translation of the coding region UGA codon as selenocysteine. In particular, dbpB differs from the prokaryotic SELB protein (44Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) in that it does not contain any elongation factor domains; therefore that function probably involves another factor, such as one of the other specific SECIS-binding proteins that have been identified by gel shift and UV-cross-linking studies (15Hubert N. Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 464-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A 60–65-kDa protein in human and rat cells binds the SECIS elements from both rat glutathione peroxidase and rat type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase transcripts, with somewhat higher affinity for the former (15Hubert N. Walczak R. Carbon P. Krol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 464-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 120-kDa protein found in rat testis cytosol binds to the SECIS of mRNA encoding both rat cellular and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases and specifically requires one of the short conserved sequences (16Lesoon A. Mehta A. Singh R. Chisolm G.M. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One or both of these proteins may combine with dbpB to permit selenocysteine insertion during protein synthesis. The molecular cloning of dbpB and its identification as the first eukaryotic SECIS-binding protein opens the way to the elucidation of the entire complex necessary for the alternative reading of the genetic code that permits translation of selenoproteins.

https://openalex.org/W2025395236,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) catalysis involves a cysteinyl phosphate intermediate, in which the phosphoryl group cannot be transferred to nucleophiles other than water. The dual specificity phosphatases and the low molecular weight phosphatases utilize the same chemical mechanism for catalysis and contain the same (H/V)C(X)5R(S/T) signature motif present in PTPases. Interestingly, the latter two groups of phosphatases do catalyze phosphoryl transfers to alcohols in addition to water. Unique to the PTPase family are two invariant Gln residues which are located at the active site. Mutations at Gln-446 (and to a much smaller extent Gln-450) to Ala, Asn, or Met (but not Glu) residues disrupt a bifurcated hydrogen bond between the side chain of Gln-446 and the nucleophilic water and confer phosphotransferase activity to the Yersinia PTPase. Thus, the conserved Gln-446 residue is responsible for maintaining PTPases' strict hydrolytic activity and for preventing the PTPases from acting as kinases to phosphorylate undesirable substrates. This explains why phosphoryl transfer from the phosphoenzyme intermediate in PTPases can only occur to water and not to other nucleophilic acceptors. Detailed kinetic analyses also suggest roles for Gln-446 and Gln-450 in PTPase catalysis. Although Gln-446 is not essential for the phosphoenzyme formation step, it plays an important role during the hydrolysis of the intermediate by sequestering and positioning the nucleophilic water in the active site for an in-line attack on the phosphorus atom of the cysteinyl phosphate intermediate. Gln-450 interacts through a bound water molecule with the phosphoryl moiety and may play a role for the precise alignment of active site residues, which are important for substrate binding and transition state stabilization for both of the chemical steps.

So far, approximately 100 PTPases have been identified, and the predicted total number of human PTPases may reach 500 based on the available genome sequencing data (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar, 2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment of PTPases from bacteria, yeast, and mammalian organisms indicates that the only structural element that has amino acid sequence identity among all PTPases corresponds to the catalytic domain that spans over 250 residues (3Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The hallmark feature that defines the PTPases is the active site sequence (H/V)C(X)5 R(S/T) in the catalytic domain also known as the PTPase signature motif (4Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Work from a number of laboratories has led to the conclusion that PTPase catalysis proceeds through a double displacement mechanism involving a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate. The side chain of the active site Cys residue serves as a nucleophile to accept the phosphoryl group from the phosphotyrosine in a substrate and form a kinetically competent cysteinyl phosphate intermediate (5Guan K.L.

The active site Arg residue interacts with the phosphoryl moiety of the substrate and plays a role in both substrate binding and transition state stabilization (4Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.

S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In addition, the conserved hydroxyl group of the Ser/Thr in the PTPase signature motif is essential for efficient hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (8Zhang Z.-Y. Palfey B.A. Wu L. Zhao Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16389-16396Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To facilitate substrate turnover, PTPases also employ an invariant Asp residue acting as a general acid/base catalyst (3Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the catalytic strategy employed by PTPases is also shared by the dual specificity phosphatases and the low molecular weight phosphatases, which share little sequence identity with the PTPases (10Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The only similarities among these three groups of phosphatases are the relative placements of the essential cysteine, arginine, and serine/threonine residues in the active sites that constitute the PTPase signature motif (H/V)C(X)5 R(S/T). Despite the lack of sequence identity, the spatial arrangements of the catalytic Cys, Arg, Ser/Thr, and Asp residues are conserved (12Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), consistent with the common catalytic mechanism. However, it is also apparent that even though these phosphatases utilize the same mechanism to catalyze phosphate monoester hydrolysis, they differ in active site specificity and exhibit measurably different structure of the transition state (14Hengge A.C. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7928-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To understand the structural and biochemical origins for these functional differences, we have begun to investigate the role of amino acids that are conserved only in a specific phosphatase subfamily.The pathogenic bacteria Yersinia encodes a PTPase essential for its virulence (15Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Because of its extraordinary phosphatase activity, the Yersinia PTPase has been the archetype of the PTPase family for mechanistic investigations. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the Yersinia PTPases combined with detailed kinetic analyses have provided important insight into residues that are essential for PTPase catalysis (3Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16389-16396Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examined the functional role of two invariant glutamines (Gln-446 and Gln-450 in the Yersinia PTPase) located at the C terminus of the PTPase catalytic domains (Fig. 1). As shown in the crystal structures, the two Gln residues are situated at the active site (16Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 17Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). There are no corresponding Gln residues in the dual specificity phosphatases and the low molecular weight phosphatases. The crystal structures of the Yersinia PTPase complexed with oxyanion such as tungstate or sulfate have shown that the apical anion oxygen (O1) is coordinated by the side chain of Gln-446 (Fig. 2 and Refs. 18Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 19Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both Gln-446 and Gln-450 form hydrogen bonds with a conserved structural water, WAT1 (WAT505 in PTP1B, Ref. 20Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), which also interacts with the apical oxygen and one of the phosphoryl oxygens (O2) in the oxyanion (Fig. 2). The apical oxygen in the oxyanion occupies the position that is equivalent to the phenolic oxygen of the leaving group in the phosphoenzyme formation step or the oxygen atom of the attacking nucleophilic water molecule in the phosphoenzyme hydrolysis step. Furthermore, the structure of the catalytic inactive C215S mutant PTP1B with phosphotyrosine bound indicates that the side chain of Gln-262 (equivalent to Gln-446 of the Yersinia PTPase) forms part of the phenyl ring binding pocket, and the Nε2 of Gln-266 interacts with WAT505, which makes a hydrogen bond with the phenolic oxygen of phosphotyrosine (20Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate the functional importance of the two invariant Gln residues in PTPase-catalyzed reaction.Figure 2Active site features of the Yersinia PTPase detailing the interactions of Gln-446 and Gln-450.

These two Gln residues are unique to the PTPase family and no corresponding residues are present in the dual specificity phosphatases and the low molecular weight phosphatases. In the structure of PTP1B/C215S bound with substrate, the side chain of Gln-262 (equivalent to Gln-446 in Yersinia PTPase) interacts with the phenyl ring of the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)), and defines a portion of the rim for the Tyr(P) binding pocket (20Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A similar interaction between Gln-446 and Tyr(P) is observed in an energy minimized model of the Yersinia PTPase with Tyr(P) bound (19Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the structures of PTPases bound with substrates or oxyanions, a trapped structural water molecule, WAT1 in the Yersinia PTPase and WAT505 in PTP1B, is observed (19Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). WAT1 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of the invariant residues Gln-446 and Gln-450, O-1 and O-2 of the oxyanion, and the carboxylate of the general acid/base Asp-356 in the PTPase-oxyanion complexes (Fig. 2). In the PTPase-substrate complexes, this water molecule makes hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Gln-450, the tyrosine leaving group oxygen (the scissile oxygen), O-2 of the phosphate, and the carboxylate of the general acid/base Asp-356 (Fig. 7 A, and Ref. 20Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a new water molecule, WAT3, is identified in the Yersinia PTPase-nitrate complex as well as in an energy minimized model of the phosphocysteine intermediate (19Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nitrate is coplanar and lacks the apical oxygen present in tetrahedral oxyanion such as tungstate. Instead, WAT3 sits directly above the nitrate and is perfectly in line with the sulfur atom of the active site Cys residue. WAT3 is proposed to be the nucleophilic attacking molecule for hydrolysis of the cysteinyl phosphate intermediate and is coordinated primarily by the side chains of Gln-446, Gln-357, Asp-356, and WAT1 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 7 B, Ref. 19Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Based on the reported structural data, Gln-446 and Gln-450 likely participate in both of the chemical steps, i.e., phosphoenzyme formation and decay. Gln-446 may function to help to align the phenyl ring of Tyr(P) in the first step and to position the attacking water in the second step. Gln-450 makes a hydrogen bond with WAT1, which in turn is in hydrogen bonding distance with the apical oxygen (O-1) and one of the phosphoryl oxygen (O-2). Thus, Gln-450 may play a role in proper stabilization of the metaphosphate-like transition state (31Hengge A.C. Sowa G Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13982-13987Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as well as in leaving group stabilization and nucleophile activation. For the Yersinia PTPase, the kinetic parameter kcat/Km is primarily limited by the phosphoenzyme intermediate formation step (31Hengge A.C. Sowa G Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13982-13987Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas the kcat term is mostly determined by intermediate breakdown. Results from kinetic analysis of the site-directed mutants of Gln-446 and Gln-450 confirm some of the structural data and provide additional insights into the mechanisms by which these two residues effect catalysis.Replacements of Gln-446 by Ala, Asn, or Met have minimal effect onkcat/Km and only less than 10-fold reduction in kcat. In the case of PTP1B/Q262A, kcat/Km and kcat are reduced by 7- and 83-fold, respectively, using the tyrosine-phosphorylated lysozyme as a substrate (7Flint A.J. Taganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It is not clear why a larger reduction in kcat is observed for the PTP1B/Q262A mutant. It appears that Gln-446 does not play a significant role in the phosphoenzyme formation step. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the putative nucleophilic water molecule is coordinated by a bidentate hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-446. Such an interaction does not exist in the Q446A, Q446N, and Q446M mutants so that the positioning of the attacking water could be affected leading to a reduced rate for the phosphoenzyme hydrolysis step. Indeed, within the PTP1B/Q262A phosphoenzyme intermediate, the position of the nucleophilic water is displaced by 1.5 Å from being colinear with the active site Cys-215 Sγ-P bond. 2D. Barford, personal communication. The moderate decrease in rate for phosphoenzyme hydrolysis observed in the Yersinia Gln-446 mutants is consistent with a dissociative transition state for which minimal activation of the nucleophilic water is required (29Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11797-11804Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, a water molecule may take the place of the Gln-446 side chain and partially rescue its function in the second step. A new water is found at the position of the side chain of Gln-262 in the structure of PTP1B/Q262A phosphoenzyme complex.2This may also explain the fact that Gln-446 mutants possess similar oxyanion binding affinity as the wild type.Replacements of Gln-450 by Ala or Met have larger effects on both the kcat/Km and kcat, consistent with the notion that it interacts through WAT1 with a phosphoryl oxygen, and the leaving group oxygen in the first step and a phosphoryl oxygen, and the attacking water in the second step. The results obtained with Q446E and Q450E are rather interesting. Although glutamic acid and glutamine are isosteric, the Gln to Glu substitution at residue 450 manifests the most deleterious effects with up to 1200-fold decrease in kcat/Km, and 66-fold decrease in kcat, 20-fold increase in Km for pNPP and 30-fold increase in Ki for arsenate. Furthermore, these deleterious effects increase as the pH is raised. These results strongly suggest that in the native Yersinia PTPase, the carboxyamide side chain must donate a hydrogen bond to WAT1 through its amide group (Fig. 7). WAT1 may receive another hydrogen bond from Asp-356 or the backbone amide from Gln-357, and donate one hydrogen bond to a phosphoryl oxygen and another hydrogen bond to the leaving group oxygen or the attacking water (Fig. 7). Thus, deprotonation of the carboxylic acid at residue 450 in Q450E will cause detrimental effects due to charge repulsion. In contrast, it appears that Gln-446 can be largely replaced by a Glu residue with little change in kcat and only moderate increase in Km for pNPP and Ki for arsenate.Gln-446 Is the Residue Escorting the Nucleophilic WaterThe ability to catalyze phosphoryl transfer to nucleophilic acceptors in addition to water is a common feature for phosphate ester hydrolases, such as nonspecific alkaline and acid phosphatases, that involve a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate (32Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 206-209Google Scholar). The PTPase-catalyzed reaction proceeds through a covalent phosphocysteine intermediate that is subsequently hydrolyzed by water. However, careful investigations from this laboratory have shown that the Yersinia PTPase and the human PTP1B can only catalyze the transfer of the phosphoryl group from the intermediate to water, yielding inorganic phosphate. Similar observations have also been made with other PTPases. For example, LAR-D1 PTPase does not show a discernible tendency to transfer the phosphoryl group to ethylene glycol or glycerol, and the CD45 catalytic fragment displayed no phosphotransferase activity to alcohols as cosubstrates (33Cho H. Ramer S.E. Itoh M. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Burn P. Saito H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Glycerol or propane-1,2-diols, at concentrations of 4–6 m, accelerated the kcat of the full-length SHP-1 by 47-fold and of the PTPase domain by 8-fold. However, 31P NMR spectroscopy indicates no formation of glycerol phosphate during hydrolysis of pNPP by SHP-1 in 50% glycerol (34Wang J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The increase in rate is likely caused by a glycerol induced conformational change which alleviates the autoinhibited state.Alcohols are better nucleophiles than water for accepting a phosphoryl group (29Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11797-11804Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol are much better nucleophilic acceptors of phosphoryl group than water and yet they fail to serve as phosphate acceptors in the PTPase reaction indicates that the phosphoryl group in the intermediate is only accessible by water. As shown in the PTPase-oxyanion complexes, the side chain of Gln-446 interacts with the apical oxygen of the oxyanion, which effectively shields the oxyanion from the aqueous environment (18Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the PTPase-nitrate complex or the energy-minimized model of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (19Fauman E.B. Yuvaniyama C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18780-18788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) the side chain of Gln-446 coordinates the attacking nucleophilic water via a bidentate hydrogen bond. Thus, nucleophiles larger than water such as alcohols cannot gain access into the active site due to steric hindrance. Alternatively, it is also possible that both protons of the nucleophilic water are required for proper positioning for the nucleophilic attack. For example, the nucleophilic water can donate one H-bond to Oε1 of Gln-446 and the other to the side chain of Asp-356, which is consistent with the carboxylate functioning as a general base in the phosphoenzyme hydrolysis step (21Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5426-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The nucleophilic water can also receive a hydrogen bond either from Nε2 of Gln-446 or from WAT1 (Fig. 7). Such interactions would position the water in an optimal position for nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom (Fig. 7). Since alcohols are incapable of making the same interactions and they can only donate one H-bond, they cannot serve as phosphoryl acceptors.Substitutions at Gln-446 by an Ala, an Asn, or a Met abolishes the specific bidentate hydrogen bonding interactions with the nucleophilic water and results in either smaller side chains (Q446A and Q446N) or a side chain with an increased mobility (Q446M), such that alcohols can replace the nucleophilic water and gain access to the phosphoenzyme intermediate. This notion is supported by the observations that Q446A, Q446N, and Q446M all displayed phosphoryl transfer activities. Q450A and Q450M also exhibited minor phosphotransfer activities. This may be caused by the slight misalignment in Gln-446 due to the disruption of the interactions between Gln-450 and WAT1 (Fig. 7). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that Gln-446 functions to escort and orient the attacking water molecule for the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate. The isosteric substitution of Gln-446 by a Glu residue introduces minimal alterations in the kinetic parameters and does not confer phosphotransfer activity to the YersiniaPTPase, suggesting that the Glu residue at 446 is protonated at pH 6.0 so that a similar bidentate hydrogen bond can be made with the nucleophilic water. Interestingly, although substitution of Gln-450 by a Glu residue leads to dramatic decrease in both catalytic efficiency and substrate/inhibitor affinity, the Q450E mutant still maintains the hydrolytic activity with no phosphotransferase activity. This implies that the Gln-450 to Glu substitution does not introduce drastic structural alterations into the enzyme active site, especially in the context of Gln-446.ConclusionsRegulation of enzyme activity by reversible cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is now considered to be one of the most important means by which cells respond to physiological stimuli. To ensure the precision and fidelity of this regulation, it may be desirable that the PTPase only possesses hydrolytic activity and protects the highly reactive phosphoenzyme intermediate from unwanted nucleophilic acceptors (such as Ser or Thr residues in a protein) during its course of action. It is shown here that Gln-446 is responsible for keeping this unwanted “kinase” activity in check. The PTPases, the dual specificity phosphatases and the low molecular weight phosphatases employ a similar chemical mechanism for phosphate monoester hydrolysis. However, in contrast to the PTPases, which possess no phosphoryl transfer activity, both the low molecular weight phosphatases (21Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5426-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11797-11804Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z.-Y. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1516-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the dual specificity phosphatase VHR (this study) are able to catalyze the transfer of the phosphoryl group from the intermediate to alcohol nucleophiles as well as to water. The biological implication for this observed mechanistic difference is unclear. Results from kinetic characterization of the Gln-446 and Gln-450 mutant PTPases combined with structural information on PTPases support the conclusion that the two invariant Gln residues constitute an integral part of the PTPase active site, serving different roles in the catalytic reaction. Gln-450 plays a role for the precise alignment of active site residues, which are important for substrate binding and transition state stabilization, whereas Gln-446 is important for the optimal positioning of the nucleophilic water molecule in the phosphoenzyme hydrolysis step.

So far, approximately 100 PTPases have been identified, and the predicted total number of human PTPases may reach 500 based on the available genome sequencing data (1Hunter T.

Amino acid sequence alignment of PTPases from bacteria, yeast, and mammalian organisms indicates that the only structural element that has amino acid sequence identity among all PTPases corresponds to the catalytic domain that spans over 250 residues (3Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The hallmark feature that defines the PTPases is the active site sequence (H/V)C(X)5 R(S/T) in the catalytic domain also known as the PTPase signature motif (4Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.

Work from a number of laboratories has led to the conclusion that PTPase catalysis proceeds through a double displacement mechanism involving a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate.

The peptide transporter shows such a broad range of substrate specificity; however, the mechanism that recognizes substrates by the peptide transporter has been incompletely understood. Previously, we have cloned rat H+/peptide transporters, PEPT1 (10Saito H. Okuda M. Terada T. Sasaki S. Inui K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar) and PEPT2 (11Saito H. Terada T. Okuda M. Sasaki S. Inui K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and constructed PEPT1- and PEPT2-expressing transfectants (12Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 1415-1421PubMed Google Scholar, 14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar). Using these transfectants, we demonstrated that both PEPT1 and PEPT2 recognized various orally active β-lactam antibiotics (14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar). When PEPT1-expressing cells were treated with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), 1The abbreviation used is: DEPC, diethylpyrocarbonate. which is a histidine residue modifier, ceftibuten (anionic cephalosporin without an α-amino group) uptake was completely abolished (12Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using the site-directed mutagenesis technique, the histidine residues at positions 57 and 121 of rat PEPT1 were suggested to be involved in substrate recognition and/or responsible for the intrinsic activity of the transporter (12Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To elucidate the diversity of the substrate recognition by the peptide transporters, it is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the interaction of the substrates with the essential residues of PEPT1 and PEPT2. Because histidine residues of the peptide transporters have been indicated as the most important key amino acid residues (12Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Miyamoto Y. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16133-16140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kato M. Maegawa H. Okano T. Inui K. Hori R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 745-749PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the functional role of histidine residues to examine the preventive effect of various substrates on the DEPC-induced inactivation of PEPT1 and PEPT2. We report here that the DEPC-sensitive histidine residue of rat PEPT1 and PEPT2 can serve as the binding site of the α-amino group of the substrates. The parental LLC-PK1 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1392) were cultured in complete medium, which consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Whittaker Bioproducts Inc., Walkersville, MD) without antibiotics in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. The LLC-PK1 cells transfected with rat PEPT1 cDNA (LLC-rPEPT1) and with rat PEPT2 cDNA (LLC-rPEPT2) were used as described, previously (14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar). In the uptake experiments, the cells were cultured for 6–7 days in complete medium. Uptake of [14C]glycylsarcosine was measured in cells grown in 60-mm plastic dishes as described previously (14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content of the cell monolayers solubilized in 1 n NaOH was determined by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine γ-globulin as the standard. Cefadroxil (Bristol Meyers Co., Tokyo, Japan), cefixime (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan), ceftibuten (Shionogi and Co., Osaka, Japan), cephradine (Sankyo Co., Tokyo, Japan), cyclacillin (Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan.), and bestatin ((2R,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanoyl-l-leucine) (Nippon Kayaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) were gifts from the respective suppliers. [14C]Glycylsarcosine (1.78 GBq/mmol) was obtained from Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Ibaraki, Japan). Glycylsarcosine and lysyl-l-lysine were obtained from Sigma. Glutamyl-l-glutamic acid was purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Captopril and DEPC were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. At first, we examined the concentration dependence for the inhibitory effect of DEPC on [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake. When the LLC-rPEPT1 and LLC-rPEPT2 cells were treated with various concentrations of DEPC, the half-maximal inhibition for [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake in both transfectants was observed at about 0.4 mm, and the maximal inhibition was at 1 mm (Table I). Therefore, the concentration of DEPC for subsequent studies was 1 mm. Fig. 1 shows the effect of DEPC treatment on [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake by LLC-rPEPT1 or LLC-rPEPT2 cells and the preventive effect of glycylsarcosine on the DEPC-induced inhibition. The uptake of [14C]glycylsarcosine by the transfectants was inhibited markedly by the pretreatment with 1 mm DEPC. This inhibition was abolished mostly by unlabeled 10 mmglycylsarcosine.Table IEffect of DEPC concentration on [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake by LLC-rPEPT1 and LLC-rPEPT2 cellsDEPC concentration[14C]Glycylsarcosine uptakeLLC-rPEPT1 cellsLLC-rPEPT2 cellsmmpmol/mg protein/15 min0920 ± 6 (100)298 ± 11 (100)0.01909 ± 19 (99)306 ± 19 (103)0.1909 ± 28 (99)311 ± 19 (104)0.5240 ± 12 (26)110 ± 4 (37)156 ± 5 (6)58 ± 4 (20)556 ± 9 (6)70 ± 5 (24) Open table in a new tab Next, we examined whether the DEPC-induced inactivation of PEPT1 and PEPT2 was affected by the pH of the incubation medium. As shown in Fig. 2, glycylsarcosine uptake at both pH 6.0 (with a H+ gradient) and pH 7.4 (without a H+gradient) was blocked by pretreatment with DEPC in the LLC-rPEPT1 and LLC-rPEPT2 cells. The histidine residues might have been located with the PEPT1 substrate binding site, and therefore, we examined the effect of two cephalosporins on the DEPC inactivation of PEPT1. Fig. 3 A shows the effect of cephradine (aminocephalosporin) and ceftibuten (anionic cephalosporin without an α-amino group) concentration on the DEPC-induced inhibition of the glycylsarcosine uptake by the LLC-rPEPT1 cells. Rat PEPT1 has a much higher affinity to ceftibuten than to cephradine (13Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 1415-1421PubMed Google Scholar, 14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar). Cephradine prevented the DEPC-induced inhibition of glycylsarcosine uptake at 5–10 mm, but ceftibuten had no preventive effect even at 10 mm. Similar results were observed for the LLC-rPEPT2 cells (Fig. 3 B). To elucidate the effect of ceftibuten, we examined the effect of the charge of the substrates on the DEPC-induced inactivation of PEPT1. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the DEPC-induced inhibition of [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake by LLC-rPEPT1 cells was prevented by various charged substrates but not by ceftibuten. When the inhibitory effect of these compounds was examined, all the dipeptides, cephradine, and ceftibuten inhibited [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake (Fig. 4 B). These results suggested that the preventive effect of substrates was independent of either their ionic charges or affinity to the transporters. For the LLC-rPEPT2 cells, these substrates prevented the DEPC-induced inhibition of the glycylsarcosine uptake in a manner similar to that used for inhibiting LLC-rPEPT1 cells (data not shown). We investigated whether the preventive effects depended on the α-amino group of the substrates. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the substrates with an α-amino group such as glycylsarcosine, cephradine, and cefadroxil (aminocephalosporin) prevented the DEPC-induced inhibition of [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake by LLC-rPEPT1 cells. However, all peptide-like drugs without an α-amino group such as ceftibuten, cefixime, bestatin, and captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) had no effect at a concentration of 10 mm in the LLC-rPEPT1 cells. Cyclacillin did not have the preventive effect despite its having an α-amino group. Similar results were obtained in LLC-rPEPT2 cells except for cefadroxil (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of DEPC, the pretreatment of cefadroxil at 10 mmhad an inhibitory effect on glycylsarcosine uptake (data not shown). Therefore, cefadroxil at 10 mm might have a cis-inhibitory effect on the [14C]glycylsarcosine uptake, considering that cefadroxil had a higher affinity for PEPT2 with an apparent inhibition constant of 3 μm (14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, glycylsarcosine uptake by the PEPT1- and PEPT2-expressing transfectants was inhibited by pretreatment with DEPC in the absence and the presence of H+ gradient, which suggests that the histidine residue modified by DEPC at least served as the substrate binding site. This could be supported by the fact that the various dipeptides and aminocephalosporins prevented the DEPC-induced inactivation of PEPT1 and PEPT2. On the other hand, the peptide-like drugs without an α-amino group had no preventive effect, although they can be transported by the peptide transporter (5Tsuji A. Terasaki T. Tamai I. Hirooka H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 594-601PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muranushi N. Yoshikawa T. Yoshida M. Oguma T. Hirano K. Yamada H. Pharm. Res. 1989; 6: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Inui K. Tomita Y. Katsura T. Okano T. Takano M. Hori R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 482-486PubMed Google Scholar, 9Swaan P.W. Stehouwer M.C. Tukker J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the histidine residue located in the recognition site is involved in the binding site of the α-amino group of the dipeptides and aminocephalosporins. Because only the unprotonated imidazole ring reacts with DEPC (18Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), it is possible that the imidazole group of the histidine residue located at the recognition site is protonated by the α-amino group of the dipeptides and aminocephalosporins but not by the peptide-like drugs that do not have an α-amino group. The α-amino group of the substrates might interact with the imidazole ring of the histidine residue of peptide transporters by proton binding. It is noted that these results were observed for PEPT1 and PEPT2 in a similar manner, which suggests that the DEPC-sensitive histidine residue plays the same role in both transporters. Among the substrates examined that had an α-amino group, only cyclacillin did not show the preventive effect against the DEPC inactivation. This may be due to the structure of cyclacillin. Cyclacillin has an α-carbon group as part of its cyclohexane ring; therefore, the cyclohexane ring may interfere with the α-amino group-histidine interaction. Nevertheless, cyclacillin was recognized by PEPT1 at a relatively high affinity (14Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F706-F711PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ganapathy M.E. Brandsch M. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25672-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A possible explanation is that the hydrophobic NH2-terminal side chain of cyclacillin interacts with the peptide transporters instead of the α-amino group-histidine interaction. As reported by Daniel et al. (20Daniel H. Adibi S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the marked hydrophobicity of the NH2-terminal side chain of aminopenicillins increased the affinity to the renal H+/peptide cotransporter. For the peptide-like drugs without an α-amino group such as ceftibuten and cefixime, which are very hydrophilic, there might be interactions between these drugs and the binding site of the peptide transporter other than the α-amino group-histidine interaction. We have previously reported that histidines 57 and 121, which are located at the predicted transmembrane domains 2 and 4 of rat PEPT1, are involved in substrate binding and/or are responsible for the intrinsic activity of the transporter (12Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to our results, Fei et al. (21Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Prasad P.D. Kekuda R. Oblak T.G. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrated that histidine 57 of human PEPT1 was absolutely essential for the catalytic activity but histidine 121 of human PEPT1 did not appear to play an essential role for the catalytic activity. The reason for this discrepancy regarding the role of histidine 121 in the rat and human PEPT1 remains unknown. However, it is possible that at least two histidine residues are involved in the transport activity of PEPT1. Indeed, Steel et al. (22Steel A. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Boyd C.A.R. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) proposed that one histidine residue as a cation site was responsible for the proton coupling and that a second histidine residue was adjacent to the peptide binding site in the studies to determine differently charged dipeptide-H+ flux coupling ratios. Mackenzie et al. (23Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human PEPT1 bound H+ first and then the substrate as demonstrated by the biophysical and kinetic analysis of the human PEPT1. These findings suggest that two histidine residues are necessary, because the histidine residue with a protonated imidazole ring cannot bind the α-amino group of the substrates as shown by the present study. Although we cannot identify the histidine residue of the binding site from this study, either histidine 57 or 121 of PEPT1 might be the candidate residue for the binding site of the α-amino group of the substrates. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration that the α-amino group of the dipeptides and aminocephalosporins interacts with the DEPC-sensitive histidine residue of rat PEPT1 and PEPT2. The present findings represent the first step for understanding the substrate recognition mechanisms by peptide transporters."

However, glauconies have long been suspected of giving young potassium-argon ages on bulk samples. Laser-probe argon-argon dating shows that glaucony populations comprise grains with a wide range of ages, suggesting a period of genesis several times longer (∼5 million years) than previously thought. An estimate of the age of their enclosing sediments (and therefore of time scale boundaries) is given by the oldest nonrelict grains in the glaucony populations, whereas the formation times of the younger grains appear to be modulated by global sea level."

All 2[4Fe-4S]2+/+ferredoxins that have been studied to date, including C. vinosum ferredoxin, are reported to have extremely similar or identical reduction potentials for the two clusters.

Ferredoxins are small, generally acidic, electron transfer proteins that are found in all types of living systems (1Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). They contain iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters ligated to the polypeptide backbone primarily via cysteine residues. When the first ferredoxin was discovered in Clostridium pasteurianum, it was thought to be a general cellular electron carrier that could participate in several different metabolic processes (2Mortensen L.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 17: 115-138Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Today it is clear that a single organism may have numerous ferredoxins, each distinguished by sequence, [Fe-S] cluster type, and [Fe-S] cluster reduction potential (1Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Reyntjens B. Jollie D.R. Stephens P.J. Gao-Sheridan S. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Inorg.

The most common cluster type is the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster, and the first ferredoxins isolated were found to contain two such clusters in an ∼6,000 molecular weight polypeptide (1Matsubara H. Saeki K.

These “clostridial-type” ferredoxins, represented by the structurally characterized Peptococcus aerogenes ferredoxin, contain two Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro motifs for ligation of the two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters (6Adman E.T.

Rev. 1988; 4: 155-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two clusters have reduction potentials that are effectively identical and in the region of −0.4 V versusSHE. 1The abbreviations used are: SHE, standard hydrogen electrode; Fd, ferredoxin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Taps, 3-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]aminopropanesulfonic acid; SCE, saturated calomel reference electrode. 1The abbreviations used are: SHE, standard hydrogen electrode; Fd, ferredoxin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Taps, 3-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]aminopropanesulfonic acid; SCE, saturated calomel reference electrode. These proteins evolved further to produce other types of ferredoxins. Replacement of the central Cys in one of the two Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motifs by another residue or insertion of two residues between the second and third Cys resulted in formation of a [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster and a new class of ferredoxins, the so-called 7Fe ferredoxins, as represented by the structurally characterized FdI from Azotobacter vinelandii (9Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The two different cluster types in these proteins have two very different reduction potentials (10Iismaa S.E.

Another evolutionary modification of clostridial-type ferredoxins involved retention of the two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters but insertion of additional residues into one of the two Cys motifs to give a Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xa7–9-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro motif (1Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This class is represented by the structurally characterized 8Fe ferredoxin from Chromatium vinosum (11Moulis J.M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite the considerable difference in binding motifs for the two clusters, it has been reported that they have the same reduction potentials (12Stombaugh N.A. Sundquist J.E.

We have now discovered an 8Fe ferredoxin (FdIII) from A. vinelandii which contains two different binding motifs analogous to the Chromatium protein. As described in this paper, FdIII is the first example of any 8Fe ferredoxin having two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters with very different reduction potentials. The A. vinelandii strain used in this study is designated DJ138/pBS122. The parent strain DJ138 was described previously (15Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Iismaa S.E. Smartt C.T. Jacobson M.R. Dean D.R. J.

For the experiment to determine the effect of ammonia levels on the intracellular FdIII levels, a separate batch of cells was grown in the presence of excess ammonium acetate. Cells were harvested, cell-free extracts were prepared, and the first DEAE-cellulose column was run as for the purification of nitrogenase (18Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys.

FdIII eluted at 70% of the linear 0.1–0.5 m NaCl gradient as a well resolved brown peak exactly where the FdI peak was expected (16Vazquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B.K.

This fraction was then diluted with 2 volumes of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and loaded onto a 2.5 × 12-cm DEAE-cellulose column that was then washed slowly with 4 liters of 0.12m KCl in the same buffer. The greenish brown fraction containing FdIII was then eluted with 0.3 m KCl, and ammonium sulfate was added to 75% saturation. After centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet was resuspended in 0.025 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and the resulting solution was loaded onto a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephadex G-75 superfine gel filtration column. FdIII eluted as a well resolved greenish brown band. NH2-terminal protein sequencing was carried out after the protein was reduced and alkylated by β-mercaptoethanol and 4-vinylpyridine at the Biotechnology Resource Facility at the University of California, Irvine. For spectroscopic studies all samples were prepared anaerobically under argon in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box using fully degassed buffers. The protein was initially purified in the presence of dithionite. To prepare oxidized samples the dithionite was first removed by gel filtration, and then the samples were exposed to oxygen for at least 2 h. Circular dichroism (CD) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) samples of oxidized FdIII were then prepared by concentrating the protein and exchanging it into 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) using a Centricon-3 microconcentrator. The reduction of FdIII was carried out by mixing well degassed FdIII, 5′-deazariboflavin and EDTA (final concentrations 100 μm, 200 μm, and 20 mm, respectively) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and then illuminating for 1 min using white light from a slide projector. UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained with a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer, CD spectra were recorded using a JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter, and EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 300 Ez spectrophotometer. To determine iron content, samples were digested, and the analysis was carried out as described elsewhere (18Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using FeCl3·6H20 to generate a standard curve with FdI (9Stout C.D. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 2: 595-602Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as controls. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry was conducted at the Protein/Peptide Micro Analytical Facility, California Institute of Technology. Purified water (∼18 megohms·cm; Millipore) was used in all electrochemical experiments. The buffers Mes, Hepes, and Taps, and co-adsorbates neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate, were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents were purchased from Aldrich or British Drug House and were of at least analytical grade. Neomycin and polymyxin solutions were prepared as concentrated stocks (0.2 m and 15 mm (i.e. 20 mg/ml), respectively) and adjusted to pH 7.4. An AutoLab electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used to measure cyclic voltammograms. Controlled potential reductions were carried out using an Ursar Instruments potentiostat in conjunction with a Kipp and Zonen YT recorder. The all-glass cell and three-electrode system used for protein film voltammetry and the bulk solution voltammetry have been described previously (10Iismaa S.E. Vazquez A.E. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All potential values are given with reference to the SHE. The saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) was held at 22 °C at which we have adopted E(SCE) = +243 mVversus SHE. Reduction potentials were calculated as the average of the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, E°′ = 1/2(Epa + Epc). The sample compartment was maintained at 0 °C. The pyrolytic graphite edge electrode (surface area typically 0.18 cm2) was polished prior to each experiment with an aqueous alumina slurry (Buehler Micropolish: 0.3 μm for solution electrochemistry or 1.0 μm for protein film voltammetry) and then sonicated extensively to remove traces of Al2O3. Controlled potential electrolysis was carried out using a cell that featured a graphite pot constructed so that the internal walls project edge surface to the solution. The cell, which has been described previously (21Duff J.L.C. Breton J.L.J. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Thomson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8603Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was set up in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology, Poole, U. K.) with an inert atmosphere of N2(O2 < 2.0 ppm). For cyclic voltammetry, only the base was connected. For controlled potential electrolysis, all parts of the electrode were used, the solution being stirred by magnetic microflea. As a precaution to ensure homogeneity in electrochemical studies, samples of FdIII were prepurified using FPLC under an anaerobic atmosphere. Solutions were dialyzed into the required buffer solutions using an Amicon 8MC unit equipped with a microvolume assembly and a YM3 membrane. For protein film experiments, the ferredoxin solution (80–100 μm) used to coat the electrode contained 0.1m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, and polymyxin (200 μg/ml). The pH of this solution was adjusted to 7.0 at 0 °C. The buffer-electrolyte solution in the electrochemical cell consisted of 0.1 m NaCl, a 60 mm mixed buffer system (15 mm in each of acetate, Mes, Hepes and Taps), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mg/ml polymyxin, adjusted to the desired pH using HCl or NaOH at 0 °C. The freshly polished electrode surface was painted with about 1 μl of chilled protein solution from a fine capillary and then placed promptly into the cell solution. To stabilize protein films, the cell solution also contained 200 μg/ml polymyxin or 2 mm neomycin. The pH of this solution was checked after each set of experiments, with the pH electrode calibrated at 0 °C. For bulk solution voltammetry and controlled potential electrolysis, ferredoxin solutions contained 0.1 m NaCl with 60 mm mixed buffer. Small aliquots of neomycin stock solution were added (final concentration 2.0 mm) to promote a strong and persistent electrochemical response. When crude extracts from nitrogen-fixing cells of wild-type A. vinelandii are separated on DEAE-cellulose with a 0.1–0.5m NaCl gradient, three major brown peaks are observed (Fig. 1). The first two peaks correspond to the MoFe and Fe proteins of nitrogenase, respectively, and the third corresponds to FdI (16Vazquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The size of the third peak is proportional to and therefore an indicator of the FdI level present. In recent years we have constructed and purified many site-directed mutant variants of FdI (e.g. 9, 10, 17) some of which accumulate to much lower levels than the wild-type protein. We have observed a strong correlation between the size of the FdI peak on the first column (Fig. 1) and the amount of material present in the cell-free extracts which cross-reacts with polyclonal antibodies raised against denatured gel-purified native FdI (Fig. 2). We were therefore very surprised to find that cells expressing one particular variant, C16S FdI, which had only very low levels of FdI that cross-reacted to the antibody (Fig. 2), had a normal, wild-type FdI size peak on the first DEAE-cellulose column (Fig. 1).Figure 2Western blot analysis to compare the levels of FdI and FdIII in different A. vinelandii strains. wt is wild-type. FdI− contains the interruptedfdxA gene. C16S contains a plasmid expressing a FdI mutant variant C16S. Equal volumes of the FdI fractions from the DEAE-cellulose column were loaded in each lane. Upper panel, detected by the anti-FdIII antibodies; lower panel, detected by the anti-FdI antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further purification of the brown “FdI” fraction from the C16S preparation (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in a greenish brown protein solution that exhibited a single band on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3). This protein did not cross-react with antibodies raised against FdI, and for reasons described below the new protein was designated FdIII. Once purified FdIII was available, polyclonal antibodies were raised, and we reexamined cell-free extracts from wild-type, FdI−, and C16S strains of A. vinelandii using the FdIII antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the results show that the levels of FdIII are much greater in cells expressing the C16S variant of FdI than they are in either wild-type cells or in cells that make no FdI. The levels of FdIII in the C16S variant are also observed to be much higher than in all other FdI mutants tested to date based on Western analysis (data not shown). Thus FdIII specifically accumulates in response to expression of the C16S FdI variant. The reason for this is not currently understood. However, it should be noted that the [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster is implicated in a regulatory function carried out by FdI in A. vinelandii and that C16 is a ligand to this cluster (9Stout C.D. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14454-14458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purification yields of FdIII from cells expressing C16S FdI are typically 15 mg/1 kg, wet weight, of cells, compared with the approximately 8 mg of FdI usually obtained from 1 kg, wet weight, of wild-type cells (19Stephens P.J. Jensen G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To identify FdIII, the first 56 NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was obtained after modification of cysteine residues by 4-vinylpyridine (Fig. 4). Before this study 11 small [Fe-S] proteins had been identified in A. vinelandii, many by gene sequencing (3Reyntjens B. Jollie D.R. Stephens P.J. Gao-Sheridan S. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 595-602Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the sequence shown in Fig. 4 did not correspond to any of the known ferredoxin-like proteins from this organism. Data base searches, however, revealed that the first 56 amino acids of FdIII exhibit 77% identity and 88% similarity with the low potential 8Fe ferredoxin from C. vinosum. Fig. 4 compares the sequence obtained here with sequences from other ferredoxins in the C. vinosum class. In general, ferredoxins that contain 2[4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters can be divided into two classes. The clostridial-type ferredoxins have two Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro motifs, whereas the ferredoxins in the “chromatium” class shown in Fig. 4 have one motif of that type and one more unusual Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xa7–9-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro motif (1Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The ligand assignment shown in Fig. 4 is derived from the x-ray structure of C. vinosum ferredoxin (11Moulis J.M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All eight ligand cysteine residues lie within the available FdIII sequence and coincide in position with the [Fe-S] cluster ligand cysteines of C. vinosum ferredoxin, thereby eliminating the possibility that FdIII is a clostridial-type ferredoxin. Most of the ferredoxins shown in Fig. 4 contain nine Cys residues, one of which is not a cluster ligand. This ninth Cys is also conserved in FdIII and is in a position identical to that of the ninth Cys of C. vinosum ferredoxin. The FdIII sequencing data presented here appear to bring to four the number of ferredoxins from one organism, A. vinelandii, which have a chromatium-type sequence (3Reyntjens B. Jollie D.R. Stephens P.J. Gao-Sheridan S. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 595-602Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The other three were identified originally by gene sequencing, and all appear to be related somehow to nitrogen fixation based on their relationships to other genes. For example, fdxN is cotranscribed withnifB (25Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vnfFd is cotranscribed withvnfH (26Raina R. Bageshwar U.K. Das H.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 27Raina R. Reddy M.A. Ghosal D. Das H.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and fixFd is cotranscribed withfixABCX (28Wientjens, R., The Involvement of the fix ABCX Genes in the Respiratory Chain in the Electron Transport to Nitrogenase, Azotobacter vinelandii. Ph.D. thesis, 1993, 48, 72, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). Only FixFd has been purified to date (3Reyntjens B. Jollie D.R. Stephens P.J. Gao-Sheridan S. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 595-602Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because of the relationship of these other proteins to nitrogen fixation we tested whether or not FdIII was nif-regulated by growing the cells in the presence and absence of ammonia. There was no difference in the amounts of FdIII present under the two conditions as measured either by Western analysis or by the purification of the protein. Thus, like FdI (29Morgan T.V. Lundell P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FdIII is notnif-regulated. Although SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is often used to determine subunit molecular masses, we have found that it is not useful when studying small acidic [Fe-S] proteins. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which compares the migration of the denatured FdIII with the migration of molecular mass standards and two A. vinelandiiferredoxins of known molecular mass, FdI and FixFd. As shown in Fig. 3, FdI and FixFd migrate as if their molecular masses were 18,800 and 9,000 Da, respectively, whereas their actual polypeptide molecular masses are known to be 12,071 (29Morgan T.V. Lundell P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 7,758 (28Wientjens, R., The Involvement of the fix ABCX Genes in the Respiratory Chain in the Electron Transport to Nitrogenase, Azotobacter vinelandii. Ph.D. thesis, 1993, 48, 72, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). Therefore other methods were employed to determine the molecular mass. First, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry shows that the FdIII apoprotein has a mass of 9,220 ± 2 Da. Based on a composition of 2[4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters (see below) this method gives a molecular mass of 9,924 Da for the holoprotein. To obtain a second estimate and to compare the native protein with the denatured protein, an FPLC-Superdex 75 gel filtration method was used, with FdI and FixFd as standards in addition to the commercially available standards. Again the migration of FdI and FixFd deviated significantly from the standard curve derived from the other four non–iron-sulfur proteins. Using only FdI and FixFd as standards, the native molecular mass of FdIII by this method was calculated to be 10,600 ± 680 Da. Thus, like the other proteins in Fig. 4 and most ferredoxin-like proteins, FdIII is a monomer. Fig. 4 compares the molecular mass of FdIII with values reported for homologous chromatium-type ferredoxins. Clearly this class can be subdivided further into two groups, proteins with molecular masses of 6,000–7,000 Da and proteins with molecular masses of 9,000–10,000. The increase in molecular mass results from a COOH-terminal extension. Even when only the NH2-terminal sequences are considered, however, the four proteins having greatest sequence similarity to FdIII, including C. vinosum ferredoxin, also fall into the same molecular mass class (Fig. 4). The UV-visible absorption spectra of FdIII are shown in Fig. 5. The spectrum of air-oxidized FdIII contains a broad peak at 390 nm and a shoulder at 315 nm. The shape of this spectrum is indistinguishable from that obtained for air-oxidizedC. vinosum ferredoxin (30Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), FixFd (3Reyntjens B. Jollie D.R. Stephens P.J. Gao-Sheridan S. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 595-602Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and other proteins that contain two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters and is quite different from that obtained for the 7Fe FdI (10Iismaa S.E. Vazquez A.E. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21563-21571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrum shown in Fig. 5 has anA390:A280 ratio of 0.74, which is the same as reported for C. vinosum FdI and for other 8Fe ferredoxins. The iron content was confirmed by direct iron analysis using A. vinelandii 7Fe FdI and the 8Fe FixFd as controls. The results gave 7.7 ± 0.4 atoms of iron/molecule of FdIII, 7.7 ± 0.1 atoms of iron/molecule of FixFd, and 6.6 ± 0.4 atoms of iron/molecule of FdI. The visible-near UV CD spectrum of oxidized FdIII is shown in Fig. 6. It exhibits two major positive features in the visible region, one at 420 nm and the other at 580 nm. The wavelength dependence and form of the CD spectrum are typical of [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters and quite different from the spectra exhibited by [1Fe-0S], [2Fe-2S], and [4Fe-4S]3+/2+ clusters (30Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters do not exhibit EPR signals at low temperature (31Orme-Johnson W.H. Sands R.H. Lovenberg W. Iron Sulfur Proteins. II. Academic Press, New York1973: 195-238Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 a, oxidized FdIII is EPR-silent at liquid helium temperatures consistent with the presence of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters and showing that FdIII does not contain a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster, which would exhibit a very characteristic g = 2.01 EPR signal under the conditions used (32Stiefel E.I. George G.N. Bertini F. Gray H. Lippard S. Valentine J. Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 365-454Google Scholar). This further eliminates the possibility that FdIII is a 7Fe protein and also shows that unlike some 8Fe ferredoxins that lose iron to form 3Fe clusters upon exposure to air (5Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar), the 4Fe clusters of FdIII are extremely"
https://openalex.org/W2052350809,"Hsp70 is a multifunctional molecular chaperone whose interactions with protein substrates are regulated by ATP hydrolysis and ADP-ATP exchange. We show here that, in addition to ATPase activity, purified Hsp70 free from nucleoside-diphosphate (NDP) kinase exhibits intrinsic ADP-ATP exchange activity. The rate constants for ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis were in a similar range at the optimum pH of 7.5–8.5 in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm ADP. Hsp70 exhibited a considerably strict preference for ATP as a phosphate donor, and a biased substrate specificity, unlike NDP kinase; ADP, UDP, CDP > dTDP, dCDP > GDP, dGDP. During the reaction, Hsp70 formed an acid-labile autophosphorylated intermediate, and nucleoside diphosphate-dependent dephosphorylation of the latter then occurred. These properties of Hsp70 are not identical but similar to those of NDP kinase, but are not similar to those of adenylate kinase and ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2318274045,"The p16INK4a (α and β form) and p15INK4b genes were analysed for homozygous deletion, hypermethylation and point mutation in B6C3F1 mouse lymphomas induced by 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine or 1,3-butadiene. Although the p16INK4a-α gene appeared normal in DNA from 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine-induced lymphomas, Southern analyses revealed homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p16INK4aβ and/or p15INK4b genes in four of 16 tumours. Surprisingly, two of these lymphomas showed exclusive deletions of the p16INK4a EIβ exon. The p15INK4b promoter region was hypermethylated in two additional 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine-induced lymphomas. In contrast, homozygous deletions spanning the p16INK4a and p15INK4b loci were observed in only two of 31 1,3-butadiene-induced tumours. Thus, these cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes may play a significant role in chemically induced mouse lymphomas and support the contention of tumour suppressor activity for the p19ARF protein encoded by the p16INK4a-β gene. Different genetic pathways may be involved in the development of these chemically induced tumours since we have previously shown that mutations in p53 and ras genes are common in 1,3-butadiene- but not 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine-induced lymphomas."

Addition of MucB to SSB-coated ssDNA caused increased electrophoretic mobility of the nucleoprotein complex and increased staining of the DNA by ethidium bromide.

The most well-studied of these are the mucA and mucBgenes, encoding homologues of UmuD and UmuC, respectively (25Perry K.L. Walker G.C.

Employing this approach we present here in vivo and in vitro data that show, for the first time, that MucB interacts with SSB 1The abbreviations used are: SSB, single strand DNA binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: SSB, single strand DNA binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). and greatly changes the structure of the SSB·ssDNA complex.DISCUSSIONThe yeast two-hybrid system had proven useful in identifying interactions of the Muc proteins. It was previously shown that the UmuD′ and UmuD proteins form both homo- and heterodimers when assayed biochemically (35Woodgate R. Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7301-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Battista J.R. Ohta T. Nohmi T. Sun W. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the yeast two-hybrid system (45Jonczyk P. Nowicka A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that MucA′ and MucA behave similarly and exhibit both self-interactions and an interaction with each other. Each of these proteins was found to interact also with MucB. The C-terminal 30 amino acids of MucB were critical in mediating this interaction, since their deletion abolished the interaction of MucB with both MucA and MucA′. The C terminus of the UmuC protein had been previously reported to be essential for UV mutagenesis (46Woodgate R. Singh M. Kulaeva O.I. Frank E.G. Levine A.S. Koch W.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5011-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the homology between UmuC and MucB, our results suggest that the interaction between MucB and MucA′ is crucial for the activity of these proteins in UV mutagenesis, consistent with the current view that the active species in mutagenesis is a complex of MucA′ and MucB (or UmuD′ and UmuC) (reviewed in Ref.47Walker G.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 416-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that UmuC interacts with UmuD′, but not with UmuD, in the yeast two-hybrid system (45Jonczyk P. Nowicka A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2580-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our case, MucB was found to interact both with MucA and MucA′. At this stage it is not clear whether these differences are real or whether they reflect differences in the assay systems.The interaction between MucA and RecA as revealed in the two-hybrid system was expected based on the finding that RecA promotes the cleavage of MucA to MucA′ (37Shiba T. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Hauser J. Levine A.S. Ennis D.G. Chumakov K.M. Woodgate R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6844-6851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similarly to the cleavage of UmuD to UmuD′ (7Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Kato T. Nakata A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1806-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8Burckhardt S.E. Woodgate R. Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1988; 85: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Interactions between RecA and MucA′ or UmuD′ were proposed previously based on chemical cross-linking experiments (39Frank E.G. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Taken together with our in vivo results, it seems plausible that the MucA/A′-RecA interactions fulfill a role additional to mediating the cleavage of MucA, possibly the recruitment of MucA′ to DNA, as previously suggested (39Frank E.G. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We found no interaction between MucB and RecA. A related binding interaction was the retention of UmuC on activated RecA immobilized on a column, when an extract of E. coli cells was passed through the column (48Freitag N. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8363-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, in this reported case, since an extract (rather than purified proteins) was used, the possibility that a third protein had mediated the interaction between RecA and UmuC hasn't been ruled out.SSB, reported here to interact with MucB, is an essential protein, which is involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (49Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 50Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1991Google Scholar, 51Meyer R.R. Laine P.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a homotetramer that binds ssDNA specifically and in a cooperative manner. Each SSB monomer contains a DNA-binding site interacting with 16 nucleotides. The extent of DNA bound by SSB strongly depends on salt and Mg2+ concentrations. With the increase in their concentration, the number of subunits that interact with DNA increases from 2 (SSB35 mode) to 4 (SSB65 mode). Electron microscopic analysis revealed that at low SSB to DNA ratio, a beaded structure is observed, with the DNA wrapped around beads of single or double tetramers of SSB, leading to a reduction in the contour length of DNA. This binding is of limited cooperativity and represents most likely the SSB65 mode. At higher SSB to DNA ratios, the binding to DNA is cooperative leading to the formation of a smooth SSB-DNA filament, where SSB is presumably in the 35 mode (reviewed in Refs. 44Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar, 50Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1991Google Scholar, and 52Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that the interaction with MucB affects the cooperative mode of SSB binding (presumably the 35-mode), which is the initial binding state of the SSB under our conditions. The exact nature of the MucB-SSB interaction is not clear yet, but it causes a major change in the SSB·ssDNA complex, without causing massive release of the SSB from DNA. This is evident from the increase in the mobility of the nucleoprotein complex and its increased staining with ethidium bromide. The quantitation of radiolabeled SSB is accurate within 10–15%. Thus, while not causing a massive displacement from DNA, it is possible that MucB does replace some SSB molecules. This, however, must have a major effect on the conformation of the DNA, as evident from its increased mobility. Several attempts to examine whether the nucleoprotein complex contains the MucB protein, using anti-MucB antibodies, were unsuccessful. At this point it is not clear whether this is a technical problem or whether MucB is released after rearranging the SSB·ssDNA complex. The increased staining can be explained by at least the following two mechanisms: 1) an increase in the accessibility of the DNA bases to ethidium bromide and 2) a change in the stacking of the DNA bases, which enables better intercalation of the dye. Noteworthy, although MucB bound a ssDNA 40 nucleotides long, we found no effect of MucB alone, or in combination with MucA or MucA′, on the migration of naked M13mp8 ssDNA in agarose gel electrophoresis. The reasons for this result are not clear yet.What are the consequences of the changes in the structure of the nucleoprotein complex caused by MucB? It is possible that such changes allow easier bypass of DNA lesions by a DNA polymerase or else they provide binding sites for other proteins required for the bypass reaction. A natural candidate for being involved in this reaction is the RecA protein. It has been shown to compete with SSB for binding to ssDNA and under certain conditions can form a ternary SSB·RecA·ssDNA complex (reviewed in Refs. 53Roca A.I. Cox M.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar and 54Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MucB interacted with SSB but not with RecA (Table IV). On the other hand, MucA′ did interact with RecA. This may mean that a MucA′B complex interacts with both RecA and SSB. The interactions of MucB with SSB and with MucA′ must occur via different regions of the protein. The C terminus of MucB is involved in the interaction with MucA/A′, whereas an additional domain is involved in the interaction with SSB. Thus, a putative 4-protein RecA-MucA′-MucB-SSB complex can be imagined, in which RecA is bound to MucA′B via MucA′, and SSB is bound via MucB. So far there is no evidence for such a complex. An alternative possibility is that the various interactions appear transiently during the mutagenic bypass reaction.One of the paradoxes in the field of SOS mutagenesis is that in vivo bypass of DNA lesions requires the UmuD′ and UmuC proteins (or their homologues) (reviewed in Ref. 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), whereas in vitrobypass of blocking lesions (2Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O.

The report onumuC-independent UV mutagenesis in phage S13 (55Tessman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6614-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the finding that umuC-independent UV mutagenesis is observed when a screening rather than selection procedure is used (56Christensen J.R. LeClerc J.E. Valone Tata P. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) support the view that UmuD′C stimulates the mutagenic reaction, rather than being absolutely required. An obvious difference between the in vivo and in vitro situations is that in the former there exist many more proteins that may affect bypass. One such family includes DNA damage binding proteins, which usually function in error-free DNA repair (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). We have recently shown that DNA damage binding proteins regulate induced mutagenesis via a mechanism that does not involve the removal of DNA damage. We found that DNA damage binding proteins directly inhibit trans-lesion replication by binding to lesions present on ssDNA (57Paz-Elizur T. Barak Y. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28906-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The current study points toward SSB as another candidate that might affect SOS mutagenesis. in vivostudies have shown that E. coli strains carrying the ssb1 mutation, encoding a temperature-sensitive SSB, had reduced UV mutagenesis at the non-permissive temperature (58Lieberman H.B. Witkin E.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 183: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 59Lieberman H.B. Witkin E.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, this was attributed to the inability of the mutant to fully induce the SOS response. Of course, this analysis does not rule out the possibility of a direct involvement of SSB in the mutagenic reaction. We have previously reported that SSB facilitates unassisted bypass of UV lesions by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (29Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9526-9533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the MucB·SSB complex increases bypass, especially when additional proteins are present. The exact mechanism of the involvement of SSB in SOS UV mutagenesis needs further biochemical and in vivo investigations. UV mutagenesis in Escherichia coli is a regulated process, controlled by the SOS stress response through its two global regulators, RecA and LexA. The mechanism underlying this process is trans-lesion replication by a DNA polymerase, most likely DNA polymerase III (for reviews see Refs. 1Walker G.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

C.1995Google Scholar). This process requires specifically two SOS-induced proteins, UmuD and UmuC (4Kato T. Shinoura Y. Mol. Gen.

Hauser J. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8169-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Taken together with our in vivo results, it seems plausible that the MucA/A′-RecA interactions fulfill a role additional to mediating the cleavage of MucA, possibly the recruitment of MucA′ to DNA, as previously suggested (39Frank E.G.

Although the mechanism of activation of PDE by transducin is well understood, the role of the noncatalytic cGMP binding sites located on the catalytic subunits of PDE remains obscure. We report here for the first time the molecular basis of the noncovalent interactions between cGMP and the high affinity, noncatalytic cGMP binding sites of frog photoreceptor PDE.None of the tested cGMP analogs were able to bind with greater affinity than cGMP itself, and the noncatalytic sites were unable to bind cAMP. The major determinant for discrimination of cGMP over cAMP is in the N-1/C-6 region of the purine ring of cGMP where hydrogen bonding probably stabilizes the selective binding of cGMP. Substitutions at the C-2 position demonstrate that this region of the molecule plays a secondary but significant role in stabilizing cGMP binding to PDE through hydrogen bond interactions. The unaltered hydrogen at the C-8 position is also important for high affinity binding. A significant interaction between the binding pocket and the ribose ring of cGMP occurs at the 2′-hydroxyl position. Steric constraints were greatest in the C-8 and possibly the C-6/N-1 regions, whereas the C-2/N-3 and C-2′ regions tolerated bulky substituents better. Several lines of evidence indicate that the noncatalytic site binds cGMP in the anti-conformation. The numerous noncovalent interactions between cGMP and the noncatalytic binding pocket of the photoreceptor PDE described in this study account for both the high affinity for cGMP and the high level of discrimination of cGMP from other cyclic nucleotides at the noncatalytic site.

Visual excitation of vertebrate retinal photoreceptors begins with the absorption of light by the visual pigment (opsin) which is followed by activation of a G-protein, transducin. This results in activation of a photoreceptor-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; ROS, rod outer segments; (Rp)-cGMPS, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp isomer); (Sp)-cGMPS, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Sp isomer); cPUMP, purine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; TEAF, triethylammonium formate; PDE2, cGMP-stimulated PDE; PDE5, cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific PDE; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. Increased cGMP hydrolysis lowers the cytoplasmic cGMP concentration which is believed to cause closure of the cGMP-gated ion channel in the plasma membrane and the generation of an electrical response (for reviews, see Refs.1Pfister C.

The rod photoreceptor PDE holoenzyme is a heterotetramer consisting of two non-identical catalytic subunits (α and β) and two small subunits (γ) that serve to inhibit catalytic activity. Cone photoreceptors have a highly homologous PDE that consists of two identical catalytic subunits (α′) and two cone-specific γ′ subunits. In addition to containing the active site for cGMP hydrolysis, the catalytic subunits of rod and cone PDEs also possess noncatalytic cGMP binding sites (6Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnellie J.E. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other classes of PDEs, namely the cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2) and the cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5), are also known to contain noncatalytic binding sites for cGMP. In the case of PDE2, binding of cGMP at the noncatalytic site allosterically activates cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis at the active site (7Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12526-12533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For PDE5, the noncatalytic cGMP binding site has been proposed to indirectly regulate catalytic activity of the enzyme via protein phosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 9Francis S.H. Thomas M.K. Corbin J.D. Beavo J. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases: Structure, Regulation and Drug Action. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 117-140Google Scholar). The function of the noncatalytic cGMP binding sites on the photoreceptor PDE (classified as PDE6) is currently not well understood. Recent evidence has supported the idea that binding of cGMP to noncatalytic sites on amphibian rod PDE enhances the affinity of the inhibitory γ subunits for binding to the catalytic subunits (10Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, displacement or removal of the γ subunits from PDE by G-protein activation causes a marked decrease in the binding affinity of cGMP with these binding sites (11Cote R.H.

These results suggest that the noncatalytic cGMP binding sites may be the locus for an additional type of regulation of PDE during visual transduction. To better understand the functional significance of these noncatalytic binding sites, we have examined the structural requirements for the binding of cGMP to the binding pocket of the noncatalytic sites on rod PDE. We have employed a series of derivatives of cGMP modified in particular positions of the cGMP molecule to identify the types of interactions that stabilize the high affinity binding of cGMP to noncatalytic sites on PDE. Cyclic nucleotide analogs have been successfully employed to define the topology of the nucleotide binding site in several proteins, including the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (13Jastorff B.

Our results with the noncatalytic cGMP binding site of frog rod PDE demonstrate that the high affinity binding of cGMP is a consequence of multiple sites of interaction between the cGMP molecule and the binding pocket of the enzyme. In particular, the C-6, N-1, C-2, and C-8 positions of the purine ring, the cyclic phosphate moiety, and the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring all contribute to stabilizing specific binding to cGMP. Furthermore, the noncatalytic site of the rod PDE shows the greatest ability to discriminate cGMP from cAMP and the highest binding affinity of any cyclic nucleotide binding protein studied to date.

In brief,O 6-benzyl-guanosine was prepared by reacting 2-NH2-6-Cl-purine riboside (1.7 g, 5.63 mmol) with sodium benzoxide (6.21 mmol) in 20 ml of dry benzyl alcohol. The alkylating reagent was generated by pretreatment of the alcohol with NaH (149 mg, 6.2 mmol) at 0–25 °C for 2 h. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 h and then evaporated to dryness. The residue was resuspended in 200 ml of water, neutralized with 1 nHCl, and the volume reduced to approximately 100 ml by evaporation. Upon cooling, a white precipitate of crude product was filtered off, washed twice with 20 ml of cold water, and dried to give analytically pure O 6-benzyl-guanosine (1.971 g, 5.24 mmol, 93%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6), δ 3.53 (dd, 1H, J = 3.5, 12.0 Hz, H5′b), 3.63 (dd, 1H, J = 3.5, 12.0 Hz, H5′a), 3.89 (ddd, 1H, J = 3.5, 3.5, 3.5 Hz, H4′), 4.10 (dd, 1H, J = 3.5, 5.5 Hz, H3′), 4.46 (dd 1H, J = 5.5, 6.0 Hz, H2′), 5.50 (d, 2H, J = 1.0 Hz, —CH2—), 6.28 (d, 1H, J = 6.0 Hz, H1′), 6.50 (broad s, 2H, −NH2), 7.30–7.55 (m, 5H, phenyl ring), 8.10 (s, 1H, H8); FAB-MS (glycerol), positive mode:m/z 374 (M + H)+, 242 (B + H)+, negative mode: m/z 372 (M − H)−, 240 (B − H)−, 745 (M2 − H)−, UV (pH 7.0), λmax = 282 nm (ε = 10,700). O 6-Benzyl-guanosine (655 mg, 1.76 mmol) was phosphorylated in the 5′-position and cyclized to the 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate essentially as described (26Genieser H.-G. Butt E. Bottin U. Dostmann W. Jastorff B. Synthesis. 1989; 1: 53-54Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC with 45% methanol, 55% water, 40 mm triethylammonium formate (TEAF) (pH 6.5); the stationary phase was a 250 × 25 mm LiChrosorb RP 18 (either 7- or 10-μm particle size; Merck). Fractions containing the product were pooled and freeze-dried eight times to remove residual TEAF. The resulting white foam was neutralized with 0.1 n NaOH and dried to obtain 556.6 μmol (32%) of compound 3 as the sodium salt. The purity was higher than 99.3% as verified by analytical HPLC and no cGMP was detectable. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6), δ 3.86–4.10 (m, 3H, H4′, H5′a, H5′b), 4.40–4.46 (m, 2H, H2′, H3′), 5.49 (s, 2H, —CH2—), 5.78 (s, 1H, H1′), 5.79 (d, 1H, J = 4.0 Hz, 2′-OH), 6.58 (broad s, 2H, —NH2), 7.31–7.52 (m, 5H, phenyl ring), 7.96 (s, 1H, H8); 31P NMR (Me2SO-d6), δ −2.58 ppm, FAB-MS (glycerol), positive mode: m/z 436 (M + H)+, negative mode: m/z 434 (M − H)−, UV (pH 7.0), λmax = 281 nm (ε = 10,700).

In brief, O 6-benzyl-cGMP (3) (137.1 mg, 300 μmol) was mixed with sodium acetate, bromoacetaldehyde, and ethanol and stirred in darkness at 37 °C for 7 days. Analytical HPLC indicated 95% conversion of the starting material and a major product signal (70%) of a compound with enhanced hydrophobicity. Evaporation of all volatile components under vacuum gave a yellow residue, which was purified using preparative HPLC (solvent: 30% methanol, 70% water, 40 mm TEAF (pH 7.0)). The sample was freeze-dried three times and neutralized with 0.1n NaOH to yield 116 μmol (37%) analytically pureN 2,3-etheno-O 6-benzyl-GMP (6) (>98.5% purity). 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6), δ 4.08–4.17 (m, 3H, H4′, H5′a, H5′b), 4.24 (m, 1H, H3′), 4.62 (dd, 1H, J = 4.0, 4.5 Hz, H2′), 5.58 (s, 2H, —CH2—), 6.24 (d, 1H,J = 4.0 Hz, 2′-OH), 6.35 (s, 1H, H1′), 7.51 (s, 1H, H6), 7.34–7.56 (m, 5H, phenyl ring), 7.94 (s, 1H, H5), 8.23 (s, 1H, H2);31P NMR (Me2SO-d6), δ −2.80 ppm, FAB-MS (nitrobenzyl alcohol), positive mode: m/z460 (M + H)+, negative mode: m/z 458 (M − H)−, UV (pH 7.0), λmax = 226 nm (ε = 32,900), 266 nm (ε = 6800). Compound 6 (80 μmol) was added to 10 ml of 70% methanol (in water) in the presence of 10% palladium on charcoal (50 mg); the sample was completely hydrogenated after 40 min at room temperature, as observed by analytical HPLC. The catalyst was filtered off, extracted 3 times with 70% methanol, and then extracted 3 times with toluene/methanol/water (5:5:1, v/v/v). The solvents were evaporated under vacuum at 20 °C and purified by preparative HPLC (solvent: 15% methanol, 85% water, 20 mm TEAF (pH 7.0)) to yield 52 μmol of 10 (97% purity). A purity higher than 99.3% with no detectable cGMP contamination was obtained after two additional chromatographic separations under identical conditions. Freeze-drying and neutralization with 0.01 n NaOH gave 27.5 μmol (34%) product. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6), δ 4.06–4.17 (m, 3H, H4′, H5′a, H5′b), 4.21 (m, 1H, H3′), 4.57 (dd, 1H, J = 4.0, 4.0 Hz, H2′), 6.19 (s, 1H, H1′), 6.22 (d, 1H, J= 4.0 Hz, 2′-OH), 7.14 (d, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, H6), 7.62 (d, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, H5), 8.06 (s, 1H, H2); 31P NMR (D2O/CD3OD, 1/1), δ − 1.30 ppm, FAB-MS (nitrobenzyl alcohol) positive mode: m/z 370 (M + H)+, negative mode: m/z 368 (M − H)−, UV (pH 7.0), λmax = 225 nm (ε = 29,700), 258 nm (ε = 10,700). 1H and 31P NMR, as well as FAB-MS analyses, were used to confirm the structure of each cGMP analog. 1H and 31P NMR spectra (internal standard Me4Si and external H3PO485%, respectively) were recorded with a Bruker WH-360 spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained with a Finnigan MAT spectrometer (model 8222) in the FAB mode and glycerol or nitrobenzyl alcohol as matrix. UV spectra were recorded with a Milton Roy Spectronic 1204 photometer in aqueous buffer at pH 7.0. Rod outer segments (ROS) from bullfrog (Rana catesbiana) retinas were purified on a Percoll gradient in total darkness as described previously (33Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ROS were isolated from frog retinas by gentle shaking and purified on a discontinuous gradient containing 60, 30, and 5% Percoll in a Ringer's solution consisting of (in mm): 105 NaCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 2.0 KCl, 1.0 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH of 7.5. Purified ROS were washed once in Ringer's to remove Percoll and resuspended in Buffer A, containing (in mm): 77 KCl, 35 NaCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 1.0 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 1.2 EGTA (pCa 300 nm), pH 7.5; the ionic composition of Buffer A partially mimicked that of frog ROS cytosol. The ROS suspension was homogenized 12 times with a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder to completely disrupt cellular morphology. Endogenous cGMP initially bound to PDE would interfere with the cGMP binding assay; this problem was avoided by incubating homogenized ROS suspensions at room temperature for 30 min, during which time >95% of the bound cGMP dissociated from PDE and was hydrolyzed by the PDE activity in the homogenate (33Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ROS extract was stored in the dark at 4 °C until use. Binding of cGMP to photoreceptor PDE was determined without further purification of the protein, since it has been previously demonstrated that PDE is the only high affinity cGMP binding protein in frog ROS extracts (33Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of PDE holoenzyme was determined by measuring the rhodopsin concentration by difference spectrophotometry (34Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and knowledge of the molar ratio of PDE to rhodopsin (0.003 mol of PDE holoenzyme per mol of rhodopsin). The subunit stoichiometry of the PDE holoenzyme in our frog ROS homogenates is assumed to be αβγ2 based on the following considerations. 1) When saturating levels of [3H]cGMP (1 μm) were used in binding assays as controls, we routinely observed 1.8–2.1 mol of cGMP bound per mol of PDE holoenzyme, in agreement with our previous measurements of the binding site density of frog PDE (11Cote R.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PDE which lacks Pγ subunits cannot bind cGMP at detectable levels (11Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl.

This too indicates that >97% of the PDE catalytic subunits is associated with Pγ. The PDE catalytic site inhibitor, zaprinast, was added 5 min prior to addition of cyclic nucleotides to prevent cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis; direct measurements confirm that <10% hydrolysis of cGMP had occurred at the time when samples were filtered. Zaprinast had little effect on the ability of cGMP to bind to the noncatalytic sites. In contrast to the ability of catalytic site inhibitors to stimulate cGMP binding to noncatalytic sites on PDE2 (23Miot F. Van Haastert P.J.M. Erneux C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), PDE5 (35Francis S.H. Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781PubMed Google Scholar), zaprinast shows no ability to stimulate cGMP binding to frog photoreceptor PDE. 3M. R. D'Amours and R. H. Cote, manuscript in preparation. We find rather that 1 mm zaprinast causes a <15% decrease in cGMP binding to the noncatalytic sites of PDE when assayed under the exact conditions of our displacement experiments. The extent of equilibrium binding of [3H]cGMP in the presence of varying levels of cyclic nucleotide analogs was determined with a modification of a previously used filter binding assay (33Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Portions of homogenized ROS (4 μm rhodopsin, 12 nm PDE holoenzyme) were mixed with 60 nm [3H]cGMP (6.64 × 1016 dpm/mol; prepared in Buffer A) which had been premixed with the indicated concentration of a cyclic nucleotide analog. This concentration of [3H]cGMP was chosen such that ∼50% of the high affinity noncatalytic sites on PDE would be occupied in the absence of competing nucleotides. Within 5 min after the addition of 60 nm [3H]cGMP, ∼90% of the maximum extent of binding was observed; no change in the extent of binding was observed between 10 and 60 min of incubation. The approach to equilibrium was not delayed when the competing nucleotide analog was added at the same time as cGMP. After incubation at 24 °C for 15 min, samples were applied to a 96-well Multiscreen filter plate prewet with Buffer A, and the filters were rinsed with 300 μl of the same solution. The filters were punched out directly into scintillation vials, mixed with 100 μl of water, vortexed, and then mixed with 3 ml of scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. To determine the extent of nonspecific entrapment of [3H]cGMP by the filters, ROS were mixed with [3H]cGMP containing 1 mm nonradioactive cGMP and treated as above. Less than 1% of the radioactivity was nonspecifically retained in the presence of ROS membranes; similar levels of nonspecific binding were observed when [3H]cGMP alone was passed through the filter and rinsed. Data analysis of the nucleotide displacement curves was performed assuming a single class of noninteracting sites to which cGMP and the nucleotide analogs both bound in a competitive fashion. The data analysis programs Sigmaplot and RADLIG (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) each provided similar values for the binding parameters. The Ki value was calculated from the IC50 value obtained from the displacement curve using the equation (38Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar), Ki = IC50(1 + KD/[cGMP]), where the dissociation constant, KD, for cGMP binding to PDE is 60 nm (11Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ki values presented in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV, Table V represent the mean ± S.D. for three or four independent experiments for each analog. For all pairwise comparisons of cGMP analogs discussed in the text, the Ki values were determined to be statistically significant at the p < 0.005 level of significance using a paired t test. We chose a set of chemically modified cGMP analogs (Fig. 1) to probe in detail the structural requirements for cGMP binding to the noncatalytic cGMP binding sites of frog rod PDE. Since the rod PDE consists of two non-identical α and β catalytic subunits, we first addressed the question of whether we could distinguish two distinct noncatalytic binding sites in our experiments. Previous equilibrium binding data at sub-micromolar cGMP concentrations have provided no evidence for two distinct classes of high affinity sites in nonactivated PDE (11Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Cote R.H. Brunnock M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the determination of the Ki for cIMP was carried out at several different [3H]cGMP concentrations that resulted in 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, or >1.8 mol cGMP bound per mol of PDE holoenzyme in the absence of the cGMP analog; no significant difference was found in the Ki value as a function of the extent of occupancy by cGMP. 4S. Thapar and R. H. Cote, unpublished observations. Furthermore, in those instances where the [3H]cGMP concentration was high enough to saturate all high affinity sites on PDE, addition of cGMP analogs never displayed complex displacement behavior. These observations support the notion that the two noncatalytic binding sites on non-activated PDE holoenzyme cannot be distinguished by the equilibrium binding measurements performed in this study. In addition, binding of [3H]cGMP to the catalytic sites of PDE can been ruled out for two reasons as follows: 1) the low concentration of [3H]cGMP used was 1000-fold lower than the KM of the enzyme, and 2) the inclusion of 1 mm zaprinast (a competitive inhibitor of cGMP hydrolysis) effectively blocked [3H]cGMP binding and catalysis at the active site of PDE. We first tested the ability of cGMP analogs with alterations in the C-6 and/or the N-1 positions of the cGMP molecule (Fig. 1 B) to bind to the noncatalytic sites of photoreceptor PDE, since these atoms differ between cGMP and cAMP. Purified frog ROS extracts were incubated with 60 nm [3H]cGMP and various concentrations of a cGMP analog. After the binding reaction had reached equilibrium, the extent to which [3H]cGMP was displaced by the analog was quantitated by a filter binding assay. Fig. 2 shows typical results for several analogs substituted at the N-1 or the C-6 positions of the purine ring; displacement of [3H]cGMP by nonradioactive cGMP is also included for comparison. We found that 6-mercapto-cGMP (1) was able to bind to the noncatalytic sites nearly as well as cGMP itself, as judged by its ability to prevent [3H]cGMP binding at low concentrations (Table I). This suggests that the electronegativity of the oxygen attached to position 6 in cGMP stabilizes binding to the binding pocket of PDE and demonstrates that the mercapto group retains the ability to interact with the binding pocket. Although compound 1 can potentially exist in both a keto and enol tautomeric form (Fig. 1 B, inset), existing evidence suggests that thio-substituted nucleosides exist almost exclusively in the keto (thio-oxo) form (39Jeffrey G.A. Saenger W. Hydrogen Bonding in Biological Structures. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1991Crossref Google Scholar).Table ISubstitutions in the N-1/C-6 region of cGMPNo.1-aCompound"

The apbA gene was the first genetic locus found to be required for function of the APB pathway (3Downs D.M. Petersen L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4858-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the apbA sequence identified a putative NAD/FAD binding site suggesting ApbA was an oxidoreductase enzyme. Recent efforts to define the in vivo function for ApbA were led by the observation that pantothenate, as well as thiamine, could correct the nutritional requirement of an apbAmutant. 2M. Frodyma and D. M. Downs, submitted for publication. Further experiments indicated that under conditions where apbA mutants required thiamine, the pantoic acid moiety of pantothenate was sufficient to restore growth.2 Because of the putative oxidoreductase activity of ApbA, we focused on the step in pantoic acid synthesis that involved the reduction of ketopantoic acid (KPA) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (ilvC), an enzyme required for branched chain amino acid biosynthesis, has been shown to catalyze this reduction in crude cell-free extracts (5Primerano D.A. Burns R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 259-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residual KPA reductase activity measured in an ilvC mutant was attributed to the KPA reductase encoded by the panE gene (5Primerano D.A. Burns R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 259-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic data presented elsewhere shows that contrary to earlier mapping data,apbA is the locus previously designatedpanE.2 The symbol of apbA has been retained to reflect the involvement of this enzyme in thiamine biosynthesis. KPA reductase activities have been identified and characterized to different extents in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas maltophilia 845 (6King Jr., H.L. Dyar R.E. Wilken D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4689-4695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shimizu S. Kataoka M. Chung M.C. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12077-12084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This work describes the completed purification of the KPA reductase from S. typhimurium encoded by the apbAgene. KPA reductase has a well described role in pantothenate biosynthesis in S. typhimurium and E. coli. However, the previously described phenotypes of an apbAmutant (3Downs D.M. Petersen L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4858-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that there is also a role for ApbA in thiamine synthesis via the APB pathway. Culture media supplies were obtained from Difco, and growth of bacterial cultures was monitored using a Manostat Klett colorimeter with a red filter (Manostat Corp., NY). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was obtained from Fisher. Ketoisovalerate, NADPH, NADH, and ammonium sulfate were obtained from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI), and Bakerbond Wide Pore Hi-propyl (C3) resin was obtained from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from Promega (Madison, WI), oligonucleotides were from Genosys Inc. (The Woodlands, TX), and Pfu recombinant DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid vector pET-14b was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Ketopantoyl lactone was prepared as described (8Lipton S.H. Strong F.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 2364-2367Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and stock solutions were stored in 15 mm HCl due to the instability of this compound at pH >2. KPA was prepared as described elsewhere (6King Jr., H.L. Dyar R.E. Wilken D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4689-4695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21/λDE3 was obtained from Novagen, Inc. Plasmids pT7–5 and pT7–6 and methods for overexpressing proteins with this system have been described (9Tabor S. Ausubel P.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.C. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 16.2.1-16.2.11Google Scholar). Plasmid pT7-apbAwas constructed by cloning a BamHI-HinDIII fragment containing the promotorless apbA coding sequence into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pT7–5 (3Downs D.M. Petersen L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4858-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construction was confirmed by sequence analysis, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into the overexpression strain BL21/λDE3, which carried in its genome the gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. A construct containing an N-terminal His6-ApbA fusion protein was generated by engineering an NdeI restriction site immediately 5′ of the translation initiation codon of apbA followed by ligation of the necessary fragment into an appropriate vector as described by the manufacturer. The resulting construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. In a standard overexpression experiment, 4 liters of BL21/λDE3 cells containing pT7-apbA were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C to an OD650 of 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce expression of the T7 RNA polymerase. After 3 h of growth, cells were centrifuged, yielding a cell pellet of approximately 15 g, which was resuspended in 60 ml of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Cell-free extracts were generated by sonicating cells on ice for four 30-s bursts at 50% duty cycle with a Fisher Model 550 Sonic Dismembrator. Cell-free extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge. A Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) or Micro BCA Protein assay reagent kit was used to quantitate protein. Ultrapure bovine serum albumin was used to generate a standard curve. Standard buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) was used unless otherwise specified. After induction, His6-ApbA was purified to >95% homogeneity using an Ni2+-affinity column developed under denaturing conditions in the presence of 6 m guanidine HCl. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against His6-ApbA were generated at the animal care unit of the University of Wisconsin Medical School. Antisera was prepared and titered according to Harlow and Lane (10Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and protein bands were visualized after staining with either (a) 40:55:5:0.05 ethanol:water:acetic acid:Coomassie R250 and destained in 40:55:5: ethanol:water:acetic acid; or (b) 1 × SYPRO Red in 7.5% acetic acid. Gels stained in SYPRO Red were visualized on a standard Fisher 312 nm transilluminator. Percent of total protein was estimated by densitometric scans using a GS300 Transmittance/Reflectance Scanning Densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). SDS-PAGE was performed as described above. Western analysis was performed as described by Harlow and Lane (10Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) was used to detect anti-ApbA bound to the membrane support, as described (10Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Electroblotting of SDS-PAGE gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce) was done as follows. A 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel containing samples of purified ApbA was soaked in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 10% MeOH for 20 min, and loaded into a Bio-Rad Mini Trans Blot cell. Transfer was run at 4 °C at 100 V (40 mA) for 1 h. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Shared Facility of MCW Research Services, Medical College of Wisconsin. The molecular mass of native ApbA was determined by HPLC gel filtration using a BioSep-SEC-S2000 column (300 × 7.8 mm) (Phenomenex; Torrence, CA). The column was equilibrated and run in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Flow rate was set at 1.0 ml/min on a Waters 600 HPLC system (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA). Protein elution from the column was monitored at 280 nm by a Waters 996 Photodiode Array detector. Standard molecular weights were calculated using Bio-Rad gel filtration standards (670-kDa thyroglobulin; 158-kDa bovine gamma globulin; 44-kDa chicken ovalbumin; 17-kDa equine myoglobin). To test biological activity of reaction components, dried paper chromatograms on which reaction mixtures had been run as described below were cut into 1-cm cross-sections and placed individually in microcentrifuge tubes with 100 μl of double-distilled water (ddH2O). After incubating for 30 min, the paper was removed, placed in a cellulose acetate filter insert (Costar, Cambridge, MA), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 60 s in a Marathon 13K/M (Fisher, Itasca, IL). Eluant was dried to completion in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 10 μl of ddH2O. Fractions were assayed for biological activity on minimal gluconate plates overlaid with soft agar (0.7% w/v) in which cells of strain DM377 (panB) were suspended. A positive control was afforded by commercial pantoyl-lactone. KPA reductase activity during ApbA purification was assayed as described (6King Jr., H.L. Dyar R.E. Wilken D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4689-4695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained KPA (2.5 μmol), potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (200 μmol), and enzyme (≤ 0.05 nmol) in a total volume of 2.0 ml. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 42 °C for 2 min prior to addition of NADPH (0.5 μmol) to initiate the reaction. Future experiments with homogenous protein employed 3.1 μmol of KPA and 3.1 μmol of NADPH in a total volume of 1 ml. A typical assay was followed for 2 min, with the initial rate determined within 30 s. The oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of protein required to oxidize 1 μmol of NADPH/min, specific activity was defined as units per mg of protein. Hi-propyl resin was equilibrated with 200 ml of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with 20% saturation (NH4)2SO4 (at 4 °C) in a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. C16/70 column (15 × 1.6 cm). (NH4)2SO4 was added to the clarified extract until 20% saturation was reached, after which the resulting extract was loaded onto the column material. A 200-ml reverse linear gradient of 20 to 0% (NH4)2SO4 was passed over the column prior to eluting ApbA from the column with 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Q-Sepharose resin was equilibrated with 20 ml of standard buffer in a Pharmacia C10/10 column (2.5 × 1.0 cm). Fractions of the Hi-propyl eluant containing ApbA were loaded onto the column and washed with 10 ml of standard buffer. The ApbA protein was eluted from the column with 2 bed volumes of 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing ApbA as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled, dialyzed against 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and concentrated in the presence of 25% glycerol by ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane, and placed at 4 °C. Descending paper chromatography was performed as described (6King Jr., H.L. Dyar R.E. Wilken D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4689-4695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using sec-butanol:propionic acid (95:5), saturated with water as the mobile phase. Chromatograms were developed on 15 × 1 cm Whatman No. 3MM paper strips for 4–5 h. The relative mobility (Rf) of KPA was determined after conversion to its semicarbazone by spraying with a solution of 0.1% semicarbazide in 0.15% sodium acetate prior to detection under ultraviolet light (330 nm). Pantoic acid was detected by spraying the dried chromatograms with a solution of 0.04% bromphenol blue in ethanol. Fast atom bombardment mass spectra were obtained with an MS-SOTC ultra high resolution mass spectrometer (Kratos, Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom). The spectrometer was equipped with a xenon fast atom bombardment gun (Ion Tech, Ltd., Teddington, United Kingdom). The acceleration potential was 6 kV, the source temperature was 25 °C, and no matrix was used. Data were collected and processed using a Kratos DS-55 data system. Early on we noted that the N-terminal His-Tag fusion of ApbA was unable to complement anapbA mutation in vivo, indicating this fusion protein was inactive. This result was consistent with a role for the N-terminal NAD+/FAD binding site in activity of the protein. Active ApbA was obtained after overexpression of the wild-typeapbA + allele in plasmid pT7-apbA. Expression of ApbA, as monitored by SDS-PAGE and enzyme assays, was optimal after 3 h with no further increase in specific activity up to 24 h postinduction (data not shown). The ratio of specific activities (crude extract/homogeneous protein) was 10%, suggesting that ApbA comprised approximately 10% of total cellular protein under overexpressing conditions. KPA reductase was purified to homogeneity from clarified extracts of E. coli BL21/λDE3 carrying pT7-apbA. Table Ishows data obtained from a representative purification of this enzyme. An average purification began with 4 liters of cells, and 89% of the KPA reductase activity remained in the soluble fraction. The majority of proteins eluted off the Hi-propyl column in either the flow through or during the 200-ml gradient of 20 to 0% ammonium sulfate saturation. ApbA eluted in a broad peak after completion of the gradient, suggesting extensive interaction of the protein with this column matrix (data not shown). Addition of up to 50% ethylene glycol or up to 1.0% Triton X-100 to the buffer failed to reduce the volume needed to elute ApbA. Although we were concerned with such a strong interaction between the matrix and the protein, percent yield and specific activity measurements suggested that the activity of the protein was unaffected by the prolonged interaction with the matrix. In addition, the period of time that the protein was in dilute solution (<1 mg ml−1) off this column did not affect the activity. Active fractions contained protein that was >98% homogeneous as determined by densitometric scans of 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Subsequent column chromatography on a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column concentrated ApbA and resulted in the completed purification of 45.8 mg of ApbA, a yield of approximately 78% (Table I). Although this ion exchange chromatography step resulted in little if any purification, this efficiently concentrated ApbA.Table IPurification of ApbAStepTotal volumeProtein concentrationTotal proteinTotal activity1-aOne unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol of ketopantoate/min.Specific activityPercent yieldmlmg ml−1mgunitsunits mg−1Crude extract609.6457823344.03100.0Clarified extract557.6141820844.9889.3Hi-propyl HIC8500.0650.3180735.8977.5Q-Sepharose133.5245.8181339.6777.61-a One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol of ketopantoate/min. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 A shows an SDS-PAGE gel of the purification described in Table I. The presence of the ApbA protein in the active fractions was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-ApbA as shown in Fig. 2 B. N-terminal amino acid sequencing determined the first 15 amino acids of the homogeneous protein to be MKITVLGCGALGQLW, a perfect match to the predicted amino acid sequence of ApbA (3Downs D.M. Petersen L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4858-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result confirmed that the purified protein was ApbA, confirmed that it was responsible for the KPA reductase activity measured, and indicated that no post-translational processing of the protein had occurred. Using the ketopantoic acid reductase assay described under “Experimental Procedures,” homogeneous ApbA was shown to have a specific activity of 64.3. To determine the in vitro product of ApbA, 0.5 μmol of ketopantoic acid was reduced to completion by 5 units of homogeneous ApbA in the presence of 400 μm NADPH. The reaction was run at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction product was isolated from substrates by paper chromatography and analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrophotometry. This analysis identified signals with m/z ratios of 149 (M + H+), 171 (M + Na+), and 187 (M + K+) and was identical to authentic pantoate. A temperature of 42 °C was determined to be the optimalin vitro temperature for ApbA at a pH of 6.0 (Fig. 3 A). The pH optimum was 6.25 at a reaction temperature of 42 °C (Fig. 3 B). Using 0.025 nmol (0.783 μg) of homogeneous enzyme under optimal reaction conditions (42 °C, pH 6.25), the specific acitivity of ApbA was 61 and 16 using NADPH and NADH, respectively, as electron donors (Fig. 3 B). This result indicated that NADPH is likely to be the preferred source of electrons for ApbA in vivo. HPLC gel filtration chromatography using a BioSep-SEC-S2000 column resolved a single, sharp protein peak associated with the homogeneous active ApbA fraction. This peak eluted with a volume indicating a molecular mass of 31 kDa, consistent with ApbA functioning as a monomer (data not shown). While many characterized reductases are multimeric, a new family of monomeric proteins including carbonyl reductases, has recently been identified and comprise the monomeric oxidoreductase family (12Stolz A. Rahimi-Kiani M. Ameis D. Chan E. Ronk M. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15253-15257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although members of this familiy share significant sequence similarity, ApbA showed no amino acid sequence similarity to members of this family, suggesting that ApbA may be a member of a yet uncharacterized family of monomeric oxidoreductases. KPA reductase activities specifically, have been identified in S. cerevisiae, E. coli, S. typhimurium, and P. maltophilia 845. Because the respective enzymes in S. cerevisiae and E. coli have been only partially purified, no oligomeric data were available for these proteins although, like ApbA, each of these KPA reductases displayed a preference for NADPH (5Primerano D.A.

However, the pH optimum of the S. typhimurium enzyme in crude extracts was reported to be 5, in contrast to the optimal pH of 6.25 determined herein for homogeneous ApbA (4Primerano D.A. Burns R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of metabolically relevant compounds bearing structural resemblance to KPA were tested for reduction by ApbA, namely, pantoate, ketoisovalerate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate, 3-hydroxypyruvic acid, α-ketoglutarate, α-ketobutyrate, and acetaldehyde. None of these compounds served as substrates for ApbA when provided in the assay mixture at the concentration used for ketopantoic acid (0.5 mm), reflecting the structural specificity of ApbA for its substrate. In the presence of NADPH, ApbA was unable to catalyze the reduction of a number of artificial dye electron acceptors, including dichlorophenol-indophenol, benzyl viologen, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, cyanocobalamin, cytochromec, and phenazine methosulfate. Initial velocity measurements were made using 0.129 nmol of enzyme with four concentrations of NADPH ranging from 125 to 3125 μm and four concentrations of KPA ranging from 125 to 3125 μm. Kinetic constants were determined at 42 °C, pH 6.25. The double reciprocal plots are shown in Fig. 4. The kinetic constants were determined from secondary plots of the intercepts versus the reciprocal of the fixed substrate concentration. Data were analyzed, and best fit lines were obtained using the Enzyme Kinetics Template of the Prism program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Kinetic constants for KPA reductase were determined using linear and non-linear regression analyses. These analyses determined that the Kmconstants of ApbA for NADPH and KPA were 0.776 ± 0.09 mm and 0.742 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. The Vmax value obtained from either secondary plot was 89.3 ± 2.3 units/mg. These plots are consistent with, but not conclusive of, the ApbA enzyme employing a ping-pong bi-bi reaction mechanism. Identification of KPA reductase activity for the apbA gene product has profound implications on our understandiing of thiamine synthesis. Because apbA mutations cause a conditional nutritional requirement that can be satisfied by pantothenate or thiamine, knowledge of the biochemical role of this gene product will allow us to frame this activity within the context of thiamine synthesis and to further probe into the integration of the pantothenate and thiamine biosynthetic pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2316543597,"A431 cells hyperproduce EGF receptors and possess inactive p53 proteins. It has been suggested that a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21/WAF1 plays a crucial role in the EGF-induced cell-cycle arrest of A431 cells. Here, we investigated the role of WAF1 gene transcription in the EGF-induced cell-cycle arrest by transfecting the 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide which corresponds to the 5′ region of WAF1 gene (AS/WAF1). When A431 cells were treated with EGF, a cascade of responses were observed, including immediate hyperphosphorylation of EGF receptor on tyrosine residues, accumulation of WAF1 mRNA and p21/WAF1 protein, dephosphorylation of RB protein which is a substrate of CDK-cyclin, and cell-cycle arrest. In the presence of AS/WAF1, EGF induced the tyrosine-phosphorylation of EGF receptor, but WAF1 mRNA was reduced to a half; accumulation of p21/WAF1 protein and its downstream responses were no longer observed; A431 cells grew continuously. Thus, the transfection of antisense efficiently prevented A431 cells from the EGF-induced arrest. These observations suggest that p21/WAF1 protein is a major effector molecule of the EGF-mediated cell-cycle arrest of A431 cells."

These essential factors include TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH and form a preinitiation complex on a promoter DNA. TFIIH is composed of multiple subunits and associates with multiple enzyme activities, DNA-dependent ATPase, DNA helicase, and protein kinase (Refs. 3Serizawa H. Mäkelä T.P. Conaway J.W.

It has been suggested that DNA helicase by TFIIH is involved in promoter opening surrounding the transcriptional start site. CDK7 and cyclin H have been identified as subunits of TFIIH, and TFIIH phosphorylates the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA pol II in vitro. Genetic studies in yeast suggest that CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH is essential for transcription in vivo (8Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol.

It has been proposed that phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIH regulates transcription. The cell cycle is believed to be regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Refs. 12Hunter T. Pines J.

Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar and references therein). The activities of CDKs are precisely regulated through the cell cycle. Several inhibitory factors of CDKs are also known. Cdk inhibitor p16INK4A has been identified as binding Cdk4 and inhibiting phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) (15Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). CDK4, a G1 CDK, phosphorylates pRb and is important for the cell cycle progression at the G1 phase in the cell cycle. Therefore p16INK4A is thought to repress the cell cycle by inhibiting G1 CDKs. Here, we report that p16INK4A associates with RNA pol II CTD and TFIIH and that p16INK4A inhibits the CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH. These data suggest that p16INK4A might directly regulate transcription through the CTD phosphorylation. Antibodies against the TFIIH p89 subunit and p16INK4A, CDK2, and CDK4 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech. The TNT reticulocite lysate kit was obtained from Promega. Except as indicated in the figure legend, protein kinase reactions were carried out using TFIIH and RNA pol II purified from calf thymus, as described by Serizawa et al. (3Serizawa H. Mäkelä T.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Weinberg R.A. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Purification of calf thymus TFIIH and RNA pol II will be described elsewhere. Reaction mixtures (15 μl) were incubated at 28 °C for 60 min, and the phosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mm DTT, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol. Phosphoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Sf21 cells were infected by recombinant baculoviruses containing cDNA sequences of p16INK4A, CDK4, and CDK2. The infected cells were harvested after 48 h, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and were burst in homogenization buffer using N2 cavitation as described by Graber et al. (16Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged to remove debris. GST fusion proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column as described by Serizawa et al.(3Serizawa H. Mäkelä T.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Weinberg R.A. Young R.A.

Harlow E. Nature. 1995; 375: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The purified His-p16 was dialyzed against buffer C (17Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20750-20756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 50 mm KCl and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto DEAE-5PW (7.5 × 75 mm) (TosoHaas) pre-equilibrated with buffer C containing 25 mmKCl. The column was washed using buffer C (17Serizawa H. Conaway J.W.

Except as indicated in the figure legend, reaction mixtures were incubated at 27 °C for 30 min under conditions similar to those of the CTD kinase assay in the absence of ATP and NdeI-digested pDN-AdML. The reactions were subsequently incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 60 min and were spun down in a centrifuge. The supernatant was removed. The precipitate was extensively washed using ELB (19Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A.

The precipitates and the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected on Western blots or autoradiograms. Bands on Western blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham). TFIIH has been reported to contain CDK7 and cyclin H and to phosphorylate RNA pol II CTD and CDK2 (3Serizawa H. Mäkelä T.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Weinberg R.A. Young R.A.

A recombinant fusion protein of glutathioneS-transferase and p16INK4A (GST-p16) was prepared from E. coli lysates and purified using a glutathione affinity column. Phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD was inhibited by the addition of purified GST-p16 (Fig. 1 a), and phosphorylation of a GST-CTD fusion protein by TFIIH was also inhibited by the addition of the purified GST-p16 (Fig. 1 b). GST was purified using a glutathione affinity column from E. coli lysates. Phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD and GST-CTD was not inhibited by the addition of amounts of the purified GST equivalent to that of GST-p16. We tested whether purified GST-p16 inhibits phosphorylation of CDK2 by TFIIH. Fig. 1 c shows that the purified GST-p16 did not inhibit phosphorylation of CDK2 by TFIIH. The protein amount of the purified GST-p16 used in the phosphorylation of GST-CDK2 is equivalent to that in the phosphorylation of GST-CTD and RNA pol II, and phosphorylation of GST-CDK2 was carried out under conditions equivalent to those of GST-CTD. GST-p16 used here inhibited phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by CDK4 (data not shown). These results indicate that purified GST-p16 is responsible for the CTD kinase inhibitory activity and furthermore that purified GST-p16 did not inhibit phosphorylation of CDK2 by TFIIH. To further confirm the CTD kinase inhibitory activity by p16INK4A, a recombinant p16INK4A protein containing six histidine residues at the N-terminal (His-p16) was prepared from E. coli lysates and was purified using a nickel affinity column. The purified His-p16 was further purified using an anion exchange HPLC column. A protein in fractions of the HPLC column was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST-CTD was carried out in the presence of these column fractions. The SDS-PAGE and the CTD kinase assay revealed that inhibition of the CTD phosphorylation was cofractionated with His-p16 (Fig. 2), thus confirming that recombinant p16INK4A inhibits the CTD kinase activity of TFIIH. To determine the molar ratio of TFIIH, GST-CTD, and His-p16 in effective inhibition of CTD phosphorylation, ∼0.01 pmol of TFIIH highly purified from rat liver, ∼40 pmol of purified GST-CTD, and various amounts of purified His-p16 were added in CTD phosphorylation reactions (Fig. 3). Highly purified rat TFIIH, shown in Fig. 3 a, was used in the CTD phosphorylation reactions. The CTD kinase inhibitory activity was saturated under the condition of ∼20 pmol of His-p16. Therefore, the molar ratio of His-p16 and GST-CTD in effective inhibition of CTD phosphorylation is about 1:2, and that of His-p16 and TFIIH is about 2,000:1. To determine whether p16INK4A associates with TFIIH, purified GST-p16 was incubated with a TFIIH preparation. GST-p16 was precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the precipitates were analyzed on Western blots using an antibody against the p89 subunit (ERCC3) of TFIIH (Fig. 4 a). The p89 subunit was detected in the precipitates on the Western blots (lane 1). In control experiments, the p89 subunit was not detected in the precipitates on the Western blots, when the purified GST was incubated with the TFIIH preparation and precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (lane 2). These results suggest that TFIIH associates and coprecipitates with GST-p16. Next, the possibility that GST-p16 binds recombinant CDK7, a subunit of TFIIH, was examined (Fig. 4 b). A recombinant CDK7 metabolically radiolabeled using [35S]methionine was prepared in vitro. [35S]CDK7 shown in lane 1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-CDK7 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads, confirming that the protein metabolically radiolabeled using [35S]methionine is CDK7 (data not shown). [35S]CDK7 was incubated with purified GST-p16. GST-p16 was precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. [35S]CDK7 was detected in the precipitates (lane 3). In control experiments, the [35S]CDK7 was not detected in the precipitates when the purified GST was incubated with the [35S]CDK7 and precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (lane 2). Furthermore, a recombinant luciferase metabolically radiolabeled using [35S]methionine in vitro was incubated with purified GST-p16 or GST. However, the [35S]luciferase was not detected in the precipitates (lanes 6 and 7). These data suggest that recombinant CDK7 binds and coprecipitates with GST-p16. Phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIH was inhibited by the addition of the purified GST-p16, whereas phosphorylation of the CDK2 was not inhibited (Figs. 1 and 2). p16INK4A has been reported not to bind CDK2 (Fig. 5 b) (15Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). The possibility that p16INK4A might associate with the RNA pol II, a protein substrate of the CTD kinase of TFIIH, was next examined. The purified GST-p16 was incubated with a fraction containing purified RNA pol II, and GST-p16 was precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The largest subunit of RNA pol II was detected in the precipitates on Western blots using a monoclonal antibody against RNA pol II CTD (Fig. 5 a, lane 1). In control experiments, the largest subunit of RNA pol II was not detected in the precipitates on Western blots using the monoclonal CTD antibody, when the purified GST fraction was incubated with the purified RNA pol II fraction and precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (lane 2). These results suggest that RNA pol II associates and coprecipitates with GST-p16. To determine whether p16INK4A associates with the CTD, the purified GST-CTD fraction was incubated with insect cell lysates containing His-p16 overexpressed by the baculovirus expression system. The His-p16 was precipitated using an anti-p16INK4Aantibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Fig. 5 b). GST-CTD was detected in the precipitates on Western blots using a monoclonal antibody against RNA pol II CTD (lane 1). In control experiments, when an excess of a synthetic peptide that was used to generate the anti-p16INK4A antibody was incubated in the precipitation reactions (lane 2), the amount of GST-CTD detected in the precipitates on the Western blots was traceable but was much smaller than that in lane 1. These data suggest that GST-CTD associates and coprecipitates with His-p16. To confirm that GST-CTD and His-p16 are coprecipitated together, glutathione-Sepharose beads were used to precipitate GST-CTD, when GST-CTD was incubated with purified His-p16 or the insect cell lysates containing His-p16 overexpressed by the baculovirus system (Fig. 5 c). His-p16 was detected in the precipitates on Western blots using an anti-p16INK4A antibody (lanes 2 and 8). In control experiments, when GST was incubated with purified His-p16 or the insect cell lysates containing His-p16 overexpressed and precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (lane 1 and 7), the amount of His-p16 detected in the precipitates on Western blots using the anti-p16INK4Aantibody was traceable but was much smaller than that in lanes 2 and 8, respectively. These data suggest that GST-CTD directly bound and coprecipitated with His-p16. p16INK4A has been reported to bind and inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 and to regulate the cell cycle via the inhibition of these CDKs (15Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar, 18Koh J. Enders G.H. Dynlacht B.D. Harlow E. Nature. 1995; 375: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate pRb, which forms a protein complex with DNA binding transcription factor E2F. The phosphorylation of pRb results in the release of E2F from the complex, which activates transcription by RNA pol II to express gene products that are required for the cell cycle (20Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Thus, p16INK4A is thought to regulate the cell cycle through the governance of a signaling pathway involved in the CDKs and RNA pol II transcription. RNA pol II CTD has been shown to be essential for cell viability and to regulate transcription in vivo (9Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A hypophosphorylated form of RNA pol II preferentially forms a preinitiation complex, and the CTD of RNA pol II engaged in transcriptional elongation is highly phosphorylated. Thus phosphorylation of the RNA pol II CTD has been proposed to be a regulatory event in transcription initiation. The present study shows that p16INK4A is capable of inhibiting phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD by TFIIH, indicating an alternative possibility that p16INK4A may directly regulate transcription via phosphorylation of RNA pol II CTD in the cell cycle. The RNA pol II holoenzyme has been reported to be a ribosome-sized protein complex containing factors involved in regulating transcription, cell cycle, and DNA repair (25Chao D.M. Gadbois E.L.

The precise subunit composition of the holoenzyme is still unclear. This work indicates that p16INK4A is a CTD-binding protein. Therefore, it is possible that p16INK4A may be a subunit of the holoenzyme. CDK8 and cyclin C appear to be subunits of the holoenzyme (28Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Yeast homologues of these molecules are SRB10 and SRB11, and the CTD kinase by SRB10 was shown to be responsible for transcriptional activation (29Liao S.M. Zhang J.H. Jeffrey D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. Vanvuuren H.J.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It is possible that p16INK4A might also inhibit the CTD phosphorylation by CDK8, and furthermore, that p16INK4Amight inhibit transcriptional activation. Mutations and deletions in the p16INK4A gene have been identified from many types of tumor cells (Ref. 18Koh J. Enders G.H. Dynlacht B.D. Harlow E. Nature. 1995; 375: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar and references therein). Mutants of p16INK4A derived from tumor cells have revealed defects in inhibiting CDK4 and in regulating cell cycle at the G1 phase (18Koh J. Enders G.H. Dynlacht B.D. Harlow E.

These p16INK4A mutants may also have defects in inhibiting the CTD kinase of TFIIH and in binding RNA pol II CTD and TFIIH, and these defects might be involved in tumorigenesis. CDK7 and cyclin H have been shown to form a 175-kDa complex in vitro (19Mäkelä T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A.

This 175-kDa complex activates the histone H1 kinase activity of CDK2 by phosphorylation of the threonine activation site. The kinase capable of activating a CDK is called CDK-activating kinase, CAK. Most of the CAK activity in cell lysates fractionates in a 175-kDa complex (30Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). TFIIH has been reported to contain in vitro CAK activity and to be a complex of about 700 kDa (3Serizawa H. Mäkelä T.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Weinberg R.A. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, the function of the 175-kDa CAK complex and TFIIH in the cell cycle is not well understood. This work reveals that p16INK4A binds the recombinant CDK7 and the purified TFIIH and that although p16INK4A inhibits CTD kinase of TFIIH, it does not inhibit CDK2 phosphorylation by TFIIH. These results suggest that CAK complexes, including TFIIH and the 175-kDa complex, may play a role in the cell cycle via a signaling pathway regulated by p16INK4A. However, p16INK4A may not be involved in a pathway to activate CDK2 by CAK.

Thus, the distal region of βL appears to function as a negative regulator of the growth inhibitory effects of type I IFNs. Further studies looking for possible targets of the βL regulatory domain demonstrated that this region associates with a tyrosine phosphatase.

However, the role of SHP1 in other cell types is not clear since this PTP is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas the IFN system functions in almost all, if not all, cell lineages. Mouse L-929 cells that coexpress wild-type human α and β subunits respond to the antiviral effects of human type I IFNs, demonstrating the presence of functional human type I IFN-R (9Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Rubinstein M. Hackett R. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to test these cells for their ability to respond to the antiproliferative effects of type I IFNs. Human IFNα and IFNβ induced only a minimal antiproliferative response, whereas murine type I IFNs produced a marked inhibition of cell proliferation. These data indicate that (i) induction of the antiproliferative and antiviral responses occurs through partially divergent pathways and (ii) that a novel species-specific signaling component is required, in addition to the α and βL chains, for the growth inhibitory effect. Surprisingly, the antiproliferative response was observed in cells that express the human βL chain truncated at amino acid 346. Thus, the distal part of βL apparently contains a negative regulatory domain that controls the growth inhibitory effects of type I IFNs. Further characterization of this negative regulatory domain revealed that it interacts with a PTP that appears to be distinct from SHP1 and SHP2. The data herein suggest that a novel species-specific component is required for the growth inhibitory effect and that this effect is regulated by a distal region corresponding to amino acids 346–417 on the β subunit.

Briefly, cells were seeded at 6,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in a final volume of 0.6 ml and treated with the indicated concentrations of IFNs. The numbers of cells per well were determined by trypsinization and counting of duplicate wells in a hemocytometer. Experiments were performed at least twice with two independent clones carrying the same mutation. Cells were treated with different concentrations of the indicated IFNs for 15 min, rapidly centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 s in an Eppendorf microfuge, and subsequently solubilized in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (4Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell.

For protein phosphatase assays, cells expressing wild-type α chain and the βL subunit truncated at the indicated amino acids were treated with or without IFNα2 for 10 min at 37 °C and lysed in lysis buffer as described previously (4Colamonici O.R.

The βL subunit was precipitated using a polyclonal serum raised against a GST fusion protein encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain (βL265–515) (39Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Domanski P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23630-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitates were washed three times in cold phosphatase buffer to remove phosphatase inhibitors. The phosphatase activity of the immunocomplexes was determined using pNPP (Sigma) as a substrate. The phosphatase assay was carried out at 37 °C for 0.5 h in 50 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm pNPP). The reaction was terminated by adding 950 μl of 1 m NaOH. The reaction product,p-nitrophenolate, was quantified by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Mouse L-929 cells transfected with the human α and βL subunits, LpZRαβL.10, activate the Jak-Stat pathway and are highly responsive to the antiviral effects of HuIFNα2 and HuIFNβ (9Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Rubinstein M. Hackett R. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To characterize the antiproliferative effect of type I IFNs in these cells, we first performed MTT proliferation assays using L-929 cells stably transfected with wild-type human α and βL subunits (LpZRαβL.10). Fig. 1 A shows that high doses of HuIFNα2 (100,000 units/ml) had little effect on cell proliferation. However, treatment with MuIFNαβ or MuIFNβ at doses between 1,000 and 10,000 units/ml induced a significant antiproliferative effect. To confirm the results observed with MTT assays, we performed similar experiments in which cell numbers were assessed. Fig. 1 Bshows that treatment of LpZRαβL.10 cells (Fig. 1 B, αβL cells) with MuIFNαβ reduced cell proliferation more than 95% over a period of 6 days, whereas HuIFNα2 produced a minimal response (20%, from 545,000 cells/well to 445,000 cells/well in control and HuIFNα2-treated cells, respectively). Similar results were observed when MuIFNβ and HuIFNβ were used (data not shown). These results indicate that the endogenous mouse type I IFN-R expressed in L-929 cells can trigger a complete antiproliferative effect in response to mouse IFNs. Thus, in contrast to the antiviral effect, reconstitution of the human receptor with the α and βL chains in these cells is not sufficient to trigger an antiproliferative effect in response to human type I IFNs, suggesting that an additional human signaling component is required for this effect. It has been reported that human/rodent somatic cell hybrids carrying human chromosome 21 acquire the ability to respond to the antiviral effect and induction of HLA class I antigens by human type I IFNs (7Colamonici O.R.

Fig. 1 C shows a proliferation assay performed with HuIFNα2 and MuIFNαβ. An 85% reduction in the growth occurred for A9+21 cells in response to MuIFNαβ, whereas only a 40% decrease (from 165,000 cells/well to 100,000 cells/well in controls and HuIFNα2-treated cells, respectively) in cell proliferation was induced by HuIFNα2. These data show that binding of human type I IFNs by human α and βL chains expressed in mouse cells (either by transfection in L-929 cells or by incorporation of human chromosome 21 in A9+21 cells) induces only a partial growth inhibitory response. Since human/rodent somatic cell hybrids carrying human chromosome 21, including A9+21 cells, have been shown to develop an antiviral state and induce HLA class I antigens in response to human type I IFNs (7Colamonici O.R.

Moreover, it is unlikely that this signaling element is encoded by any genes present on human chromosome 21. Since deletion of the distal region of the α chain produces an increase in HLA class I response induced by human IFNα2 (48Gibbs V. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether the antiproliferative response could be induced by human IFNs in L-929 cells that express α and βL subunits with deletions of various regions of their cytoplasmic domains. Cells that express the βL chain truncated at amino acid 417 are more responsive to MuIFNαβ than to HuIFNα2 (Fig. 2 A,panel A). These results parallel our findings for L-929 or A9+21 cells, which express wild-type receptor subunits (Fig. 1,B and C). By direct contrast, L-929 cells coexpressing both the wild-type α and βL truncated at amino acid 346 (Fig. 2, panels B, αβL346.2cells), responded to the growth inhibitory effects of human type I IFNs. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of βL at amino acid 300, which removes the Jak1 binding site (18Domanski P. Fish E. Nadeau O.W. Witte M. Platanias L.C. Yan H. Krolewski J. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26388-26393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), abolished the antiproliferative response to human type I IFNs but did not affect the antiproliferative response to MuIFNαβ (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that the mouse signaling machinery is intact in these cells. We also studied L-929 transfectants expressing wild-type βL and an α chain with a deletion of the negative regulatory domain (truncation at amino acid 511 and tyrosine 466 mutated to phenylalanine; Fig. 2, panel D, αY1FβL.11 cells) (48Gibbs V. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These cells showed a significant response to MuIFNαβ, whereas human type I IFNs induced only a partial antiproliferative effect, which was similar to that observed in cells expressing wild-type receptors. This result suggests that the negative regulatory region of the α subunit does not control cell proliferation (48Gibbs V. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, L-929 cells coexpressing the same mutations of the α subunit and βL truncated at amino acid 346 (Fig. 2, panel E, αY1F511βL346.3) were extremely sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of human and mouse type I IFNs. Similar results were obtained with two independent clones carrying the same mutation (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that a region corresponding to amino acids 346–417 in the βL chain contains a negative regulatory domain and may be a possible target for mouse regulatory proteins. Thus, removal of this negative regulatory domain appears to complement the absence of an unknown species-specific component required for the antiproliferative effect (see “Discussion”). Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a central role in IFN and cytokine signaling. Therefore, to determine if the negative regulatory domain of βL was associated with a PTP, we performed in vitro phosphatase assays after immunoprecipitation with anti-βL sera. As a source of βL chain, we used cell lysates obtained from mouse L-929 cells cotransfected with the wild-type α subunit and truncations of the βL chain at amino acids 346, 417, or 462, respectively. Cells were treated with IFNα2 for 10 min, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes all truncated forms of the βL chain, and in vitrophosphatase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates. Fig. 3 shows that significant phosphatase activity is associated with βL462 and βL417, but not with βL346 after IFNα2 treatment, indicating that the 346–417 region of βLassociates with a PTP. Since the increase in phosphatase activity associated with the 346–417 region of βL is observed only after IFNα treatment, we could not elucidate whether the βL-associated PTP is recruited to the receptor complex after IFNα stimulation or is constitutively associated with the βL chain and activated by IFNα2 stimulation. We next sought to test if deletion of the 346–417 region of the βL chain and, consequently, removal of the phosphatase interaction site had an effect on tyrosine phosphorylation. We performed time course and dose response experiments with mouse L-929 cells stably cotransfected with wild-type α chain and βL truncated at amino acids 346 or 417, respectively. Fig. 4 A shows that more intense phosphorylation of Jak1 was observed at lower doses of IFNα2 in cells expressing the βL subunit truncated at amino acid 346, as compared with the βL chain truncated at residue 417. Moreover, deletions distal to amino acid 346, but not at amino acid 417, prolonged the period of time that Jak1 was phosphorylated (Fig. 4 B). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation observed was not due to different amounts of immunoprecipitated Jak1 protein since stripping and reblotting of the same membranes with an anti-Jak1 mAb showed a similar amount of Jak1 in all lanes (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels). Two independent clones expressing βLtruncated at amino acid 346, αβL346.2 and αβL346.4, produced equivalent results. The intensity of Tyk2 phosphorylation, however, was unaffected by truncation of βL at residue 346 as revealed by immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Tyk2 sera followed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that the 346–417 region of βL interacts with a phosphatase that regulates Jak1 phosphorylation. It has been previously reported that SH2-containing phosphatases (SHP1 and SHP2) interact with the α subunit of type I IFNR (37David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 49David M. Zhou G. Pine R. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15862-15865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since the negative regulatory region of βLcontains only one tyrosine (Tyr-411), which (if phosphorylated) may serve as docking site for SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatases, we studied the effect of a phenylalanine mutation of tyrosine 411 on cell proliferation. Panel F (Fig. 2) shows that mutation of tyrosine 411 to phenylalanine does not reconstitute the antiproliferative effect of type I IFNs. Similar results were also obtained with different clones carrying the same mutations (data not shown). Therefore, tyrosine 411 is not critical for induction of the negative regulatory effect and is presumably not a docking site for SH2-containing phosphatases. The type I IFNs have multiple biological actions, including antiviral and antiproliferative effects, which are the most prominent of these cellular responses (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Binding of human type I IFNs to mouse L-929 cells that coexpress human α and βL chains is sufficient to trigger activation of the Jak-Stat pathway and to produce a full antiviral response, which demonstrates the presence of functional human type I IFN-R subunits (9Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Rubinstein M. Hackett R. Pitha P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We therefore tested these cells for their ability to respond to the antiproliferative actions of human type I IFNs. Although these cells were able to respond to the full growth inhibitory effects of MuIFNαβ, only a minimal response was observed for human type I IFNs. Thus, the antiproliferative pathway is intact in these cells but not fully activated via the human receptors. Similar results were also observed for different clones of mouse A9+21 cells that carry several copies of human chromosome 21, which is thought to contain the type I IFN-R cluster (7Colamonici O.R.

Genet. 1995; 21: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 47Hertzog P. Hwang S.Y. Holland K.A. Tymms M.J. Iannello R. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14088-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these data indicate that (i) induction of the antiproliferative and antiviral responses occurs through partially divergent pathways and (ii) that a novel species-specific signaling component is required, in addition to the α and βLchains, for the growth inhibitory effect. It has been reported that elements of the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors have a negative regulatory role in signaling. For example, removal of the docking site for SHP1 in EPO-R results in hypersensitivity to EPO and prolonged phosphorylation of Jak2 (31Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of the distal region of the α subunit of the IFNαR results in increased sensitivity to induction of HLA class I antigens by IFNα2 (48Gibbs V. Takahashi M. Aguet M. Chuntharapai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28710-28716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, removal of the distal region (346–417) of the cytoplasmic domain of βL resulted in a gain in response to the growth inhibitory effects of IFNα, indicating that this region encodes a negative regulatory domain. The effect of the negative regulatory domain of βL is specific, as demonstrated by the finding that deletion of a homologous region of the α chain did not have an effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 2, αY1F511βL cells). The negative regulatory domain of βL interacts with a PTP as indicated by detection of phosphatase activity associated with the 346–417 region of βL and the finding that deletion of this region resulted in prolonged phosphorylation of Jak1 in mouse cells. Mutation of the only tyrosine in the negative regulatory domain (Tyr-411) did not have the same effect on the antiproliferative response as deletion of the 346–417 region, indicating that the putative phosphatase is not docked to βL through an SH2 domain. Moreover, immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the α and βL chains, and pull-down experiments with GST fusion proteins encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the α and βL chains failed to precipitate SHP1 or SHP2 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the 346–417 region of βL functions as a negative regulator for the antiproliferative effect of IFNs, possibly by recruiting a regulatory phosphatase through an SH2-independent mechanism. Consistently with the finding in mouse cells, immunoprecipitations with anti-βL antibodies also revealed phosphatase activity specifically associated with the βL subunit expressed in human cells (data not shown). It should be noted, however, that in human cells no conclusive data have been obtained using GSTβL fusion proteins. Since mouse IFNs completely inhibit proliferation of cells expressing human α and βL chains, we can conclude that the mouse receptor couples the signal induced by murine IFNs with the intracellular proteins responsible for antiproliferative pathway in these cells. Consequently, the inability of LpZRαβL and A9+21 cells to respond to the growth inhibitory effect of human IFNs centers the defect at the level of the human receptor. One possibility is that the intracellular domains of the human α and/or βL chains, which are responsible for activation of the antiproliferative pathway, are not homologous to their murine counterparts. However, this possibility is highly unlikely, based on two primary observations. First, deletion of the negative regulatory domain of βL allows a full human IFNα-induced antiproliferative effect, indicating that the human receptor subunits are capable of interacting with the appropriate mouse signaling proteins. Second, these transfectants respond to the antiviral effect of IFNs. Another possibility is that the missing species-specific component corresponds to a third receptor subunit. In this scenario, the antiproliferative response requires the assembly of a receptor composed of three subunits; in this complex, the third receptor subunit regulates the activity of a protein associated with the negative regulatory domain of βL, presumably a PTP. If, in fact, a phosphatase is involved, the third receptor subunit may delay activation of the PTP or releases the PTP from the complex, resulting in prolonged activation of Jak1 and generation of the antiproliferative response. Thus, deletion of the negative regulatory domain of βL has the same outcome as activating the third receptor subunit, blocking the action of the PTP or an unknown protein that associates with this region. We thank Dr. J. N. Ihle for providing the Jak1 antisera."
