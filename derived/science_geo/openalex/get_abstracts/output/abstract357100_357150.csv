https://openalex.org/W2035538351,"The cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational energy of accreting matter into radiation. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*, where strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5 mm and 7 mm have detected intrinsic structure in Sgr A*, but the spatial resolution of observations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm that set a size of 37(+16)(-10) microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of Sgr A*. This is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of Sgr A* emission may not be centred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow."

In Nature this week, features and opinion pieces on one of the most daunting challenges facing modern science: how to cope with the flood of data now being generated. A petabyte is a lot of memory, however you say it — a quadrillion, 1015, or tens of thousands of trillions of bytes. But that is the currency of 'big data'. We visited the Sanger Institute's supercomputing centre, and its petabyte of capacity. Wikipedia's success shows how well the 'wiki' concept of open-access editing can work. It could work too as a way of coping with the data flows of modern biology. The world's leading search engine is ten this month. Eleven years ago few would have predicted Google's domination: undaunted we ask scientists and business people to try to predict the next big thing, a Google for the petabyte era. Digital data are easily shared, and just as easily wiped or lost. The problem of keeping on-line data accessible is especially difficult for the smaller lab. In Books&Arts, Felice Frankel and Rosalind Reid champion the cause of data visualization as a way of finding meaning in an otherwise daunting data stream. From the 1700s to the mid 1950s, most 'computers' were human. Best known were the 'Harvard computers', a group of women working from the 1880s until the 1940s, at the Harvard College Observatory. Employed to classify stars captured on millions of photographic plates, some of the 'computers' made significant contributions to science. Online databases are a vital outlet for publishing the data being produced by biological research. But the data need to be properly organized. This is the role of the biocurator, but as a team of authors from 15 of the world's major online research resources explains, biocuration is now sadly neglected. An aspect of the data boom with a political dimension is the environment: how much data to collect, how much money to spend.

https://openalex.org/W2140266186,"Background Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Despite recent improvements in cure rates, prediction of disease outcome remains a major challenge and survivors suffer from serious therapy-related side-effects. Recent data showed that patients with WNT-activated tumors have a favorable prognosis, suggesting that these patients could be treated less intensively, thereby reducing the side-effects. This illustrates the potential benefits of a robust classification of medulloblastoma patients and a detailed knowledge of associated biological mechanisms. Methods and Findings To get a better insight into the molecular biology of medulloblastoma we established mRNA expression profiles of 62 medulloblastomas and analyzed 52 of them also by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. Five molecular subtypes were identified, characterized by WNT signaling (A; 9 cases), SHH signaling (B; 15 cases), expression of neuronal differentiation genes (C and D; 16 and 11 cases, respectively) or photoreceptor genes (D and E; both 11 cases). Mutations in β-catenin were identified in all 9 type A tumors, but not in any other tumor. PTCH1 mutations were exclusively identified in type B tumors. CGH analysis identified several fully or partly subtype-specific chromosomal aberrations. Monosomy of chromosome 6 occurred only in type A tumors, loss of 9q mostly occurred in type B tumors, whereas chromosome 17 aberrations, most common in medulloblastoma, were strongly associated with type C or D tumors. Loss of the inactivated X-chromosome was highly specific for female cases of type C, D and E tumors. Gene expression levels faithfully reflected the chromosomal copy number changes. Clinicopathological features significantly different between the 5 subtypes included metastatic disease and age at diagnosis and histology. Metastatic disease at diagnosis was significantly associated with subtypes C and D and most strongly with subtype E. Patients below 3 yrs of age had type B, D, or E tumors. Type B included most desmoplastic cases. We validated and confirmed the molecular subtypes and their associated clinicopathological features with expression data from a second independent series of 46 medulloblastomas. Conclusions The new medulloblastoma classification presented in this study will greatly enhance the understanding of this heterogeneous disease. It will enable a better selection and evaluation of patients in clinical trials, and it will support the development of new molecular targeted therapies. Ultimately, our results may lead to more individualized therapies with improved cure rates and a better quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2095600149,"The recent discovery of superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide family of compounds has generated intense interest. The layered crystal structure with transition-metal ions in planar square-lattice form and the discovery of spin-density-wave order near 130 K (refs 10, 11) seem to hint at a strong similarity with the copper oxide superconductors. An important current issue is the nature of the ground state of the parent compounds. Two distinct classes of theories, distinguished by the underlying band structure, have been put forward: a local-moment antiferromagnetic ground state in the strong-coupling approach, and an itinerant ground state in the weak-coupling approach. The first approach stresses on-site correlations, proximity to a Mott-insulating state and, thus, the resemblance to the high-transition-temperature copper oxides, whereas the second approach emphasizes the itinerant-electron physics and the interplay between the competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The debate over the two approaches is partly due to the lack of conclusive experimental information on the electronic structures. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of LaOFeP (superconducting transition temperature, T(c) = 5.9 K), the first-reported iron-based superconductor. Our results favour the itinerant ground state, albeit with band renormalization. In addition, our data reveal important differences between these and copper-based superconductors."

https://openalex.org/W2065878937,"Misfolding and pathological aggregation of neuronal proteins has been proposed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are frequent neurodegenerative diseases of the aging population. While progressive accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) oligomers has been identified as one of the central toxic events in AD, accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) resulting in the formation of oligomers and protofibrils has been linked to PD and Lewy body Disease (LBD). We have recently shown that Abeta promotes alpha-syn aggregation and toxic conversion in vivo, suggesting that abnormal interactions between misfolded proteins might contribute to disease pathogenesis. However the molecular characteristics and consequences of these interactions are not completely clear.In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in potential Abeta/alpha-syn interactions, immunoblot, molecular modeling, and in vitro studies with alpha-syn and Abeta were performed. We showed in vivo in the brains of patients with AD/PD and in transgenic mice, Abeta and alpha-synuclein co-immunoprecipitate and form complexes. Molecular modeling and simulations showed that Abeta binds alpha-syn monomers, homodimers, and trimers, forming hybrid ring-like pentamers. Interactions occurred between the N-terminus of Abeta and the N-terminus and C-terminus of alpha-syn. Interacting alpha-syn and Abeta dimers that dock on the membrane incorporated additional alpha-syn molecules, leading to the formation of more stable pentamers and hexamers that adopt a ring-like structure. Consistent with the simulations, under in vitro cell-free conditions, Abeta interacted with alpha-syn, forming hybrid pore-like oligomers. Moreover, cells expressing alpha-syn and treated with Abeta displayed increased current amplitudes and calcium influx consistent with the formation of cation channels.These results support the contention that Abeta directly interacts with alpha-syn and stabilized the formation of hybrid nanopores that alter neuronal activity and might contribute to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in AD and PD. The broader implications of such hybrid interactions might be important to the pathogenesis of other disorders of protein misfolding."

https://openalex.org/W2084109336,"Under hypoxic conditions, cells suppress energy-intensive mRNA translation by modulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and pancreatic eIF2alpha kinase (PERK) pathways. Much is known about hypoxic inhibition of mTOR activity; however, the cellular processes activating PERK remain unclear. Since hypoxia is known to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesized that hypoxic ROS regulate mTOR and PERK to control mRNA translation and cell survival. Our data indicate that although exogenous ROS inhibit mTOR, eIF2alpha, and eEF2, mTOR and eEF2 were largely refractory to ROS generated under moderate hypoxia (0.5% O(2)). In direct contrast, the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 integrated stress response (ISR) was activated by hypoxic ROS and contributed to global protein synthesis inhibition and adaptive ATF4-mediated gene expression. The ISR as well as exogenous growth factors were critical for cell viability during extended hypoxia, since ISR inhibition decreased the viability of cells deprived of O(2) and growth factors. Collectively, our data support an important role for ROS in hypoxic cell survival. Under conditions of moderate hypoxia, ROS induce the ISR, thereby promoting energy and redox homeostasis and enhancing cellular survival."
https://openalex.org/W2095594395,"Recent neuroimaging studies have identified a set of brain regions that are metabolically active during wakeful rest and consistently deactivate in a variety the performance of demanding tasks. This “default network” has been functionally linked to the stream of thoughts occurring automatically in the absence of goal-directed activity and which constitutes an aspect of mental behavior specifically addressed by many meditative practices. Zen meditation, in particular, is traditionally associated with a mental state of full awareness but reduced conceptual content, to be attained via a disciplined regulation of attention and bodily posture. Using fMRI and a simplified meditative condition interspersed with a lexical decision task, we investigated the neural correlates of conceptual processing during meditation in regular Zen practitioners and matched control subjects. While behavioral performance did not differ between groups, Zen practitioners displayed a reduced duration of the neural response linked to conceptual processing in regions of the default network, suggesting that meditative training may foster the ability to control the automatic cascade of semantic associations triggered by a stimulus and, by extension, to voluntarily regulate the flow of spontaneous mentation."
https://openalex.org/W2016500542,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) of Apicomplexan parasites are crucial for the survival of the parasite throughout its life cycle. CDPK1 is expressed in the asexual blood stages of the parasite, particularly late stage schizonts. We have identified two substrates of Plasmodium falciparum CDPK1: myosin A tail domain-interacting protein (MTIP) and glideosome-associated protein 45 (GAP45), both of which are components of the motor complex that generates the force required by the parasite to actively invade host cells. Indirect immunofluorescence shows that CDPK1 localizes to the periphery of P. falciparum merozoites and is therefore suitably located to act on MTIP and GAP45 at the inner membrane complex. A proportion of both GAP45 and MTIP is phosphorylated in schizonts, and we demonstrate that both proteins can be efficiently phosphorylated by CDPK1 in vitro. A primary phosphorylation of MTIP occurs at serine 47, whereas GAP45 is phosphorylated at two sites, one of which could also be detected in phosphopeptides purified from parasite lysates. Both CDPK1 activity and host cell invasion can be inhibited by the kinase inhibitor K252a, suggesting that CDPK1 is a suitable target for antimalarial drug development."
https://openalex.org/W1982966359,"Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a dietary cancer chemopreventive agent, causes apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, but the mechanism of cell death is not fully understood. We now demonstrate that the BITC-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells is initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inhibition of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The BITC-induced ROS production and apoptosis were significantly inhibited by overexpression of catalase and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitochondrial DNA-deficient Rho-0 variant of MDA-MB-231 cells was nearly completely resistant to BITC-mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. The Rho-0 MDA-MB-231 cells also resisted BITC-mediated mitochondrial translocation (activation) of Bax. Biochemical assays revealed inhibition of complex III activity in BITC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells as early as at 1 h of treatment. The BITC treatment caused activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which function upstream of Bax activation in apoptotic response to various stimuli. Pharmacological inhibition of both JNK and p38 MAPK conferred partial yet significant protection against BITC-induced apoptosis. Activation of JNK and p38 MAPK resulting from BITC exposure was abolished by overexpression of catalase. The BITC-mediated conformational change of Bax was markedly suppressed by ectopic expression of catalytically inactive mutant of JNK kinase 2 (JNKK2(AA)). Interestingly, a normal human mammary epithelial cell line was resistant to BITC-mediated ROS generation, JNK/p38 MAPK activation, and apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the BITC-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells is initiated by mitochondria-derived ROS.

Thus, identification of novel agents that are relatively safe but can suppress growth of both ER-positive and ER-negative human breast cancers is highly desirable. Epidemiological studies continue to support the premise that dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may lower the risk of various types of malignancies, including breast cancer (11Cohen J.H.

The anticarcinogenic effect of cruciferous vegetables is attributed to organic isothiocyanates (ITCs), which are generated upon processing of these vegetables due to hydrolysis of the corresponding glucosinolates through catalytic mediation of myrosinase (15Hecht S.S.

Elucidation of the mechanism of cellular responses to BITC (cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction) has been the topic of intense research in the past several years. For example, the BITC-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells correlated with phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (24Miyoshi N. Uchida K. Osawa T. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The cell death caused by BITC in the 1483 human head and neck cancer cell line was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (23Lui V.W. Wentzel A.L. Xiao D. Lew K.L. Singh S.V. Grandis J.R. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that BITC treatment causes suppression of nuclear factor-κB activation in human pancreatic cancer cells (25Srivastava S.K. Singh S.V.

Despite these advances, however, the mechanism by which BITC treatment triggers apoptosis in cancer cells is not fully understood. For example, the signaling intermediates responsible for the initiation of BITC-mediated apoptosis remain to be identified. We have shown previously that BITC treatment causes caspase-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in association with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (27Xiao D. Vogel V. Singh S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2931-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of ROS in BITC-mediated cell death is unclear. Likewise, the mechanism by which BITC treatment causes ROS generation remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that BITC treatment inhibits complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) in breast cancer cells to trigger generation of ROS, which function upstream of JNK and p38 MAPK activation and mitochondrial translocation (activation) of Bax in BITC-induced apoptosis.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with Me2SO or 2.5 μm BITC for specified time periods. The cells were collected and processed for the desired assays. Immunoblotting—The cells were treated with BITC as described above, and both floating and attached cells were collected. The cells were lysed as described by us previously (28Xiao D. Srivastava S.K. Lew K.L. Zeng Y. Hershberger P. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The mitochondria-free cytosolic fraction for immunoblotting of cytochrome c was prepared as described by us previously (29Choi S. Lew K.L. Xiao H. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Xiao D. Brown C.K. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2007; 28: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from control and BITC-treated cells for immunoblotting of Bax and cytochrome c were prepared using a kit from BioVision (Mountain View, CA), as recommended by the manufacturer. The lysate proteins were resolved by 6–12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as described by us previously (28Xiao D. Srivastava S.K. Lew K.L. Zeng Y. Hershberger P. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 29Choi S. Lew K.L. Xiao H. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Xiao D. Brown C.K. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2007; 28: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody to correct for differences in protein loading. Change in protein level was determined by densitometric scanning of the immunoreactive band and corrected for actin loading control. Immunoblotting for each protein was performed at least twice using independently prepared lysates to ensure reproducibility of the results. ROS Generation Assay—Intracellular ROS generation was measured by flow cytometry following staining with hydroethidine and H2DCFDA essentially as described by us previously (27Xiao D. Vogel V. Singh S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2931-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm culture dishes, allowed to attach by overnight incubation, and exposed to Me2SO (control) or the desired concentration of BITC for the specified time intervals. The cells were stained with 2 μm hydroethidine and 5 μm H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected, and the fluorescence was measured using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for specified time periods with rotenone (0.4 μm) or DPI (10 μm) prior to BITC exposure and analysis of ROS generation. Determination of Apoptosis—Apoptosis induction by BITC was assessed by analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation, which has emerged as a highly sensitive and reliable technique for quantitation of apoptotic cell death. The cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation was determined as described by us previously (27Xiao D. Vogel V. Singh S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2931-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with rotenone (0.4 μm) or DPI (10 μm) prior to BITC treatment and analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. Determination of Caspase-3 Activation—Activation of caspase-3 was determined by flow cytometry using a kit from Cell Signaling Technology. Briefly, the cells (3 × 105) were plated in T25 flasks and allowed to attach by overnight incubation. The cells were then treated with Me2SO (control) or the desired concentrations of BITC for the specified time periods. Subsequently, the cells were collected by trypsinization and processed for flow cytometric analysis of caspase-3 activation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Rho-0 Variant of MDA-MB-231 Cells—The Rho-0 variant of MDA-MB-231 cells was generated and maintained as described previously by King and Attadi (30King M.P. Attadi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 313-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cells were cultured in complete medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm uridine, and 2.5 μm ethidium bromide for more than 20 passages over a period of 7 weeks. Cells cultured in parallel in medium without ethidium bromide were used as controls (wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized, and used for different experiments. Immunocytochemical Analysis for COXIV and Bax—Wild-type and Rho-0 variant of MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 105) were cultured on coverslips and treated with 2.5 μm BITC or Me2SO (control) for specified time periods. Cells were treated with 200 nm MitoTracker red at 37 °C for 30 min to stain mitochondria. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with anti-Bax or anti-COXIV antibody overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and stained with DAPI (10 ng/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS and examined under a Leica fluorescence microscope at ×40 objective lens magnification. Analysis of Bax Conformation Change—The cells were treated with 2.5 μm BITC or Me2SO (control) for the specified time interval and lysed using a solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture. Aliquots containing 300 μg of lysate protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody. Protein G-agarose beads (50 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added to each sample, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and subjected to electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-Bax antibody. Measurement of MRC Enzyme Activities—Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 in 100-mm culture dishes, allowed to attach overnight, and treated with Me2SO or the desired concentrations of BITC for specified time periods. Cells were then harvested by scraping, washed with PBS, and lysed. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent. The activity of complex I-linked NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase was determined by measuring the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol, which leads to decreased absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μm ubiquinone to the reaction mixture containing 100 μg of lysate protein, 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NADH, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm KCN at 30 °C. The reaction was monitored for 5 min, and then 10 μm rotenone was added, and the reaction rate was followed for an additional 5 min. The activity of complex I was calculated using the rotenone-sensitive rate and expressed as nmol/min/mg protein. Complex II-linked succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity was determined by measuring the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, leading to formation of ubiquinol, which can be monitored at 600 nm. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ubiquinone Q2 to the reaction mixture containing 100 μg of lysate protein, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mm sodium succinate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 74 μm dichlorophenolindophenol, 1 mm KCN, and 10 μm rotenone and followed for 5 min at 30 °C. 2-Thenoytrifluoroacetone was then added to inhibit the complex II activity. The complex II activity was calculated using the 2-thenoytrifluoroacetone-sensitive rate. Complex III-linked ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase activity was determined by monitoring reduction of cytochrome c by the electrons donated from ubiquinol, which can be monitored at 550 nm. This is a first order enzymatic reaction, which is dependent on the concentrations of both ubiquinol and cytochrome c. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ubiquinol (substrate) to the reaction mixture containing 100 μg of protein lysate, 35 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCN, 5 μm rotenone, and 15 μm cytochrome c. The absorbance of cytochrome c was followed at 550 nm for 5 min at 30 °C. The complex III activity was calculated using the pseudo-first order constant, and the results are presented as K/min/mg of protein. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using a potential-sensitive dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (31Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). A stock solution of JC-1 (1 mg/ml) was prepared in Me2SO and freshly diluted with the assay buffer. Briefly, cells (2 × 105) were plated in T25 flasks, allowed to attach by overnight incubation, exposed to the desired concentrations of BITC for the specified time periods, and collected by trypsinization. The cells were incubated with medium containing JC-1 (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed, resuspended in 0.5 ml of assay buffer, and analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL Flow Cytometer. Mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (25 μm) was used as a positive control. Genetic Suppression of JNK in MDA-MB-231 Cells—The MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding the catalytically inactive mutant of JNK kinase 2 (JNKK2(AA)) (32Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA), or empty pcDNA3.1 vector as described by us previously (33Antosiewicz J. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Marynowski S.W. Singh S.V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5379-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with Me2SO (control) or 2.5 μm BITC for the specified time periods and processed for analysis of DNA fragmentation, immunoblotting for phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun or conformational change of Bax. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance of difference in measured variables between control and treated groups was determined by t test or one-way ANOVA. Difference was considered significant at p < 0.05. BITC-induced Apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 Cells Was Inhibited by Ectopic Expression of Catalase—We have shown previously that BITC treatment causes apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 (an estrogen-independent cell line) and MCF-7 (an estrogen-responsive cell line) human breast cancer cell lines in association with ROS generation (27Xiao D. Vogel V. Singh S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2931-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We also found that the BITC-induced apoptosis in both cell lines is significantly inhibited by pretreatment with a combined mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase (27Xiao D. Vogel V. Singh S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2931-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although these results suggested that ROS might be critical signaling intermediates in BITC-mediated apoptosis, caution must be exercised in interpretation of results using small molecules due to the possibility of an off-target effect(s). To rule out this possibility, we determined the effect of ectopic expression of antioxidative enzyme catalase on ROS generation and apoptosis induction by BITC. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the level of catalase protein was >6-fold higher in MDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector encoding catalase compared with cells transfected with the empty vector. In addition, BITC treatment (2.5 μm, 24 h) did not have any appreciable effect on levels of endogenous (empty vector-transfected cells) or overexpressed catalase protein (Fig. 1A). Similar to untransfected cells (27Xiao D. Vogel V. Singh S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2931-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the BITC-mediated oxidation of H2DCFDA to fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), a measure of ROS generation (34Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 35Narayanan P.K. Goodwin E.H. Lehnert B.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3963-3971PubMed Google Scholar), was observed in empty vector-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, overexpression of catalase conferred complete protection against BITC-mediated oxidation of H2DCFDA to DCF in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment of empty vector-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with 2.5 μm BITC for 24 h resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation compared with Me2SO-treated control cells (Fig. 1C). The extent of BITC-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation was significantly lower in catalase-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these results, the BITC-mediated cleavage of procaspase-3 was markedly h"
https://openalex.org/W2120269615,"The energy-level structure of a quantum system, which has a fundamental role in its behaviour, can be observed as discrete lines and features in absorption and emission spectra. Conventionally, spectra are measured using frequency spectroscopy, whereby the frequency of a harmonic electromagnetic driving field is tuned into resonance with a particular separation between energy levels. Although this technique has been successfully employed in a variety of physical systems, including natural and artificial atoms and molecules, its application is not universally straightforward and becomes extremely challenging for frequencies in the range of tens to hundreds of gigahertz. Here we introduce a complementary approach, amplitude spectroscopy, whereby a harmonic driving field sweeps an artificial atom through the avoided crossings between energy levels at a fixed frequency. Spectroscopic information is obtained from the amplitude dependence of the system’s response, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of a broadband-frequency-based approach. The resulting ‘spectroscopy diamonds’, the regions in parameter space where transitions between specific pairs of levels can occur, exhibit interference patterns and population inversion that serve to distinguish the atom’s spectrum. Amplitude spectroscopy provides a means of manipulating and characterizing systems over an extremely broad bandwidth, using only a single driving frequency that may be orders of magnitude smaller than the energy scales being probed. Spectral lines of atoms have historically been observed to reveal the discrete energy levels of basic matter. The technique involves sweeping the incoming radiation for the clear absorption lines that appear when a frequency matches the separation between two energy levels. From the 1990s, artificial atoms (quantum systems with atom-like energy structure) have also been studied using frequency spectroscopy, using coherent microwave radiation sources. However, much information about the energy level spectrum remains hidden, as the technique is impractical for high frequencies. Berns et al. have developed a complementary technique in which the energy level of an artificial atom is not scanned by tuning frequency, but by the amplitude of the radiation while the frequency is tuned to a specific feature in the spectrum. A wealth of new spectral information becomes visible with this technique which is generally applicable to a range of artificial and natural atoms. Artificial atoms, quantum systems with atom-like energy structure, have been studied with frequency spectroscopic techniques. However, much information about the energy level spectrum has been hidden, as the technique is impractical for high frequencies. A complementary technique has been developed where the energy level of an artificial atom is not scanned by tuning frequency, but amplitude of the radiation, while the frequency is tuned to a specific feature in the spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2153492790,"Background The presence of measles virus (MV) RNA in bowel tissue from children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances was reported in 1998. Subsequent investigations found no associations between MV exposure and ASD but did not test for the presence of MV RNA in bowel or focus on children with ASD and GI disturbances. Failure to replicate the original study design may contribute to continued public concern with respect to the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Methodology/Principal Findings The objective of this case-control study was to determine whether children with GI disturbances and autism are more likely than children with GI disturbances alone to have MV RNA and/or inflammation in bowel tissues and if autism and/or GI episode onset relate temporally to receipt of MMR. The sample was an age-matched group of US children undergoing clinically-indicated ileocolonoscopy. Ileal and cecal tissues from 25 children with autism and GI disturbances and 13 children with GI disturbances alone (controls) were evaluated by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for presence of MV RNA in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis, including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between MV and ASD were reported. The temporal order of onset of GI episodes and autism relative to timing of MMR administration was examined. We found no differences between case and control groups in the presence of MV RNA in ileum and cecum. Results were consistent across the three laboratory sites. GI symptom and autism onset were unrelated to MMR timing. Eighty-eight percent of ASD cases had behavioral regression. Conclusions/Significance This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2141369175,"Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disease with a huge cost to human lives. The impact of the disease is also a growing concern for the governments of developing countries, in particular due to the increasingly high number of elderly citizens at risk. Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, a common term for memory loss and other cognitive impairments. There is no current cure for AD, but there are drug and non-drug based approaches for its treatment. In general the drug-treatments are directed at slowing the progression of symptoms. They have proved to be effective in a large group of patients but success is directly correlated with identifying the disease carriers at its early stages. This justifies the need for timely and accurate forms of diagnosis via molecular means. We report here a 5-protein biomarker molecular signature that achieves, on average, a 96% total accuracy in predicting clinical AD. The signature is composed of the abundances of IL-1α, IL-3, EGF, TNF-α and G-CSF. Methodology/Principal Findings Our results are based on a recent molecular dataset that has attracted worldwide attention. Our paper illustrates that improved results can be obtained with the abundance of only five proteins. Our methodology consisted of the application of an integrative data analysis method. This four step process included: a) abundance quantization, b) feature selection, c) literature analysis, d) selection of a classifier algorithm which is independent of the feature selection process. These steps were performed without using any sample of the test datasets. For the first two steps, we used the application of Fayyad and Irani's discretization algorithm for selection and quantization, which in turn creates an instance of the (alpha-beta)-k-Feature Set problem; a numerical solution of this problem led to the selection of only 10 proteins. Conclusions/Significance the previous study has provided an extremely useful dataset for the identification of AD biomarkers. However, our subsequent analysis also revealed several important facts worth reporting: 1. A 5-protein signature (which is a subset of the 18-protein signature of Ray et al.) has the same overall performance (when using the same classifier). 2. Using more than 20 different classifiers available in the widely-used Weka software package, our 5-protein signature has, on average, a smaller prediction error indicating the independence of the classifier and the robustness of this set of biomarkers (i.e. 96% accuracy when predicting AD against non-demented control). 3. Using very simple classifiers, like Simple Logistic or Logistic Model Trees, we have achieved the following results on 92 samples: 100 percent success to predict Alzheimer's Disease and 92 percent to predict Non Demented Control on the AD dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2124329191,"Background Gene duplication is the primary force of new gene evolution. Deciphering whether a pair of duplicated genes has evolved divergent functions is often challenging. The zebrafish is uniquely positioned to provide insight into the process of functional gene evolution due to its amenability to genetic and experimental manipulation and because it possess a large number of duplicated genes. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the identification and characterization of two hypoxia-inducible genes in zebrafish that are co-ortholgs of human IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). IGFBP-1 is a secreted protein that binds to IGF and modulates IGF actions in somatic growth, development, and aging. Like their human and mouse counterparts, in adult zebrafish igfbp-1a and igfbp-1b are exclusively expressed in the liver. During embryogenesis, the two genes are expressed in overlapping spatial domains but with distinct temporal patterns. While zebrafish IGFBP-1a mRNA was easily detected throughout embryogenesis, IGFBP-1b mRNA was detectable only in advanced stages. Hypoxia induces igfbp-1a expression in early embryogenesis, but induces the igfbp-1b expression later in embryogenesis. Both IGFBP-1a and -b are capable of IGF binding, but IGFBP-1b has much lower affinities for IGF-I and -II because of greater dissociation rates. Overexpression of IGFBP-1a and -1b in zebrafish embryos caused significant decreases in growth and developmental rates. When tested in cultured zebrafish embryonic cells, IGFBP-1a and -1b both inhibited IGF-1-induced cell proliferation but the activity of IGFBP-1b was significantly weaker. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate subfunction partitioning of the duplicated IGFBP-1 genes at the levels of gene expression, physiological regulation, protein structure, and biological actions. The duplicated IGFBP-1 may provide additional flexibility in fine-tuning IGF signaling activities under hypoxia and other catabolic conditions."

Application of the MEROPS classification to a comprehensive set of genomes yields a simple pattern of peptidase distribution and provides insight into the organization of proteolysis in all forms of life. Unexpectedly, a near ubiquitous core set of peptidases is shown to contain more types than those unique to higher multicellular organisms. From this core group, an array of eukaryote-specific peptidases evolved to yield well known intracellular and extracellular processes.

These findings provide a framework for deeper investigation into the evolutionary forces that shaped each peptidase family and a roadmap to develop a timeline for their expansion as an interconnected system. Proteolysis is a requirement for life. Some peptidases recycle polypeptides into their constitutive amino acids, whereas others catalyze selective polypeptide cleavage for post-translational modification. Approximately 700 peptidases are present in the human genome, collectively termed the degradome (1Lopez-Otin C. Overall C.M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 509-519Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar), mediating diverse processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling, immunity, development, protein processing, cell signaling, and apoptosis (2Puente X.S. Sanchez L.M. Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The MEROPS data base classifies peptidases into clans based on structural similarity or sequence features suggesting such homology (3Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 4Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Families divide clans by common ancestry. Subfamilies have common structure yet unclear ancestry. Individual peptidases are termed species. For example, clan PA peptidases contain eight families each bearing a classical two β-barrel architecture observed in chymotrypsin with either cysteine or serine acting as catalytic nucleophile (5Page M.J. Di Cera E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The blood clotting peptidase thrombin (6Di Cera E. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 203-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) is one species in the large S1A family of clan PA (7Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Classification provides context to decipher peptidase function in the natural world. Different classes of peptidases associate with vital biological pathways. Metallopeptidases dictate structural composition surrounding cells in multicellular organisms (8Mott J.D. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Cysteine peptidases mediate regulated cell death (9Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar). Serine peptidases enable our immune response (10Beutler B. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Threonine peptidases function as the central conduit for protein recycling in many organisms (11Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). Aspartic peptidases broker viral infection (12Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4686-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). However, each of these examples is a small subset within each catalytic type. To clarify peptidase diversity, we apply the MEROPS classification on a comprehensive set of genomes to visualize, compare, and contrast the proteolytic underpinnings of the biosphere. From this analysis, a map of peptidase distribution is drawn to provide a framework for decoding function, architecture, and evolution of proteolysis in vivo. Remarkably, a simple pattern is shown to underlie limited proteolysis in all forms of life. Annotated protein sequences from whole genome sequence data were obtained from public ftp servers of the NCBI, DOE JGI, and select genome project homepages on the worldwide web. ClustalW was used to prepare sequence alignments from peptidase domains obtained from the MEROPS data base (3Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J.

Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar) was used to build hidden Markov models (HMM) 2The abbreviation used is: HMM, hidden Markov models. from the ClustalW prepared alignments and used to search protein sequence data using default cutoff values. HMMs were constructed for 154 peptidase families. Families were excluded from the census if they contained only a few sequences, typically less than 20, or if from viral origin. All of the data in the MEROPS data base were queried with each peptidase HMM and returned greater than 80% data base coverage indicating utility of the models (supplemental Fig. S1). An iterated search was applied on 128 genomes from all three kingdoms of life. The complete list of genomes examined, their taxonomy, and peptidase estimates are provided in supplemental Table S1. The HMMs applied capture peptidase diversity in the biosphere, yet the numbers of peptidases noted in each organism are only an estimate. Results were parsed with BioPerl (15Stajich J.E. Block D.

HMMs were constructed for 154 peptidase families using the HMMER software package to probe 128 eukaryotic, eubacterial, and archaeal genomes. Results are provided in supplementary Table S1. Genomes examined represent every order of organism for which complete genome sequence data are available. Due to the tremendous diversity of peptidase families the resulting census captures trends in degradome composition and is not an exact measure. Variation in polypeptide sequence, distant phylogenetic relationships, gene loss, horizontal gene transfer, inactive peptidase sequences, and quality of the genome annotation makes precise assignment difficult (19Doolittle R.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence, the tabulated numbers are only approximates of the true diversity. The HMMs distill over two million protein sequences into more than 38,000 peptidases. Plotting number of each peptidase family estimated in each genome reveals the landscape of degradome composition in known forms of cellular life (Fig. 1). Select peptidase families underwent significant expansion in copy number per genome and of these the S1A family of trypsins is most prevalent. A landscape of genome-wide peptidase diversity is visualized from the census that enables a framework for understanding limited proteolysis in vivo. Serine peptidases are the most abundant class in the dataset followed by metalloproteases. Typically 100 peptidases are found in genomes of bacteria. In contrast, archaeal genomes present half that many. Explosive growth in multiple peptidase families is evident in eukaryotic organisms and the difference in degradome composition between eubacteria and eukarya is striking. Considerable work remains to detail how changes in polypeptide sequence associate with the functional gains in each of these families and further refine accuracy of the census. To derive a concise picture of peptidase diversity, we reduced dimensionality of the data. Peptidase census results were converted into a binary matrix obviating the need for weighting functions and other advanced statistical measures. Clustering peptidase families from the binary dataset by the organisms that contain them greatly clarifies peptidase diversity (Fig. 2). The clustering algorithm, commonly applied to microarray data, segregates organisms into the three kingdoms of life and trends with accepted classification yet is entirely based upon degradome content (20Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar, 21Cavalier-Smith T. Intl. J. Syst. Evolut. Microbiol. 2002; 52: 297-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 22Doolittle W.F. Science. 1999; 284: 2124-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Despite presenting few peptidases in their genome, the archaea group is distinctively apart from the eubacteria. Inclusion of multiple genomes from parasitic organisms within the dataset complicates phylogenetic inference from the dataset due to significant gene loss (23Yang S. Doolittle R.F. Bourne P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Ochman H. Moran N.A. Science. 2001; 292: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a clear pattern of peptidase distribution emerges accounting for all of the HMMs examined and nearly 90% of the families in the MEROPS data base of which 10% are viral peptidases not examined in this study. A nearly ubiquitous core of 16 peptidase families encompasses proteolytic requirements of cellular life in a modern environment (Table 1). Given extensive distribution it is unlikely gene transfer between organisms explains this observation. Highly conserved peptidase families play central metabolic and protein processing roles such folate and glutathione metabolism, de novo purine biosynthesis, and signal peptide processing (25Yao R. Schneider E. Ryan T.J. Galivan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10134-10138Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol.

Importance of intracellular protein homeostasis is evident by the presence of nine families with known digestive function (29Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Rhomboid and FtsH peptidases cleave substrates on or in a phospholipid bilayer and are highly conserved (30Urban S. Lee J.R. Freeman M. Cell. 2001; 107: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 31Karata K. Inagawa T. Wilkinson A.J. Tatsuta T. Ogura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26225-26232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The prolyl aminopeptidase family is associated with a variety of other chemistries outside of proteolysis including epoxide hydrolase and monoglyceride lipase activities (32Holmquist M. Curr. Protein Peptide Sci. 2000; 1: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The M22 family bear homology with the DNAK/Hsp70 family of chaperones (33Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Hence, the 16 near ubiquitous families need not have been active peptidases at their origin nor throughout the dataset. The basal degradome was expanded upon through gains in intra- and extracellular peptidase activity.TABLE 1The nearly ubiquitous core of peptidase families Sixteen peptidase families can be identified in the genomes of all forms of cellular life. The known functions of these peptidases appear to encompass all the requirements for complex proteolysis capable of digestion and protein processing. Several organisms have lost one or more of these peptidase families.FamilyClanCommon nameBiological functionC26PCγ-Glutamyl hydrolaseFolate metabolismC44PBAmidophosphoribosyltransferaseAdenosine biosynthesisM1MAAminopeptidase NProtein turnoverM16BMEPitrilysinSignal peptide processingM20AMHGlutamate carboxypeptidaseProtein turnoverM22MKHsp70/DnaK homologChaperoneM24AMGMethionyl aminopeptidaseProtein turnoverM24BMGAminopeptidase PProtein turnoverM41MAFtsH peptidaseMembrane protein processingS14SKClp peptidaseProtein turnoverS16SJLonA peptidaseProtein turnoverS1BPAHtrA peptidaseProtein turnoverS33SCProlyl aminopeptidaseTurnover and epoxide hydrolaseS54STRhomboidMembrane protein processingS8ASCSubtilisinProtein turnoverT3PBγ-GlutamyltranferaseGlutathione metabolism Open table in a new tab Intracellular peptidase inventions in eukaryotic organisms bring about four major cellular advances in eukaryotes (Table 2). First, ubiquitin- and SUMO-mediated protein turnover emerged through invention of six peptidase families (34Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The autophagins are also critical for autophagy, a cellular process requiring a complex cytoskeleton. Second, calpains are both unique to eukarya and to known peptidases for their dependence upon Ca2+ for activity (35Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Calpains are largely cytosolic and critical for cytoskeletal reorganization, endosome recycling, and membrane fusion (36Evans J.S. Turner M.D. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Third, two peptidase families are involved in structure and cell division in the nucleus. Separases divides sister chromatids during mitosis or meiosis through cleavage of cohesions and nucleoporins form an integral component of the pore separating the nucleus from the cytoplasm (37Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 38Liu Z. Makaroff C.A. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Last, M76 peptidases are required for processing of mitochondrial proteins including respiratory chain complexes (39Osman C. Wilmes C. Tatsuta T. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). On the basis of these intracellular advances, extracellular proteolysis expanded with the emergence of multicellularity.TABLE 2Eukaryotic peptidase families Thirty-four peptidase families are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms playing numerous roles in intra- and extracellular biology. The six families of peptidases involved in ubiquitin- and SUMO-mediated protein turnover are most notable given their vital role in protein homeostasis.FamilyClanCommon nameBiological functionA1AAAPepsinProtein turnover and processingA22AADPresenillin peptidaseCell signallingA22BADIMPASProtein processingC12CAUbiquitin C-terminal hydrolaseProtein turnoverC13CDLegumainProtein processingC14BCDMetacaspaseProtein processingC15CFPyroglutamyl-peptidaseBioactive peptide processingC19CAUbiquitin-specific peptidaseProtein turnoverC1ACAPapainProtein turnover and processingC1BCABleomycin hydrolaseProtein processingC48CESENP peptidaseProtein turnoverC50CDSeparaseCell divisionC54CAAutophaginAutophagyC65CAOtubainProtein turnoverC78CAUbiquitin-fold modifier peptidaseProtein turnoverM10AMAMatrix metallopeptidaseExtracellular matrix remodelingM14AMCCarboxypeptidase A1Protein turnover and processingM14BMCCarboxypeptidase EProtein turnover and processingM16AMEPitrilysinProtein processingM16CMEMitochondrial processing peptidaseProtein processingM18MHAminopeptidase 1Protein turnoverM49M-Dipeptidyl-peptidase IIIProtein turnoverM67AMPPoh1 peptidaseProtein turnoverM67CMPAMSH deubiquitinating peptidaseProtein turnoverM76M-Atp23 peptidaseProtein processingM8MALeishmanolysinProtein processingS10SCCarboxypeptidase YProtein processingS26BSFSignalaseProtein processingS28SCPro-Xaa carboxypeptidaseProtein processingS59SPNucleoporinNuclear pore formationS8BSBSubtilisinProtein turnoverS9BSCDipeptidyl-peptidase IVProtein processingS9DSCDipeptidyl-peptidase VProtein processingT1APBProteasome catalytic subunitProtein turnover Open table in a new tab A number of peptidase families involved in extracellular biology evolved in eukarya to broker key regulatory processes and set the stage for further expansion (Table 2). Invention of novel selectivity mechanisms fostered gains in the complexity of extracellular biology. Selectivity advances include the removal of a single basic amino acid from the C terminus of a substrate (M14B family) (40Reznik S.E. Fricker L.D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), cleavage of substrates following a penultimate proline residue (S28 family) (41Leiting B. Pryor K.D. Wu J.K. Marsilio F. Patel R.A. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Cummings R.T. Thornberry N.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 525-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and steric hindrance to a dipeptidyl peptidase-selective active site by an associated protein domain (S9B family) (42Rea D. Fulop V. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 44: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The unusual selectivity of these novel peptidases promoted expansion of cellular communication through processing small bioactive peptides. Of eukaryotic inventions only a handful are specific to higher metazoa. Remarkably, only 10 peptidase families are restricted to the presence in non-yeast metazoa implying late evolutionary discovery (Table 3). Of these, the C14A caspases are notable for their central role in apoptosis (43Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). The C14 family is the clearest example of phylogenetic distinction in a peptidase clan. Peptidases in the C14A subfamily are found in eukaryotes, whereas C14B peptidases are not. Therefore an ancestral C14B peptidase is the root of all C14A peptidases. Two additions to the ubiquitin-dependent protein recycling machinery are present in higher organisms, the Cezanne deubiquitinylating peptidases and CylD protein (44Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 45Evans P.C. Smith T.S. Lai M.J. Williams M.G. Burke D.F. Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. Blundell T.L. Kilshaw P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23180-23186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Diversity of function is embodied by the M12A family of astacins, which act in processes ranging from hormonal control to extracellular matrix remodeling (46Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Early association with a disintegrin domain propelled massive and rapid expansion of adamalysins to shape extracellular matrix composition and other signaling functions (47Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar). Of late emerging peptidases, pappalysins are noteworthy given the origin of the name of this family, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (48Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The small number of peptidase inventions by animals is mirrored in plants and yeasts. Only the A1B and M11 peptidase families appear limited to plants, whereas seven families are unique to yeasts. Together, these observations suggest the conserved degradome among eukaryotes required few gains to enable complex multicellularity.TABLE 3Peptidase inventions in non-yeast metazoa Ten peptidase families are unique to higher organisms. Each peptidase family has been shown to play a role in key, and largely, extracellular processes. The most notable exception are the caspases, the executioners of cell death. Both the M12A and M12B peptidase families have diverse functions and underwent rapid expansion in higher metazoa.FamilyClanCommon nameBiological functionC14ACDCaspaseApoptosisC46CHHedgehogDevelopmentC64CACezanne peptidaseProtein turnoverC67CACylD proteinProtein turnoverM12AMAAstacinExtracellular biologyM12BMAAdamalysinExtracellular biologyM2MAAngiotensin-converting enzymeBioactive peptide processingM43BMAPappalysinBioactive peptide processingM50AMMS2P peptidaseSignal peptide processingS60SRLactoferrinIron metabolism Open table in a new tab Although most peptidase families can be grouped through organism-level description, several cannot due to sporadic distribution, poor identification by the HMMs applied, and rare occurrence. In certain instances, the MEROPS classification may require adjustment. For example, several larger peptidase clans with many families are likely distantly related. The common ancestor of these families lived over a billion years ago whose traces have been obliterated by the passage of time (49Feng D.F. Cho G. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Hence, phylogenetic reconstruction is challenging and demands both additional sequence information and close attention to reconcile convergent from divergent evolution. It is reasonable that the majority of peptidase families arise from divergent evolution as both the structure and enzymatic mechanism is conserved. For example, the M16 family contains three subfamilies with structural homology and weak sequence similarity (50Shen Y. Joachimiak A. Rosner M.R. Tang W.J. Nature. 2006; 443: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 51Taylor A.B. Smith B.S. Kitada S. Kojima K. Miyaura H. Otwinowski Z. Ito A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2001; 9: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 52Johnson K.A. Bhushan S. Stahl A. Hallberg B.M. Frohn A. Glaser E. Eneqvist T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When combined with organism-level distribution, M16B predates both M16C and M16A and is the ancestral family. Such a simple pattern is not readily discerned with most peptidase families. Of these, the S1A peptidases have contentious origin despite widespread abundance. Peptidase families with mixed distribution are spread throughout the clustered data. Dispersal of these 32 peptidase families result from the diversity of both peptidases and genomes examined, gene transfer between organisms, and misidentification. Both free-living and parasitic lifestyles are also encompassed by the dataset and further complicate interpretation of the results. Of mixed peptidase families, the tricorn peptidase, C-terminal processing peptidase, and HslV component of the HslUV peptidase are notable given their importance toward intracellular protein homeostasis yet overlapping and redundant functionality (53Wu W.F. Zhou Y. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Two abundant peptidases in higher organisms, the S1A family of trypsins and S9A prolyl oligopeptidases also show a widely dispersed pattern. These peptidase families require further attention to address the interplay between gene transfer and loss. Analysis of peptidase diversity spanning the complete biosphere introduces limitations on the results. HMMs used are derived from MEROPS annotation that return 80% coverage of the data base (supplemental Fig. S1). Usage of protein not the nucleotide sequence data continues bias of the genome annotation and quality of the underlying sequence data (55Devos D. Valencia A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 429-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pseudogenes are not considered. Due to the broad nature of the HMMs applied, some peptidases identified may be non-peptidase homologs, particularly in the S33 family. Hence, the total numbers of peptidases counted are useful estimates that differ from previous studies (56Puente X.S. Sanchez L.M. Gutierrez-Fernandez A. Velasco G. Lopez-Otin C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 57Puente X.S. Gutierrez-Fernandez A. Ordonez G.R. Hillier L.W. Lopez-Otin C. Genomics. 2005; 86: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 58Lopez-Otin, C., and Bond, J. S. (July 23, 2008) J. Biol. Chem., DOI 10.1074/jbc.R800035200Google Scholar). These issues encourage revisions to the framework. Despite these limitations, clear trends emerge in the evolution of peptidase diversity. Identification of a near ubiquitous core of peptidase families provides a working definition of a basal degradome and a starting point to appreciate evolutionary expansion of proteolytic networks. Near ubiquitous peptidase families do not increase the copy number per genome over time and do not expand into different functional niches. Non-expanding, highly conserved peptidase families broker intracellular processes and absence in certain organisms suggests they can be replaced. Therefore, although the core set of peptidases fulfill vital roles they are neither malleable to the forces of molecular evolution nor location independent. Such observations are all the more remarkable given exposure to billions of years of natural selection. Degradome expansion demanded novel mechanisms of limited proteolysis particularly in extracellular environments. Eukaryotes met this requirement through a variety of protein innovations yet a surprising paucity of these novel families is unique to higher metazoa. Limited peptidase inventions in higher organisms suggest network organization, refining properties of select peptidases and enhanced spatial and temporal regulation were sufficient to generate the wide diversity of proteolysis in life. Trypsins, the S1A family, are the most abundant member in the human degradome, such as those of all non-yeast metazoa and many lower eukaryotes. Emergence of the S1A peptidase family predates major speciation events in multicellular eukaryotes, yet the origin of this family remains unclear as with several other peptidase families due to mixed distribution. Visualization of degradome diversity provides a roadmap to develop a timeline for the evolution of proteolysis at the systems level. Download .zip (.13 MB) Help with zip files"

https://openalex.org/W2009817296,"The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from adult somatic cells by ectopic expression of key transcription factors holds significant medical promise. However, current techniques for inducing pluripotency rely on viral infection and are therefore not, at present, viable within a clinical setting. Thus, there is now a need to better understand the molecular basis of stem cell pluripotency and lineage specification in order to investigate alternative methods to induce pluripotency for clinical application. However, the complexity of the underlying molecular circuitry makes this a conceptually difficult task. In order to address these issues, we considered a computational model of transcriptional control of cell fate specification. The model comprises two mutually interacting sub-circuits: a central pluripotency circuit consisting of interactions between stem-cell specific transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG coupled to a differentiation circuit consisting of interactions between lineage-specifying master genes.The molecular switches which arise from feedback loops within these circuits give rise to a well-defined sequence of successive gene restrictions corresponding to a controlled differentiation cascade in response to environmental stimuli. Furthermore, we found that this differentiation cascade is strongly unidirectional: once silenced, core transcription factors cannot easily be reactivated. In the context of induced pluripotency, this indicates that differentiated cells are robustly resistant to reprogramming to a more primitive state. However, our model suggests that under certain circumstances, amplification of low-level fluctuations in transcriptional status (transcriptional ""noise"") may be sufficient to trigger reactivation of the core pluripotency switch and reprogramming to a pluripotent state. This interpretation offers an explanation of a number of experimental observations concerning the molecular mechanisms of cellular reprogramming by defined factors and suggests a role for stochasticity in reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2044698222,"Transcription is controlled by cis regulatory elements, which if localized downstream to the transcriptional start site (TSS), in the 5'UTR, could influence translation as well. However presently there is little evidence for such composite regulatory elements. We have identified by computational analysis an abundant element located downstream to the TSS up to position +30, which controls both transcription and translation. This element has an invariable ATG sequence, which serves as the translation initiation codon in 64% of the genes bearing it. In these genes the initiating AUG is preceded by an extremely short 5'UTR. We show that translation in vitro and in vivo is initiated exclusively from the AUG of this motif, and that the AUG flanking sequences create a strong translation initiation context. This motif is distinguished from the well-known Kozak in its unique ability to direct efficient and accurate translation initiation from mRNAs with a very short 5'UTR. We therefore named it TISU for Translation Initiator of Short 5'UTR. Interestingly, this translation initiation element is also an essential transcription regulatory element of Yin Yang 1. Our characterization of a common transcription and translation element points to a link between mammalian transcription and translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2012675392,"Acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is one of the four intestinal membrane bound acyltransferases implicated in dietary fat absorption. Recently, it was found that, in addition to acylating diacylglycerol (DAG), DGAT1 also possesses robust enzymatic activity for acylating monoacylglycerol (MAG) (Yen, C. L., Monetti, M., Burri, B. J., and Farese, R. V., Jr. (2005) J. Lipid Res. 46, 1502-1511). In the current paper, we have conducted a detailed characterization of this reaction in test tube, intact cell culture, and animal models. Enzymatically, we found that triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis from MAG by DGAT1 does not behave according to classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At low concentrations of 2-MAG (<50 microm), the major acylation product by DGAT1 was TAG; however, increased concentrations of 2-MAG (50-200 microm) resulted in decreased TAG formation. This unique product/substrate relationship is similar to MGAT3 but distinct from DGAT2 and MGAT2. We have also found that XP620 is an inhibitor that selectively inhibits the acylation of MAG by DGAT1 (IC(50) of human DGAT1: 16.6+/-4.0 nM (MAG as substrate) and 1499+/-318 nM (DAG as substrate); IC(50) values of human DGAT2, MGAT2, and MGAT3 are >30,000 nM). Using this pharmacological tool, we have shown that approximately 76 and approximately 89% of the in vitro TAG synthesis initiated from MAG is mediated by DGAT1 in Caco-2 cell and rat intestinal mucosal membranes, respectively. When applied to intact cultured cells, XP620 substantially decreased but did not abolish apoB secretion in differentiated Caco-2 cells. It also decreased TAG and DAG syntheses in primary enterocytes. Last, when delivered orally to rats, XP620 decreased absorption of orally administered lipids by approximately 50%. Based on these data, we conclude that the acylation of acylglycerols by DGAT1 is important for dietary fat absorption in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1997191764,"To enhance understanding of how Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS) adapts during invasive infection, we performed a whole-genome transcriptome analysis after incubation with whole human blood. Global changes occurred in the GBS transcriptome rapidly in response to blood contact following shift from growth in a rich laboratory medium. Most (83%) of the significantly altered transcripts were down-regulated after 30 minutes of incubation in blood, and all functional categories of genes were abundantly represented. We observed complex dynamic changes in the expression of transcriptional regulators and stress response genes that allow GBS to rapidly adapt to blood. The transcripts of relatively few proven virulence genes were up-regulated during the first 90 minutes. However, a key discovery was that genes encoding proteins involved in interaction with the host coagulation/fibrinolysis system and bacterial-host interactions were rapidly up-regulated. Extensive transcript changes also occurred for genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including multi-functional proteins and regulators putatively involved in pathogenesis. Finally, we discovered that an incubation temperature closer to that occurring in patients with severe infection and high fever (40 degrees C) induced additional differences in the GBS transcriptome relative to normal body temperature (37 degrees C). Taken together, the data provide extensive new information about transcriptional adaptation of GBS exposed to human blood, a crucial step during GBS pathogenesis in invasive diseases, and identify many new leads for molecular pathogenesis research."
https://openalex.org/W2042364092,"Timing of flowering is a reproductive trait that has significant impact on fitness in plants. In contrast to recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of floral transition, few empirical studies have addressed questions concerning population processes of flowering time diversification within species. We analyzed chloroplast DNA genealogical structure of flowering time variation in central Eurasian wild wheat Aegilops tauschii Coss. using 200 accessions that represent the entire species range. Flowering time measured as days from germination to flowering varied from 144.0 to 190.0 days (average 161.3 days) among accessions in a common garden/greenhouse experiment. Subsequent genealogical and statistical analyses showed that (1) there exist significant longitudinal and latitudinal clines in flowering time at the species level, (2) the early-flowering phenotype evolved in two intraspecific lineages, (3) in Asia, winter temperature was an environmental factor that affected the longitudinal clinal pattern of flowering time variation, and (4) in Transcaucasus-Middle East, some latitudinal factors affected the geographic pattern of flowering time variation. On the basis of palaeoclimatic, biogeographic, and genetic evidence, the northern part of current species' range [which was within the temperate desert vegetation (TDV) zone at the Last Glacial Maximum] is hypothesized to have harbored species refugia. Postglacial southward dispersal from the TDV zone seems to have been driven by lineages that evolved short-flowering-time phenotypes through different genetic mechanisms in Transcaucasus-Middle East and Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2032774463,"The grapevine is a widely cultivated crop and a high number of different varieties have been selected since its domestication in the Neolithic period. Although sexual crossing has been a major driver of grapevine evolution, its vegetative propagation enhanced the impact of somatic mutations and has been important for grapevine diversity. Transposable elements are known to be major contributors to genome variability and, in particular, to somatic mutations. Thus, transposable elements have probably played a major role in grapevine domestication and evolution. The recent publication of the complete grapevine genome opens the possibility for an in deep analysis of its transposon content.We present here a detailed analysis of the ""cut-and-paste"" class II transposons present in the genome of grapevine. We characterized 1160 potentially complete grapevine transposons as well as 2086 defective copies. We report on the structure of each element, their potentiality to encode a functional transposase, and the existence of matching ESTs that could suggest their transcription.Our results show that these elements have transduplicated and amplified cellular sequences and some of them have been domesticated and probably fulfill cellular functions. In addition, we provide evidences that the mobility of these elements has contributed to the genomic variability of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2005431630,"Multi-modal visuo-tactile stimulation of the type performed in the rubber hand illusion can induce the brain to temporarily incorporate external objects into the body image. In this study we show that audio-visual stimulation combined with mental imagery more rapidly elicits an elevated physiological response (skin conductance) after an unexpected threat to a virtual limb, compared to audio-visual stimulation alone. Two groups of subjects seated in front of a monitor watched a first-person perspective view of slow movements of two virtual arms intercepting virtual balls rolling towards the viewer. One group was instructed to simply observe the movements of the two virtual arms, while the other group was instructed to observe the virtual arms and imagine that the arms were their own. After 84 seconds the right virtual arm was unexpectedly ""stabbed"" by a knife and began ""bleeding"". This aversive stimulus caused both groups to show a significant increase in skin conductance. In addition, the observation-with-imagery group showed a significantly higher skin conductance (p<0.05) than the observation-only group over a 2-second period shortly after the aversive stimulus onset. No corresponding change was found in subjects' heart rates. Our results suggest that simple visual input combined with mental imagery may induce the brain to measurably temporarily incorporate external objects into its body image."
https://openalex.org/W2055325053,"Insect body color polyphenisms enhance survival by producing crypsis in diverse backgrounds. While color polyphenisms are often indirectly induced by temperature, rearing density, or diet, insects can benefit from immediate crypsis if they evolve polyphenisms directly induced by exposure to the background color, hence immediately deriving protection from predation. Here, we examine such a directly induced color polyphenism in caterpillars of the geometrid peppered moth (Biston betularia). This larval color polyphenism is unrelated to the genetic polymorphism for melanic phenotypes in adult moths. B. betularia caterpillars are generalist feeders and develop body colors that closely match the brown or green twigs of their host plant. We expand on previous studies examining the proximal cues that stimulate color development. Under controlled rearing conditions, we manipulated diets and background reflectance, using both natural and artificial twigs, and show that visual experience has a much stronger effect than does diet in promoting precise color matching. Their induced body color was not a simple response to reflectance or light intensity but instead specifically matched the wavelength of light to which they were exposed. We also show that the potential to change color is retained until the final (sixth) larval instar. Given their broad host range, this directly induced color polyphenism likely provides the caterpillars with strong protection from bird predation."
https://openalex.org/W2063512748,"Artificial olfactory systems have been studied for the last two decades mainly from the point of view of the features of olfactory neuron receptor fields. Other fundamental olfaction properties have only been episodically considered in artificial systems. As a result, current artificial olfactory systems are mostly intended as instruments and are of poor benefit for biologists who may need tools to model and test olfactory models. Herewith, we show how a simple experimental approach can be used to account for several phenomena observed in olfaction. An artificial epithelium is formed as a disordered distributed layer of broadly selective color indicators dispersed in a transparent polymer layer. The whole epithelium is probed with colored light, imaged with a digital camera and the olfactory response upon exposure to an odor is the change of the multispectral image. The pixels are treated as olfactory receptor neurons, whose optical properties are used to build a convergence classifier into a number of mathematically defined artificial glomeruli. A non-homogenous exposure of the test structure to the odours gives rise to a time and spatial dependence of the response of the different glomeruli strikingly similar to patterns observed in the olfactory bulb. The model seems to mimick both the formation of glomeruli, the zonal nature of olfactory epithelium, and the spatio-temporal signal patterns at the glomeruli level. This platform is able to provide a readily available test vehicle for chemists developing optical indicators for chemical sensing purposes and for biologists to test models of olfactory system organization."
https://openalex.org/W1984447534,"Background The choroid plexus (CP) is an epithelial and vascular structure in the ventricular system of the brain that is a critical part of the blood-brain barrier. The CP has two primary functions, 1) to produce and regulate components of the cerebral spinal fluid, and 2) to inhibit entry into the brain of exogenous substances. Despite its importance in neurobiology, little is known about how this structure forms. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we show that the transposon-mediated enhancer trap zebrafish line EtMn16 expresses green fluorescent protein within a population of cells that migrate toward the midline and coalesce to form the definitive CP. We further demonstrate the development of the integral vascular network of the definitive CP. Utilizing pharmacologic pan-notch inhibition and specific morpholino-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate a requirement for Notch signaling in choroid plexus development. We identify three Notch signaling pathway members as mediating this effect, notch1b, deltaA, and deltaD. Conclusions and Significance This work is the first to identify the zebrafish choroid plexus and to characterize its epithelial and vasculature integration. This study, in the context of other comparative anatomical studies, strongly indicates a conserved mechanism for development of the CP. Finally, we characterize a requirement for Notch signaling in the developing CP. This establishes the zebrafish CP as an important new system for the determination of key signaling pathways in the formation of this essential component of the vertebrate brain."
https://openalex.org/W2024289745,"Photosynthetic organisms have developed multiple protective mechanisms to prevent photodamage in vivo under high-light conditions. Cyanobacteria and red algae use phycobilisomes (PBsomes) as their major light-harvesting antennae complexes. The orange carotenoid protein in some cyanobacteria has been demonstrated to play roles in the photoprotective mechanism. The PBsome-itself-related energy dissipation mechanism is still unclear.Here, single-molecule spectroscopy is applied for the first time on the PBsomes of red alga Porphyridium cruentum, to detect the fluorescence emissions of phycoerythrins (PE) and PBsome core complex simultaneously, and the real-time detection could greatly characterize the fluorescence dynamics of individual PBsomes in response to intense light.Our data revealed that strong green-light can induce the fluorescence decrease of PBsome, as well as the fluorescence increase of PE at the first stage of photobleaching. It strongly indicated an energetic decoupling occurring between PE and its neighbor. The fluorescence of PE was subsequently observed to be decreased, showing that PE was photobleached when energy transfer in the PBsomes was disrupted. In contrast, the energetic decoupling was not observed in either the PBsomes fixed with glutaraldehyde, or the mutant PBsomes lacking B-PE and remaining b-PE. It was concluded that the energetic decoupling of the PBsomes occurs at the specific association between B-PE and b-PE within the PBsome rod. Assuming that the same process occurs also at the much lower physiological light intensities, such a decoupling process is proposed to be a strategy corresponding to PBsomes to prevent photodamage of the photosynthetic reaction centers. Finally, a novel photoprotective role of gamma-subunit-containing PE in red algae was discussed."

Aim of this study was to investigate two testing regimen of SMBG in patients with stable metabolic control. Research Design and Methods Patients with T2D treated with oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized to two groups: either one SMBG (low) or four SMBG (high) per week. Subjects were followed up after 3, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcome parameter was the change in HbA1c between baseline and 6 months. Primary outcome criterion was tested by a one-sided t- test for non- inferiority. Secondary outcome parameters were safety, compliance and HbA1c at 3 and 12 months. Results There were no differences in the 202 subjects for demographic and sociodemographic parameters and drug treatment. HbA1c (%) at baseline was similar in both groups (7.2±1.4 vs. 7.2±1.0). Non- inferiority was demonstrated for the low group (p = 0.0022) with a difference from baseline to 6 months of 0.24 in the low and of 0.16 in the high group. Compliance with the testing regimen was 82–90% in both groups. There were no statistical significant differences for compliance, HbA1c at 3 and 12 months and serious adverse events (SAE). Conclusion One SMBG per week is as sufficient and safe as four SMBG per week to maintain HbA1c in non-insulin treated T2D close to metabolic target. The results of this study are in contrast to current international consensus guidelines. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN79164268"

Randomized controlled trials have not consistently shown that this practice improves TB treatment success rates. In Thailand, one of 22 WHO-designated high burden TB countries, patients may have TB treatment observed by a health care worker (HCW), family member, or no one. We studied whether DOT improved TB treatment outcomes in a prospective, observational cohort.We prospectively collected epidemiologic data about TB patients treated at public and private facilities in four provinces in Thailand and the national infectious diseases hospital from 2004-2006. Public health staff recorded the type of observed therapy that patients received during the first two months of TB treatment. We limited our analysis to pulmonary TB patients never previously treated for TB and not known to have multidrug-resistant TB. We analyzed the proportion of patients still on treatment at the end of two months and with treatment success at the end of treatment according to DOT type. We used propensity score analysis to control for factors associated with DOT and treatment outcome. Of 8,031 patients eligible for analysis, 24% received HCW DOT, 59% family DOT, and 18% self-administered therapy (SAT). Smear-positive TB was diagnosed in 63%, and 21% were HIV-infected. Of patients either on treatment or that defaulted at two months, 1601/1636 (98%) patients that received HCW DOT remained on treatment at two months compared with 1096/1268 (86%) patients that received SAT (adjusted OR [aOR] 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-6.0) and 3782/3987 (95%) patients that received family DOT (aOR 2.1; CI, 1.4-3.1). Of patients that had treatment success or that defaulted at the end of treatment, 1369/1477 (93%) patients that received HCW DOT completed treatment compared with 744/1074 (69%) patients that received SAT (aOR 3.3; CI, 2.4-4.5) and 3130/3529 (89%) patients that received family DOT (aOR 1.5; 1.2-1.9). The benefit of HCW DOT compared with SAT was similar, but smaller, when comparing patients with treatment success to those with death, default, or failure.In Thailand, two months of DOT was associated with lower odds of default during treatment. The magnitude of benefit was greater for DOT provided by a HCW compared with a family member. Thailand should consider increasing its use of HCW DOT during TB treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1984000968,"A key goal of systems biology is to understand how genomewide mRNA expression levels are controlled by transcription factors (TFs) in a condition-specific fashion. TF activity is frequently modulated at the post-translational level through ligand binding, covalent modification, or changes in sub-cellular localization. In this paper, we demonstrate how prior information about regulatory network connectivity can be exploited to infer condition-specific TF activity as a hidden variable from the genomewide mRNA expression pattern in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We first validate experimentally that by scoring differential expression at the level of gene sets or ""regulons"" comprised of the putative targets of a TF, we can accurately predict modulation of TF activity at the post-translational level. Next, we create an interactive database of inferred activities for a large number of TFs across a large number of experimental conditions in S. cerevisiae. This allows us to perform TF-centric analysis of the yeast regulatory network.We analyze the degree to which the mRNA expression level of each TF is predictive of its regulatory activity. We also organize TFs into ""co-modulation networks"" based on their inferred activity profile across conditions, and find that this reveals functional and mechanistic relationships. Finally, we present evidence that the PAC and rRPE motifs antagonize TBP-dependent regulation, and function as core promoter elements governed by the transcription regulator NC2. Regulon-based monitoring of TF activity modulation is a powerful tool for analyzing regulatory network function that should be applicable in other organisms.

More precisely, starting from a recently introduced measure to determine the topological entropy of non-hierarchical networks, we provide bounds for estimating the entropy of hierarchical graphs. Apart from bounds to estimate the entropy of a single hierarchical graph, we see that the derived bounds can also be used for characterizing graph classes. Our contribution is an important extension to previous results about the entropy of non-hierarchical networks because for practical applications hierarchical networks are playing an important role in chemistry and biology. In addition to the derivation of the entropy bounds, we provide a numerical analysis for two special graph classes, rooted trees and generalized trees, and demonstrate hereby not only the computational feasibility of our method but also learn about its characteristics and interpretability with respect to data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2079037835,"We have previously reported an important role of increased tyrosine phosphorylation activity by Src in the modulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. Here we provide evidence showing a novel mechanism of decreased tyrosine phosphorylation on HCN channel properties. We found that the receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase-alpha (RPTPalpha) significantly inhibited or eliminated HCN2 channel expression in HEK293 cells. Biochemical evidence showed that the surface expression of HCN2 was remarkably reduced by RPTPalpha, which was in parallel to the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel protein. Confocal imaging confirmed that the membrane surface distribution of the HCN2 channel was inhibited by RPTPalpha. Moreover, we detected the presence of RPTPalpha proteins in cardiac ventricles with expression levels changed during development. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activity by phenylarsine oxide or sodium orthovanadate shifted ventricular hyperpolarization-activated current (I(f), generated by HCN channels) activation from nonphysiological voltages into physiological voltages associated with accelerated activation kinetics. In conclusion, we showed a critical role RPTPalpha plays in HCN channel function via tyrosine dephosphorylation. These findings are also important to neurons where HCN and RPTPalpha are richly expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2009248766,"Background Cerebral malaria (CM) is a syndrome characterized by neurological signs, seizures and coma. Despite the fact that CM presents similarities with cerebral stroke, few studies have focused on new supportive therapies for the disease. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been successfully used in patients with numerous brain disorders such as stroke, migraine and atherosclerosis. Methodology/Principal Findings C57BL/6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) were exposed to daily doses of HBO (100% O2, 3.0 ATA, 1–2 h per day) in conditions well-tolerated by humans and animals, before or after parasite establishment. Cumulative survival analyses demonstrated that HBO therapy protected 50% of PbA-infected mice and delayed CM-specific neurological signs when administrated after patent parasitemia. Pressurized oxygen therapy reduced peripheral parasitemia, expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-10 mRNA levels and percentage of γδ and αβ CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes sequestered in mice brains, thus resulting in a reduction of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and hypothermia. Conclusions/Significance The data presented here is the first indication that HBO treatment could be used as supportive therapy, perhaps in association with neuroprotective drugs, to prevent CM clinical outcomes, including death."
https://openalex.org/W1967839608,"Background Matrix models are widely used to study the dynamics and demography of populations. An important but overlooked issue is how the number of individuals sampled influences estimates of the population growth rate (λ) calculated with matrix models. Even unbiased estimates of vital rates do not ensure unbiased estimates of λ–Jensen's Inequality implies that even when the estimates of the vital rates are accurate, small sample sizes lead to biased estimates of λ due to increased sampling variance. We investigated if sampling variability and the distribution of sampling effort among size classes lead to biases in estimates of λ. Methodology/Principal Findings Using data from a long-term field study of plant demography, we simulated the effects of sampling variance by drawing vital rates and calculating λ for increasingly larger populations drawn from a total population of 3842 plants. We then compared these estimates of λ with those based on the entire population and calculated the resulting bias. Finally, we conducted a review of the literature to determine the sample sizes typically used when parameterizing matrix models used to study plant demography. Conclusions/Significance We found significant bias at small sample sizes when survival was low (survival = 0.5), and that sampling with a more-realistic inverse J-shaped population structure exacerbated this bias. However our simulations also demonstrate that these biases rapidly become negligible with increasing sample sizes or as survival increases. For many of the sample sizes used in demographic studies, matrix models are probably robust to the biases resulting from sampling variance of vital rates. However, this conclusion may depend on the structure of populations or the distribution of sampling effort in ways that are unexplored. We suggest more intensive sampling of populations when individual survival is low and greater sampling of stages with high elasticities."
https://openalex.org/W2031879926,"Reversible phosphorylation of proteins regulates numerous aspects of cell function, and abnormal phosphorylation is causal in many diseases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is central to the regulation of glucose homeostasis. PDC exists in a dynamic equilibrium between de-phospho-(active) and phosphorylated (inactive) forms controlled by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP1,2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1–4).

The effects of IPG-P from liver, and the action of Mn2+ and Zn2+, trace metals associated with IPGs (24Fonteles M.C. Almeida M.Q. Larner J. Horm. Metab. Res. 2000; 32: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Larner J. Price J.D. Heinmark D. Smith L. Rule O. Piccariello T. Fonteles M.C. Pontes C. Huang L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), were examined for their effects on PDK. The results indicated that IPG-P played a significant role in regulating glucose metabolism at the PDC stage by sigmoidal inhibition of PDK in addition to the linear activation of PDP. At critical concentrations of IPG-P an enhancement of the switchover mechanism to the active de-phospho form of PDC occurs. In the light of evidence for the release of IPGs from membrane preparations by insulin (15Varela-Nieto I. Leon Y. Caro H.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Tissues and Reagents—Wistar albino male rats weighing 130–150 g, from Harlan Olac UK Ltd. (Bicester, Oxon, UK) were used for the preparation of the IPGs from liver. CoA, pyruvate, thiamine pyrophosphate, dithiothreitol, and activated charcoal were purchased from Sigma. AG1-X8 resin (OH-, 20–50 mesh, converted to the formate form) was purchased from Bio-Rad. Salts, organic solvents, and other reagents were of analytical grade or better. PDC and PDP (metal-dependent form) were prepared from beef heart as described by Lilley et al. (29Lilley K. Zhang C. Villar-Palasi C. Larner J. Huang I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Preparation of IPGs—IPG-P and IPG-A extracted from 5 to 10 g of tissue were separated by elution from Amberlite columns (formate form) with HCl, pH 2.0 and pH 1.3, respectively, as described by Nestler et al. (30Nestler J.E. Romero G. Huang L.C. Zhang C.G. Larner J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2951-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and as modified by Caro et al. (16Caro H.N. Kunjara S. Rademacher T.W. Leon Y. Jones D.R. Avila M.A. Varela-Nieto I. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The freeze-dried fractions were stored at -80 °C and for use were dissolved in distilled water. Further stages of purification of the IPG-P were as described in detail by Caro et al. (16Caro H.N.

A parallelism between the activation of PDP and inhibition of PDK was observed at each stage of the purification procedure. The final product was subjected to paper chromatography and elution with butanol/water/ethanol at a ratio of 4:1:1. Fraction 1 contained on average 67% of the initial IPG-P activation of PDP and 58% of inhibition of PDK; <10% was found in fraction 2, and all other fractions (fractions 3–7) contained <5% of the original activity. On the basis of this evidence, there appeared to be no grounds for considering that the effectors of PDP and PDK were separate entities.

In brief, IPG-P was determined using the activation of PDP by the spectrophotometric variant of the two-stage system described by Lilley et al. (29Lilley K. Zhang C. Villar-Palasi C. Larner J. Huang I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A unit of activity is defined as the conversion of 1 nmol of NAD+ to NADH per min at 30 °C. IPG-A was assayed by the stimulation of incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into lipids of adipocytes isolated from rat epididymal fat pads by the method of Rodbell (38Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unit of IPG-A is defined as 1 nmol of [14C]glucose incorporated into lipid/g dry weight/h at 37 °C. Preparation of Heart PDC and Assay of PDP and PDK—PDC was partially purified from beef heart mitochondria as described previously (29Lilley K. Zhang C. Villar-Palasi C. Larner J. Huang I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this complex contains a tightly associated PDK (2Roche T.E. Baker J.C. Yan X. Hiromasa Y. Gong X. Peng T. Dong J.

The PDP was separated from PDC by washing the PDC three times with a buffer mixture containing the following: 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2 (16Caro H.N. Kunjara S. Rademacher T.W. Leon Y. Jones D.R. Avila M.A. Varela-Nieto I. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the heart preparations used were as follows: PDC, 1.4 units/mg protein and PDP 1.8 units/mg protein (1 unit produces 1 μmol of NADH/min/30 °C; these were stored at -80 °C until used). These preparations were free from lactic dehydrogenase, ATPase, and activity in the reoxidation of NADH. Assay of PDP—The assay of PDP is based on the reactivation of the phosphorylated form of PDC by incubation with the separated soluble beef heart PDP component and measurement of the activity of PDC by the rate of reduction of NAD+ using the two-step procedure of Lilley et al. (29Lilley K. Zhang C. Villar-Palasi C. Larner J. Huang I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as previously described by Caro et al. (16Caro H.N. Kunjara S. Rademacher T.W. Leon Y. Jones D.R. Avila M.A. Varela-Nieto I. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After inactivation with ATP the activity of PDC was reduced to less than 1% of the original value (see supplemental material). Assay of PDK—The assay of PDK was based on the rate of inactivation of PDC by ATP catalyzed by the PDK component of the complex, a first order rate reaction that is basically similar to that described by Bajotto et al. (39Bajotto G. Murakami T. Nagasaki M. Tamura T. Tamura N. Harris R.A. Shimomura Y. Sato Y. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The active nonphosphorylated residual activity of PDC was measured spectrophotometrically (16Caro H.N. Kunjara S. Rademacher T.W. Leon Y. Jones D.R. Avila M.A. Varela-Nieto I. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Full inactivation of PDC required 15 min (<1% of original activity), and the PDC was ∼70% inactivated in 10 min. The amount of effector molecule being tested was adjusted so that the extent of inactivation was decreased from 70% with ATP alone to ∼50% in the presence of the test sample. These parameters were set to achieve a response yielding linearity. The net effect of inhibition of PDK by IPG-P or synthetic analogues was a higher residual activity of PDC and faster rate of reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The effects of IPG P-type from liver and of metal ions on the activity of PDC are presented as nanomoles of NADH/min at 30 °C or as percentage inhibition of PDK (see supplemental material). Measurement of Free Ca2+ Ions—The ISM-146 Ca microcalcium electrode and the DJM-146 micro-reference electrode from Lazar Research Laboratories, Inc. were used. The calibration curve range was 0.02–6 mm CaCl2 in an isotonic solution of NaCl (0.9%). The free Ca2+ in the PDP assay was 0.035 mm (mean of three values). The addition of Mn2+ (1.0 mm) did not alter the free Ca2+ over the range examined (0.01–1.0 mm). Mn2+ and Zn2+ Content of IPG Preparations—Trace metals were measured in rat liver IPGs using an atomic absorption spectrometer (Philips PU 9100) with an air/acetylene flame; Mn2+ was measured at 279.5 nm and Zn2+ at 213.9 nm. Effect of Liver IPG-P and IPG-A on PDC—The effects of IPG-P isolated from liver on PDP and PDK are shown in the Fig. 3, a and b. The sigmoidal dose-response curve contrasted sharply with the well established linear stimulatory effects of IPG-P types on activation of PDP (16Caro H.N. Kunjara S. Rademacher T.W. Leon Y.

The regulatory effect of the contrast between the linear activation of PDP and sigmoidal inhibition of PDK, the latter been manifest at higher concentration of IPG-P, is for a push-pull system that will magnify the response of PDC to moderate changes in IPG-P, a highly sensitive system at critical tissue concentrations of IPG-P. In contrast, IPG-A type from liver had no effect on PDK activity (data not shown). Effect of Mn2+ and Zn2+ on PDK and PDP Activity—As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the optimal concentration of Mn2+ (1 mm) was broadly similar for PDP and PDK contrasting with Zn2+, which was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for Mn2+ for PDP (0.01 mm) and an order lower for PDK (0.1 mm). These values are the total amounts in the assay systems and not the free, unbound concentrations. The possibility that Mn2+ might raise the free Ca2+ in the assay medium for PDP was tested using a calcium ion electrode; no significant change was detected. The Mn2+ and Zn2+ content of IPG-P and IPG-A from rat liver measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy is given in Table 1, the Mn2+/Zn2+ ratio was ∼3:2. It has been shown that removal of metals with dithizone inactivated a liver IPG-P preparation, activity being partially restored by treatment with Mn2+ (16Caro H.N. Kunjara S. Rademacher T.W. Leon Y.

As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, in the absence of Ca2+, Mn2+ and IPG-P increased the PDP activity by 2.7- and 7-fold, respectively, in combination an additive effect was observed (Fig. 5A). The addition of Ca2+ (0.1 mm) alone gave a 6-fold increase in basal PDP activity; the incremental effect of Ca2+ appeared to be constant whether added alone, with Mn2+, with IPG-P, or with Mn2+ plus IPG-P (Fig. 5B). It can be hypothesized that an effect of IPG-P and Mn2+ on bovine heart PDP might be on the PDP2 isoform, the added effect of Ca2+ being on PDP1. An action of IPG-P and Mn2+ on PDP1 cannot be excluded because the heart PDP preparation contained both isoforms, and Mn2+ can replace Mg2+ and Ca2+ (2Roche T.E. Baker J.C. Yan X. Hiromasa Y. Gong X. Peng T. Dong J. Turkan A. Kasten S.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 33-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements using the separate isoforms of PDP are required. Activity of Synthetic Hexosamine Inositols—To date the only chemically characterized synthetic IPG is GalNH2β4-d-pinitol (19) that has been termed INS-2. This compound was originally isolated from both rat and bovine liver (25Larner J. Price J.D. Heinmark D. Smith L. Rule O. Piccariello T. Fonteles M.C. Pontes C. Huang L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We were not able to confirm the activity of this compound as an allosteric activator of PDP either in the presence or absence of Mn2+. We also synthesized the L form (20), and this was similarly inactive (data not shown). The nonphosphorylated analogues from the myo and chiro series (Series 1 and 5, see Fig. 1) were also found to have no activity as activators of PDP. In contrast α- and β-nonphosphorylated analogues of d-glucosaminyl and d-galactosaminyl 1–6 d-pinitol (Series 7) all had significant activity with the glucosaminyl derivative always more active than the corresponding galactosaminyl derivative (21 versus 23 and 22 versus 18). Because IPGs should contain phosphate groups, a series of hexosamine phosphate and inositol phosphate analogues was synthesized: Series 2, 3, and 6). These compounds were all more active than the nonphosphorylated glycosaminyl pinitols with clear structure-activity relationships. For example, comparison of the 6-O-phosphate-R (7) with (8) 4-O-phosphate-R and (9) 3-O-phosphate-R showed an activity (PDP) increase of 30, 125, and 325%, respectively (with R = GlcNH2α1–6-d-myo-inositol) as shown in Fig. 6A. Compounds 17 and 6, which contained a phosphate(s) on the inositol, were also very active (PDP), 325 and 375% respectively. A number of acetate analogues were also synthesized (Series 4). Compounds 11 and 12 had significant activity in the PDP assay as shown in Fig. 6C. A number of the compounds also demonstrated activity as inhibitors of PDK (Fig. 6, B and C); compound 6 was the most active. This ability to both activate PDP and also inhibit PDK in a single structure was unexpected, a"
https://openalex.org/W2032132983,"Although neutrophils are known to migrate in response to various chemokines and complement factors, the substances involved in the early stages of their transmigration and activation have been poorly characterized to date. Here we report the discovery of a peptide isolated from healthy porcine hearts that activated neutrophils. Its primary structure is H-Leu-Ser-Phe-Leu-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gly-Trp-Val-Leu-Ser-His-Leu-Asp-His-Tyr-Lys-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ala-OH, and it was indicated to originate from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. This peptide caused chemotaxis at concentrations lower than that inducing beta-hexosaminidase release. Such responses were observed in neutrophilic/granulocytic differentiated HL-60 cells but not in undifferentiated cells, and G(i2)-type G proteins were suggested to be involved in the peptide signaling. Moreover the peptide activated human neutrophils to induce beta-hexosaminidase secretion. A number of other amphipathic neutrophil-activating peptides presumably originating from mitochondrial proteins were also found. The present results suggest that neutrophils monitor such amphipathic peptides including the identified peptide as an initiation signal for inflammation at injury sites."
https://openalex.org/W1974541190,"Background In ecotoxicological and environmental studies Lemna spp. are used as test organisms due to their small size, rapid predominantly vegetative reproduction, easy handling and high sensitivity to various chemicals. However, there is not much information available concerning spatial and temporal stability of experimental set-ups used for Lemna bioassays, though this is essential for interpretation and reliability of results. We therefore investigated stability and natural variability of a Lemna gibba bioassay assessing area-related and frond number-related growth rates under controlled laboratory conditions over about one year. Methology/Principal Findings Lemna gibba L. was grown in beakers with Steinberg medium for one week. Area-related and frond number-related growth rates (r(area) and r(num)) were determined with a non-destructive image processing system. To assess inter-experimental stability, 35 independent experiments were performed with 10 beakers each in the course of one year. We observed changes in growth rates by a factor of two over time. These did not correlate well with temperature or relative humidity in the growth chamber. In order to assess intra-experimental stability, we analysed six systematic negative control experiments (nontoxicant tests) with 96 replicate beakers each. Evaluation showed that the chosen experimental set-up was stable and did not produce false positive results. The coefficient of variation was lower for r(area) (2.99%) than for r(num) (4.27%). Conclusions/Significance It is hypothesised that the variations in growth rates over time under controlled conditions are partly due to endogenic periodicities in Lemna gibba. The relevance of these variations for toxicity investigations should be investigated more closely. Area-related growth rate seems to be more precise as non-destructive calculation parameter than number-related growth rate. Furthermore, we propose two new validity criteria for Lemna gibba bioassays: variability of average specific and section-by-section segmented growth rate, complementary to average specific growth rate as the only validity criterion existing in guidelines for duckweed bioassays."

In Nature this week, features and opinion pieces on one of the most daunting challenges facing modern science: how to cope with the flood of data now being generated. A petabyte is a lot of memory, however you say it — a quadrillion, 1015, or tens of thousands of trillions of bytes. But that is the currency of 'big data'. We visited the Sanger Institute's supercomputing centre, and its petabyte of capacity. Wikipedia's success shows how well the 'wiki' concept of open-access editing can work. It could work too as a way of coping with the data flows of modern biology. The world's leading search engine is ten this month. Eleven years ago few would have predicted Google's domination: undaunted we ask scientists and business people to try to predict the next big thing, a Google for the petabyte era. Digital data are easily shared, and just as easily wiped or lost. The problem of keeping on-line data accessible is especially difficult for the smaller lab. In Books&Arts, Felice Frankel and Rosalind Reid champion the cause of data visualization as a way of finding meaning in an otherwise daunting data stream. From the 1700s to the mid 1950s, most 'computers' were human. Best known were the 'Harvard computers', a group of women working from the 1880s until the 1940s, at the Harvard College Observatory. Employed to classify stars captured on millions of photographic plates, some of the 'computers' made significant contributions to science. Online databases are a vital outlet for publishing the data being produced by biological research. But the data need to be properly organized. This is the role of the biocurator, but as a team of authors from 15 of the world's major online research resources explains, biocuration is now sadly neglected. An aspect of the data boom with a political dimension is the environment: how much data to collect, how much money to spend.

https://openalex.org/W2059490433,"The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri expresses a unique allorecognition system. When two histoincompatible Botryllus colonies come into direct contact, they develop an inflammatory-like rejection response. A surprising high number of vertebrates' coagulation genes and coagulation-related domains were disclosed in a cDNA library of differentially expressed sequence tags (ESTs), prepared for this allorejection process. Serine proteases, especially from the trypsin family, were highly represented among Botryllus library ortholgues and its “molecular function” gene ontology analysis. These, together with the built-up clot-like lesions in the interaction area, led us to further test whether a vertebrate-like clotting system participates in Botryllus innate immunity. Three morphologically distinct clot types (points of rejection; POR) were followed. We demonstrated the specific expression of nine coagulation orthologue transcripts in Botryllus rejection processes and effects of the anti-coagulant heparin on POR formation and heartbeats. In situ hybridization of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor orthologues elucidated enhanced expression patterns specific to histoincompatible reactions as well as common expressions not augmented by innate immunity. Immunohistochemistry for fibrinogen revealed, in naïve and immune challenged colonies alike, specific antibody binding to a small population of Botryllus compartment cells. Altogether, molecular, physiological and morphological outcomes suggest the involvement of vertebrates-like coagulation elements in urochordate immunity, not assigned with vasculature injury."
https://openalex.org/W1969184405,"Background Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) is a rodent gammaretrovirus that serves as the backbone for common gene delivery tools designed for experimental and therapeutic applications. Recently, an infectious gammaretrovirus designated XMRV has been identified in prostate cancer patients. The similarity between the MLV and XMRV genomes suggests a possibility that the two viruses may interact when present in the same cell. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested the ability of XMRV to complement replication-deficient MLV vectors upon co-infection of cultured human cells. We observed that XMRV can facilitate the spread of these vectors from infected to uninfected cells. This functional complementation occurred without any gross rearrangements in the vector structure, and the co-infected cells produced as many as 104 infectious vector particles per milliliter of culture medium. Conclusions/Significance The possibility of encountering a helper virus when delivering MLV-based vectors to human cells in vitro and in vivo needs to be considered to ensure the safety of such procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2042314131,"Background Detecting objects is an important task when moving through a natural environment. Flies, for example, may land on salient objects or may avoid collisions with them. The neuronal ensemble of Figure Detection cells (FD-cells) in the visual system of the fly is likely to be involved in controlling these behaviours, as these cells are more sensitive to objects than to extended background structures. Until now the computations in the presynaptic neuronal network of FD-cells and, in particular, the functional significance of the experimentally established distributed dendritic processing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is not understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We use model simulations to analyse the neuronal computations responsible for the preference of FD-cells for small objects. We employed a new modelling approach which allowed us to account for the spatial spread of electrical signals in the dendrites while avoiding detailed compartmental modelling. The models are based on available physiological and anatomical data. Three models were tested each implementing an inhibitory neural circuit, but differing by the spatial arrangement of the inhibitory interaction. Parameter optimisation with an evolutionary algorithm revealed that only distributed dendritic processing satisfies the constraints arising from electrophysiological experiments. In contrast to a direct dendro-dendritic inhibition of the FD-cell (Direct Distributed Inhibition model), an inhibition of its presynaptic retinotopic elements (Indirect Distributed Inhibition model) requires smaller changes in input resistance in the inhibited neurons during visual stimulation. Conclusions/Significance Distributed dendritic inhibition of retinotopic elements as implemented in our Indirect Distributed Inhibition model is the most plausible wiring scheme for the neuronal circuit of FD-cells. This microcircuit is computationally similar to lateral inhibition between the retinotopic elements. Hence, distributed inhibition might be an alternative explanation of perceptual phenomena currently explained by lateral inhibition networks."
https://openalex.org/W2048646138,"Background During uncontrolled HIV disease, both TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TRAIL receptor expression are increased. Enhanced TRAIL sensitivity is due to TRAIL receptor up-regulation induced by gp120. As a result of successful antiretroviral therapy TRAIL is down-regulated, and there are fewer TRAIL-sensitive cells. In this setting, we hypothesized that all cells that contain virus, including those productively- and latently-infected, have necessarily been “primed” by gp120 and remain TRAIL-sensitive, whereas uninfected cells remain relatively TRAIL-resistant. Methods and Findings We evaluated the immunologic and antiviral effects of TRAIL in peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from HIV-infected patients with suppressed viral replication. The peripheral blood lymphocytes were treated with recombinant TRAIL or an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin as a negative control. Treated cells were then analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry, ELISPOT for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell function, and limiting dilution microculture for viral burden. Alterations in the cytokine milieu of treated cells were assessed with a multiplex cytokine assay. Treatment with recombinant TRAIL in vitro reduced viral burden in lymphocytes collected from HIV-infected patients with suppressed viral load. TRAIL treatment did not alter the cytokine milieu of treated cells. Moreover, treatment with recombinant TRAIL had no adverse effect on either the quantity or function of immune cells from HIV-infected patients with suppressed viral replication. Conclusions TRAIL treatment may be an important adjunct to antiretroviral therapy, even in patients with suppressed viral replication, perhaps by inducing apoptosis in cells with latent HIV reservoirs. The absence of adverse effect on the quantity or function of immune cells from HIV-infected patients suggests that there is not a significant level of “bystander death” in uninfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065203603,"Proper development of a seed requires coordinated exchanges of signals among the three components that develop side by side in the seed. One of these is the maternal integument that encloses the other two zygotic components, i.e., the diploid embryo and its nurturing annex, the triploid endosperm. Although the formation of the embryo and endosperm contains the contributions of both maternal and paternal parents, maternally and paternally derived alleles may be expressed differently, leading to a so-called parent-of-origin or imprinting effect. Currently, the nature of how genes from the maternal and zygotic genomes interact to affect seed development remains largely unknown. Here, we present a novel statistical model for estimating the main and interaction effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that are derived from different genomes and further testing the imprinting effects of these QTLs on seed development. The experimental design used is based on reciprocal backcrosses toward both parents, so that the inheritance of parent-specific alleles could be traced. The computing model and algorithm were implemented with the maximum likelihood approach. The new strategy presented was applied to study the mode of inheritance for QTLs that control endoreduplication traits in maize endosperm. Monte Carlo simulation studies were performed to investigate the statistical properties of the new model with the data simulated under different imprinting degrees. The false positive rate of imprinting QTL discovery by the model was examined by analyzing the simulated data that contain no imprinting QTL. The reciprocal design and a series of analytical and testing strategies proposed provide a standard procedure for genomic mapping of QTLs involved in the genetic control of complex seed development traits in flowering plants."

https://openalex.org/W2065312638,"Understanding how a myriad of transcription regulators work to modulate mRNA output at thousands of genes remains a fundamental challenge in molecular biology. Here we develop a computational tool to aid in assessing the plausibility of gene regulatory models derived from genome-wide expression profiling of cells mutant for transcription regulators. mRNA output is modelled as fluid flow in a pipe lattice, with assembly of the transcription machinery represented by the effect of valves. Transcriptional regulators are represented as external pressure heads that determine flow rate. Modelling mutations in regulatory proteins is achieved by adjusting valves' on/off settings. The topology of the lattice is designed by the experimentalist to resemble the expected interconnection between the modelled agents and their influence on mRNA expression. Users can compare multiple lattice configurations so as to find the one that minimizes the error with experimental data. This computational model provides a means to test the plausibility of transcription regulation models derived from large genomic data sets."
