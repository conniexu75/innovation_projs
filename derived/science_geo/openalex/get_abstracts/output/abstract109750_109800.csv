https://openalex.org/W2070217033,"It is widely held that conscious recall of past experiences involves a specific system--episodic memory. Patients with amnesia have gross impairments of episodic memory while other kinds of memory remain intact, suggesting that a separable brain system underlies episodic memory. We have used positron emission tomography (PET) to identify components of this system in normal volunteers. A dual-task interference paradigm was used to isolate brain areas associated with acquisition, and a cueing paradigm to isolate the areas concerned with retrieval from verbal episodic memory. Acquisition was associated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex and the retrosplenial area, whereas retrieval was associated with activity in right prefrontal cortex and the precuneus. Our results provide clear evidence that episodic memory involves a network of specific prefrontal and posterior structures which can be fractionated into different component processes."

Four ligands from Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv that stimulated proliferation of a major human gamma delta T cell subset were isolated and partially characterized. One of these ligands, TUBag4, is a 5' triphosphorylated thymidine-containing compound, to which the three other stimulatory molecules are structurally related. These findings support the hypothesis that some gamma delta T cells recognize nonpeptidic ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2059428026,"The movement of chromosomes that precedes meiosis was observed in living cells of fission yeast by fluorescence microscopy. Further analysis by in situ hybridization revealed that the telomeres remain clustered at the leading end of premeiotic chromosome movement, unlike mitotic chromosome movement in which the centromere leads. Once meiotic chromosome segregation starts, however, centromeres resume the leading position in chromosome movement, as they do in mitosis. Although the movement of the telomere first has not been observed before, the clustering of telomeres is reminiscent of the bouquet structure of meiotic-prophase chromosomes observed in higher eukaryotes, which suggests that telomeres perform specific functions required for premeiotic chromosomal events generally in eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1516514485,"The identification and purification of human cell proteins required for the production of form I DNA following DNA replication from the simian virus 40 (SV40) origin is described. Using these proteins, complete SV40 DNA replication was reconstituted with only purified DNA replication factors: SV40 large tumor antigen (TAg), replication protein A (RPA), DNA topoisomerases I and II, DNA polymerase alpha-primase, replication factor C (RFC), the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), DNA polymerase delta, maturation factor 1 (MF1), and DNA ligase I. MF1, a 5' to 3' exonuclease and DNA ligase I were both identified as essential components for production of covalently closed circular relaxed (form I) DNA. MF1 is probably the same exonuclease previously shown by others to function during DNA synthesis on artificial DNA templates or in conjunction with DNA polymerase alpha from the SV40 origin. Combined with these previous studies, our results suggest that MF1 functions to remove an RNA primer attached to every Okazaki fragment during lagging strand DNA synthesis. Interestingly, whereas mammalian DNA ligase I functioned in the reconstituted replication system, mammalian DNA ligase III did not substitute and the phage T4 DNA ligase functioned inefficiently, suggesting that DNA ligase I has a specific role as a replicative DNA ligase in eukaryotic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2028825471,"Cognitive and behavioral responses to environmental stimuli depend on an evaluation of sensory signals within the cerebral cortex. The mechanism by which this occurs in a specific visual task was investigated with a combination of physiological and psychophysical techniques. Rhesus monkeys discriminated among eight possible directions of motion while directional signals were manipulated in visual area MT. One directional signal was generated by a visual stimulus and a second signal was introduced by electrically stimulating neurons that encoded a specific direction of motion. The decisions made by the monkeys in response to the two signals allowed a distinction to be made between two possible mechanisms for interpreting directional signals in MT. The monkeys tended to cast decisions in favor of one or the other signal, indicating that the signals exerted independent effects on performance and that an interactive mechanism such as vector averaging of the two signals was not operative. Thus, the data suggest a mechanism in which monkeys chose the direction encoded by the largest signal in the representation of motion direction, a ""winner-take-all"" decision process."

https://openalex.org/W2059969446,"The genetic requirements for adaptive mutation in Escherichia coli parallel those for homologous recombination in the RecBCD pathway. Recombination-deficient recA and recB null mutant strains are deficient in adaptive reversion. A hyper-recombinagenic recD strain is hypermutable, and its hypermutation depends on functional recA and recB genes. Genes of subsidiary recombination systems are not required. These results indicate that the molecular mechanism by which adaptive mutation occurs includes recombination. No such association is seen for spontaneous mutation in growing cells."

https://openalex.org/W2094831461,"An amino-terminal transactivation domain is required for Myc to function as a transcription factor controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. A complementary DNA expression library was screened with a Myc fusion protein to identify proteins interacting with this domain, and a clone encoding the Rb-related p107 protein was isolated. The p107 protein was shown to associate with Myc in vivo and to suppress the activity of the Myc transactivation domain. However, mutant forms of Myc from Burkitt lymphoma cells, which contain sequence alterations in the transactivation domain, were resistant to p107-mediated suppression. Thus, disruption of a regulatory interaction between Myc and p107 may be important in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1532123823,"The receptor for angiotensin II (Ang II) has recently been cloned; it is a receptor with seven transmembrane spanning domains that stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis upon ligand binding. The physiologic effects of Ang II are important in the regulation of vascular function. In this study, we examined the ability of Ang II to regulate the enzymatic activity of phospholipase C (PLC) in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In cultured VSMC, PLC-gamma 1 and PLC-delta 1 isozymes, but not PLC-beta 1, were identified by Western analysis. Ang II (10(-7) M)-stimulated PLC-gamma 1 phosphotyrosine phosphorylation with a maximum increase of 4.5-fold at 0.5 min. This followed the same time course as the Ang II-stimulated increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) levels. 1,4,5-IP3 formation was inhibited 75% by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (120 microM). Several growth factor receptors, such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor are themselves tyrosine kinases and have been shown to phosphorylate PLC-gamma 1 and increase intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The time course for PLC-gamma 1 phosphorylation, IP3 formation, and Ca2+ mobilization by PDGF differed from Ang II in VSMC. The kinetics of the PDGF effects were slower in onset and more prolonged than those of Ang II. In summary, these findings show that Ang II stimulates VSMC phosphoinositide hydrolysis in association with tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 and support the concept that Ang II-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is responsible for early signal transduction events."

https://openalex.org/W2007239250,"Editing reactions are essential for the high fidelity of information transfer in processes such as replication, RNA splicing, and protein synthesis. The accuracy of interpretation of the genetic code is enhanced by the editing reactions of aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, whereby amino acids are prevented from being attached to the wrong tRNAs. Amino acid discrimination is achieved through sieves that may overlap with or coincide with the amino acid binding site. With the class I Escherichia coli isoleucine tRNA synthetase, which activates isoleucine and occasionally misactivates valine, as an example, a rationally chosen mutant enzyme was constructed that lacks entirely its normal strong ability to distinguish valine from isoleucine by the initial amino acid recognition sieve. The misactivated valine, however, is still eliminated by hydrolytic editing reactions. These data suggest that there is a distinct sieve for editing that is functionally independent of the amino acid binding site."

https://openalex.org/W2013862371,"Nonlinear chemically dissipative mechanisms have been proposed as providing a possible underlying process for some aspects of biological self-organization, pattern formation, and morphogenesis. Nonlinearities during the formation of microtubular solutions result in a chemical instability and bifurcation between pathways leading to macroscopically self-organized states of different morphology. The self-organizing process, which contains reactive and diffusive contributions, involves chemical waves and differences in microtubule concentration in the sample. Patterns of similar appearance are observed at different distance scales. This behavior is in agreement with theories of chemically dissipative systems."

https://openalex.org/W1947993673,"Abstract The x-ray crystal structure of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) from Escherichia coli has been determined by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement to a resolution of 2.5 A. Crystals of SCS are tetragonal with a space group of P4(3)22 and unit cell dimensions of a = b = 98.47 A and c = 400.6 A. One molecule of SCS (142 kDa) is contained in the asymmetric unit. The current model has been refined to a conventional R factor of 21.6% with root mean square deviations from ideal stereochemistry of 0.022 A for bond lengths and 3.25 degrees for bond angles. The quaternary organization of the E. coli enzyme is an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramer. In this tetramer, the alpha-subunits interact only with the beta-subunits, whereas the beta-subunits interact to form the dimer of alpha beta-dimers. The two active site pockets are located at regions of contact between alpha- and beta-subunits. One molecule of coenzyme A is bound to each alpha-subunit at a typical nucleotide-binding motif, and His-246 of each alpha-subunit is phosphorylated. This phosphohistidine, a catalytic intermediate, is stabilized by two helix dipoles (the power helices), one from each of the two subunit types. A short segment of the beta-subunit from one alpha beta-dimer is in close proximity to the CoA-binding site of the other alpha beta-dimer, providing a possible rationale for the overall tetrameric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1552962359,"The receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is composed of at least two subunits, alpha and beta. In addition to the conserved cysteine residues and a WSxWS motif, the extracellular segments of both subunits have domains that are structurally related to a fibronectin type III domain. This structure is conserved in all members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. We isolated and characterized genomic DNA clones containing the entire coding sequences of the alpha subunit of the human GM-CSF receptor (hGMR alpha). The gene spans approximately 44 kilobases and has 13 exons. The major transcription initiation site was determined to be 195 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site. The putative promoter region lacks a typical TATA motif and an Sp1 binding site, but contains a purine-rich stretch about 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. This stretch is also found in the human interleukin 2 receptor gamma subunit and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor genes. We compared the exon-intron organization of the hGMR alpha gene with other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily and found the genomic organizations to be remarkably well conserved. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model for evolution of this gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1530945732,"As a result of alternative splicing, the Src-related tyrosine protein kinase p59fyn consists of two distinct isoforms termed FynB and FynT. Whereas the first product accumulates principally in brain, the second is expressed in hemopoietic cells, especially in T-lymphocytes. There is increasing evidence that the Fyn proteins are critical for normal functions of neuronal and lymphoid cells. To better understand the regulation of the catalytic function of p59fyn, we have tested the effects of mutating the major site of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation, tyrosine 528, on the biological and biochemical properties of this enzyme. Our studies showed that a tyrosine 528-->phenylalanine (Y528F) mutation converted either Fyn isoform into a dominant oncoprotein, capable of full transformation of rodent fibroblasts. However, while both Y528F p59fynT and Y528F p59fynB were able to transform NIH 3T3 cells, activated FynT molecules were consistently more efficient at this process. It was also found that expression of wild-type p59fyn or kinase-defective Y528F Fyn molecules failed to provoke transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, implying that the transforming capabilities of Y528F Fyn relied on deregulated catalytic activity. Contrary to an earlier study (Cheng, S. H., Espino, P. C., Marshall, J., Harvey, R., Merrill, J., and Smith, A. E. (1991) J. Virol. 65, 170-179), these findings showed that mutation of the conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue markedly stimulated the catalytic function of p59fyn in vivo, implying that dephosphorylation of tyrosine 528 is sufficient to produce biologically relevant activation of the Fyn kinase. Moreover, our results provided further indication that the two Fyn isoforms possess distinct biochemical activities that may dictate functional differences in normal cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2059838864,"Drosophila dorsoventral (DV) patterning and mammalian hematopoiesis are regulated by related signaling pathways (Toll, interleukin-1) and transcription factors (dorsal, nuclear factor-kappa B). These factors interact with related enhancers, such as the rhomboid NEE and kappa light chain enhancer, that contain similar arrangements of activator and repressor binding sites. It is shown that the kappa enhancer can generate lateral stripes of gene expression in transgenic Drosophila embryos in a pattern similar to that directed by the rhomboid NEE. Drosophila DV determinants direct these stripes through the corresponding mammalian cis regulatory elements in the kappa enhancer, including the kappa B site and kappa E boxes. These results suggest that enhancers can couple conserved signaling pathways to divergent gene functions."
https://openalex.org/W1591993193,"The lambda repressor exhibits structural characteristics of lock and key complementary through the helix-turn-helix motif, and of induced fit by virtue of DNA-dependent folding of the N-terminal arm. In both cases, molecular recognition is mediated by direct contacts between amino acids and DNA bases. The extent to which such contacts function as discrete elements in a protein-DNA recognition code is not known. Because of the relevance of protein recognition to the broader issue of protein design, and because the lambda system serves as a prototype for gene regulation, we have employed laser Raman and 1H NMR spectroscopy to compare free and operator-bound structures of lambda repressor variants which are known to exhibit altered DNA-binding specificities. Experimental design is based upon a previous biochemical study of mutations in the repressor N-terminal arm (K4Q) and helix-turn-helix motif (G48S) (Nelson, H. C. M., and Sauer, R. T. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 192, 27-38). These mutations, which were originally isolated by loss of function (K4Q) and second-site reversion (G48S), are of particular interest in light of their complex effects on sequence specificity at multiple positions in the operator site (Benson, N., Adams, C., and Youderian, P. (1992) Genetics 130, 17-26). Laser Raman and 1H NMR spectra of repressor variants carrying one (G48S) or two mutations (K4Q/G48S) are similar to those of the native wild type repressor and are in accord with the x-ray crystal structure. Remarkably, however, the complexes of wild type and mutant repressors exhibit extensive differences both in the global DNA structure and in the environments of key functional groups along the major groove. By demonstrating that single amino acid substitutions can induce global reorganization of a protein-DNA interface, the present results establish that repressor-operator recognition in solution cannot be explained in terms of a simple recognition code."
https://openalex.org/W1574202363,"The FLP protein that is encoded by the 2-microns plasmid of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a 45-kDa site-specific recombinase that belongs to the Int family of recombination proteins. FLP catalyzes a recombination event within the plasmid by binding specifically to each of three 13-base pair (bp) symmetry elements of the FLP recognition target (FRT). We have shown previously that partial proteolysis of the FLP protein by proteinase K resulted in a COOH-terminal fragment of size 32 kDa (P32) and an NH2-terminal fragment of 13 kDa (P13). In this study we have used footprinting with dimethyl sulfate to show that P32 binds specifically to the outer 9 bp of the 13 bp symmetry element. Binding of P13 alone to the FRT site was not detectable in this assay. However, when P13 and P32 were incubated together with the FRT site, protection of the remaining 4-bp region of the symmetry element was observed. To confirm these results we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-dependent UV cross-linking. P32 became cross-linked to the substrate that contained BrdU substitutions in the outer 9 bp of a 13-bp symmetry element, but not to one with the BrdU substitutions in the inner 4 bp. Reciprocally P13 cross-linked to the latter substrate but not the former. Cross-linking was both BrdU and ultraviolet light-dependent. This study indicates that the COOH-terminal domain (P32) of FLP recognizes the outer 9 bp of the 13-bp symmetry element, whereas its NH2-terminal domain (P13) is needed for protection of the inner 4 bp of each symmetry element."
https://openalex.org/W1485240753,"Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) catalyzes the COOH-terminal alpha-amidation of neuro-endocrine peptides through the sequential action of monooxygenase and lyase domains contained within this bifunctional protein. Alternative splicing leads to the expression of soluble and integral membrane bifunctional PAM proteins as well as a soluble monofunctional monooxygenase. In order to determine how alternative splicing affects post-translational modification of PAM proteins, we investigated the sulfation of PAM proteins expressed in stably transfected hEK-293 cells. Metabolic labeling with [35S]SO4(2-) or [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that [35S]SO4(2-) was efficiently incorporated into PAM proteins that have the noncatalytic exon A region following the monooxygenase domain (PAM-1 and PAM-4) and into a soluble bifunctional PAM protein (PAM-3). Alkaline hydrolysis, radiosequencing, and deglycosylation experiments demonstrated the presence of a sulfated tyrosine (Tyr965) in the COOH-terminal domain of PAM-3 and multiple sulfated O-glycans in the exon A region of PAM-1 and PAM-4. A mutant PAM-3 protein in which Tyr965 was changed to Ala965 (PAM-3/Y965A) was not sulfated and exhibited monooxygenase and lyase activities similar to those of wild type PAM-3. Pulse-chase and temperature block experiments showed that the PAM-3/Y965A protein exits the trans-Golgi network faster than wild type PAM-3. Thus inclusion of exon A results in the sulfation of O-glycans, while elimination of the transmembrane domain results in the sulfation of Tyr965."

https://openalex.org/W1511925312,"The three-dimensional structures of complexes of yeast apotransketolase with the coenzyme analogs 6'-methyl, N1'-pyridyl, and N3'-pyridyl thiamin diphosphate, respectively, were determined with protein crystallographic methods. All three coenzyme analogs bind to the enzyme in a fashion highly similar to the cofactor thiamin diphosphate. Thus, either one of the hydrogen bonds of the pyrimidine ring nitrogens to the protein is sufficient for proper binding and positioning of the cofactor. The lack of catalytic activity of the N3'-pyridyl analog is not due to incorrect orientation of the pyrimidine ring, but results from the absence of the hydrogen bond between the N1' nitrogen atom and the conserved residue Glu418. The structure analysis provides further evidence for the importance of this conserved interaction for enzymatic thiamin catalysis."
