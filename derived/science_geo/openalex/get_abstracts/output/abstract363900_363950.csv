https://openalex.org/W1918384196,"Autophagy is a degradative process that recycles long-lived and faulty cellular components. It is linked to many diseases and is required for normal development. ULK1, a mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a key role in the initial stages of autophagy, though the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report identification of a novel protein complex containing ULK1 and two additional protein factors, FIP200 and ATG13, all of which are essential for starvation-induced autophagy. Both FIP200 and ATG13 are critical for correct localization of ULK1 to the pre-autophagosome and stability of ULK1 protein. Additionally, we demonstrate by using both cellular experiments and a de novo in vitro reconstituted reaction that FIP200 and ATG13 can enhance ULK1 kinase activity individually but both are required for maximal stimulation. Further, we show that ATG13 and ULK1 are phosphorylated by the mTOR pathway in a nutrient starvation-regulated manner, indicating that the ULK1.ATG13.FIP200 complex acts as a node for integrating incoming autophagy signals into autophagosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001502548,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are frequently overexpressed in broad range of cancer types, where they alter cellular epigenetic programming to promote cell proliferation and survival. However, the mechanism by which HDACs become overexpressed in human cancers remains somewhat of a mystery. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional significance of miR-449a in prostate cancer cells. Using real-time PCR, we found that miR-449a is downregulated in prostate cancer tissues relative to patient-matched control tissue. Introduction of miR-449a into PC-3 prostate cancer cells resulted in cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and a senescent-like phenotype. In silico analysis of 3′-UTR regions identified a number of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation as putative targets of miR-449a. Using a luciferase 3′-UTR reporter system, we established that HDAC-1 (histone deacetylase 1), a gene that is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancer, is a direct target of miR-449a. Further, our data indicate that miR-449a regulates cell growth and viability in part by repressing the expression of HDAC-1 in prostate cancer cells. Our findings provide new insight into the function of miRNA in regulating HDAC expression in normal versus cancerous tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2045969462,"Inflammation under sterile conditions is a key event in autoimmunity and following trauma. Hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan released from the extracellular matrix after injury, acts as an endogenous signal of trauma and can trigger chemokine release in injured tissue. Here, we investigated whether NLRP3/cryopyrin, a component of the inflammasome, participates in the inflammatory response to injury or the cytokine response to hyaluronan. Mice with a targeted deletion in cryopyrin showed a normal increase in Cxcl2 in response to sterile injuries but had decreased inflammation and release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Similarly, the addition of hyaluronan to macrophages derived from cryopyrin-deficient mice increased release of Cxcl2 but did not increase IL-1β release. To define the mechanism of hyaluronan-mediated activation of cryopyrin, elements of the hyaluronan recognition process were studied in detail. IL-1β release was inhibited in peritoneal macrophages derived from CD44-deficient mice, in an MH-S macrophage cell line treated with antibodies to CD44, or by inhibitors of lysosome function. The requirement for CD44 binding and hyaluronan internalization could be bypassed by intracellular administration of hyaluronan oligosaccharides (10–18-mer) in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. Therefore, the action of CD44 and subsequent hyaluronan catabolism trigger the intracellular cryopyrin → IL-1β pathway. These findings support the hypothesis that hyaluronan works through IL-1β and the cryopyrin system to signal sterile inflammation.

Inflammation, as defined by changes in vascular permeability and leukocyte recruitment, is an essential step for the control of microbial invasion. Specific microbial products trigger this process through a diverse array of innate immune pattern recognition receptors. However, an inflammatory response independent of infection is also an important process for maintenance of biological homeostasis. For example, normal wound healing requires a controlled inflammatory response to enable the recruitment of monocytes and the release of growth factors required for repair. This response can occur in the absence of microbial stimuli. Furthermore, inflammation and the release of proinflammatory mediators is also associated with many diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease (1Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). These diseases are not well understood in terms of their triggers but rather are described by the subsequent release of proinflammatory mediators. Identification of the triggers of sterile inflammation represents an important goal with immediate diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Recent work has begun to elucidate pathways of inflammation that occur in the absence of microbial stimuli. Stress signals such as heat-shock proteins, intracellular components of necrotic cells not normally seen by immune cells, and components of the extracellular matrix have all been implicated as endogenous triggers of injury (2Beg A.A.

Among this group is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), 6The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; fl-HA, fluorescein-labeled hyaluronan; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; NLR, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat-containing; IL-1β, interleukin 1 β; MIP-2, macrophage inflammatory protein-2; FCAS, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecule pattern; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine; siRNA, small interference RNA; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; FCS, fetal calf serum; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; WT, wild type; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR. an important structural component of the extracellular matrix that is also a common component of bacterial surfaces. HA is synthesized at the cell surface and typically exists as a high molecular mass polymer greater than 106 Da and composed of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid (5Tammi R. Saamanen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Unlike other glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfates that encode specific activity by use of a diverse disaccharide sequence, HA is not sulfated or epimerized, and only changes in HA size, concentration, and location affect function. We have previously developed murine models of sterile injury to identify the innate elements that recognize and mediate sterile inflammation (7Taylor K.R. Yamasaki K. Radek K.A. Di Nardo A.

Our results demonstrated that (a) the initiation of a sterile intrinsic inflammatory process is dependent on TLR4 activation, (b) sterile injury induces HA accumulation at the injured site, and (c) sterile intrinsic inflammation resembles signaling events that are activated by HA. Furthermore, we have defined a novel alternative recognition complex for HA that involves TLR4, MD-2, and CD44 (7Taylor K.R. Yamasaki K. Radek K.A. Di Nardo A. Goodarzi H. Golenbock D. Beutler B.

Med. 2005; 11: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), these observations have provided new insight into mechanisms responsible for sterile inflammation. Recently, the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat-containing) family has been extensively analyzed as a group of intracellular pattern recognition receptors (11Meylan E. Tschopp J.R. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). NLRs have a leucine-rich repeat that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns including bacterial cell wall components and viral nucleic acids. NOD2 and NLR family, pyrin containing 3 (NLRP3)/cryopyrin are two of the best characterized NLRs. NOD2 recognizes the bacterial peptidoglycan-derived molecule muramyl dipeptide and activates the NF-κB pathway to induce inflammatory responses (12Tanabe T. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Zhu L. Qiu S.

Mutations of the NOD2 gene were identified in individuals with chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn disease (13Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H.

Mouse knockin mutants of NOD2, which have the same mutation in NOD2 as human patients with Crohn disease, showed elevated proinflammatory cytokines following muramyl dipeptide challenge or dextran sodium sulfate-induced bowel inflammation (16Maeda S.

NLRP3, also known as cyropyrin, CIAS1, NALP3, PYPAF1, forms an “inflammasome” with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1 to convert pro-IL-1β to active IL-1β (17Agostini L.

Mutations in NLRP3 were identified in individuals with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome, and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (18Hoffman H.M.

These individuals have recurrent or chronic inflammatory symptoms, including fever, arthritis, and a urticaria-like eruption characterized by neutrophilic infiltration. In FCAS, symptoms can be elicited by cold provocation by a mechanism that appears to be mediated through the skin (15Miceli-Richard C. Lesage S. Rybojad M. Prieur A.M. Manouvrier-Hanu S. Hafner R.

Assoc. 1940; 114: 1067-1068Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because disorders associated with mutations in NLRP3 are examples of inflammation under sterile conditions and HA has been shown to be a trigger of sterile inflammation, we sought to further understand the mechanism of the response to HA by examining the role of cryopyrin during injury and after exposure to HA. Our results show that cryopyrin and IL-1β are integral to sterile inflammation and the response to HA. These observations provide new insight into the function of HA as a “danger signal” of injury. Cells, Media, and Reagents—The mouse alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, catalogue number CRL-2019). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 mg/ml, respectively), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Human umbilical cord hyaluronan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HA preparations were free of DNA and protein contamination as preparations showed no absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. In addition, to ensure purity, 1-ml HA batches were boiled for 1 h and then run on two successive endotoxin-removal columns (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., East Falmouth, MA) to remove potential endotoxin contamination. Short HA oligosaccharides (4–18-mer, 0.777–3.5 kDa) were a generous gift from Dr. Paul L. DeAngelis at the University of Oklahoma. Hyalgan™, rooster comb HA, was purchased from Fidia Farmaceutici (Abano Terme, Italy). LPS (from Escherichia coli K12 D31m4 (RE), catalogue number 302) was obtained from LIST Biologics, Inc. (Campbell, CA). Amirolide hydrochloride hydrate, bafilomycin A1, and chroloquine diphosphate were obtained from Sigma. Rat anti-mouse CD44 monoclonal antibodies KM114 and IM7 were obtained from BD Biosciences and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. In Vitro Cell Stimulation and Sample Collection (MH-S Cells)—MH-S cells were grown to confluence in a 96-well flat bottom plate (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA). For experiments, media were removed from cells and replaced with media containing either HA or LPS at the indicated concentration. All stimulations were done in low serum media (1% FCS). In assays with chemical inhibitors and antibodies, cells were incubated with inhibitors or antibodies for 30 min, and then media were replaced with media containing HA and inhibitors. Cells were allowed to incubate for 18 h, and media were then collected and spun at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any debris. Cell media were stored at –20 °C until analysis. RNA was extracted from adherent cells after supernatant collection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was stored at –80 °C. Macrophage Collection and Stimulation in Vitro—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 ml of 5% thioglycolate. After 3 days, macrophages were collected through intraperitoneal lavage of 10 ml of RPMI 1640 media. Collected cells were counted and plated in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 mg/ml, respectively), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. After recovering, cells were stimulated for 18 h at 37 °C with the designated concentrations of HA, and supernatants and RNA were collected as described previously. Models of Skin Sterile Inflammation—Cryopyrin-deficient mouse (Nlrp3–/–) were generated as described previously (22Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A. Park J.H. Franchi L. Whitfield J. Barchet W. Colonna M. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Akira S. Nunez G. Nature. 2006; 440: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) and backcrossed 10 generations to a C57/B6 background. Tlr4–/– (C3H/HeJ), Tlr4+/+ controls, CD44-deficient mouse (Cd44tm1Hbg, Cd44–/–), and Cd44+/+ controls (B6129SF2/J) were all purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. For bead injection, 0.5 mg of Cytodex™ microcarrier beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were placed in 25-ml sterile endotoxin-free PBS, maintained in sterile conditions, and autoclaved. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, and fur was plucked from the back area and wiped with an ethanol pad. Two hundred fifty μl of Cytodex bead slurry were injected subcutaneously into the backspace using a sterile 25-gauge needle and sterile 1-ml syringe, creating a large bubble in the skin. For the liquid nitrogen sterile inflammation model, a CRY-AC liquid nitrogen dispenser with a 1-mm nozzle (Brymill Cryogenic Systems, Ellington, CT) was used to administer a steady liquid nitrogen 1-cm diameter circle to the mouse back for 15 s. This provided a frozen injury that was kept frozen for a full 60 s. After 48 h, mice were euthanized by over-anesthesia with halothane, and an 8-mm punch biopsy was used to isolate either injured or non-injured skin regions on the backs of the mice. The skin sections were placed in tube with 500 ml 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics) and were beaten with 2.4-mm zirconia beads by a mini-beadbeater apparatus (Bio-Spec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) for 50 s on full speed. Extracts were then sonicated for 5 min in ice-cold water and spun down at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and kept at –20 °C until analysis. Animal procedures were approved by the University of California San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System subcommittee on animal studies. ELISA—Mouse IL-1β and Cxcl2/MIP-2 in mouse skin and cultured media of MH-S cells and macrophages were measured by IL-1β and MIP-2 ELISA Duo set (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR—Real-time PCR was used to determine the induction of IL-1β and Cxcl2 mRNA following sterile injury and HA stimulation. cDNA was synthesized from RNA by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to analyze expression of Il1b (assay ID: Mm00434228-m1) and Cxcl2 (assay ID: Mm00436450-m1) as described by the manufacturer's instructions (76Applied BiosystemsUser Bulletin 2. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA2001Google Scholar). Gapdh mRNA was used as an internal control to validate RNA for each sample. Il1b and Cxcl2 mRNA were calculated as relative expression to Gapdh mRNA, and all data are presented as normalized data against each control (mean of non-treated skin or non-stimulated cells). Endosome/Lysosome Acidification—Endosome/lysosome acidification was monitored by LysoSensor™ Green DND-189 (Invitrogen), which is a pH-sensitive dye and fluoresces green in acidic compartments (pKa = 5.2). MH-S cells and macrophages were cultured in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc International) for 24 h. One μm of LysoSensor was added to culture media for 30 min. After washing with PBS once, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml HA for the designated time at 37 °C. Media were removed, and cells were fixed with ProLong™ antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and a coverslip. Fluorescence was observed using an Olympus BX41 fluorescent microscope (Scientific Instrument Co., Temecula, California). RNA Interference—Hyaluronidase-specific siRNAs and mock siRNA (siGLO) were obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). Transfection of siRNAs was performed with siLentFect™ transfection reagent (Bio-Rad). MH-S cells were cultured for 48 h and replaced with 5% FCS-containing media. siRNAs (final concentration at 10 nm) with transfection agent were added every 24 h up to 72 h (total of three transfections). In the case of both Hyal1 and Hyal2 siRNA treatment, 5 nm each of siRNA (total 10 nm in final concentration) was used for transfection. Then the medium was replaced with 100 μl of low serum media (1% FCS) containing HA. Culture media were collected 18 h after HA stimuli for cytokine ELISA. Fluorescein Labeling of Hyaluronan—HA was labeled with fluorescein-amine, isomer 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (23de Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). HA (50 mg) was dissolved in 40 ml of water for 12 h. The hyaluronan solution was then diluted in 20 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The HA solution was reacted with fluorescein amine (25 mg), acetalaldehyde (25 μl), and cyclohexyl isocyanide (25 μl) dissolved in 0.5 ml of DMSO at 22 °C for 5 h with continuous stirring. The product was precipitated in 240 ml of ethanol saturated with sodium chloride. The precipitate was allowed to sediment, and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitation was repeated until the product was free from non-bound fluorescein. This fluorescein-labeling method conjugates fluorescein in the carboxyl hydroxyl group of the N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) of hyaluronan. Thus, hyaluronidase and chondroitinase digestion does not interfere with the fluorescein conjugated to GlcNAc. The fluorescein-labeled HA (fl-HA) was dialyzed against distilled water with a 1-kDa cutoff filter for further experiments, and in some cases, further defined by dialysis first through a 30-kDa dialysis membrane and then collected in the retentate of 10-kDa dialysis (Microcon™, Millipore). HA Internalization—MH-S cells and peritoneal macrophages from WT and Cd44–/– mice were cultured in 8-well chamber slides (Nunc International) for 24 h. fl-HA was added to culture media for the indicated time. After washing with PBS thrice, cells were fixed with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and a coverslip. Fluorescence was observed using an Olympus BX41 fluorescent microscope (Scientific Instrument Co.) or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). HA Stimulation by Lipofection—DOTAP™ liposomal transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Applied Science and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2.5 μg of HA oligosaccharides were incubated with 3 μl of DOTAP for 30 min in a final volume of 15 μl of serum free media. After incubation, 100 μl of low serum media (1% FCS) were added. MH-S cells were stimulated with 0.2 μg/ml LPS in low serum media (1% FCS) for 3 h prior to HA oligosaccharide stimulation. After LPS-priming, media were replaced with the HA oligosaccharides and DOTAP-containing media. Culture media were collected 18 h after treatment for cytokine ELISA. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and are representative of at least three separate experiments. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine significance, which was analyzed by GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.), unless otherwise stated. Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine significance in the experiment of dose-dependent IL-1β and Cxcl2 secretion by HA. Sterile Injury Induces Inflammation through Cryopyrin and IL-1β—Tissue injury results in an inflammatory response. Models of skin injury that lack exposure to microbes, such as freezing or disruption of the matrix by subcutaneous sterile bead injection, induce the release of fragments of HA that in turn stimulates a TLR4-dependent increase in CXCL2 chemokines (7Taylor K.R. Yamasaki K. Radek K.A. Di Nardo A. Goodarzi H. Golenbock D. Beutler B. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18265-18275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To further examine other pathways that may be involved in the tissue response to injury, we examined the response of cryopyrin-deficient mice (Nlrp3–/–) to sterile injury in two model systems. Following sterile injury by either liquid nitrogen freezing or dermal disruption through injection of sterile beads, cryopyrin null mice showed less skin erythema than control animals (Fig. 1a). Because cryopyrin could potentially influence this phenotype through its action on IL-1β release (22Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A. Park J.H. Franchi L. Whitfield J. Barchet W.

Tschopp J. Nature. 2006; 440: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar), we measured the abundance of IL-1β in the lesional skin of these animals and observed that there was no increase in IL-1β in cryopyrin null mice as compared with controls, whereas similar increases in Cxcl2/MIP-2 were observed in both mice (Fig. 1, b and c). This selective lack in IL-1β increase but not Cxcl2/MIP-2 in cryopyrin null mice contrasts with Tlr4–/– mice that have much less IL-1β (Fig. 1d) and, as reported previously, Cxcl2/MIP-2 than controls (7Taylor K.R. Yamasaki K. Radek K.A. Di Nardo A. Goodarzi H. Golenbock D. Beutler B. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18265-18275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that different intracellular signaling pathways regulate IL-1β and Cxcl2/MIP-2 induction following sterile injury and that the local inflammatory response is associated with IL-1β production and not solely related to the abundance of Cxcl2/MIP-2. HA Induces IL-1β Secretion through Cryopyrin—Because the release of fragments of HA from the extracellular matrix has previously been associated with the sterile inflammatory response (7Taylor K.R.

Biol. 2007; 23: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we next examined whether HA can directly induce IL-1β release. Peritoneal macrophages of WT mice, but not cryopyrin null mice (Nlrp3–/–), showed a large increase in IL-1β release (Fig. 2a). The presence of cryopyrin did not affect the release of Cxcl2/MIP-2 in response to HA or LPS (Fig. 2b). HA-dependent IL-1β release showed dose dependence, and 10–25 μg/ml HA induced the highest release of IL-1β (Fig. 2c). Diminished IL-1β induction by HA digested with hyaluronidase or chondroitinase ABC confirmed HA as the active molecule (supplemental Fig. 1, a and b). These doses of HA also induced Cxcl2/MIP-2, but lack of cryopyrin did not affect Cxcl2/MIP-2 induction (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, HA induced an increase in IL-1β and Cxcl2/MIP-2 mRNA in both WT and cryopyrin null mice, although the magnitude of this response was slightly lower in cryopyrin null mice (Fig. 2, e and f). In contrast to the cryopyrin null mice, IL-1β release and transcription were suppressed in macrophages derived from Tlr4-deficient mice (Fig. 2, g and h). These data again show that HA induces the release of Cxcl2/MIP-2 and IL-1β by different mechanisms and that transcriptional control was not dependent on cryopyrin but on TLR4. CD44 Is Required for HA-dependent IL-1β Release—CD44 binds HA and associates with TLR4 for HA-dependent Cxcl2/MIP-2 induction (7Taylor K.R. Yamasaki K. Radek K.A. Di Nardo A. Goodarzi H. Golenbock D.

Therefore, to further understand the mechanism of IL-1β release in response to HA, the role of CD44 was studied. CD44-deficient macrophages showed significantly less IL-1β release following HA stimulation (Fig. 3a, p < 0.001). A similar result was observed in the MH-S macrophage cell line pretreated with anti-CD44 antibodies (Fig. 3b, p < 0.01), demonstrating that CD44 is involved in the release of both IL-1β and Cxcl2/MIP-2.

https://openalex.org/W2020272282,"Glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) is a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that plays a major role in the reductive detoxification of peroxides in cells. In permanently transfected cells with approximate 2-fold overexpression of GPx-1, we found that intracellular accumulation of oxidants in response to exogenous hydrogen peroxide was diminished, as was epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated Akt activation in response to hydrogen peroxide or EGF stimulation. Knockdown of GPx-1 augmented EGFR-mediated Akt activation, whereas overexpression of catalase decreased Akt activation, suggesting that EGFR signaling is regulated by redox mechanisms. To determine whether mitochondrial oxidants played a role in these processes, cells were pretreated with a mitochondrial uncoupler prior to EGF stimulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial function attenuated EGF-mediated activation of Akt in control cells but had no additional effect in GPx-1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that GPx-1 overexpression decreased EGFR signaling by decreasing mitochondrial oxidants. Consistent with this finding, GPx-1 overexpression decreased global protein disulfide bond formation, which is dependent on mitochondrially produced oxidants. GPx-1 overexpression, in permanently transfected or adenovirus-treated cells, also caused overall mitochondrial dysfunction with a decrease in mitochondrial potential and a decrease in ATP production. GPx-1 overexpression also decreased EGF- and serum-mediated [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, indicating that alterations in GPx-1 can attenuate cell proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that GPx-1 can modulate redox-dependent cellular responses by regulating mitochondrial function."

X-linked IAP, the prototypical IAP in mammals, inhibits apoptosis largely through direct inhibition of the initiator caspase-9 and the effector caspase-3 and -7. Two additional IAP family members, cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, were once thought to also inhibit caspases, but more recent studies have suggested otherwise. Here we demonstrate that cIAP1 does not significantly inhibit the proteolytic activities of effector caspases on fluorogenic or endogenous substrates. However, cIAP1 does bind to caspase-3 and -7 and does so, remarkably, at distinct steps prior to or following the removal of their prodomains, respectively. Indeed, cIAP1 bound to an exposed IAP-binding motif, AKPD, on the N terminus of the large subunit of fully mature caspase-7, whereas cIAP1 bound to partially processed caspase-3 in a manner that required its prodomain and cleavage between its large and small subunits but did not involve a classical IAP-binding motif. As a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, cIAP1 ubiquitinated caspase-3 and -7, concomitant with binding, in a reaction catalyzed by members of the UbcH5 subfamily (ubiquitin carrier protein/ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and in the case of caspase-3, differentially by UbcH8. Moreover, wild-type caspase-7 and a chimeric caspase-3 (bearing the AKPD motif) were degraded in vivo in a proteasome-dependent manner. Thus, cIAPs likely suppress apoptosis, at least in part, by facilitating the ubiquitination and turnover of active effector caspases in cells.

Caspases are synthesized as single-chain zymogens, containing a prodomain, as well as large and small subunits that include residues required for substrate recognition and cleavage (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). During death receptor or mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, the long prodomain-containing initiator caspase-8/10 and -9 are recruited via their adapter proteins, Fas-associated death domain and apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), to multimeric caspase-activating complexes known as the death-inducing signaling complex and the apoptosome, respectively (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 2Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the latter case, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is required to mediate the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytosol, where it stimulates dATP/ATP-dependent oligomerization of Apaf-1 into the apoptosome (2Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Once recruited, all initiator caspases are concentrated within their respective complexes and are thought to be activated as a result of dimerization, with concomitant autocatalytic cleavage of the activation loops that separate their large and small subunits (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, unlike caspase-8 and -10, caspase-9 must remain bound to the apoptosome to exhibit significant catalytic activity, so that in addition to promoting dimerization, the apoptosome may also induce conformational changes in caspase-9 that are necessary for its activation (3Bratton S.B.

PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 1079-1087Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast to initiator caspases, effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7, contain short prodomains and exist normally as latent dimers, wherein their activation loops sterically hinder substrate access and hold the substrate binding pocket in an inactive conformation (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Effector caspases are directly activated by caspase-8, -9, and -10, and following cleavage of caspase-3 between its large and small subunits, the two-chain p20/p12 form becomes a catalytically active heterotetramer and undergoes subsequent autocatalytic processing between its prodomain and large subunits to generate the fully mature p17/p12 form of the enzyme (7Han Z. Hendrickson E.A. Bremner T.A. Wyche J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13432-13436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Similarly, procaspase-7 is also activated following cleavage of its activation loop to generate its two-chain p22/p12 form; however, it remains unclear whether removal of its prodomain in cells (to generate its p19/p12 form) is accomplished primarily via autocatalysis, active caspase-3, or perhaps by serine proteases at a non-aspartate residue (8Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 and -7 exhibit significant sequence and structural homology, differing primarily in their short prodomains. Despite this fact, caspase-3 processes a wider array of protein substrates during apoptosis and is largely responsible for dismantling the cell (10Walsh J.G. Cullen S.P. Sheridan C. Luthi A.U. Gerner C. Martin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 12815-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, interesting questions remain regarding the physiological roles of caspase-7, whether caspase-7 activity is differentially regulated compared with caspase-3, and what structural features determine (and in some cases limit) its substrate specificity. Given the devastating consequences of unfettered caspase activation, cells have evolved mechanisms to regulate caspase activity. For example, IAPs, originally identified in baculoviruses, possess one or more baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains, and at least one of the eight family members, XIAP, selectively inhibits the activities of caspase-9, -3, and -7 (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 11Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the BIR3 domain in XIAP binds to an exposed IBM on the N terminus of the small subunit of processed caspase-9, situated directly above the active site, and limits the access of substrates (12Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 13Shiozaki E.N.

By contrast, the linker region (located between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains in XIAP) lies across the active sites of caspase-3 and -7 and binds in a reverse orientation to substrates, thereby preventing cleavage of the linker while simultaneously preventing the access of substrates (14Riedl S.J.

The BIR2 domain then stabilizes the linker-caspase-3 (and linker-caspase-7) interactions further by binding to an exposed IBM on the N terminus of the small subunit in the adjacent caspase dimer (14Riedl S.J.

Importantly, IAP antagonists, such as Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2, are normally sequestered to the intermembrane space of mitochondria and are released (along with cytochrome c) into the cytoplasm during apoptosis. As IAP antagonists also possess IBMs, they bind to BIR domains and prevent or relieve the inhibition of caspases by IAPs (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Previously, two additional IAP family members, cIAP1 and cIAP2, were also thought to inhibit caspases, but more recent studies suggest that these IAPs bind but do not inhibit caspases (17Eckelman B.P.

XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 possess C-terminal RING zinc finger domains with E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activities capable of catalyzing the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of cellular targets, including themselves (27Silke J.

However, although there is some evidence to support a direct role for ubiquitination in the regulation of effector caspases by XIAP (35Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 36Chen L. Smith L. Wang Z. Smith J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 334-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the role of cIAPs in this process remains unclear, particularly in vivo. We demonstrate herein that cIAP1 binds to caspase-3 and -7 at unique steps in their processing, prior to or following the removal of their prodomains, respectively. Moreover, rather than directly inhibiting these effector caspases, cIAP1 ubiquitinates them and targets them for proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby suppressing apoptosis. Reagents—Antibodies to caspase-3 and -7 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog numbers 9665, 9661, and 9491; Danvers, MA) or BD Biosciences (catalog number 551238; San Jose, CA). Actin antibody was purchased from Oncogene (catalog number CP01; Cambridge, MA), Myc antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog number 2276), and HA antibody from Covance (catalog number MMS-101R; Emeryville, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies to rabbit and mouse IgG were obtained from DakoCytomation (catalog number P0448; Carpinteria, CA) and Sigma (catalog number A8924), respectively. Mouse IgM was purchased from Calbiochem (catalog number 401225), and anti-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody-agarose affinity gel (catalog number A2220) was obtained from Sigma. Plasmids—Procaspase-3 and -7 were cloned into BamHI-XhoI sites of pET21b vector (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). SGIS procaspase-7, Δ24–27 procaspase-7, SGVD procaspase-7, AKPD procaspase-3, SGPI procaspase-3, and various doubly swapped chimeras were then generated by PCR-SOE and cloned into pET21b using the following primers: C7-US, 5′-GTCGGGATCCGATGGCAGA-3′; C7-DS, 5′-GGTGCTCGAGTTGACTGAAG-3′; C7-SGIS-US, 5′-GTGGATTCTGGAATATCCCGGTCCTCGTTTGTACCGTC-3′; C7-SGIS-DS, 5′-GGACCGGGATATTCCAGAATCCACTGAATCTTCATTTGCTG-3′; C7-Δ24–27-US, 5′-AATGAAGATTCAGTGGATCGGTCCTCGTTTGTACCGTC-3′; C7-Δ24–27-DS, 5′-CGGTACAAACGAGGACCGATCCACTGAATCTTCATTTGCTG-3′; C7-SGVD-US, 5′-AGGCCGACTCGGGGGTCGACAATGACACAGATGC-3′; C7-SGVD-DS, 5′-GCATCTGTGTCATTGTCGACCCCCGAGTCGGCCT-3′; C7-D28A-US, 5′-AATGAAGATTCAGTGGCTGCTAAGCCAGACCG-3′; C7-D28A-DS, 5′-CGGTCTGGCTTAGCAGCCACTGAATCTTCATT-3′; C3-US, 5′-GTCGGGATCCCATGGAGAAC-3′; C3-DS, 5′-GGTGCTCGAGGTGATAAAAATA-3′; C3-AKPD-US, 5′-ATGGACGCTAAGCCAGACCTGGACAACAGTTATAAAATGGAT-3′; C3-AKPD-DS, 5′-GTCCAGGTCTGGCTTAGCGTCCATTGATTCGCTTCCATGT-3′; C3-SGPI-US, 5′-GAGACAGACAGTGGTCCTATTGATGACATGGCG-3′; C3-SGPI-DS, 5′-ACGCCATGTCATCAATAGGACCACTGTCTGTCTC-3′; C3-D23A-US, 5′-GGAAGCGAATCAATGGCCTCTGGAATATCCCTG-3′; C3-D23A-DS, 5′-CAGGGATATTCCAGAGGCCATTGATTCGCTTCC-3′; C3-GGVD-US, 5′-TGGCATTGAGACAGACGGTGGTGTTGATGATGA-3′; and C3-GGVD-DS, 5′-TCATCATCAACACCACCGTCTGTCTCAATGCCA-3′. WT procaspase-3 and AKPD procaspase-3 were then subcloned into BamHI-XhoI of pcDNA3.1-Myc-His6 (Invitrogen). Finally, for all of the caspase-3 constructs, the caspase cleavage site NSVD9↓S was mutated (D9A) to ensure that autocatalytic removal of the prodomain occurred only at Asp-28. To generate Ub fusion constructs of SGIS-caspase-3-myc, AKPD-caspase-3-myc, AKPD-caspase-7-myc, and SGIS-caspase-7-myc, residues 33–276 of caspase-3 and residues 28–303 of caspase-7 were subcloned into BamHI-XhoI of pDhaUb (kindly provided by Prof. Alexander Varshavsky, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena), containing an N-terminal mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), HA tag, and Ub. The BamHI site was subsequently replaced with either an AKPD or SGIS by site-directed mutagenesis, so that the final glycine residue in Ub was immediately followed by an alanine or serine residue, respectively. Each of the DHFR-HA-Ub-caspase constructs was then subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-Myc-His6. The FLAG-Ub construct was generated by cloning Ub into the BamHI/NotI sites of pEBB-FLAG. XIAP and cIAP1 were cloned into EcoRI-NotI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). XIAP-BIR1-BIR2 was then generated by introducing a stop codon into XIAP at residue 242 by site-directed mutagenesis. p23 cochaperone in pET45b and truncated PARP (residues 1–373) in pET24b were kindly provided by Prof. Seamus J. Martin (Trinity College, Ireland) and Prof. Hung-wen Liu (University of Texas, Austin), respectively. All of the E2 constructs were kindly provided by Prof. Aaron Ciechanover (Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). Recombinant Protein Expression—Protein expression was induced in bacterial cultures with 0.1–1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when bacterial densities reached an OD of 0.4–0.6. Cultures were then incubated as follows: 16 h at 27 °C for GST-XIAP-BIR1-BIR2; 16 h at 24 °C for GST-cIAP1; 4 h at 28 °C for caspase-3; 16 h at 37 °C for caspase-7; 16 h at 37 °C for all E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes; and 16 h at 18 °C for PARP-(1–373). GST-tagged proteins were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose resin (Novagen), and His6-tagged proteins were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using Ni2+-charged resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Stock protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay or, in the case of active caspases, were determined by active site titration using Z-VAD-fmk and/or DEVD-CHO (37Garcia-Calvo M.

Methods (San Diego). 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Protein Binding Assays—GST-tagged cIAP1 and XIAP-BIR1-BIR2 (4 μm for Coomassie; 400 nm for Western blotting) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Novagen) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with GST-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) and incubated with recombinant caspases (4 μm for Coomassie; 12 nm for Western blotting) in 500 μl of GST-PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, after extensive washing with assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0), bound proteins were eluted by incubating the protein-bound beads in GSH elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm GSH reduced) for 20 min at 25 °C. Proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Caspase Assays—WT and chimeric caspase-3 and -7 (10 nm) were incubated with IAPs (40 nm) in caspase buffer (50 mm PIPES/KOH, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.2) for 30 min at 37 °C. The caspase-3/7 substrate, DEVD-AMC (final 20 nm; Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was then added, and the release of AMC was monitored (λex/λem = 380 nm/460 nm) using a Victor3 plate reader. PARP and p23 Cochaperone Cleavage Assays—WT and chimeric caspases-3 and -7 (400 nm) were incubated ±cIAP1 or XIAP-BIR1-BIR2 (800 nm) in buffer (10 mm PIPES/KOH, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.2) for 30 min at 25 °C. Truncated PARP (10 μg; 49 kDa) was then added and incubated at 25 °C for indicated times. Similarly, WT and chimeric caspase-3 and -7 (150 nm) were incubated with p23 cochaperone (10 μg) in buffer at 25 °C for indicated times, and the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Ubiquitination Assays—Reactions (20 μl) containing wild-type or methylated Ub (2 μm; Biomol), His-tagged E1 (60 nm; Biomol), and His-tagged human UbcH3, UbcH5a-c, UbcH6, UbcH7, or UbcH8 (200 nm; expressed and purified in-house) were incubated along with Mg2+/ATP (4 mm), caspase proteins (100 nm), and cIAP1 protein (100 nm) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture). In some incubations the polycaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (25 μm) was also included, as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and then quenched with 2× Laemmli loading dye and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cell Culture and Transfections—MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 5% FetalPlex (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), and 4 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 and passaged every 3 days. Cells were transfected with 1.5 μg/ml plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and for stable transfections, cells were subsequently selected in 1.5 mg/ml G418. Individual clones were then isolated and tested for the expression of caspase-3 by immunoblotting. Cell Viability Assays—MCF-7 cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and resuspended in annexin-V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and/or propidium iodide-labeled cell populations were counted by flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Western Blotting—Cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Na2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) with protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were assayed for protein concentration (Bradford assay), mixed with Laemmli loading dye, and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), and blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were then exposed to primary and secondary antibodies as indicated, and protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—All experiments were performed at least three times. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. Multiple group comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc analysis (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). cIAP1 Binds to Active Caspase-3 and -7 through Distinct Mechanisms at Steps Prior to or Following Removal of Their Prodomains—Although once reported to inhibit caspase-3 and -7, more recent studies suggest that cIAPs bind to these effector caspases but do not inhibit their activities (17Eckelman B.P. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3254-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18Tenev T. Zachariou A. Wilson R. Ditzel M. Meier P. Nat.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). In an effort to further clarify the binding mechanisms of cIAP1 for caspase-3 and -7, we began by examining the protein-protein interactions between fully processed recombinant caspase-7 and full-length GST-cIAP1. As expected, cIAP1 interacted with WT active caspase-7, resulting in the pulldown of the p19 large subunit (LS) and the associated p12 small subunit (SS) (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2). Surprisingly, however, cIAP1 failed to bind WT p17/p12 caspase-3 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Consistent with a previous report (18Tenev T. Zachariou A. Wilson R. Ditzel M. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we found that removal of a putative IBM (Δ24–27, i.e. ΔAKPD) from the large subunit of caspase-7 resulted in an active enzyme that could no longer bind to cIAP1 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 3). To determine whether the AKPD motif was sufficient to mediate IAP binding to effector caspases, we generated caspase-3/7 chimeric enzymes, in which the AKPD motif from caspase-7 was replaced with the corresponding motif in caspase-3 and vice versa, resulting in SGIS caspase-7 and AKPD caspase-3 (Fig. 1A). Following expression in bacteria, AKPD caspase-3 and SGIS caspase-7 underwent autocatalytic activation, wherein their prodomains were removed, exposing the AKPD and SGIS motifs, respectively. Remarkably, in subsequent pulldown experiments, we observed that GST-cIAP1 could now bind to AKPD caspase-3 (Fig. 1C, lane 2), whereas SGIS caspase-7 exhibited significantly reduced binding compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Thus, despite their high degree of sequence homology, caspase-3 and -7 differed dramatically in their abilities to bind cIAP1, and the mere presence of the AKPD motif in caspase-7 was required and sufficient to mediate this interaction. During our studies, Salvesen and co-workers (14Riedl S.J. Renatus M. Schwarzenbacher R. Zhou Q. Sun C. Fesik S.W. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 16Scott F.L. Denault J.B. Riedl S.J. Shin H. Renatus M. Salvesen G.S.

Therefore, to determine whether this second site might also participate in binding to cIAP1, we generated caspase-3/7 chimeras in which the SGPI motif in caspase-7 was replaced with the SGVD motif in caspase-3 and vice versa (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, in subsequent pulldown experiments, cIAP1 bound to SGPI caspase-3 with higher affinity than WT caspase-3 but wit"

These data suggest that MUP1 regulates systemic glucose and/or lipid metabolism through the paracrine/autocrine regulation of the hepatic gluconeogenic and/or lipogenic programs, respectively. Circulatory glucose is maintained within a narrow range by a sophisticated regulatory system to provide a constant fuel supply for cell metabolism. The liver plays a key role in the maintenance of systemic glucose homeostasis. In the absorptive state, ingested glucose is taken up by hepatocytes and converted to glycogen and lipids. In the postabsorptive state, hepatocytes produce glucose, which is secreted into the circulation. Insulin and counter-regulatory hormones (e.g. glucagon and glucocorticoids) regulate hepatic glucose production mainly by regulating the hepatic gluconeogenic program. Insulin decreases hepatic glucose production by suppressing the expression of key gluconeogenic genes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) 2The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MUP, major urinary protein; hMUP, human MUP; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; GTT, glucose tolerance test; ITT, insulin tolerance test; MUP, major urinary protein; β-gal, β-galactosidase; STZ, streptozotocin; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element binding protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; HFD, high fat diet; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time RT-PCR; HGP, hepatic glucose production; PGC1α, proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1α; WT, wild type. and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase); conversely, counter-regulatory hormones increase hepatic glucose production by stimulating the transcription of these genes.

Hyperglycemia initiates pathological changes in multiple tissues, contributing to neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disorders in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The liver secretes a variety of proteins, including insulin like-growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) and major urinary proteins (MUPs) (2.Clemmons D.R.

These observations raise the possibility that MUP1 may be involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. MUP1 is a lipocalin family member containing a characteristic eight-stranded β-barrel structure (5.Cavaggioni A. Mucignat-Caretta C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9.Macek P. Novak P. Krizova H. Zidek L. Sklenar V. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mouse MUP genes are highly polymorphic, including 20 discrete isoforms (10.Chamero P. Marton T.F. Logan D.W. Flanagan K. Cruz J.R. Saghatelian A. Cravatt B.F. Stowers L. Nature. 2007; 450: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Individual mice express 4–6 isoforms of MUPs (11.Robertson D.H. Hurst J.L. Bolgar M.S. Gaskell S.J. Beynon R.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 786-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different isoforms of MUPs are very similar in DNA sequences (>85% identity). Comparative genomic analyses identify nine MUP genes in rats and a single MUP gene in other mammals (10.Chamero P. Marton T.F. Logan D.W. Flanagan K. Cruz J.R. Saghatelian A. Cravatt B.F. Stowers L. Nature. 2007; 450: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).

MUP1 binds via its central hydrophobic pocket to lipophilic molecules, including volatile pheromones (small odorant molecules) (5.Cavaggioni A. Mucignat-Caretta C. Biochim. Biophys.

MUP1 slowly releases its bound volatile odorant molecules from urinary scent marks into the air, thereby increasing the half-life of pheromones (15.Hurst J.L. Robertson D.H.L. Tolladay U. Beynon R.J. Anim. Behav. 1998; 55: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, MUP themselves also act as pheromone ligands to mediate chemical signaling in mice (10.Chamero P. Marton T.F. Logan D.W. Flanagan K. Cruz J.R. Saghatelian A. Cravatt B.F. Stowers L. Nature. 2007; 450: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that in addition to mediating chemical signaling, circulatory MUP1 also regulates systemic glucose metabolism, presumably by regulating the hepatic gluconeogenic and/or lipogenic programs. Animals—Wild-type and db/db mice were in the C57BL/6 genetic background and purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Mice were fed either normal chow (9% kcal from fat) or a high fat diet (45% kcal from fat, catalog number D12451, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ), and had a free access to water. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the protocols approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA). MUP1 Adenoviral Preparation and Purification—Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and used to synthesize the first strand cDNAs by reverse transcription using oligo(dT)12–18 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). Mouse MUP1 cDNA was generated by PCR using these hepatic cDNAs and verified by DNA sequencing. Full-length MUP1 cDNA was used to generate recombinant MUP1 adenoviruses using a pAdEasy kit (QBiogene, Carlsad, CA). Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified in QBI-293A cells and purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. Blood Glucose and Insulin—Blood samples were collected from mouse tail veins using heparin-pretreated capillary tubes. Blood glucose was measured by a glucometer (Bayer Corp., Tarrytown, NY), and plasma insulin was measured using a rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem, Inc., Chicago, IL). Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) and Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)—For GTT, mice were fasted overnight and intraperitoneally injected with d-glucose. Blood glucose was measured 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection. For ITT, mice were fasted for 6 h (from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) and intraperitoneally injected with human insulin. Blood glucose was monitored 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after insulin injection. Streptozotocin (STZ) Treatment and Adenoviral Infection—STZ (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 4.5) immediately before use. Wild-type male mice (10 weeks) were intraperitoneally injected with STZ (200 mg/kg of body weight). Blood glucose was measured in randomly fed mice 3 days after STZ injection. Additional STZ (100 mg/kg of body weight) was injected into a few mice whose blood glucose levels were below 300 mg/dl. Type 1 diabetes was defined by hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels were >300 mg/dl in randomly fed mice). MUP1 or β-galactosidase (β-gal) (control) adenoviruses were administrated into diabetic mice via tail vein injection at 2 × 1011 viral particles per mouse. Hepatic Glycogen Contents—Liver tissues were boiled in 30% KOH. Glycogen was precipitated with ethanol and air-dried. Glycogen pellet was dissolved in water and digested with amyloglucosidase (Sigma) at 42 °C. Glycogen-derived glucose was measured using a glucose assay kit (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX). Hepatic Triglyceride Contents—Liver tissues were homogenized in chloroform:methanol (2:1) and separated by centrifugation. The organic phase was air-dried. Triglycerides was dissolved and hydrolyzed in 3 m KOH at 70 °C. Glycerol concentration was measured using a glycerol assay kit (Sigma) and converted to triglyceride concentration. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—Mice were fasted overnight and euthanized at 10 am. Liver was isolated immediately and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the liver and used to synthesize the first strand cDNAs by reverse transcription using oligo(dT)12–18 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The mRNA abundance of various molecules was measured using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR kit and the Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as we previously described (16.Ren D. Li M. Duan C. Rui L. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 1% Nonidet P-40; 150 mm NaCl; 2 mm EGTA; 1 mm Na3VO4; 100 mm NaF; 10 mm Na4P2O7; 1 mm benzamidine; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration in tissue lysate was measure using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Tissue extracts were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h and with protein A-agarose beads (RepliGen Corp., Waltham, MA) for an additional hour at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes absorbed on the protein A-agarose beads were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 1% Nonidet P-40; 150 mm NaCl; 2 mm EGTA) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol; 10% glycerol; 0.005% bromphenol blue). Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted with indicated antibodies, and visualized by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE). Primary Hepatocyte Culture and the Gluconeogenic Assays—Hepatocytes were isolated from male mice (9 weeks in C57BL/6 background). Briefly, mice were anesthetized, and the liver was perfused with 0.5 mg/ml type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Co.) via the inferior vena cava to isolate hepatocytes. Cells were seeded for 3 h on collagen-coated 12-well plates in Williams Medium E (catalog number: W4125, Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (∼4 × 105 cells/well). For viral infection experiments, cells were incubated with β-gal or MUP1 adenoviruses (2 × 109 viral particles/well) for 2 h, cultured overnight (∼16 h) in Williams Medium E supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and then subjected to hepatic glucose production (HGP) assays. For conditioned medium treatment experiments, hepatocytes were incubated with β-gal (control) or MUP1 conditioned medium overnight and then subjected to HGP assays. To prepare conditioned medium, HepG2 cells were infected with β-gal or MUP1 adenoviruses for 4 h and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were subsequently grown in Williams Medium E supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, and culture medium (conditioned medium) was collected 24 h later. For HGP assays, primary hepatocyte cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with HGP buffer (phenol red- and glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.8% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm sodium dl-lactate) in the presence or absence of MIX (10 μm N6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt and 100 nm dexamethasone). Culture buffer was collected 4 h later and used to measure glucose using Glucose LiquiColor kits (Fisher Scientific Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as means ± standard error of the mean (S.E.). Two-tailed Student's t tests were used for comparisons between two groups. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Are Associated with Reduced MUP1 Expression—To determine whether MUP1 expression is regulated by metabolism, male mice (15–16 weeks) were either fasted overnight or refed for 4 h after fasting. Total hepatic RNA was prepared and used to measure the expression of MUP1 and key gluconeogenic genes by real-time qRT-PCR. Refeeding significantly reduced the expression of PEPCK and PGC1α, two important gluconeogenic genes (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, refeeding also reduced MUP1 expression by 72% (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that MUP1 expression is regulated by metabolic signals. Metabolism is profoundly changed in obesity and type 2 diabetes. To determine whether MUP1 expression is altered in obesity and type 2 diabetes, wild-type and db/db mice (10–11 weeks) were fasted overnight. Total hepatic RNA was prepared and used to measure hepatic MUP1 expression by qRT-PCR. db/db mice are deficient of functional leptin receptor and commonly used as a genetic model of obesity and type 2 diabetes. db/db mice were severely obese (body weight: db/db, 40.8 ± 1.6 g, n = 5; wild type (WT), 20.0 ± 0.3 g, n = 5, p < 0.05) and hyperglycemic (fasting blood glucose: db/db, 191.8 ± 19.5 mg/dl, n = 5; WT, 70.8 ± 1.7 mg/dl, n = 5, p < 0.05). Importantly, MUP1 expression was reduced by ∼90% in db/db mice (Fig. 1B). To determine whether dietary fat-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes are also associated with a reduction in MUP1 expression, wild-type male mice (8 weeks) were fed an HFD for 8 weeks. As expected, HFD-fed mice developed both obesity (normal chow: 24.0 ± 0.4 g, n = 8; HFD: 35.7 ± 1.1 g, n = 9, p < 0.05) and hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose: normal chow: 80.4 ± 5.9 mg/dl, n = 8; HFD: 136.7 ± 8.9 mg/dl, n = 9, p < 0.05). MUP1 expression was decreased by ∼68% in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 1C). To determine whether MUP1 protein is also reduced in diabetic mice, liver extracts were prepared from wild-type and db/db mice and immunoblotted with anti-MUP1 antibody (αMUP1) or α-tubulin, respectively. Two forms of MUP1 were detected in wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). These two forms may be generated through differential proteolytic cleavages of the MUP1 precursors. Importantly, MUP1 protein levels were markedly reduced in db/db mice, and the low molecular weight form was deceased to a greater extent (Fig. 1D). Moreover, both the high and the low molecular weight forms of MUP1 were also markedly reduced in livers of HFD-fed mice (Fig. 1D). These observations raise the possibility that a reduction in MUP1 expression may contribute to hyperglycemia in obese and diabetic animals. MUP1 Ameliorates Hyperglycemia and Glucose Intolerance in Diabetic Mice—To determine whether MUP1 is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, MUP1 cDNA was prepared from mouse livers and used to generate recombinant MUP1 adenoviruses. To determine whether MUP1 adenoviruses express recombinant MUP1, HepG2 cells, which are derived from human livers, were infected with β-gal or MUP1 adenoviruses. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after vial infection and immunoblotted with anti-MUP1 (αMUP1) or anti-β-actin antibodies. MUP1 protein was detected in MUP1 but not β-gal adenovirus-infected cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether recombinant MUP1 is a secretory protein, culture medium was prepared from HepG2 cells 48 h after viral infection and immunoblotted with αMUP1. Recombinant MUP1 was detected in the medium collected from MUP1 but not β-gal adenovirus-infected HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether recombinant MUP1 is also expressed in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice, db/db male mice (9 weeks) were infected with either MUP1 or β-gal adenoviruses via tail vein injection. Recombinant adenoviruses primarily infect hepatocytes under these conditions (17.Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Total liver RNA was prepared 16 days after viral infection and used to measure MUP1 mRNA abundance by qRT-PCR. MUP1 expression was approximately six times higher in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 2C). To verify recombinant MUP1 proteins, mice were infected with β-gal or MUP1 adenoviruses. Liver extracts were prepared 16 days after infection and immunoblotted with αMUP1 or α-tubulin. MUP1 protein levels were markedly increased in livers of MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 2D). Together, these data indicate that recombinant MUP1 is highly expressed in livers of MUP1 but not β-gal adenovirus-infected mice and secreted into the circulation. To determine whether recombinant MUP1 regulates blood glucose in animals, db/db male mice (9 weeks) were infected with MUP1 or β-gal adenoviruses, respectively. Blood glucose was measured in animals fasted overnight. Blood glucose was similar between these two groups prior to viral infection (Fig. 2E, −6 days). Fasting blood glucose slightly decreased 6 days after β-gal adenoviral infection and increased 10 days after β-gal adenoviral infection (Fig. 2E). In contrast, blood glucose decreased to a much greater extent in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 2E). Blood glucose was 59.4% lower in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice 10 days after infection. MUP1 overexpression slightly reduced blood insulin in db/db mice; however, the values did not reach statistical difference between MUP1 and β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 2F). MUP1 overexpression did not alter body weight under these conditions (β-gal: 41.5 ± 0.9 g, n = 8; MUP1: 39.2 ± 1.2 g, n = 7, p = 0.16; 7 days after vial infection). To further analyze the effect of MUP1 on glucose metabolism, GTT and ITT were performed in db/db mice 10 and 7 days after adenoviral infection, respectively. Blood glucose levels were much lower in MUP1 than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice at each time point in GTT (Fig. 2G). Exogenous insulin reduced blood glucose to a greater extent in MUP1 than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice 15 and 30 min after injection in ITT (Fig. 2H). Together, these data demonstrate that recombinant MUP1 markedly attenuates hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in genetically diabetic mice. MUP1 Overexpression Results in the Inhibition of the Hepatic Gluconeogenic Program in db/db Mice—To determine whether MUP1 ameliorates hyperglycemia by decreasing endogenous glucose production in the liver, we examined the hepatic gluconeogenic program by measuring the expression of PEPCK, G6Pase, and PGC1α, key gluconeogenic genes. db/db male mice (9 weeks) were infected with MUP1 or β-gal adenoviruses, respectively. Sixteen days after viral infection, mice were fasted overnight, and livers were isolated. The mRNA abundance of hepatic PEPCK, G6Pase, and PGC1α was measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. MUP1 inhibited the expression of PEPCK by 32% and G6Pase by 44% (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PGC1α expression was similar between MUP1 and β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 3A). To determine whether overexpression of MUP1 alters insulin signaling, we measured the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and Akt. Akt is a key downstream mediator of insulin action (1.White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18.Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I.

Mice were fasted overnight 16 days after viral infection and treated with insulin for 5 min. Liver extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibody (Fig. 3B, αIR) and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (Fig. 3B, αPY). Insulin similarly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in both MUP1 and β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 3B). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (pThr308) was also comparable between MUP1 and β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 3B). Therefore, it is unlikely that MUP1 inhibits the hepatic gluconeogenic program by increasing insulin sensitivity in the liver. MUP1 Inhibits the Hepatic Lipogenic Program in db/db Mice—To determine whether hepatic overexpression of MUP1 alters lipid metabolism in the liver, db/db male mice (9 weeks) were infected with MUP1 or β-gal adenoviruses for 16 days. Mice were fasted overnight, and livers were isolated. Liver weight was significantly reduced in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 4A). Hepatic glycogen content was also reduced slightly but not significantly (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, hepatic triglyceride contents were reduced by 53% in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice when compared with that in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 4C). To determine whether MUP1 regulates the hepatic lipogenic program in db/db mice, the expression of lipogenic genes was measured by qRT-PCR. Hepatic overexpression of MUP1 suppressed the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) by 78%, fatty acid synthase (FAS) by 51%, carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) by 52%, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) by 34% (Fig. 4D). In contrast, SREBP1c expression was similar between MUP1 and β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that MUP1 inhibits the hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing the expression of lipogenic genes, including SCD1, FAS, ChREBP, and PPARγ. MUP1 Improves Glucose Metabolism in Mice Fed HFD—To determine whether MUP1 ameliorates hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in dietary fat-induced type 2 diabetes, male mice (7 weeks) were fed HFD for 10 weeks. HFD induced obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance as described before. Mice were infected with MUP1 or β-gal adenoviruses, and blood glucose, ITT, and GTT were measured 6, 8, and 10 days after viral infection, respectively. Fasting blood glucose was significantly lower in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice (Fig. 5A). Blood glucose was also significantly lower in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice at each time point in ITT and 0, 15, and 30 min after glucose injection in GTT (Fig. 5, B and C). MUP1 did not alter body weight under these conditions (β-gal: 36.9 ± 0.9 g, n = 8; MUP1: 35.0 ± 1.3 g, n = 9, p = 0.24; 7 days after vial infection). These data indicate that MUP1 improves glucose metabolism in both genetic and dietary fat-induced type 2 diabetes. MUP1 Reduces Hyperglycemia and Glucose Intolerance in Streptozotocin-induced Type 1 Diabetes—To determine whether insulin is required for MUP1 to reduce blood glucose, male mice (10 weeks) were administrated with STZ, a pancreatic β cell toxin. STZ treatments induced type 1 diabetes as revealed by severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose in randomly fed mice: 457.0 ± 24.5 mg/dl, n = 14). STZ-treated mice were infected with either MUP1 or β-gal adenoviruses, respectively. Blood glucose levels in randomly fed mice were similar between these two groups prior to viral infection (MUP1: 459.6 ± 40.6 mg/dl, n = 7; β-gal: 454.4 ± 30.9 mg/dl, n = 7). Importantly, blood glucose was 25% lower in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice 8 days after viral infection and 31% lower in MUP1 than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice 13 days after viral infection (Fig. 6A). In GTT, blood glucose levels were significantly lower in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice at each time point after glucose injection (Fig. 6B). Exogenous insulin reduced blood glucose to a greater extent in MUP1 adenovirus-infected mice than in β-gal adenovirus-infected mice 30 and 60 min after injection (Fig. 6C). Because hyperglycemia induces insulin resistance, MUP1 may improve insulin sensitivity partially by reducing hyperglycemia in STZ-treated mice. Together, these data suggest that MUP1 is able to reduce hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance independent of insulin in type 1 diabetes. MUP1 Directly Inhibits the Hepatic Gluconeogenic Program in Primary Hepatocyte Cultures—To determine whether MUP1 directly regulates hepatocyte activity, primary hepatocyte cultures were prepared from male mice (9 weeks), infected with β-gal or MUP1 adenoviruses, treated with or without MIX (a combination of N6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt, a cAMP analog, and dexamethasone), and then subjected to HGP assays. MIX was used to mimic counter-regulatory hormones to stimulate HGP. MUP1 slightly reduced HGP under basal conditions; however, it reduced HGP by 31% in MIX-stimulated hepatocytes (Fig. 7A). To examine the hepatic gluconeogenic program, the expression of key gluconeogenic genes was measured by qRT-PCR. MUP1 expression was higher in MUP1 adenovirus-infected cells than in β-gal adenovirus-infected cells as expected. Importantly, MUP1 overexpression inhibited G6Pase and PEPCK expression by 70 and 54%, respectively (Fig. 7B). To determine whether recombinant MUP1 protein directly regulates the hepatic gluconeogenic program, conditioned medium was prepared from β-gal or MUP1 adenovirus-infected HepG2 cells. Recombinant MUP1 protein was detected in MUP1 but not β-gal conditioned medium (Fig. 7C). Hepatocytes were treated with β-gal or MUP1 conditioned medium overnight and then stimulated with or without MIX for 4 h. When compared with β-gal conditioned medium, MUP1 conditioned medium reduced basal and MIX-stimulated HGP by 13 and 22%, respectively (Fig. 7D). In MIX-treated hepatocytes, recombinant MUP1 inhibited the expression of G6Pase by 50% and PEPCK by 64% (Fig. 7E). Taken together, these data suggest that MUP1 directly inhibits the hepatic gluconeogenic program, thereby regulating systemic glucose metabolism. In this study, we discovered that in addition to mediating chemical signaling, circulatory MUP1 also regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in animals. First, we showed that the expression of hepatic MUP1 was regulated by nutritional and/or metabolic signals. Second, the expression of hepatic MUP1 markedly decreased in both genetic and dietary fat-induced type 2 diabetes, suggesting that a reduction of MUP1 contributes to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance in diabetes. Third, overexpression of recombinant MUP1 in the liver markedly reduced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in three different types of diabetes. Fourth, overexpression of MUP1 suppressed the expression of both gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes in the liver. Fifth, recombinant MUP1 directly inhibited the hepatic gluconeogenic program in primary hepatocyte cultures. It is less likely that MUP1 regulates metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitivity. Overexpression of MUP1 markedly reduced blood glucose levels and glucose intolerance in db/db mice but marginally enhanced insulin sensitivity. MUP1 also significantly reduced hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes. In addition, MUP1 overexpression neither significantly altered plasma insulin levels nor enhanced insulin signaling. In contrast, MUP1 attenuated the ability of cAMP analog (glucagon mimetic) and dexamethasone (glucocorticoid mimetic) to stimulate hepatic glucose production. Therefore, MUP1 may reduce blood glucose levels by inhibiting the hyperglycemic response to counter-regulatory hormones. Recombinant MUP1 directly inhibited glucose production and the expression of gluconeogenic genes in primary hepatocyte cultures. These observations raise the possibility that MUP1 may suppress the hepatic glucose production by activating its own cognate receptor(s) expressed in hepatocytes. Consistent with this idea, urinary MUPs also directly stimulate sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (10.Chamero P. Marton T.F. Logan D.W. Flanagan K. Cruz J.R. Saghatelian A. Cravatt B.F. Stowers L. Nature. 2007; 450: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Additionally, circulatory MUP1 binds to lipophilic molecules, and these lipophilic molecules may directly regulate glucose and/or lipid metabolism. Therefore, MUP1 may regulate glucose and lipid metabolism indirectly by modulating the activity of these bioactive lipophilic molecules. The liver is likely to be a physiological target of MUP1. MUP1 inhibited the expression of key gluconeogenic (e.g. G6Pase) and lipogenic genes (e.g. SCD1, FAS, ChREBP, and PPARγ) in livers of db/db mice. Moreover, MUP1 also directly suppressed both basal and counter-regulatory hormone-stimulated glucose production in cultured hepatocytes. Therefore, MUP1 may regulate systemic glucose and lipid metabolism through paracrine/autocrine regulation of hepatocyte metabolic activity. In contrast to MUP1, retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) and lipocalin-2, two other lipocalin family members, promote insulin resistance and hyperglycemia (21.Kloting N. Graham T.E. Berndt J.

Glucose metabolism is likely to be regulated by a balance between the MUP1 group and the RBP4/lipocalin-2 group of lipocalin family members. Interestingly, the human genome contains a gene (accession number: XM_001723632), which is predicted to encode a MUP1-like molecule (designated as hMUP). hMUP is ∼50% identical to mouse MUP1 in amino acid sequence. We predict that hMUP also regulates glucose metabolism by a similar mechanism as MUP1. We thank Qiong Wang, Liang Sheng, David Morris, and Kae Won Cho for their assistance and helpful discussion.

Despite much attention regarding the biosynthesis of curcuminoids because of their pharmaceutically important properties and biosynthetically intriguing structures, no enzyme systems have been elucidated. Here we propose a pathway for curcuminoid biosynthesis in the herb C. longa, which includes two novel type III polyketide synthases. One of the type III polyketide synthases, named diketide-CoA synthase (DCS), catalyzed the formation of feruloyldiketide-CoA by condensing feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The other, named curcumin synthase (CURS), catalyzed the in vitro formation of curcuminoids from cinnamoyldiketide-N-acetylcysteamine (a mimic of the CoA ester) and feruloyl-CoA. Co-incubation of DCS and CURS in the presence of feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA yielded curcumin at high efficiency, although CURS itself possessed low activity for the synthesis of curcumin from feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. These findings thus revealed the curcumin biosynthetic route in turmeric, in which DCS synthesizes feruloyldiketide-CoA, and CURS then converts the diketide-CoA esters into a curcuminoid scaffold.

The rhizome of turmeric, Curcuma longa, has been used as a food additive, especially as a spice in curry, as a coloring agent, and in cosmetics (1.Sharma R.A. Gescher A.J. Steward W.P. Eur. J.

In addition to its aromatic, stimulant, and coloring properties, the powdered rhizome of turmeric possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activities and has been taken orally to treat dyspepsia, flatulence, and liver and urinary tract diseases (3.Ringman J.M.

Most of these pharmaceutical properties of turmeric depend on the curcuminoids, including curcumin (3e), demethoxycurcumin (4e), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (2e) (see Fig. 1A). The amounts (wild type t%) of these curcuminoids were ∼2, 0.7, and 0.6% in powdered turmeric (7.Hiserodt R. Hartman T.G. Ho C.-T. Rosen R.T. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 740: 51-63Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs), 4The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CUS, curcuminoid synthase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; NAC, N-acetylcysteamine; CURS, curcumin synthase; DCS, diketide-CoA synthase; LC-ESI MS, liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization mass spectrometry; APCI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. 4The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CUS, curcuminoid synthase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; NAC, N-acetylcysteamine; CURS, curcumin synthase; DCS, diketide-CoA synthase; LC-ESI MS, liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization mass spectrometry; APCI, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. consisting of a homodimer of ketosynthase, play an important role in the biosynthesis of most plant polyketides (8.Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Chalcone synthase (CHS), a typical type III PKS, catalyzes the formation of naringenin chalcone by the following mechanism (see Fig. 1B) (9.Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 10.Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The reaction of CHS is primed by a transfer of the acyl moiety of p-coumaroyl-CoA, which is called a starter substrate, to the catalytic cysteine of CHS. Subsequent iterative decarboxylative condensation of three malonyl-CoAs, which are called extender substrates, yields a tetraketide intermediate. These iterative condensations are catalyzed by a Cys-Asn-His catalytic triad (8.Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 9.Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The resultant tetraketide intermediate is then cyclized by Claisen condensation, followed by aromatization resulting in naringenin chalcone formation. Like CHS, most type III PKSs catalyze condensation of one starter substrate and several extender substrates. Due to the pharmaceutically important properties of curcuminoids, the biosynthetic pathway has been the subject of much attention, and radio tracer studies were performed decades ago (11.Roughley P.J. Whiting D.A. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1973; 1973: 2379-2388Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Based on those results, Schröder (12.Schröder J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) proposed that curcuminoids are derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway and that one or more type III PKSs were responsible for the formation of its scaffold. Curcuminoids, consisting of two phenylpropanoid units, are chemically derived from phenylalanine connected by a central carbon unit derived from malonyl-CoA. The 13C feeding experiment carried out by Kita et al. (13.Kita T. Imai S. Sawada H. Kumagai H. Seto H. Biosci. Biotechnol.

One possible pathway from phenylalanine to curcumin is presented in Fig. 1A. However, it is not known when the methyl ethers at the 3′ position of curcumin are incorporated, i.e. before or after curcumin scaffold formation, or how the curcumin scaffold is synthesized, i.e. by a single type III PKS enzyme or a multiple enzyme system. On the basis of these findings, several groups attempted to identify one or more type III PKSs responsible for the formation of the curcuminoid scaffold. Brand et al. (14.Brand S. Holscher D. Schierhorn A. Svatos A. Schröder J. Schneider B. Planta. 2006; 224: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) characterized a type III PKS in Wachendorfia thyrsiflora, a plant that produces phenylphenalenones derived from a curcuminoid scaffold. This type III PKS, named WtPKS1, synthesizes a benzalacetone scaffold and triketide pyrones from various starter substrates (see Fig. 1B). Therefore, they predicted that benzalacetone synthesis might be included in a step for the formation of the curcuminoid scaffold. This hypothesis was also mentioned by Abe et al. (15.Abe I. Takahashi Y. Morita H. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ramirez-Ahumada et al. (16.Ramirez-Ahumada M.d.C. Timmermann B.N. Gang D.R. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 2017-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) detected curcuminoid synthetic activity in an extract from the leaves of turmeric. Their attempts to purify a type III PKS responsible for this reaction by anion-exchange column chromatography failed. We recently discovered a type III PKS, named curcuminoid synthase (CUS), in the rice Oryza sativa, that catalyzes the formation of bisdemethoxycurcumin by condensing two p-coumaroyl-CoAs and one malonyl-CoA by the mechanism shown in Fig. 1B (17.Katsuyama Y. Matsuzawa M. Funa N. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37702-37709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CUS synthesizes p-coumaroyldiketide-CoA (2b) by condensing p-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA. The resultant diketide-CoA (2b) is hydrolyzed to yield a β-keto acid (2c), which then serves as the second extender substrate and is condensed with another p-coumaroyl-CoA, resulting finally in the formation of bisdemethoxycurcumin (2e). CUS is the first type III PKS that catalyzes condensation of two starter substrates with one extender substrate. CUS also produces triketide pyrones from one p-coumaroyl-CoA and two malonyl-CoAs (Fig. 1B). O. sativa produces no detectable curcuminoids, and therefore the in vivo function of CUS still remains unknown. Although the discovery of CUS supported the hypothesis proposed by Schröder (12.Schröder J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the type III PKS catalyzing the curcuminoid synthesis in turmeric still remained undiscovered. In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of two type III PKSs from turmeric, which were named diketide-CoA synthase (DCS) and curcumin synthase (CURS) on the basis of their activities. DCS catalyzes the formation of a diketide intermediate via condensation of feruloyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA. CURS catalyzes the formation of curcumin from the diketide intermediate and feruloyl-CoA. CURS also catalyzes the formation of a diketide intermediate from feruloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, but at a very low rate. We thus concluded that DCS and CURS participate in curcumin synthesis using the abundantly present CoA esters in turmeric. Materials—Escherichia coli JM109, pUC19, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Biochemicals (Shiga, Japan). pET16b was used for expression of the His-tagged proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Bisdemethoxycurcumin (2f) was purchased from Chromadex (Santa Ana, CA). Curcumin (3f) was purchased from Sigma (Steinheim, Germany). trans-Cinnamic acid, trans-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid), and trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (ferulic acid) were purchased from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). Benzalacetone (1d) and dehydrozingerone (3d) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). 4-Hydroxybenzalacetone (2d) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. p-Coumaroyl-CoA (2a), cinnamoyl-CoA (1a), and feruloyl-CoA (3a) were synthesized according to the procedures reported by Blecher (18.Blecher M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cinnamoyldiketide-N-acetylcysteamine (4b) was synthesized according to the reported method (19.Gilbert I.H. Ginty M. O'Neill J.A. Simpson T.J. Staunton J. Willis C.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 1587-1590Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). trans-3-Oxo-5-phenylpent-4-enoic acid (1c) was synthesized by a modification of the procedure reported by Matsumura et al. (20.Matsumura S. Asai N. Yoneda S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1985; 3: 310-360Google Scholar). Cinnamoyl-p-coumaroylmethane (5e), dicinnamoylmethane (1e), and cinnamoylferuloylmethane (6e) were synthesized according to previously reported methods (21.Katsuyama Y. Matsuzawa M. Funa N. Horinouchi S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 2620-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). trans-5-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-oxopent-4-enoic acid methyl ester was synthesized by a modification of a published procedure (22.Holtz E. Alberecht U. Langer P. Tetrahedron. 2007; 63: 3293-3301Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). cDNA Preparation—Curcuma longa was grown under standard conditions in a field in Chiba, Japan, for 4 months before rhizomes and leaves were collected. Total RNA was prepared from 80 mg each of rhizomes and leaves using the RNeasy– Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The DNA was digested using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and total RNA was concentrated using the RNeasy– MinElute– Cleanup kit (Qiagen), yielding total RNAs of 1010 ng from the leaf and 360 ng from the rhizome. cDNA was synthesized from these RNAs using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and PrimeScript– Reverse Transcriptase (Takara). Amplification of Full-length cDNAs—The full-length cDNA of CURS was amplified by the primers 5′-CTCTGCGACTGCGAGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTATAACAGATAGACAGC-3′ from a cDNA library. These primers were designed on the basis of previously reported expressed sequence tag sequences (NCBI accession numbers DY384950 and DY386934). A 1.3-kb cDNA fragment encoding CURS was obtained. The full-length cDNA of DCS was amplified as follows. A BLAST search using CUS from O. sativa as a query established conserved sequences of type III PKSs that would be appropriate for the primers to amplify cDNAs of type III PKS genes. The primers thus designed were 5′-TCATGGCCATCGGCACNGCNAMNCC-3′ (M = A or C; N = A, T, G, or C) and 5′-CCTGTTGTTCTCGGCCADNTCYTTNGC-3′ (D = G, A, or T; Y = T or C). A partial sequence of the cDNA encoding the conserved regions of type III PKSs was amplified from the cDNA library using these primers, and the fragment obtained was sequenced. Using this sequence, a gene-specific primer, 5′-GACATCACGCACCTGGTCTTCTG-3′, was designed. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). The amplified 5′-RACE fragment was purified and sequenced. The primer 5′-GGTAACACGCGTCATTCTTTGC-3′ was designed to carry out 3′-RACE using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit. The amplified 3′-RACE fragment was purified and sequenced, yielding a 1.4-kb cDNA fragment encoding DCS. Relative Quantification by Quantitative Real-time PCR—cDNA was prepared and purified as described above. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out on a Smart Cycler II (Takara) using SYBER Premix Ex Taq polymerase and 0.2 μm of gene-specific forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S1) in a total volume of 25 μl. The conditions were as follows. The initial incubation at 95 °C was carried out for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 20 s. For quantification of the PCR products, 18 S rRNA was used as a control (DNA accession no. AB047718). The ratio of gene-specific expression to 18 S rRNA signals was defined as the relative expression. Production and Purification of DCS—Using the DCS cDNA as a template, the 1.1-kb DNA fragment containing the DCS-coding region was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CCGAATTCCATATGGAAGCGAACGGCTACCG-3′ (the bold letters indicate an EcoRI site, the underline indicates an NdeI site, and the italics indicate the start codon of DCS) and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAGTTCAGTCTGCAACTAT-3′ (the bold letters indicate a BamHI site, and italics indicate the stop codon of DCS). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-DCS. The DCS sequence was excised as an NdeI-BamHI fragment from pUC19-DCS and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b, resulting in pET16b-DCS. For the production of histidine-tagged DCS, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET16b-DCS was grown overnight in Luria Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. After sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysate was applied to a column containing His-bind metal chelation resin (Qiagen). The purified histidine-tagged protein was dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. DCS Assay—The standard reaction mixture contained 100 μm starter substrate (cinnamoyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl-CoA, or feruloyl-CoA), 100 μm extender substrate (malonyl-CoA), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 4.0 μg of DCS in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before being quenched with 20 μl of 6 m HCl or 5 μl of 10 m NaOH. The solutions, to which NaOH was added at a final concentration of 0.5 m, were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min for alkaline hydrolysis. The solutions obtained were applied directly to LC-ESI MS/MS analysis. LC-ESI MS/MS analysis was carried out using the Esquire High-capacity Trap (HCT) plus system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The HPLC was equipped with a Pegasil-B C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Senshu Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient (5% for 5 min, 5 to 40% over 35 min, and 40–80% over 5 min) in water containing 25 mm ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. UV spectra were detected on an Agilent G1315B system. Identification of Feruloyldiketide-CoA (3b)—Feruloyldiketide-CoA was purified by HPLC. HPLC on a Waters 600 system equipped with a Pegasil-B C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) was carried out by elution with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10–40% over 40 min and 40–70% over 5 min) in water containing 25 mm KH2PO4 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The purified feruloyldiketide-CoA was dialyzed by HPLC. The feruloyldiketide-CoA thus obtained was hydrolyzed in 1 m KOH at 65 °C for 10 min. The resultant solution was acidified and kept on ice until directly applied to LC-ESI MS analysis. LC-ESI MS/MS analysis was carried out using the Esquire HCT system. The HPLC was equipped with a Pegasil-B ODS reversed-phase HPLC column (2 × 250 mm, Senshu) and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient (5% for 5 min, 5–40% over 35 min, and 40–80% over 5 min) in water containing 25 mm ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The compound derived as a result of hydrolysis was identified as trans-5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-oxopent-4-enoic acid by comparison to the sample synthesized by hydrolysis of trans-5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-oxopent-4-enoic acid methyl ester. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters of DCS—A standard reaction contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 200 μm malonyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA (2.5–100 μm), and 4.0 μg of DCS in a total volume of 100 μl for determination of kinetic values for feruloyl-CoA, and contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), malonyl-CoA (2.5–50 μm), 100 μm feruloyl-CoA, and 4.0 μg of DCS in a total volume of 100 μl for determination of kinetic values for malonyl-CoA. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min, reactions were initiated by adding the substrate and continued for 5 min. We observed that the product formation was linear throughout this period. The reactions were stopped with 5 μl of 10 m NaOH, and the solution was incubated at 65 °C for 15 min to hydrolyze the products. The solution was acidified by adding 10 μl of 6 n HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was collected and evaporated. The residual materials were dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis. The velocity of the reaction was measured by monitoring the formation of dehydrozingerone that was synthesized via nonenzymatic hydrolysis and decarboxylation (3d) of feruloyldiketide-CoA (3b). HPLC analysis was carried out using a Waters 600 HPLC apparatus equipped with a COSMOSIL 5C18MS-II reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and isocratically eluted with acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UV was detected by the Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Dehydrozingerone (3d) was used to generate the standard curve for quantification of the products. Steady-state parameters were determined by fitting the curve to v = Vmax[S]n/(S50n + [S]n) (n indicates the slope value) and v = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]). Production and Purification of CURS—Using CURS cDNA as a template, the 1.1-kb DNA fragment containing the CURS-coding region was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CCGAATTCCATATGGCCAACCTCCACGCGTT-3′ (the bold letters indicate an EcoRI site, the underline indicates an NdeI site, and the italics indicate the start codon of CURS) and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTACAGTGGCATACTGCGCA-3′ (the bold letters indicate a BamHI site, and italics indicate the stop codon of CURS). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-CURS. The CURS sequence was excised as an NdeI-BamHI fragment from pUC19-CURS and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b, resulting in pET16b-CURS. For production of histidine-tagged CURS, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET16b-CURS was grown overnight in Luria Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. After sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysate was applied to a column containing His-bind metal chelation resin (Qiagen). The purified histidine-tagged protein was dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. CURS Assay—The standard reaction mixture contained 100 μm starter substrate (cinnamoyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl-CoA, or feruloyl-CoA), 100 μm extender substrate (malonyl-CoA or cinnamoyldiketide-NAC), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and 4.0 μg of CURS in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before being quenched with 20 μl of 6 m HCl. The products were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residual material was dissolved in 20 μl of DMSO for LC-APCI MS/MS analysis, which was carried out using the esquire HCT plus system. The HPLC was equipped with a Pegasil-B C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10–100% over 45 min) in water containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. UV spectra were detected on an Agilent G1315B system. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters of CURS—The reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 2–100 μm each of feruloyl-CoA or p-coumaroyl-CoA, 100 μm cinnamoyl-diketide-NAC, and 4.0 μg of CURS in a total volume of 100 μl. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min, reactions were initiated by adding the substrates and continued for 5 min. We confirmed that the product formation was linear throughout this period. The reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 6 m HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was collected and evaporated. The residual materials were dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was carried out using the Waters 600 HPLC apparatus equipped with a Pegasil-B C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Senshu) and isocratically eluted with 60% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UV absorbance was detected using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Cinnamoyl-p-coumaroylmethane (4f) and cinnamoylferuloylmethane (5f) were used to generate the standard curves for quantification of the products. Steady-state parameters were determined by fitting the curve to v = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]).

Isolation and Cloning of cDNAs Encoding Type III PKSs—We cloned and sequenced two full-length cDNAs obtained by amplifying the cDNA library from the rhizome and leaf of turmeric (supplemental Fig. S1). One full-length cDNA was obtained via amplification using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed on the basis of the conserved sequence of type III PKSs (the details of the method are described under “Experimental Procedures”). Another was obtained using primer sequences based on the expressed sequence tag sequences reported by Gang's group (NCBI accession numbers DY384950 and DY386934). Direct sequencing of these DNA fragments predicted that both cDNAs encoded different type III PKSs. These type III PKSs were named DCS and CURS on the basis of their enzyme activities (see below). The entire DCS and CURS cDNAs were cloned using standard DNA manipulation methods. DCS and CURS shared 62% identity in their amino acid sequences and contained a conserved Cys-Asn-His catalytic triad (supplemental Fig. S2) (9.Jez J.M. Ferrer J.-L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Expression of DCS and CURS in turmeric was checked by quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the rhizome and leaf of turmeric grown for 4 months, and cDNAs were prepared using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Quantitative PCR showed that DCS and CURS were expressed in both the leaf and rhizome (supplemental Fig. S3), consistent with our observation that the leaves of turmeric contain dihydrocurcuminoids probably synthesized via reduction of the double bond of curcuminoids. 5Y. Katsuyama, T. Kita, N. Funa, and S. Horinouchi, unpublished data. The expression levels of both enzyme genes were higher in the rhizome than in the leaf (supplemental Fig. S3), which is also in agreement with the amounts of curcuminoids; the total amount of curcuminoids is higher in the rhizome than in the leaf. Characterization of DCS—DCS fused with a His tag at its N terminus was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using a pET system and purified on an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (supplemental Fig. S4). Recombinant DCS, giving a major protein band on SDS-PAGE, was incubated with cinnamoyl-CoA (1a), p-coumaroyl-CoA (2a), or feruloyl-CoA (3a) as starter substrates and malonyl-CoA as an extender substrate. The reaction was quenched by addition of HCl, and the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. Liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC-APCI MS) analysis of the organic layer revealed the presence of a trace amount of dehydrozingerone (3d) in the feruloyl-CoA-primed reaction (Fig. 2). 4-Hydroxybenzalacetone (2d) was also produced, when examined after scaling up the reaction (data not shown). These compounds were characterized by comparing their retention times, UV, MS, and MS/MS spectra with those of commercially available authentic samples. The low benzalacetone synthesis activity of DCS and a plausible curcumin biosynthesis route via diketide-CoA formation suggested that DCS acted as a diketide-CoA synthase to produce feruloyldiketide-CoA (3b), and the dehydrozingerone detected was a byproduct formed via artificial or nonenzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation of the diketide-CoA. Acidification of the solution might result in hydrolysis of a thioester bond. It is known that β-keto acids are easily decarboxylated at room temperature and converted to 2-ketones (23.Guthrie J.P. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 32-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, some β-keto acids are decarboxylated rapidly under acidic conditions (24.Marcus J.P. Dekker E.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To prove this prediction, we applied the reaction mixture directly to the LC-ESI MS without acidification or ethyl acetate extraction. As expected, no productio"

We performed experiments to determine whether another T cell-specific cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), is also regulated by TTP and found that T cell receptor-activated T cells from TTP knock-out mice overproduced IFN-γ mRNA and protein compared with activated T cells from wild-type mice. The half-life of IFN-γ mRNA was 23 min in anti-CD3-stimulated T cells from wild-type mice, whereas it was 51 min in anti-CD3-stimulated T cells from TTP knock-out mice, suggesting that the overexpression of IFN-γ mRNA in TTP knock-out mice was due to stabilization of IFN-γ mRNA. Insertion of a 70-nucleotide AU-rich sequence from the murine IFN-γ 3′-untranslated region, which contained a high affinity binding site for TTP, into the 3′-untranslated region of a β-globin reporter transcript conferred TTP-dependent destabilization on the β-globin transcript. Together these results suggest that TTP binds to a functional AU-rich element in the 3′-untranslated region of IFN-γ mRNA and mediates rapid degradation of the IFN-γ transcript. Thus, TTP plays an important role in turning off IFN-γ expression at the appropriate time during an immune response.

It is predominantly secreted by activated CD4 T helper 1 lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, and it promotes effective innate and adaptive immune responses by increasing phagocytic activity of macrophages, up-regulating class I and class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, inducing expression of adhesion molecules to facilitate leukocyte-endothelium interactions, inducing the complement cascade, and initiating apoptosis (1.Boehm U.

Secreted IFN-γ regulates the activation of other types of immune cells and functions in autocrine or paracrine pathways to further promote the activation of T cells. Binding by IFN-γ to IFN-γ receptors 1 and 2 activates the JAK 1 and 2 and the STAT1 signaling pathway (10.Greenlund A.C. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Biol.

STAT1 forms a homodimer that enters the nucleus and binds to promoter elements, activating or repressing transcription of IFN-γ regulated genes including genes involved in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, bacterial killing, immunomodulation, cellular differentiation, and leukocyte trafficking (3.Schroder K.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Thus, proper IFN-γ signaling is vital to the development of an immune response, and the expression of IFN-γ needs to be precisely regulated at multiple levels. Although transcriptional regulation of IFN-γ expression is important, post-transcriptional regulation at the level of mRNA decay is also vital for a normal immune response (for a review, see Ref. 17.Khabar K.S. Young H.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2007; 89: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, CD28 co-stimulation induces increased IFN-γ expression through stabilization of IFN-γ mRNA (18.Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 19.Raghavan A. Ogilvie R.L. Reilly C. Abelson M.L. Raghavan S. Vasdewani J. Krathwohl M. Bohjanen P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5529-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The rapid decay of IFN-γ mRNA also provides a potential mechanism for turning off the expression of IFN-γ at the appropriate time during an immune response.Numerous genes involved in T cell activation, including genes encoding cytokines, signal transduction regulators, cell cycle regulators, and regulators of apoptosis, are regulated at the level of mRNA decay (19.Raghavan A. Ogilvie R.L. Reilly C. Abelson M.L. Raghavan S. Vasdewani J. Krathwohl M. Bohjanen P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5529-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Most mRNA transcripts that are induced following T cell activation exhibit rapid decay (19.Raghavan A. Ogilvie R.L. Reilly C. Abelson M.L. Raghavan S. Vasdewani J. Krathwohl M. Bohjanen P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5529-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the rapid decay of these transcripts may provide a mechanism to turn off their expression at the appropriate time following T cell activation. Many of the labile transcripts expressed in T cells contain AU-rich elements (AREs), conserved sequence elements found in their 3′-untranslated region (UTR) that function as mediators of mRNA decay (19.Raghavan A. Ogilvie R.L. Reilly C. Abelson M.L. Raghavan S. Vasdewani J. Krathwohl M. Bohjanen P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5529-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). ARE-dependent mRNA turnover is mediated by trans-acting proteins that bind to AREs and regulate transcript decay. Numerous ARE-binding proteins have been identified; some promote transcript degradation, whereas others promote transcript stabilization (20.Shim J. Lim H. Yates J.R. Karin M. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The importance of TTP as a regulator of gene expression is illustrated by the phenotype of TTP knock-out mice. These mice are normal at birth but develop a systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by cachexia, dermatitis, erosive arthritis, and myeloid hyperplasia (28.Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M.

The syndrome is caused by the overproduction of cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), due to a lack of TTP-mediated mRNA decay (28.Taylor G.A.

Our research group has previously shown that TTP is induced in T cells following T cell receptor-mediated activation and that the T cell-derived cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), is overproduced in activated T cells from TTP knock-out mice due to stabilization of IL-2 mRNA (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the current work, we performed experiments to determine whether another T cell-specific cytokine, IFN-γ, is also regulated by TTP. We found dramatic overexpression of the IFN-γ transcript in activated T cells from TTP knock-out mice and showed that the overexpression of IFN-γ was due to stabilization of IFN-γ mRNA. Insertion of a 70-nucleotide AU-rich sequence, which contained an 18-nucleotide TTP-binding site, from the murine IFN-γ 3′-UTR into the 3′-UTR of a β-globin reporter transcript conferred TTP-dependent destabilization on the β-globin transcript. Together these results demonstrate that TTP mediates degradation of IFN-γ mRNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification and Stimulation of Primary Murine and Human T Cells—Generation of homozygous TTP knock-out mice has been described previously (28.Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J.

Purification of T lymphocytes from wild-type or TTP knock-out C57BL/6 mice was performed as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The purified T cell populations from wild-type and TTP knock-out mice were similar with respect to cell surface CD4 and CD8 expression, and both populations consisted of cells that were 87–90% CD3-positive, 46–49% CD4-positive, and 35–39% CD8-positive. Purified murine T cells were unstimulated (medium) or stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody (R&D Systems) for 6 h as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Protocols for animal experimentation were reviewed and approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Primary human T cell populations from peripheral blood were purified from human buffy coat packs obtained from the American Red Cross as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and consisted of 90–98% CD3-positive T cells. These cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Measurement of Murine IFN-γ mRNA by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total cellular RNA was isolated from purified T cells from wild-type and TTP knock-out mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was additionally purified using the Qiagen RNeasy cleanup kit, including DNase treatment, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). cDNA used for real time PCR analysis was synthesized from total cellular RNA using StrataScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) and transcript-specific primers. PCR amplifications were performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Commercially purchased (Integrated DNA Technologies) transcript-specific oligonucleotide primers used for the PCR amplifications are listed as sense followed by antisense: IFN-γ,5′-CTTCTTCAGCAACAGCAAGG-3′,5′-TGAGCTCATTGAATGCTTGG-3′; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 5′-GGTGAAAAGGACCTCTCGAA-3′,5′-AGTCAAGGGCATATCCAACA-3′. PCR amplifications were performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler thermocycler, and the data were analyzed using iCycler software. IFN-γ mRNA levels were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA levels.To assay IFN-γ mRNA decay rates, purified T cells from wild-type or TTP homozygous knock-out mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies for 6 h and then treated with 10 μg/ml of actinomycin D, and total RNA was harvested after 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. IFN-γ mRNA levels at each time point were normalized to the corresponding level of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase transcript. GraphPad Prism software version 4.00 was used to calculate transcript half-lives based on a one-phase exponential decay model.Measurement of Murine IFN-γ Protein—IFN-γ concentrations in culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Pharmingen OptEIA Mouse IFN-γ Set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Tet-Off mRNA Decay Assay—Measurement of the decay of β-globin reporter constructs was performed as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In some experiments, HeLa Tet-Off cells (1.6 × 106 cells) were transfected with 3.0 μg of the tet-responsive reporter construct that encoded rabbit β-globin transcripts that contained the 70-nucleotide murine IFN-γ sequence or the mutated sequence shown in Fig. 3A inserted at the unique BglII restriction site in its 3′-UTR. In other experiments, cells were transfected with β-globin reporter constructs in which the β-globin 3′-UTR was replaced with the 631-bp 3′-UTR from murine IFN-γ or a mutated version that contained the mutations shown in Fig. 3A. The cells were co-transfected with either 100 ng of the pCMV.TTP.myc plasmid that expresses Myc-tagged murine TTP or the pcDNA-3 plasmid (Invitrogen) as a mock control. The pCM-V.TTP.myc plasmid was created by excising the Myc-tagged murine TTP cDNA from the plasmid hphMX-TTP (34.Stoecklin G. Gross B. Ming X.F. Moroni C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3554-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and cloning it into the pcDNA-3 plasmid. Cells were also co-transfected with 1 μg of the pTracerC-EF/V5-His/lacZ construct (Invitrogen), which produces green fluorescent protein (GFP), to control for transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed with 1.5 units of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)/μg of plasmid DNA. After 48 h, 300 ng/ml doxycycline was added to stop transcription, and total RNA was isolated after discrete time points. RNA isolation and Northern blotting to assess expression of β-globin and GFP transcripts were performed as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For each point, the hybridization intensity of the β-globin transcript was normalized to the hybridization intensity of the GFP transcript, and the normalized values were used to calculate half-lives using GraphPad Prism 4.00 software based on a one-phase exponential decay model.Overxpression of Murine or Human TTP in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were grown as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.1 × 107 HeLa cells were transfected with 54 μg of the pCMV.TTP.myc plasmid that expresses Myc-tagged murine TTP, the pCMV.TTP.Tag plasmid that expresses hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human TTP, or the pcDNA-3 plasmid (Invitrogen) as a mock control. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).RNA Probes and Competitors—RNA oligonucleotides were purchased commercially (Dharmacon Research, Boulder, CO). The sequence for each RNA oligonucleotide was as follows: IFN-γ ARE, CUAUUUAUUAAUAUUUAA; IL-2 ARE, UAUUUAUUUAAAUAUUUAAAUUUUAUAUUUAU; mutated ARE, UCACUCACUCACUCACU. The IFN-γ ARE RNA oligonucleotide probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase to produce a radiolabeled probe with a specific activity of ∼4 × 106 cpm/μg.Gel Shift, Supershift, and UV Cross-linking Assays—Gel shift, supershift, and UV cross-linking assays were performed as described previously (33.Ogilvie R.L. Abelson M. Hau H.H. Vlasova I. Blackshear P.J. Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts (8–10 μg of protein) were incubated for 20 min with 15–35 fmol of the 32P-labeled IFN-γ ARE RNA probe in the absence or presence of 10 pmol of unlabeled IFN-γ, IL-2, or mutated ARE RNA oligonucleotides in a total volume of 20–24 μl. For supershift assays, an anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, Upstate), an anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), an anti-TTP antibody (N-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or a control anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was added to the reaction mixtures.RESULTSIFN-γ Is Overexpressed in T Cells from TTP Knock-out Mice—We have previously shown that TTP is expressed in human and murine T cells (33.Ogilvie R.L.

Bohjanen P.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine whether IFN-γ, another T cell-specific cytokine, is regulated by TTP, experiments were performed to determine whether T cells from TTP knockout mice overproduced IFN-γ mRNA. T cells from wild-type and TTP knock-out mice were stimulated for 6 h with medium alone or an immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Total cellular RNA was then collected, and IFN-γ mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR. As seen in Fig. 1A, IFN-γ mRNA was expressed at a very low level in unstimulated T cells from both wild-type and TTP knock-out mice (medium). In wild-type mice, stimulation with anti-CD3 induced increased expression of IFN-γ mRNA. Compared with wild-type mice, however, the anti-CD3-induced expression of IFN-γ mRNA was 4.7-fold higher in T cells from TTP knock-out mice. In parallel experiments, culture supernatants were collected 24 h after stimulation, and IFN-γ protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1B). IFN-γ protein production was not detected in T cells from wild-type or TTP knock-out mice following stimulation with medium alone. Stimulation of wild-type mice with anti-CD3 induced no detectable IFN-γ production; however, IFN-γ production was dramatically increased following stimulation of T cells from TTP knock-out mice with anti-CD3. These data demonstrate that IFN-γ production is dramatically increased in activated T cells from TTP knock-out mice. Overall these experiments demonstrate that IFN-γ mRNA and protein are both overexpressed in activated T cells from TTP knock-out mice.FIGURE 1IFN-γ mRNA and protein are overproduced in T cells from TTP knock-out mice. Purified murine T cells from homozygous TTP knock-out mice or wild-type littermates were either unstimulated (medium) or stimulated for 6 h with anti-CD3 antibodies. A, total cellular RNA was isolated, and IFN-γ mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR. For each sample, the expression levels for IFN-γ mRNA were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA levels. Each point represents the mean and S.E. of triplicate samples. B, IFN-γ protein levels were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The graphed data show the mean and S.E. of triplicate samples for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IFN-γ mRNA Is Stabilized in T Cells from TTP Knock-out Mice—Because TTP regulates the expression of other cytokines by mediating mRNA decay (29.Carballo E.

To test this hypothesis, we measured IFN-γ mRNA decay rates in purified T cells from wild-type and TTP knock-out mice. T cells were stimulated for 6 h with an anti-CD3 antibody, and then actinomycin D was added to stop transcription. Total cellular RNA was harvested 0, 15, 30, and 45 min after the addition of actinomycin D, and IFN-γ mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR (Fig. 2). IFN-γ mRNA decay half-lives were calculated based on a model of first order decay to be 23 min (95% confidence interval, 21–26 min) in T cells from wild-type mice and 51 min (95% confidence interval, 42–66 min) in T cells from TTP knock-out mice. The difference in transcript half-lives comparing wild-type and TTP knock-out mice was statistically significant with a p value of less than 0.0001, indicating that IFN-γ mRNA is more stable in the absence of TTP. The increased stability of IFN-γ in T cells from TTP knock-out mice compared with wild-type mice suggests that TTP mediates IFN-γ mRNA decay.FIGURE 2IFN-γ mRNA is stabilized in TTP knock-out mice. Purified murine T cells from wild-type or TTP knock-out mice were stimulated for 6 h with anti-CD3 antibodies. Actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was then added to stop transcription, and total RNA was isolated after 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. IFN-γ mRNA was measured using real time reverse transcription-PCR, and expression levels were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA levels. The normalized level of IFN-γ mRNA at time 0 was set at 100%, and all other normalized mRNA levels were graphed relative to that value.

https://openalex.org/W2009687620,"Recent studies in receptor-transfected cell lines have demonstrated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by angiotensin type 1A receptor and other G protein-coupled receptors can be mediated by both G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms. However, few studies have explored these mechanisms in primary cultured cells expressing endogenous levels of receptors. Accordingly, here we utilized the β-arrestin biased agonist for the angiotensin type 1A receptor, SII-angiotensin (SII), and RNA interference techniques to investigate angiotensin II (ANG)-activated β-arrestin-mediated mitogenic signaling pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Both ANG and SII induced DNA synthesis via the ERK activation cascade. Even though SII cannot induce calcium influx (G protein activation) after receptor stimulation, it does cause ERK activation, although less robustly than ANG. Activation by both ligands is diminished by depletion of β-arrestin2 by small interfering RNA, although the effect is more complete with SII. ERK activation at early time points but not later time points is strongly inhibited by those protein kinase C inhibitors that can block protein kinase Cζ. Moreover, ANG- and SII-mediated ERK activation require transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor via metalloprotease 2/9 and Src kinase. β-Arrestin2 facilitates ANG and SII stimulation of Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr-845 on the EGFR, a known site for Src phosphorylation. These studies delineate a convergent mechanism by which G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent pathways can independently mediate ERK-dependent transactivation of the EGFR in vascular smooth muscle cells thus controlling cellular proliferative responses.

G protein-coupled receptors, also known as seven transmembrane (7TM) 2The abbreviations used are: 7TM, seven transmembrane; AT1R, angiotensin type 1 receptor; ANG, angiotensin II; SII, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]-angiotensin II; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinases; BiPS, 2R-[(4-biphenylsulfonyl)amino]-N-hydroxy-3-phenylpropinamide; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; GFX, bisindolylmaleimide I; ANOVA, analysis of variance. receptors, control virtually all known physiological processes in mammals (1Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The various functions of these receptors are mediated and modulated by three families of proteins, which share the property that they interact virtually universally with the receptors in a strictly stimulus-dependent way (1Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These three families of proteins are the heterotrimeric G proteins, the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), and the β-arrestins. Activation of the receptors stimulates classical G protein-dependent signaling, often involving regulation of levels of second messengers such as cAMP and diacyglycerol. However, as has been known for many years, interaction of activated receptors with GRKs leading to their phosphorylation, and subsequent interaction with β-arrestins leads to desensitization of G protein signaling. In recent years, however, it has become increasingly clear that the β-arrestin-GRK system is in fact bifunctional (2DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Thus, even as it desensitizes G protein signaling by the receptors, it also serves as a signal transduction system in its own right, activating a growing list of signaling pathways. These positive signaling functions are often mediated by the ability of β-arrestin to serve as an adaptor or scaffold molecule, bringing elements of diverse signaling pathways into proximity with one another and the receptors and thereby facilitating their activation. This new paradigm for understanding the previously unrecognized signaling properties of the β-arrestin-GRK system has been explored in a wide variety of transfected cultured cell systems. However, to date, relatively little investigation of these novel signaling pathways has been carried out in primary cell culture systems expressing endogenous levels of 7TM receptors. In seeking such a system in which to characterize and compare β-arrestin and G protein-mediated signaling pathways from a typical 7TM receptor, our attention was drawn to cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Several features of rat VSMCs suggest this to be a relevant system for these purposes. Rat VSMCs express a variety of physiologically important 7TM receptors including the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1R) (3Demoliou-Mason C.D. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This receptor has been the focus of extensive study in transfected cell systems with respect to its β-arrestin-mediated signaling to a variety of pathways, most particularly extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, the AT1R mediates the physiologically important effects of angiotensin II (ANG) on vascular tone as well as on proliferation and chemotaxis (4Nozawa Y. Matsuura N. Miyake H. Yamada S. Kimura R. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 2061-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Wassmann S. Nickenig G. J. Hypertens. 2006; 24: S15-S21Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Pathophysiologically, ANG stimulation of this receptor has been implicated in VSMC proliferation and chemotaxis, which are thought to play an important role in such important disease processes as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty (6Yu P.J.

Indonesia. 2007; 39: 86-93PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a ligand has been characterized [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8](SII)-angiotensin (SII), a triply mutated angiotensin octapeptide that, in transfected cell systems, acts as a specific agonist for β-arrestin-mediated signaling, although not activating G protein-mediated signaling (8Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the studies described here, we set out to investigate the characteristics of activation of ERK in rat VSMCs that might be mediated through G protein as well as β-arrestin signaling. The results not only demonstrate the importance of β-arrestin-mediated signaling in ERK-mediated proliferative responses of these cells, but also shed new light on the molecular mechanisms and interrelationships between the β-arrestin and classical G protein-mediated activation of these pathways.

Synthesis of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Chemically synthesized, double-stranded siRNAs, with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-dTdT overhangs were purchased from Dharmacon in deprotected and desalted forms. The siRNA sequence targeting β-arrestin1 is 5′-AGCCUUCUGUGCUGAGAAC-3′, corresponding to position 431–459 relative to the start codon. The siRNA sequences targeting β-arrestin2 are 5′-GGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′ and 5′-CCAACCTCATTGAATTCGA-3′, corresponding to positions 150–168 and 1115–1133 relative to the start codon (10Ahn S.

A non-silencing RNA duplex (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′), as the manufacturer indicated, was used as a control. Cell Culture and RNA Transfection—VSMCs were prepared from aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion (11Kim J. Zhang L. Peppel K. Wu J.H. Zidar D.A. Brian L. DeWire S.M. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and maintained in Medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Eighty to 90% confluent, slow growing early passage (<5) cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 20 μg of siRNA using 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (11Kim J. Zhang L. Peppel K. Wu J.H. Zidar D.A. Brian L. DeWire S.M. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were starved with media with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for at least 48 h prior to stimulation. Calcium Fluorimetry—Cells were loaded with the dye Fura-2 as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with either ANG (100 nm) or SII (10 μm), in the presence of either 1 μm valsartan (Angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker, AT1RB) or 300 nm PD123319 (Angiotensin receptor type 2 blocker, AT2RB). The instantaneous 340/380-nm excitation ratio for Fura-2 was calculated and plotted as a function of time. DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was determined as incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material as described (11Kim J. Zhang L. Peppel K. Wu J.H. Zidar D.A. Brian L. DeWire S.M. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded 10,000 cells/well in 12-well plates and grown to subconfluence (1 day). Cells were rendered quiescent by 48 h in serum-free M199 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and stimulated by addition of fresh medium containing the agonists and/or inhibitors. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) was added to the medium at the time of stimulation. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and three times with 0.5% trichloroacetic acid, and then cells were lysed with 1 n NaOH. Extent of cell growth was determined by counting incorporation of [3H]thymidine into nascent DNA strands. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed by a modification of the methods of Daub et al. (12Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved in M199 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 48 h after siRNA transfection. Stimulation of serum-starved rat VSMC in 100-mm dishes with appropriate agonists was done at 37 °C for 2 min. After stimulation, monolayers were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The EGFR was immunoprecipitated using 4 μg of anti-EGFR antibody plus 25 μl of 50% slurry of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose and agitated overnight at 4 °C. Western blotting was performed to detect phosphorylation residues at Tyr-845 of the EGFR with antibody (Cell Signaling). For Western blotting for ERK activation, VSMCs on 6-well plates were starved for at least 48 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were solubilized by directly adding the 2× SDS sample buffer followed by sonication. Aliquoted cells after transfection were solubilized in a lysis buffer, as described previously (13Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), to measure the protein concentration. Equal amounts of cellular extracts were separated on 4–20% Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling, 1:2,000), anti-ERK (Upstate Technology Inc, 1:10,000), and anti-β-arrestin (A1CT, 1:3,000 and A2CT, 1:3000) antibodies, respectively (9Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce), and all the immunoblots were visualized and quantified by Bio Imaging system (Syngene). The levels of ERK phosphorylation was normalized to a loading control (total ERK). Statistical analysis was done using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (PRISM software) to correct for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni's multiple comparison test) with post test. Intracellular Calcium Mobilization and Its Effect on DNA Synthesis and ERK Activation Stimulated with ANG or SII—ANG regulates vascular tone and induces mitogenic responses. To understand the functions of β-arrestins in endogenously expressed AT1R-mediated mitogenic pathways, we utilized a triply mutated angiotensin octapeptide (SII) that acts as a specific agonist for β-arrestin-mediated signaling while not activating G protein-mediated signaling (8Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To validate the utility of SII as an activator of only β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways in primary cultured rat VSMCs (as is the case with receptor-transfected HEK 293 cells (8Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar)), calcium influx in response to ANG and SII was measured. As shown in Fig. 1A, VSMCs treated with ANG display robust calcium mobilization, whereas cells treated with SII shows no calcium mobilization, implying that SII cannot activate G-protein pathways in these cells. The ANG response is completely blocked in the presence of an angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker (AT1RB, Valsartan) but not by an angiotensin receptor type 2 blocker (AT2RB, PD 123319) (Fig. 1A). It is well known that ERK activation plays an important role in cell proliferation. To investigate the contribution of β-arrestin-mediated ERK activation to VSMC proliferation, we studied ANG- and SII-mediated DNA synthesis in VSMCs as an indicator of cell proliferation. VSMCs were pretreated or not with a pharmacological inhibitor (PD98059) of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) followed by stimulation with 100 nm ANG, 10 μm SII, or 10 ng/ml EGF. Although SII cannot activate classical G-protein-dependent Ca2+ fluxes (Fig. 1A), it significantly increased DNA synthesis (thymidine incorporation) to a level similar to that provoked by ANG or EGF stimulation in VSMCs (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with PD98059 ablated virtually all activation over basal levels (n = 5; p < 0.05), indicating that ERK activation regulates DNA synthesis in VSMCs (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that a G-protein-independent ERK activation mechanism that can be stimulated by SII can mediate AT1R-regulated DNA synthesis in rat VSMCs. In transfected HEK 293 cells it has been demonstrated that SII elicits AT1R signaling to ERK activation without activating the Gq protein (8Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates the inability of SII to activate calcium fluxes, a classic Gq response in VSMCs, whereas retaining the ability to induce DNA synthesis, which requires ERK activation. Next, we tested SII-mediated ERK activation mediated by the AT1R-expressed endogenously in VSMCs. Fig. 1, C and D, show that ERK activation by SII in VSMCs reaches maximal levels by 5 min, and amounted to a 2-fold increase over basal, which was about 50% of ANG-mediated ERK activation. Both ANG- and SII-stimulated ERK activation is completely sensitive to AT1RB pretreatment in VSMCs (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a G protein-independent pathway contributes to ERK activation in primary VSMCs through endogenously expressed AT1R. Effect of β-Arrestin Depletion on ANG- and SII-mediated ERK Activation—As shown in Figs. 1, G protein-independent signaling is involved in AT1R-mediated DNA synthesis via ERK activation in VSMCs. In HEK 293 cells, we have previously demonstrated that β-arrestins play critical roles in G protein-independent ERK activation (13Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of β-arrestin1 and -2 expression on the kinetics of ERK activation following stimulation with ANG and SII in VSMCs. Transfection with siRNAs targeting β-arrestin1 or -2 effectively and specifically silence the expression of each β-arrestin (Fig. 2A). In β-arrestin1 siRNA-transfected cells, ANG stimulation evokes a kinetic pattern of ERK activation similar to control but with significantly elevated levels of activation at the 2-min time point, compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, depletion of β-arrestin2 leads to decreased ERK activation (by over 30%) at the later time points (5 to 20 min) (Fig. 2, B and D). SII-stimulated ERK activation is completely lost in β-arrestin2 siRNA-transfected VSMCs (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that SII-stimulated ERK activation is entirely β-arrestin2-mediated. To further validate the contribution of β-arrestin2 to VSMC proliferation, we measured ANG- and SII-induced thymidine incorporation as an indicator of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in VSMCs after depletion of β-arrestin1 or -2. ANG- and SII-induced DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited only by deletion of β-arrestin2 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that β-arrestin2 has a major role in AT1R-mediated ERK signaling and cell proliferation in VSMCs. Role of PKC in AT1R-mediated ERK Activation in VSMCs—Upon agonist binding, AT1R activates Gq protein, which activates phospholipase C. Active phospholipase C generates inositol triphosphate and diacyglycerol, which increase intracellular calcium influx and PKC, respectively (14de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found that in HEK 293 cells AT1R-mediated G protein-dependent ERK activation requires PKC activity. This process is rapid (peak < 2 min) and quite transient (∼2 min) (13Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the role of PKC in mediating ANG-stimulated ERK activation in VSMCs by using PKC inhibitors. We tested several PKC inhibitors including GFX (bisindolylmaleimide I), Ro-31-8425, Gö6976, and Gö6983, which inhibit the activities of various combinations of conventional (α, β, or γ), novel (δ, ϵ, or μ), and atypical (ζ, ι) isoforms of PKC in a concentration-dependent way. There was no significant inhibition of ERK activation by either 1 μm Gö6976, a selective inhibitor of PKC α, β, and χ (Fig. 4A), or by 1 μm Ro-31-8425 (data not shown), a selective inhibitor of PKC α, β, χ, and ϵ. ANG-mediated ERK activation was also not inhibited by either 1 μm Gö6983 (Fig. 4B) or 5 μm GFX (data not shown), which at the concentrations tested only inhibit the activities of PKC isoforms α, β, δ, and/or χ. In contrast, pretreatment with PKC inhibitors (15 μm GFX and 10 μm Gö6983) resulted in dramatic decreases (∼75%) in ERK activation at early time points (1 and 2 min) after ANG stimulation, but little inhibition was observed at longer time points (10 and 20 min) (Fig. 4). The general PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced ERK activation and this was abolished by all of the PKC inhibitors used in VSMCs (data not shown). The kinetic pattern of ERK activation in the presence of the PKC inhibitors GFX and Gö6983 in VSMCs (Fig. 4) is similar to that observed previously for ANG-stimulated, β-arrestin2-dependent ERK activation in HEK 293 cells expressing AT1R (13Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Only early activity (i.e. prior to 5–10 min of stimulation) was inhibited. Thus, the temporal patterns of G protein-dependent (PKC dependent) and β-arrestin2-dependent ERK activation through endogenous AT1Rs in VSMCs are distinct from each other. The majority of early activity (≤2 min) is elicited via the G protein-dependent pathway (PKC inhibitor sensitive), whereas late activity (>5 min) is predominantly mediated by the β-arrestin2-dependent pathway. PKCζ Mediates G-protein-dependent ERK Activation Upon Stimulation with ANG—Three isoforms of PKC, α, δ, and ζ, have been shown to be expressed in VSMCs (15Assender J.W. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Among them, PKCζ has been implicated in ANG-mediated mitogenic responses and cell growth in VSMCs (16Parmentier J.H. Zhang C. Estes A. Schaefer S. Malik K.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: H1602-H1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although different isoforms of PKC may play roles in ERK activation in different cell types (17Porreca E. Ciccarelli R. Di Febbo C. Cuccurullo F. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 104: 137-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, we observed inhibition of ERK activation at the early time points when two PKC inhibitors capable of blocking PKC activity were used. Furthermore, blockade of PKCα and δ appears not to inhibit this ERK activation. Thus, we next examined the role of PKCζ in ERK activation in VSMCs utilizing the RNAi technique. Transfection with PKCζ-specific siRNA reduces the expression of PKCζ by 70% in VSMCs (Fig. 5, A and B). ANG-induced ERK activation at early time points (<5 min) was significantly decreased in cells transfected with PKCζ siRNA compared with that in control siRNA-transfected VSMCs (Fig. 5, C and D). To further validate the role of PKCζ in β-arrestin-dependent (or G protein-dependent) pathways, we also stimulated VSMCs transfected with PKCζ siRNA with SII. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, SII leads to activation of ERK at the same magnitude in both control and PKCζ siRNA-transfected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that PKCζ, at least partially, mediates ANG-induced early ERK activation, whereas not affecting β-arrestin-dependent ERK activation in VSMCs. ANG- and SII-mediated ERK Activation Is Dependent on EGFR Kinase and Metalloprotease 2/9 in VSMCs—It is known that AT1R-mediated EGFR transactivation plays an important role in proliferation of various cell types including VSMCs (19Eguchi S.

ANG promotes activation of the EGFR pathway through release of the EGFR ligand “heparin-binding EGF” in various cell types (12Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

However, it is not clear whether EGFR transactivation is required for β-arrestin-dependent ERK activation in VSMCs. To answer this question, we examined ERK activation after ANG and SII stimulation in the presence of various pharmacological inhibitors of components thought to be involved in the EGFR transactivation pathway. First we tested the requirement for EGFR kinase activity in ANG-induced ERK activation. In the presence of AG1478, an EGFR-specific kinase inhibitor, ANG-induced ERK activation is dramatically inhibited at all tested time points (Fig. 6, A and B). Next, we investigated the contribution of EGFR kinase activity particularly for the β-arrestin2-dependent pathway by testing ANG-mediated ERK activation in the presence of AG1478 after depletion of β-arrestin2. In VSMCs transfected with β-arrestin2 siRNA, ERK activation was further reduced by AG1478 as shown in Fig. 6, C and D. ANG-stimulated ERK activation was inhibited by AG1478 in both control and β-arrestin2 siRNA-transfected VSMCs (reduced to ∼40–50% of maximal ANG stimulation (Fig. 6, B and D). These data indicate that, without β-arrestin2, the remaining G protein-dependent component was also affected by the EGFR kinase inhibitor. Thus, both G protein- and β-arrestin2-dependent components required EGFR transactivation for AT1R-mediated ERK activation. In addition, SII-mediated ERK activation was virtually completely abolished by AG1478 as shown in Fig. 6, E and F. Because SII only activates β-arrestin-dependent pathways, this is clear evidence that EGFR kinase activity is required for β-arrestin2-dependent ERK activation in VSMCs. Our results utilizing RNA interference and pharmacological inhibitors reveal that β-arrestin-dependent ERK activation requires EGFR kinase activity, suggesting that EGFR transactivation is required for both G protein and β-arrestin2-dependent ERK activation by AT1R. ANG is known to induce transactivation of the EGFR through activation of metalloproteases that mediate cleavage of heparin-binding EGF from its precursor. It has been reported that BiPS, previously known as matrix metalloprotease-2/9 inhibitor, blocks ANG-induced EGFR transactivation (20Saito S. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Dempsey P.J. Utsunomiya H.

Pretreatment with BiPS completely inhibits SII-induced ERK activation; whereas it inhibits ANG-induced ERK activation by about 50% (Fig. 6, G and H). EGF-induced ERK activation is not affected by pretreatment with BiPS (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that both ANG- and SII-induced DNA"

This maternal-embryonic crosstalk involves local mediators within the uterine microenvironment. We demonstrate that a secreted protein, prokineticin 1 (PROK1), is expressed in the receptive endometrium and during early pregnancy. PROK1 induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in endometrial epithelial cells and first trimester decidua via a Gq-Ca2+-cSrc-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated pathway. We show that human embryonic chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces sequential mRNA expression of PROK1 and LIF in an in vivo baboon model, in human endometrial epithelial cells, and in first-trimester decidua. We have used micro RNA constructs targeted to PROK1 to demonstrate that hCG-mediated LIF expression in the endometrium is dependent on prior induction of PROK1. Dual immu-nohistochemical analysis colocalized expression of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor, PROK1, PROKR1, and LIF to the glandular epithelial cells of the first trimester decidual tissue. PROK1 enhances adhesion of trophoblast cells to fibronectin and laminin matrices, which are mediated predominantly via LIF induction. These data describe a novel signaling pathway mediating maternal-embryonic crosstalk, in which embryonic hCG via endometrial PROK1 may play a pivotal role in enhancing receptivity and maintaining early pregnancy.—Evans, J., Catalano, R.

Early vaccination of the population would be the single most effective measure for the control of an emerging influenza pandemic.Influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) produced in insect cell-culture substrates do not depend on the availability of fertile eggs for vaccine manufacturing. We produced VLPs containing influenza A/Viet Nam1203/04 (H5N1) hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix proteins, and investigated their preclinical immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Mice immunized intranasally with H5N1 VLPs developed high levels of H5N1 specific antibodies and were 100% protected against a high dose of homologous H5N1 virus infection at 30 weeks after immunization. Protection is likely to be correlated with humoral and cellular immunologic memory at systemic and mucosal sites as evidenced by rapid anamnestic responses to re-stimulation with viral antigen in vivo and in vitro.These results provide support for clinical evaluation of H5N1 VLP vaccination as a public health intervention to mitigate a possible pandemic of H5N1 influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2018544354,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a common bacteria-derived product, has long been recognized as a key factor implicated in periodontal bone loss. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms by which LPS induces bone loss still remains controversial. Here, we show that LPS inhibited osteoclastogenesis from freshly isolated osteoclast precursors but stimulated osteoclast formation from those pretreated with RANKL in vitro in tissue culture dishes, bone slices, and a co-culture system containing osteoblasts, indicating that RANKL-mediated lineage commitment is a prerequisite for LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, the RANKL-mediated lineage commitment is long term, irreversible, and TLR4-dependent. LPS exerts the dual function primarily by modulating the expression of NFATc1, a master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, in that it abolished RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression in freshly isolated osteoclast precursors but stimulated its expression in RANKL-pretreated cells. In addition, LPS prolonged osteoclast survival by activating the Akt, NF-kappaB, and ERK pathways. Our current work has not only unambiguously defined the role of LPS in osteoclastogenesis but also has elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying its complex functions in osteoclast formation and survival, thus laying a foundation for future delineation of the precise mechanism of periodontal bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2073430587,"Intersectin-short (intersectin-s) is a multimodule scaffolding protein functioning in constitutive and regulated forms of endocytosis in non-neuronal cells and in synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. In vertebrates, alternative splicing generates a second isoform, intersectin-long (intersectin-l), that contains additional modular domains providing a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Cdc42. In mammals, intersectin-s is expressed in multiple tissues and cells, including glia, but excluded from neurons, whereas intersectin-l is a neuron-specific isoform. Thus, intersectin-I may regulate multiple forms of endocytosis in mammalian neurons, including SV endocytosis. We now report, however, that intersectin-l is localized to somatodendritic regions of cultured hippocampal neurons, with some juxtanuclear accumulation, but is excluded from synaptophysin-labeled axon terminals. Consistently, intersectin-l knockdown (KD) does not affect SV recycling. Instead intersectin-l co-localizes with clathrin heavy chain and adaptor protein 2 in the somatodendritic region of neurons, and its KD reduces the rate of transferrin endocytosis. The protein also co-localizes with F-actin at dendritic spines, and intersectin-l KD disrupts spine maturation during development.

Through its GEF activity and binding to actin regulatory proteins, including N-WASP, intersectin-l has been implicated in actin regulation and the development of dendritic spines (19Nishimura T.

In addition, because the rest of the binding modules are shared between intersectin-s and -l, it is generally thought that the two intersectin isoforms have the same endocytic functions. In particular, given the well defined role for the invertebrate orthologs of intersectin-s in SV endocytosis, it is thought that intersectin-l performs this role in mammalian neurons, which lack intersectin-s. Defining the complement of intersectin functional activities in mammalian neurons is particularly relevant given that the protein is involved in the pathophysiology of Down syndrome (DS). Specifically, the intersectin gene is localized on chromosome 21q22.2 and is overexpressed in DS brains (38Pucharcós C. Fuentes J.J. Casas C. de la Luna S. Alcántara S. Arbonés M.L. Soriano E. Estivill X. Pritchard M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, alterations in endosomal pathways are a hallmark of DS neurons and neurons from the partial trisomy 16 mouse, Ts65Dn, a model for DS (39Cataldo A.M. Peterhoff C.M. Troncoso J.C.

Thus, an endocytic trafficking defect may contribute to the DS disease process. Here, the functional roles of intersectin-l were studied in cultured hippocampal neurons. We find that intersectin-l is localized to the somatodendritic regions of neurons, where it co-localizes with CHC and AP-2 and regulates the uptake of transferrin. Intersectin-l also co-localizes with actin at dendritic spines and disrupting intersectin-l function alters dendritic spine development. In contrast, intersectin-l is absent from presynaptic terminals and has little or no role in SV recycling. Neuronal Cultures and Transfections—Experiments were performed on primary hippocampal cultures from E18 rats, prepared as described (41Burman J.L. Wasiak S. Ritter B. de Heuvel E. McPherson P.S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and maintained in culture from between 10 and 21 days in vitro (DIV). Neurons were grown in Neurobasal medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, B-27, and N-2 supplements (Invitrogen). At 4-7 DIV, neurons were transduced with lentivirus (see below) or transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's guidelines. miRNA Vectors and Viruses—Three separate microRNA (miRNA) sequences (intersectin #1, #2, and #3) were generated to target rat intersectin-l. Intersectin #1 and #2 are against regions that are also found in intersectin-s, whereas intersectin #3 is specific to intersectin-l. The sequences target intersectin-l mRNA starting at nucleotides 2085 (intersectin #1), 2205 (intersectin #2), and 5337 (intersectin #3) and are CAAGCCGGAAGTGCAAGACAA, GAGTGCCAAAGTGGTGTATTA, and GGTCTTGTCATGGCTTCTAGA, respectively. A non-targeting miRNA was used for controls, and its sequence is AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT. Oligonucleotides encoding the miRNA sequences were cloned into pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR plasmid (Invitrogen). The EmGFP-miR cassette was then amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pRRLsinPPT vector, and VSVG pseudotyped virus was produced in HEK-293T cells. Virus particles were purified by ultracentrifugation and titered in HEK-293T cells.

For CME of transferrin, neuronal cultures were starved with unsupplemented Neurobasal media overnight prior to the experiment. Alexa-Fluor 546-transferrin (Invitrogen) was diluted to 12.5 μg/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and was continuously perfused in the imaging chamber during the entire length of live cell imaging. For quantification, regions of interest were drawn to outline the somatodendritic regions of neurons using ImageJ software (NIH). Total fluorescence in the regions of interest was measured and plotted over time. A linear regression was performed on the fluorescence time courses to calculate the rate of uptake. Uptake rates were averaged over multiple experiments as indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. Analysis of Dendritic Spines—Primary hippocampal cultures at 9-11 DIV were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on an upright confocal microscope (DMLFSA, Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) with a Leica SP2 scanhead, and cultures were continuously perfused with ∼30 °C Hanks' balanced salt solution. EmGFP-labeled tertiary dendrites were imaged with a Leica 63× (numerical aperture, 0.9) water immersion lens in three-dimensional stacks with voxel dimensions of 61 × 61 × 250-300 nm. Areas of interest were cropped and further processed for deconvolution using Huygens Pro Software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands) through a full maximum likelihood extrapolation algorithm. Volume rendering and quantification was carried out using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich). Dendritic spines were quantified as previously described (43McKinney R.A. Capogna M. Dürr R. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Briefly, spines that have short necks but a large, mushroom-shaped head correspond to the “mushroom” class. Spines that have an elongated neck (>1 μm in length) but only a small head correspond to the “long-thin” class. In addition, “filopodia”-type protrusions were typically >3 μm in length, lacking a distinct head, similar to those found during synaptogenesis (44Fiala J.C. Feinberg M. Popov V. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8900-8911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intersectin Knockdown Does Not Affect SV Recycling in Hippocampal Neurons—Intersectin has been shown to be present and to regulate SV recycling at invertebrate neuromuscular synapses (21Wang W.

Genet. 2008; 17: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is possible that intersectin-l fulfills this function in vertebrates including mammals. In fact, in lamprey, which expresses intersectin-l, disruption of intersectin function through injection of antibodies or overexpression of SH3 domains disrupts CME of SVs, although these reagents do not distinguish intersectin-s from intersectin-l (45Evergren E. Gad H. Walther K. Sundborger A. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test for a possible role for intersectin-l in SV recycling in mammalian neurons, we first analyzed its localization in hippocampal cultures. When neurons expressing monomeric red fluorescent protein to reveal cell morphology were stained for intersectin, the protein was found in puncta that were distributed in neuronal processes and throughout the cell body (Fig. 1A). Double labeling immunofluorescence with an antibody against synaptophysin, a marker of axonal boutons revealed little or no co-localization of intersectin with synaptophysin (Fig. 1, A and B). This result is in fact entirely consistent with the recent observation of Nishimura et al. (19Nishimura T. Yamaguchi T. Tokunaga A. Hara A. Hamaguchi T. Kato K. Iwamatsu A. Okano H. Kaibuchi K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1273-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that GFP-intersectin-l transfected in hippocampal neurons does not co-localize with synaptophysin. Thus, intersectin does not appear to be a major component of pre-synaptic boutons but is instead localized to somatodendritic regions. Recently, Yu et al. (36Yu Y. Chu P.Y. Bowser D.N. Keating D.J. Dubach D. Harper I. Tkalcevic J. Finkelstein D.I. Pritchard M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) demonstrated that intersectin null mice display a subtle but significant slowing of SV endocytosis. Thus, despite the fact there is little or no intersectin expression in the presynaptic compartment of hippocampal neurons, we sought to examine for possible defects in CME of SVs using a loss-of-function approach. To this end, we took advantage of a lentiviral system that we have developed to deliver inhibitory miRNA into post-mitotic cells, including neurons. 5B. Ritter and P.S. McPherson, unpublished results. We used three different miRNA sequences to KD intersectin-l in neurons. Two of the miRNAs (intersectin #1 and #2) target sequences that are common with intersectin-s, whereas a third miRNA (intersectin #3) targets a sequence specific to intersectin-l. Neuronal cultures transduced with the various intersectin targeted viruses or a control virus were lysed and processed for Western blot analysis. Intersectin #1- and #2-encoding viruses caused a decrease in the levels of both intersectin-s (∼140 kDa) and intersectin-l (∼190 kDa) as detected with two different antibodies (Fig. 2A). Intersectin #3 miRNA caused a selective decrease in the level of intersectin-l with no affect on the level of intersectin-s coming from glia (Fig. 2A). The levels of the multiple variants of clathrin light chains serve as loading controls and are equivalent between samples. Intersectin KD was also readily detectable by immunofluorescence where images from cultures treated with different miRNA-encoding viruses and control virus were taken with the same microscope settings (Fig. 2B). Alternatively, we used transfection of miRNA-encoding plasmids. Neurons transfected with the various intersectin miRNAs showed reduced intersectin immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate the effectiveness of the intersectin KD, and, importantly, they indicate that the immunofluorescence signal seen with the intersectin antibody is specific for intersectin. We also observed that intersectin miRNAs targeting the region of intersectin-l common with intersectin-s were able to eliminate intersectin staining in glia, whereas the intersectin-l-specific miRNA did not affect the levels of intersectin in glial cells (data not shown). Thus, the intersectin miRNA-encoding reagents are effective for intersectin KD. We measured SV endocytosis with the membrane dye FM4-64 as previously described (42Allaire P.D. Ritter B. Thomas S. Burman J.L. Denisov A.Y. Legendre-Guillemin V. Harper S.Q. Davidson B.L. Gehring K. McPherson P.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13202-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When comparing FM4-64 uptake in axons of transfected neurons with their non-transfected neighbors, we found no difference in axonal bouton fluorescence intensity upon intersectin KD (Fig. 3A). Averaging the amount of FM4-64 uptake in hundreds of boutons from multiple cultures/transfections revealed no significant effect of intersectin KD, regardless of which intersectin miRNA was used (Fig. 3B). Our data demonstrate that intersectin is not present in axonal boutons and that it does not appear to function in CME of SVs in mammalian hippocampal neurons. Intersectin Co-localizes with Markers of Clathrin-coated Structures in the Soma and Dendrites—Despite its seeming lack of function in SV endocytosis, intersectin could still participate in endocytic events in neurons. To examine this possibility, we studied the localization of intersectin in relationship to CHC, the central component of clathrin-coated pits and clathrin-coated vesicles. In neurons, CHC is localized to clathrin-coated structures that form at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane in somatodendritic regions. CHC is also found in synaptic boutons, were it co-localizes with synaptophysin and other pre-synaptic markers. Intersectin was found to partially co-localize with CHC in dendrites (Fig. 4) suggesting that a pool of the protein is present on endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Consistent with this notion we detected co-localization of intersectin with AP-2 in dendrites (Fig. 5A). Because, like CHC, a significant pool of AP-2 in neurons is found in pre-synaptic boutons, the CHC and AP-2 puncta that are negative for intersectin likely represent, to a large part, the pre-synaptic component. We also noted a pool of intersectin in the juxtanuclear area (Figs. 4 and 5). This pool of intersectin was also found to co-localize with CHC (Fig. 4), suggesting that intersectin is present on clathrin-coated structures at the TGN. Consistent with this notion, the juxtanuclear pool of intersectin was seen to co-localize in part with adaptor protein-1 (AP-1), a component and marker of TGN-derived clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 5B). Little co-localization was seen with GM130, a marker of the cis-Golgi (data not shown). Therefore, intersectin localizes to multiple clathrin-coated membranes in the somatodendritic region of neurons.FIGURE 5Intersectin co-localizes with clathrin adaptor proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2049261415,"It has recently been discovered that cell-cycle gene transcription is regulated by a core complex named LINC that switches from a transcriptionally repressive complex in G(0)-G(1) with the p130 or p107 pocket proteins and E2F4 to a transcriptionally active complex in S-G(2) containing B-Myb. We have studied the function of LINC in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, which are distinguished by a rapid cell cycle resulting from an extremely short G(1) phase. We show that suppressing expression of the LINC component, Lin-9, in F9 cells causes arrest in mitosis, and we have used this system to screen for transcriptional targets. In these cells, B-Myb was found in complexes with Lin-9 and several other LINC constituents, however, the pocket proteins did not associate with LINC unless F9 cells were differentiated. Lin-9 and B-Myb were both required for transcription of G(2)/M genes such as Cyclin B1 and Survivin. Moreover, B-Myb was demonstrated to recruit Lin-9 to the Survivin promoter through multiple Myb-binding sites. The demonstration that a B-Myb/LINC complex is vital for progression through mitosis in cells lacking a G(1)/S checkpoint has implications for both undifferentiated embryonal cells and for cancers in which pocket protein function is compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2066718551,"Background Radiation is a primary or secondary therapeutic modality for treatment of head and neck cancer. A common side effect of irradiation to the neck and neck region is xerostomia caused by salivary gland dysfunction. Approximately 40,000 new cases of xerostomia result from radiation treatment in the United States each year. The ensuing salivary gland hypofunction results in significant morbidity and diminishes the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies as well as the quality of life for these patients. Previous studies in a rat model have shown no correlation between induction of apoptosis in the salivary gland and either the immediate or chronic decrease in salivary function following γ-radiation treatment. Methodology/Principal Finding A significant level of apoptosis can be detected in the salivary glands of FVB mice following γ-radiation treatment of the head and neck and this apoptosis is suppressed in transgenic mice expressing an activated mutant of Akt (myr-Akt1). Importantly, this suppression of apoptosis in myr-Akt1 mice preserves salivary function, as measured by saliva output, three and thirty days after γ-radiation treatment. In order to translate these studies into a preclinal model we found that intravenous injection of IGF1 stimulated activation of endogenous Akt in the salivary glands in vivo. A single injection of IGF1 prior to exposure to γ-radiation diminishes salivary acinar cell apoptosis and completely preserves salivary gland function three and thirty days following irradiation. Conclusions/Significance These studies suggest that apoptosis of salivary acinar cells underlies salivary gland hypofunction occurring secondary to radiation of the head and neck region. Targeted delivery of IGF1 to the salivary gland of patients receiving head and neck irradiation may be useful in reducing or eliminating xerostomia and restoring quality of life to these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2021429236,"Musashi1 (Msi1) is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein with pivotal functions in stem cell maintenance, nervous system development, and tumorigenesis. Despite its importance, only three direct mRNA targets have been characterized so far: m-numb, CDKN1A, and c-mos. Msi1 has been shown to affect their translation by binding to short elements located in the 3′-untranslated region. To better understand Msi1 functions, we initially performed an RIP-Chip analysis in HEK293T cells; this method consists of isolation of specific RNA-protein complexes followed by identification of the RNA component via microarrays. A group of 64 mRNAs was found to be enriched in the Msi1-associated population compared with controls. These genes belong to two main functional categories pertinent to tumorigenesis: 1) cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis and 2) protein modification (including ubiquitination and ubiquitin cycle). To corroborate our findings, we examined the impact of Msi1 expression on both mRNA (transcriptomic) and protein (proteomic) expression levels. Genes whose mRNA levels were affected by Msi1 expression have a Gene Ontology distribution similar to RIP-Chip results, reinforcing Msi1 participation in cancer-related processes. The proteomics study revealed that Msi1 can have either positive or negative effects on gene expression of its direct targets.

RBPs can be classified as either general or specific. Specific RBPs interact with a small subset of mRNAs and can have a restrictive pattern of expression, e.g. being expressed only in certain tissues or during specific developmental stages (reviewed in Refs. 1McKee A.E. Silver P.A. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Sanchez-Diaz P. Penalva L.O. RNA Biol. 2006; 3: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Some subsets of functionally related mRNAs may be co-regulated by specific RBPs, thereby setting the basis for the “RNA-operon” model (3Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 4Keene J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). One group of specific RBPs comprises “oncofetal” proteins, which play an important role during embryonic development. In adults, their expression is limited to stem and progenitor cells and in some instances are detected in tumor tissues. The coding region determinant-binding protein falls into this category. Transgenic mice overexpressing coding region determinant-binding protein in mammary glands developed tumors in 95% of the cases, suggesting that coding region determinant-binding protein is a proto-oncogene (5Tessier C.R. Doyle G.A. Clark B.A. Pitot H.C. Ross J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Another RBP with a similar pattern of expression and phenotype is Musashi1 (Msi1), which is the focus of our study. Musashi (Msi) is conserved across species (6Sakakibara S. Nakamura Y. Yoshida T.

High levels of Msi1 have been found in different malignancies and, in certain cases, a correlation between Msi1 expression and a cancer cell's proliferative activity has been proposed. Further, small interference RNA-mediated Msi1 knockdown affects cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation and prevents cells from growing as xenographs (9Sanchez-Diaz P.C. Burton T.L.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Binding of Msi1 to this regulatory element has been shown to modulate mRNA translation either blocking it in the cases of the mammalian targets m-numb and CDKN1A, or enhancing it in the case of X. laevis target c-mos (18Imai T.

Imai T. Imataka H. Tsujimoto M. Matsumoto K. Okano H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); the mechanism by which Msi1 activates c-mos translation in X. laevis has yet to be determined. Based on what is known for other specific RBPs, we hypothesize that the three known Msi1 targets represent a small fraction of the RNAs regulated by this protein. To further elucidate the role of Msi1 in stem cell biology and tumor growth, a high throughput study to identify Msi1-associated RNAs is required. In this regard, RIP-Chip (Ribonomics) is the best approach available. In this method, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing the protein of interest are isolated via precipitation or immunoprecipitation (IP), and the associated RNAs are isolated and identified by microarray analysis (22Tenenbaum S.A.

BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This technology has been successfully used to identify RNA targets of numerous RBPs in different organisms (reviewed in Refs. 2Sanchez-Diaz P. Penalva L.O.

The analysis of 64 Msi1 preferentially associated mRNAs showed that Msi1 is likely to be involved in regulation of cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and post-translational modification. Transcriptomic analysis supports these findings. Plasmids—Msi1 and GFP open reading frames were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pShrek vector (23Penalva L.O. Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) coding sequence. pCMV3.1 (Invitrogen) expressing birA gene was previously generated (23Penalva L.O. Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-UTRs of the genes BTG3, CD164, RCN2, and UBE2E3 were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) in forward and reverse orientations in the XbaI site. Another plasmid was produced from the BTG3 3′-UTR clone by deleting a putative Msi1 binding site (GTAGT) located in position 1000–1004 (NM_006806). Tissue Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals Inc., Lawrenceville, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Herndon, VA). HEK293T cells were transfected using Gene Jammer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were plated in 150-mm plates coated with 0.001% polylysine, grown in media supplemented with 1 mm biotin (Research Organics, Cleveland, OH) to 50–60% confluence and co-transfected with 7 μg of BirA and 14 μg of the BAP-tagged protein-encoding plasmids.

Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained RNA samples were evaluated on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot Analysis and Precipitation Western—50 μg of protein extract was run on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Upstate, Temecula, CA) as described before (23Penalva L.O. Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For precipitation Western blots, we performed the isolation of RNP complexes, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots as described above with minor modifications. After washing with NT2 buffer, beads were re-suspended in 1 volume of 2× SDS-loading buffer, heated for 10 min at 95 °C, and 20 μl of sample was analyzed. Sample Preparation for Microarray Analysis (Transcriptomics)—293T cells were transfected either with the BAP-GFP or the BAP-Msi1 constructs as described before. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. For RNA preparation, cells were treated with TRIzol as recommended by Invitrogen (protocol for total RNA isolation) and re-purified with the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. Microarray Analysis—200 ng of each RNA sample was labeled with Cy3/Cy5 dye using Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification kit as per the manufacturer's protocols. To avoid dye-specific bias effects we used the dye-swap design in both RIP-Chip and gene expression experiments. After amplification, 750 ng each of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled RNA were combined and hybridized to an Agilent Human 1A oligonucleotide gene expression array. A two-color microarray-based gene expression analysis protocol (Agilent) was used. Microarrays were scanned using the Agilent Microarray Scanner G2565AA and extracted using Agilent feature Extraction Software version 9.1. Microarray Data Analysis (RIP-Chip)—Analyses of microarray data were done using the packages in Bioconductor such as marray, arrayQuality, limma, and arrayMagic. First, array quality was assessed by constructing a MA plot and RG (red/green) density plot and other quality diagnostic plots. The arrays were then background corrected using “Edwards” method. Within array normalization was achieved using “loess” normalization and a “quantile” normalization method was used for between array normalization. To detect genes that are enriched in the Msi1 population, the LIMMA model was used (26Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9184) Google Scholar). Both 3-fold enrichment in Msi1 array signal compared with controls and a spot intensity equal or higher than the average microarray spot intensity were established as thresholds for target identification. Adjusted false discovery rate p values were calculated for all the selected genes based on the LIMMA model and the null hypothesis of equal expression. Microarray Data Analysis (Gene Expression)—A similar analysis was done for the gene expression microarrays. First, the quality of the arrays was evaluated through several diagnostic plots and hierarchical clustering. Then, background was corrected using the “normexp + offset” method (27Ritchie M.E. Silver J. Oshlack A. Holmes M. Diyagama D. Holloway A. Smyth G.K. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). For within and between arrays normalizations “loess” and “Aquantile” methods were applied, respectively. Differential expression was assessed through linear models and Bayes' methods by using the LIMMA model (26Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article 3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9184) Google Scholar). We established a threshold of 2-fold enrichment or reduction in Msi1 expression compared with control, with an adjusted FDR p values below 0.05. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Primers for qRT-PCR (supplemental File S1) were designed using Primer3 (28Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Samples were analyzed using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system and Power SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 20 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed in a one-step qRT-PCR reaction using the MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and a gene-specific primer. All reactions were performed in quadruplicate. Following amplification, the ABI 7500 real-time software was used to determine the relative concentration of each mRNA using the ΔΔCt method. In the validation of RIP-Chip data, Mrsp5, a gene displaying a consistent 1:1 intensity ratio in the microarrays (BAP-Msi1 versus BAP-PABP1) was used as endogenous control for normalization. RNA Decay Assay of Msi1-associated mRNAs—HEK293T cells were transfected as before with either BAP-Msi1 or BAP-GFP. After growth for 24 h, RNA polymerase II activity was inhibited using α-amanitin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. At different time points, RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) and resuspended in nuclease-free water (Ambion). qRT-PCR reactions were performed as above. The gene expression data were normalized to 18 S rRNA expression and analyzed by the ΔΔCt methodology. Analysis of Secondary Structure of the 3′-UTR of Msi1-associated mRNAs—We applied EDscan (29Le S.Y. Chen J.H. Konings D. Maizel Jr., J.V. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to determine well ordered folding sequences, by calculating Zscre scores along the sequence by moving windows of sizes 40, 60, 80, and 100 nucleotides by steps of 5 nucleotides. Zscre = (Ediff - Ediff(w))/stdw, where Ediff(w) and stdw are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the Ediff scores computed by sliding a fixed-length window in steps of 5 nucleotides from the 5′ to the 3′ end of a sequence. Ediff = Ef - E, where E is the lowest free energy of the locally folded segment, and Ef is the lowest free energy of the structure that is computed under the condition that all base pairs formed in the minimum structure are prohibited. We looked for significant EDscan scores in the vicinity of Msi1 binding sites and determined the structures in the identified sites. Gene Ontology and Pathway Analysis—The biological function (Gene Ontology) of the Msi1 preferentially associated mRNAs identified by microarray analysis was determined by using DAVID (Data base for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) (30Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the Pathway Studio 6.0 software (Ariadne Genomics, Inc., Rockville, MD), an automated text-mining tool based on published literature from various sources. Pathway Studio software was also used to interpret, build, and visualize biological networks. MS-based Proteomics Analysis—Transfection of HEK293T cells with either the BAP-GFP or BAP-Msi1 was performed as described above. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cell extracts were prepared in two steps. Cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer with 1 volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was recovered as the “cytoplasmic” fraction. Another volume of buffer was added to the pellet. Cells were sonicated and treated as above to collect the “pellet” fraction. Both fractions were analyzed as follows. Protein extracts were prepared for tandem mass spectrometry analysis using a standard protocol, which involves denaturation (45 min at 55 °C with 50% trifluoroethanol), cysteine oxidation (30 min at room temperature with 55 mm iodoacetamide), tryptic digest (with ∼1:50 to 1:100 w/w trypsin at 37C for 4.5 h), and sample clean-up using C18 tips (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), and Microcon-10 filters. Samples were injected 3–4 times into an LCQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFinnigan) mass spectrometer and analyzed in a 0 to 90% acetonitrile gradient over 5 h via reversed-phase chromatography on a Thermo BioBasic-18 column (100- × 0.10-mm inner diameter). Each of the runs was analyzed independently with Bioworks (ThermoFinnigan), searching a database of non-redundant human sequences obtained from ENSEMBL (31Flicek P. Aken B.L. Beal K. Ballester B. Caccamo M. Chen Y. Clarke L. Coates G. Cunningham F. Cutts T. Down T. Dyer S.C. Eyre T. Fitzgerald S. Fernandez-Banet J. Graf S. Haider S. Hammond M. Holland R. Howe K.L. Howe K. Johnson N.

Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3897) Google Scholar) and ProteinProphet (33Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar), and then post-processed in the APEX pipeline (34Lu P. Vogel C. Wang R. Yao X. Marcotte E.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 35Vogel C. Marcotte E.M. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to estimate absolute and differential protein expression based on spectral counts of the proteins of interest. We accepted proteins as confidently identified if their ProteinProphet probability was above a cutoff corresponding to <5% global FDR. RIP-Chip Analysis of Msi1 and Identification of Preferentially Associated mRNAs—We expect Msi1 to regulate a few hundred mRNAs (reviewed in Refs. 1McKee A.E. Silver P.A. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Keene J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 25Halbeisen R.E. Galgano A. Scherrer T. Gerber A.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) considering its involvement in complex processes such as stem cell maintenance and neuronal differentiation. As stated previously, only three Msi1 mRNA targets have been characterized in vertebrates. We decided to conduct a RIP-Chip analysis to identify novel Msi1 targets and to gain a better insight on the biological processes regulated by this protein. We chose to use HEK293T cells as a model system for several reasons. First, our approach was originally developed in this cell system and achieved excellent reproducibility for a variety of RBPs (23Penalva L.O. Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, because high levels of Msi1 have been observed in different tumor samples and derived cell lines, we decided to use a cell line that allows exceptional levels of transfection and transgene expression. Third, CDKN1A, one of Msi1's described targets, was identified using this cell line and, recently, Kawahara et al. (21Kawahara H. Imai T. Imataka H. Tsujimoto M. Matsumoto K. Okano H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 639-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) used HEK293T as the model system to elucidate the mechanism by which Msi1 regulates translation in mammalian cells. There are currently no standards regarding the way a RIP-Chip analysis should be conducted. Previous studies have been performed using either a tag strategy or antibodies against endogenous RBPs. There is also great variation in terms of controls and cut-off limits to define preferentially associated mRNAs (reviewed in Refs. 2Sanchez-Diaz P. Penalva L.O. RNA Biol. 2006; 3: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Keene J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 25Halbeisen R.E. Galgano A. Scherrer T. Gerber A.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 798-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To increase confidence in our results, we conducted two parallel experiments with two different controls. In both cases, Msi1-associated mRNAs were expected to be enriched in the experimental samples compared with controls. Our two controls were green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Poly(A)-binding protein I (PABP1). Because GFP is not an RNA-binding protein and is not expressed in mammalian cells, we assume that the RNAs pulled down represent the background signal. In contrast, PABP1 is a protein that plays a key role in mRNA translation via its binding to their poly(A) tails. Previous data indicate that the “PABP1 profile” is very similar to the “transcriptomic profile” (36Penalva L.O. Burdick M.D. Lin S.M. Sutterluety H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cancer. 2004; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we propose to use PABP1 IPs as a control for all polyadenylated mRNAs present in RNPs. This strategy is similar to the use of RNA polymerase II IPs in ChIP-Chip experiments to identify all genes in a sample with poised RNA polymerase (Fig. 1). We conducted RIP-Chip experiments using a tag strategy. The biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) attached to the protein of interest was biotinylated in vivo by the Escherichia coli BirA enzyme, and then streptavidin-Sepharose beads were used to pull down and isolate RNP complexes (23Penalva L.O. Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two groups of experiments were carried out. In both cases, the “experimental sample” represents the transfection with the BAP-Msi1 construct. One control sample was derived from cells transfected with the BAP-GFP construct, whereas the second control was derived from cells transfected with the BAP-PABP1 construct. In all cases, a plasmid expressing the birA gene was co-transfected to assure biotinylation of the BAP tags (Fig. 1). Because high protein recovery dictates the success of a RIP-Chip analysis, we first performed a precipitation Western blot to determine the levels of tagged protein recovery via streptavidin-Sepharose bead precipitation. Experiments were carried out with the BAP-Msi1 and BAP-GFP constructs; BAP-PABP1 was described and characterized previously (23Penalva L.O. Keene J.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37 (606, 608–610): 604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery of both BAP-GFP and BAP-Msi1 from cell extract was highly successful (supplemental File S2). Subsequently, we measured RNA recovery using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to verify that the tagged proteins behaved as expected. Starting from 1 ml of cell lysate (∼20 mg of total protein), the amount of RNA we typically recovered after precipitation with streptavidin-Sepharose beads was ∼15 μg for BAP-PABP1, ∼4 μg for BAP-Msi1, and 500 ng for BAP-GFP, in agreement with the properties of the three proteins used in our analysis. RNAs were then amplified and labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures” to probe human 22K Agilent arrays. Each set of experiments included four microarrays, two technical replicates of BAP-Msi1 versus control (BAP-GFP or BAP-PABP1) for each dye orientation. We used default statistical parameters to define mRNAs that are preferentially associated with BAP-Msi1. We conservatively established a 3-fold minimum average of enrichment, adjusted FDR p value < 0.00001, and spot (gene) intensity equal or above the average array signal as cut-off values. We compared the results from the two sets of experiments and identified 64 mRNAs that met threshold in both experiments (Table 1 and supplemental File S3). Noteworthy, 62 out of the 64 mRNAs contained at least one consensus binding site for Msi1 in the 3′-UTR.TABLE 1Functional classification of Msi1-associated mRNAsSymbolGene descriptionBiological processaBiological process abbreviations: APOP, apoptosis; CC, cell cycle; DIFF, differentiation; PM, protein modif"
https://openalex.org/W2038275015,"The three key players in the exocytotic release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles are the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins synaptobrevin 2, syntaxin 1a, and SNAP-25. Their assembly into a tight four-helix bundle complex is thought to pull the two membranes into close proximity. It is debated, however, whether the energy generated suffices for membrane fusion. Here, we have determined the thermodynamic properties of the individual SNARE assembly steps by isothermal titration calorimetry. We found extremely large favorable enthalpy changes counterbalanced by positive entropy changes, reflecting the major conformational changes upon assembly. To circumvent the fact that ternary complex formation is essentially irreversible, we used a stabilized syntaxin-SNAP-25 heterodimer to study synaptobrevin binding. This strategy revealed that the N-terminal synaptobrevin coil binds reversibly with nanomolar affinity. This suggests that individual, membrane-bridging SNARE complexes can provide much less pulling force than previously claimed."
https://openalex.org/W1973129324,"Background Dietary energy density (DED) does not have a simple linear relationship to fat mass in children, which suggests that some children are more susceptible than others to the effects of DED. Children with the FTO (rs9939609) variant that increases the risk of obesity may have a higher susceptibility to the effects of DED because their internal appetite control system is compromised. We tested the relationship between DED and fat mass in early adolescence and its interaction with FTO variants. Methods and Findings We carried out a prospective analysis on 2,275 children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Diet was assessed at age 10 y using 3-day diet diaries. DED (kJ/g) was calculated excluding drinks. Children were genotyped for the FTO (rs9939609) variant. Fat mass was estimated at age 13 y using the Lunar Prodigy Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry scanner. There was no evidence of interaction between DED at age 10 y and the high risk A allele of the FTO gene in relation to fat mass at age 13 y (β = 0.005, p = 0.51), suggesting that the FTO gene has no effect on the relation between DED at 10 y and fat mass at 13 y. When DED at 10 y and the A allele of FTO were in the same model they were independently related to fat mass at 13 y. Each A allele of FTO was associated with 0.35±0.13 kg more fat mass at 13 y and each 1 kJ/g DED at 10 y was associated with 0.16±0.06 kg more fat mass at age 13 y, after controlling for misreporting of energy intake, gender, puberty, overweight status at 10 y, maternal education, TV watching, and physical activity. Conclusions This study reveals the multi-factorial origin of obesity and indicates that although FTO may put some children at greater risk of obesity, encouraging a low dietary energy density may be an effective strategy to help all children avoid excessive fat gain."
https://openalex.org/W2043676834,"Mutant p53 gain of function contributes to cancer progression, increased invasion and metastasis potentials, and resistance to anticancer therapy. The ability of mutant p53 to acquire its gain of function is shown to correlate with increased expression of progrowth genes, such as c-MYC, MDR1, and NF-κB2. However, most of the published studies to identify mutant p53 target genes were performed in a cell system that artificially overexpresses mutant p53. Thus, it remains unclear whether such mutant p53 targets can be regulated by endogenous physiological levels of mutant p53. Here, we utilized SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells, in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down, to identify mutant p53 target genes that potentially mediate mutant p53 gain of function. We found that knockdown of mutant p53 inhibits GRO1 expression, whereas ectopic expression of mutant R175H in p53-null HCT116 cells increases GRO1 expression. In addition, we found that endogenous mutant p53 is capable of binding to and activating the GRO1 promoter. Interestingly, ectopic expression of GRO1 can rescue the proliferative defect in SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells induced by knockdown of mutant p53. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous GRO1 inhibits cell proliferation and thus abrogates mutant p53 gain of function in SW480 cells. Taken together, our findings define a novel mechanism by which mutant p53 acquires its gain of function via transactivating the GRO1 gene in cancer cells. Thus, targeting GRO1 for cancer therapy would be applicable to a large portion of human tumors with mutant p53, but the exploration of GRO1 as a potential target should take the mutation status of p53 into consideration.

It is known that mutation of p53 and/or inactivation of the p53 pathway are a hallmark of ∼50% human tumors. p53 is a tumor suppressor, and mutation of p53 leads to loss of its tumor-suppressing functions. Furthermore, a growing number of studies have provided compelling evidence that some p53 mutants have acquired additional functions that promote cancer development and progression, called gain-of-function (1Kalo E. Buganim Y. Shapira K.E. Besserglick H. Goldfinger N. Weisz L. Stambolsky P. Henis Y.I. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8228-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Bossi G. Lapi E. Strano S. Rinaldo C. Blandino G. Sacchi A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Accordingly, gain of function was found to include the ability of mutant p53 to modulate specific target genes, such as MDR1 and c-MYC (3Atema A. Chene P.

However, most of the published studies to identify mutant p53 target genes were performed in a cell system that artificially overexpresses exogenous mutant p53 proteins. Thus, it remains unclear whether these mutant p53 targets can be regulated by endogenous physiological levels of mutant p53. Growth-regulated oncogene 1 (GRO1 or CXCL1) is found as an inflammatory factor and necessary for wound healing by modulating cell migration and angiogenesis (5Lane B.R. Liu J. Bock P.J. Schols D.

GRO1, a 73-amino acid secreted protein, contains a 3-amino acid motif (ELR; glutamate, leucine, and arginine) between the N terminus and the first cysteine (7Bechara C. Chai H. Lin P.H. Yao Q. Chen C. Med. Sci. Monit. 2007; 13: RA87-RA90PubMed Google Scholar). GRO1 is structurally and functionally related to GRO2 (CXCL2), GRO3 (CXCL3), and interleukin-8. These four ligands constitute the CXC chemokine subfamily. All four ligands bind to the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR2, with GRO1 having the highest affinity (8Hammond M.E.

Upon ligand-receptor interaction, various signaling cascades are activated, including ERK1/2, JAK2-STAT3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases, to promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell invasion and migration (9Wang B.

GRO1 is also found to be an oncogene and has pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (9Wang B. Hendricks D.T. Wamunyokoli F. Parker M.I.

Furthermore, GRO1 was found to be a potent mediator of tumor-associated angiogenesis in colorectal and breast cancers (15Wang D. Wang H. Brown J. Daikoku T. Ning W. Shi Q. Richmond A. Strieter R. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Caunt M. Hu L. Tang T. Brooks P.C. Ibrahim S. Karpatkin S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4125-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, how GRO1 expression is deregulated in malignant cells is still poorly understood. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the GRO1 promoter contains several cis-acting elements, including the ones recognized by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), Sp1, and human CUT homeodomain protein/CCAAT displacement protein (19Nirodi C. Hart J. Dhawan P. Moon N.S. Nepveu A. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26122-26131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, NF-κB activity is found to be necessary for GRO1 expression in microvascular endothelial cells (20Karl E. Warner K. Zeitlin B. Kaneko T. Wurtzel L. Jin T. Chang J. Wang S. Wang C.Y. Strieter R.M. Nunez G. Polverini P.J. Nor J.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5063-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and breast cancer cells (13Bachmeier B.E. Mohrenz I.V. Mirisola V. Schleicher E. Romeo F. Hohneke C. Jochum M. Nerlich A.G. Pfeffer U. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, GRO1 is regarded as one of NF-κB target genes (21Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that GRO1 is transactivated by endogenous mutant p53 and serves as a crucial determinant for mutant p53 gain of function. We showed that endogenous mutant p53 directly binds to the GRO1 promoter and that knockdown of mutant p53 inhibits GRO1 expression. In addition, overexpression of mutant R175H in p53-null HCT116 cells increases GRO1 expression. Interestingly, ectopic expression of GRO1 can rescue the proliferative defect in SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells induced by knockdown of mutant p53. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous GRO1 inhibits cell proliferation and thus abrogates mutant p53 gain of function in SW480 cells. Small Hairpin RNA Oligonucleotides and Plasmids—To transiently knock down wild-type p53, a 21-bp p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), 2The abbreviations used are: shRNA, short hairpin RNA; nt, nucleotide(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. 5′-GACUCCAGUGGUAAUCUACdTdT-3′, and a randomly selected scrambled shRNA, 5′-GCAGUGUCUCCACGUACUAdTdT-3′, were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies. Transfection of p53 or scrambled shRNA was performed by using SilentFect™ lipid reagent (Bio-Rad). To generate a construct that expresses p53 shRNA under the control of tetracycline, one pair of oligonucleotides was cloned into pBabe-H1 at HindIII and BglII sites, and the resulting construct was designated as pBabe-H1-p53shRNA. pBabe-H1 is a PolIII promoter-driven plasmid with a tetracycline operator sequence inserted before the transcriptional starting site (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The shRNA oligonucleotides cloned into pBabe-H1-p53shRNA are sense (5′-GAT CCC C GA CTC CAG TGG TAA TCT ACT TCA AGA GAG TAG ATT ACC ACT GGA GTC TTT TTG GAA A-3′) and antisense (5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AA G ACT CCA GTG GTA ATC TAC TCT CTT GAA GTA GAT TAC CAC TGG AGT CGG G-3′), with the shRNA targeting region shown in boldface type. To generate a construct that expresses GRO1 shRNA, one pair of oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-GAT CCC CGC TCA CTG GTG GCT GTT CCT TCA AGA GAG GA A CAG CCA CCA GTG AGC TTT TTG GAA A-3′; antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AA G CTC ACT GGT GGC TGT TCC TCT CTT GAA GGA ACA GCC ACC AGT GAG CGG G-3′; shRNA targeting region shown in boldface type) was synthesized and cloned into pBabe-H1 at HindIII and BglII sites, and the resulting construct was designated as pBabe-H1-GRO1shRNA. For stable or inducible overexpression of GRO1 in cancer cells, a cDNA fragment containing the GRO1 open reading frame was amplified from an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ accession code NM_001511) with the forward primer (5′-GGA TCC ACC ATG GCC CGC GCT GCT CTC TCC G-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CTC GAG TCA GTT GGA TTT GTC ACT GTT CAG-3′), confirmed by DNA sequencing, and then cloned into pcDNA3 and pcDNA4 tetracycline-inducible expression vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were designated as pcDNA3-GRO1 and pcDNA4-GRO1, respectively. To generate a construct that expresses mutant p53(R175H), a DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of mutant p53(R175H) was amplified with a forward primer (5′-AAG CTT ACC ATG GGC TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CTC GAG TCA GTC TGA GTC AGG CCC TTC-3′) and confirmed by sequencing. The fragment was cloned into pcDNA4 and the resulting plasmid designated as pcDNA4-HA-p53(R175H). To generate a construct that expresses wild-type p53, a DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of wild-type p53 was amplified with a forward primer (5′-AAG CTT ACC ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CTC GAG TCA GTC TGA GTC AGG CCC TTC-3′) and confirmed by sequencing. The fragment was cloned into pcDNA3, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pcDNA3-wtp53. The luciferase reporter under the control of the p21 promoter, pGL2-p21A, was as previously described (23Nozell S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To generate a luciferase reporter under the control of the GRO1 promoter, a 100-bp DNA fragment containing the GRO1 promoter from nucleotide (nt) -50 to +50 was amplified using genomic DNA from SW480 cells with forward primer 5′-CTC GAG TTT CCA GCC CCA ACC ATG C-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAG CTT GAG AGG AGC GGA AGA GCT G-3′. The PCR product, GRO1-50, was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing. After digesting with XhoI and HindIII, the fragment was cloned into pGL2-Basic vector. The resulting luciferase reporter was designated as pGL2-GRO1-50. Cell Culture—Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 (containing R273H/P309S), pancreatic cancer cell line MIA-PaCa-2 (containing R248W), and colon carcinoma cell lines HCT116 and HCT116 (p53-/-) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with ∼10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). SW480-p53-KD and MIA-PaCa-2-p53-KD cell lines, in which shRNA targeting p53 is inducibly expressed under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter, were generated as described (24Yan W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9117-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To generate cell lines in which mutant p53 is inducibly knocked down and GRO1 is stably overexpressed, pBabe-H1-p53shRNA was cotransfected with pcDNA3-GRO1 into SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells, which express a tetracycline repressor by pcDNA6. The resulting p53 knockdown and GRO1-stable overexpression cell lines were selected with puromycin and G418. The efficiency of p53 knockdown and GRO1-stable overexpression was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-p53 and anti-GRO1 antibodies. To generate cell lines that inducibly overexpress GRO1, pcDNA4-GRO1 was transfected into SW480 cells, which express a tetracycline repressor by pcDNA6. The resulting GRO1 overexpression cell lines were selected with Zeocin, and inducible GRO1 overexpression was then confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-GRO1 antibody. To generate cell lines that inducibly overexpress mutant p53(R175H), pcDNA4-HA-p53(R175H) was transfected into HCT116(p53-/-) cells, which express a tetracycline repressor by pcDNA6. The resulting p53(R175H) overexpression cell lines were selected with Zeocin, and inducible mutant p53 overexpression was then confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-p53 antibody. Affymetrix GeneChip, Northern Blot, and Real-time PCR Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, which contain probe sets for analysis of over 47,000 human transcripts, were purchased from Affymetrix. GeneChip analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Yan W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9117-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The GRO1 probe was prepared from an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ accession code NM_001511). The mRNA level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was examined as a loading control. Real-time PCR was conducted using a Realplex2 system (Eppendorf). cDNA was synthesized using a Iscript™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). To quantify the GRO1 mRNA, real-time PCR was done with the forward primer 5′-AGG GAA TTC ACC CCA AGA AC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACT ATG GGG GAT GCA GGA TT-3′.To quantify the p65 mRNA, quantitative real-time PCR was done with the forward primer 5′-CTG CCG GGA TGG CTT CTA T-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCG CTT CTT CAC ACA CTG GAT-3′. To quantify the p52 mRNA, real-time PCR was done with the forward primer 5′-GGG GCA TCA AAC CTG AAG ATT TCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCC GGA ACA CAA TGG CAT ACT GT-3′. GAPDH was amplified as internal control using the forward primer 5′-AGC CTC AAG ATC ATC AGC AAT G-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATG GAC TGT GGT CAT GAG TCC TT-3′. The changes in the levels of GRO1, p65, and p52 mRNA relative to that of GAPDH mRNA were determined using a threshold cycle method to calculate changes in threshold cycle and then folds. An average value for each gene was obtained from triplicate reactions. Luciferase Assay—The assay was performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, 0.25 μg of a luciferase reporter, 0.25 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 that expresses mutant p53 or wild-type p53, and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL-CMV (Promega) were co-transfected into p53-null HCT116 cells. The -fold increase in relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by mutant p53 divided by that induced by an empty pcDNA3 vector. The pGL2-p21A luciferase reporter under the control of the two p53-responsive elements in the p21 promoter was used as a control (19Nirodi C. Hart J. Dhawan P. Moon N.S. Nepveu A. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26122-26131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The assay was performed as previously described (17Loukinova E. Dong G. Enamorado-Ayalya I. Thomas G.R. Chen Z. Schreiber H. Van Waes C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

SW480-p53-shRNA cells, which were uninduced (-) or induced (+) to knock down mutant p53 for 3 days, were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and chromatin was sonicated to generate 200–1000-bp DNA fragments. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies. The DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. After phenol and chloroform extraction, DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. To detect mutant p53 binding site in the GRO1 promoter, three regions, including GRO1-C1 (from nt -219 to +6), GRO1-C2 (from nt -1938 to -1719), and GRO1-C3 (from nt -3806 to -3611), were amplified by PCR. Three pairs of PCR primers were used to amplify: GRO1-C1 with forward 5′-TCA GAG TCC ACA GGA GTT ACT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCT GTG GCT CTC CGA GAT CC-3′; GRO1-C2 with forward 5′-AGA AAC AAC ATT CTA GCA CAC C-3′ and reverse 5′-TAT ATC AGT TAC TGC TAC CCA AC-3′; and GRO1-C3 with forward 5′-TGA CAC ATT ACT TTT AAC TGA AC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTC TTC AAA ATT GTC AAT GTC ATG-3′. To amplify the region from nt -2312 to -2131 in the p21 promoter, PCR was performed with forward primer 5′-CAG GCT GTG GCT CTG ATT GG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTC AGA GTA ACA GGC TAA GG-3′. A region in the GAPDH promoter was amplified to serve as a nonspecific binding control with forward primer 5′-AAA AGC GGG GAG AAA GTA GG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAG AAG ATG CGG CTG ACT GT-3′. DNA Pull-down Assay—The pull-down assay was performed as described (25Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Wu K.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 338: 281-290PubMed Google Scholar). The biotin-labeled promoter probe (nt -219 to +6 in the GRO1 gene) was synthesized by PCR with 5′-biotinated forward primer 5′-TCA GAG TCC ACA GGA GTT ACT and reverse primer 5′-TCT GTG GCT CTC CGA GAT CC. The biotin-labeled probe (nt -205 to +16 in the GAPDH gene), which does not contain a known NF-κB binding site, was also synthesized by PCR with 5′-biotinated forward primer 5′-CTA CGT CGG GGC CCA CAC and reverse primer 5′-GCT GCG GGC TCA ATT TAT AG and used as a negative binding control. The biotinated probes were then bound to streptavidin-agarose beads and used to precipitate a protein of interest from nuclear protein extracts. All steps of nuclear extract isolation were done at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in two package cell volumes of a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgC12, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm NaF. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in two-thirds package cell volume of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol, and various protein inhibitors as above. After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was isovolumetrically diluted with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KC1, 0.2 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, and inhibitors. The binding assay was performed by mixing 200 μg of nuclear protein extracts, 2 μg of a biotin-labeled probe, 20 μl of 50% streptavidin-agarose beads (Prozyme), and 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with various protein inhibitors (PBSI). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with rocking. Beads were then pelleted down by centrifugation, washed with PBSI three times, and resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected for Western blot assay. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were grown on a 4-well chamber slide and treated as indicated. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min, and then incubated with mouse anti-p53 and rabbit anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research and Molecular Probes). Cells were also stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) to visualize nuclei and then mounted with a solution containing 0.1% of purified protein derivative (Sigma) and 80% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Intracellular distribution of proteins was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies—Mouse anti-GRO1 and rabbit anti-p65 were purchased from Abcam Inc. and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Antibodies against p53, hemagglutinin epitope, and actin were described previously (26Wu K.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 338: 281-290PubMed Google Scholar). The level of actin protein was measured as a loading control. Colony Formation Assay—SW480 or MIA-PaCa-2 cells (1000 cells/well) in a 6-well plate were cultured in the absence or presence of tetracycline (1.0 μg/ml) for 72 h and then untreated or treated with camptothecin as indicated for 4 h, followed by one wash with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove the drug. The cells were maintained in fresh medium for the next 15–17 days and then fixed with methanol/glacial acetic acid (7:1) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Statistics—All experiments were performed in triplicates. Two-group comparisons were analyzed by two-sided Student's t test. p values were calculated, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Knockdown of Mutant p53 Inhibits GRO1 Expression in SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 Cells—Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that in addition to loss of tumor-suppressing functions, mutant p53 contributes to the malignant process by acquiring additional activities, including resistance to anticancer therapy and increased invasion and metastasis potential (2Bossi G. Lapi E. Strano S. Rinaldo C. Blandino G. Sacchi A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M.

Through overexpression, some mutant p53 is capable of transactivating genes involved in cell growth and survival, such as c-MYC, MDR1, and NF-κB2 (4Frazier M.W. He X. Wang J. Gu Z. Cleveland J.L. Zambetti G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 28Scian M.J. Stagliano K.E. Anderson M.A. Hassan S. Bowman M. Miles M.F. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell.

However, it is not certain whether these genes can be regulated by physiologically relevant levels of mutant p53 in tumor cells. To address this, we utilized SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 cell lines in which endogenous mutant p53 can be inducibly knocked down by shRNA under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter. Several representative p53 knockdown SW480 (Fig. 1A, left) and MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig. 1B, left) cell lines were shown. Upon induction of shRNA against p53, the levels of mutant p53 protein were obviously reduced. Furthermore, to determine whether endogenous mutant p53 has a transcriptional activity, microarray analyses were used to examine the pattern of gene expression in both SW480 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells, which were uninduced or induced to knock down endogenous mutant p53. We found that GRO1 expression was significantly down-regulated upon mutant p53 knockdown. Next, Northern blot analyses and quantitative real-time PCRs were performed and showed that the levels of GRO1 mRNA were markedly decreased upon knockdown of mutant p53 in SW480 (Fig. 1A, middle and right) and MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig. 1B, middle and right) cells. The levels of GAPDH mRNA were examined as a control in both assays. To examine whether down-regulation of GRO1 in these cells is specifically due to mutant p53 knockdown, wild-type p53 in HCT116 cells was transiently knocked down by p53 shRNA. We found that the protein levels of wild-type p53 and its target p21 under both the basal and stress (treated with camptothecin) conditions were reduced by shRNA against p53 but not scrambled mock shRNA (Fig. 1C, left). However, knockdown of wild-type p53 had little if any effect on the relative mRNA level of GRO1 (Fig. 1C, right). These data suggest that GRO1 is likely to be a common target of mutant R273H/P309S in SW480 cells and mutant R248W in MIA-PaCa-2 cells. The NF-κB Pathway Is Not Required for Mutant p53 to Regulate GRO1 Expression—Previous studies showed that GRO1 is an NF-κB target gene (21Wood L.D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30619-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and down-regulation of the NF-κB activity inhibits GRO1 expression (13Bachmeier B.E. Mohrenz I.V.

Interestingly, wild-type p53 was found to inhibit, whereas mutant p53 was found to increase, the expression and/or activity of the NF-κB pathway (28Scian M.J. Stagliano K.E. Anderson M.A. Hassan S.

https://openalex.org/W2030519118,"Previously, we have demonstrated that human oxidative DNA glycosylase NEIL1 excises photoactivated psoralen-induced monoadducts but not genuine interstrand cross-links (ICLs) in duplex DNA. It has been postulated that the repair of ICLs in mammalian cells is mainly linked to DNA replication and proceeds via dual incisions in one DNA strand that bracket the cross-linked site. This process, known as “unhooking,” enables strand separation and translesion DNA synthesis through the gap, yielding a three-stranded DNA repair intermediate composed of a short unhooked oligomer covalently bound to the duplex. At present, the detailed molecular mechanism of ICL repair in mammalian cells remains unclear. Here, we constructed and characterized three-stranded DNA structures containing a single ICL as substrates for the base excision repair proteins. We show that NEIL1 excises with high efficiency the unhooked ICL fragment within a three-stranded DNA structure. Complete reconstitution of the repair of unhooked ICL shows that it can be processed in a short patch base excision repair pathway. The new substrate specificity of NEIL1 points to a preferential involvement in the replication-associated repair of ICLs. Based on these data, we propose a model for the mechanism of ICL repair in mammalian cells that implicates the DNA glycosylase activity of NEIL1 downstream of Xeroderma Pigmentosum group F/Excision Repair Cross-Complementing 1 endonuclease complex (XPF/ERCC1) and translesion DNA synthesis repair steps. Finally, our data demonstrate that Nei-like proteins from Escherichia coli to human cells can excise bulky unhooked psoralen-induced ICLs via hydrolysis of glycosidic bond between cross-linked base and deoxyribose sugar, thus providing an alternative heuristic solution for the removal of complex DNA lesions.

Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Furanocoumarins (psoralens), naturally occurring secondary metabolites in plants, are tricyclic compounds formed by the fusion of a furan ring with a coumarin (Fig. 1). Among other ICL-inducing agents, psoralens require UVA photoactivation following DNA intercalation to chemically react with both cellular DNA in vivo and naked DNA in vitro (3Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is an asymmetric, planar compound that intercalates into DNA duplex near pyrimidines, preferentially at 5′-TpA sites. Upon photoactivation, 8-MOP primarily photoalkylates DNA by cycloaddition to the 5,6-double bond of a thymidine generating monoadducts (MA) with either the 4′,5′-double bond of the furan (MAf) or the 3,4-double bond of the pyrone (MAp) side of the psoralen (4Cole R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 254: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). A unique property of psoralen photochemistry is that the absorption of a second photon by the MAf leads to formation of a pyrone side 5,6-double bond adduct with a flanking thymine in the complementary strand, thus generating an ICL (5Johnston B.H. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An angular fusion of the two-ring systems forms isopsoralens such as angelicin (Ang), 3-carbethoxypsoralen (3CP), and 7-methylpyrido(3,4-c)psoralen (MePy). In contrast to psoralens, isopsoralens, due to their geometry, cannot generate cross-links and form only monoadducts with DNA and RNA. The structures of several psoralen and isopsoralen derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. The detailed structures of psoralen-DNA adducts including sites of covalent attachment of psoralen in DNA helix and chemical structure of psoralen-DNA adducts were well established (3Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Crystal and NMR structures of psoralen-induced ICL revealed that psoralen can induce both minor and dramatic distortions into the DNA helix, depending on the sequence (6Eichman B.F. Mooers B.H. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Ho P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Hwang G.S. Kim J.K. Choi B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1995; 92: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This knowledge enabled geneticists to use photoactivated psoralen as a model agent to study ICL repair and mutagenesis. Importantly, up to 40% of induced DNA lesions by UVA+8-MOP exposure are ICLs, the remaining being two types of MAs (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This is in striking contrast with other cross-linking agents such as mitomycin, cis-platin, and nitrogen mustard, which induce a plethora of different kinds of damage and only 1–8% of ICLs (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the repair of plasmids containing a single ICL in cell-free extract from Xenopus egg showed that ICL repair is coupled to DNA replication and involves convergence of two replication forks on the lesion (9Raschle M. Knipsheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E. Scharer O.D. Walter J.C. Cell. 2008; 134: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, genetic evidence indicates that the repair of ICLs is also linked to DNA replication and proceeds via induction of a double strand break during DNA replication, probably due to replication fork collapse as a result of Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease cleavage of a template strand on the 3′-side of the lesion (10Hanada K.

On the same strand, the XPF/ERCC1 nuclease might generate ICL-specific incision on the 5′-side of the damaged site to unhook a cross-linked DNA fragment from the template strand (12Kuraoka I.

Bessho T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1275-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting unhooked ICL swings free of the duplex, exposing a single-stranded gap. Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) across the gap can be catalyzed by DNA polymerase κ (14Minko I.G. Harbut M.B. Kozekov I.D. Kozekova A. Jakobs P.M. Olson S.B. Moses R.E. Harris T.M. Rizzo C.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 13869-13872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), yielding a three-stranded DNA repair intermediate composed of a short oligomer covalently adducted to the duplex. This remaining cross-linked DNA fragment has to be removed from the template strand to unblock DNA replication. It has been proposed that in human cells, as in Escherichia coli and yeast, the unhooked ICLs are excised from the three-stranded DNA by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery (17Cipak L. Watanabe N. Bessho T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of XPF/ERCC1-deficient cells, cells lacking critical NER components only show a moderate sensitivity to the cross-linking agents, which induce both MAs and ICLs (18Hoy C.A. Thompson L.H. Mooney C.L. Salazar E.P. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1737-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 19De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in human cells, either the NER pathway is only marginally responsible for the resolution of three-stranded DNA repair intermediates or an alternative pathway might exist. In the base excision repair (BER) pathway, a DNA glycosylase binds to the abnormal base by flipping it out of the helix and catalyzes cleavage of the base-sugar bond, generating either an abasic site or a single strand break with 3′-blocking moiety (20Hitomi K. Iwai S. Tainer J.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 410-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Human homologues of the E. coli oxidized base-specific bifunctional DNA glycosylase/endonuclease VIII (Nei) were identified by a data base search of the genome and named NEIL1, -2, and -3 (human Nei-like proteins 1, 2, and 3) (21Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 22Bandaru V. Sunkara S. Wallace S.S. Bond J.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the oxidative DNA glycosylases, E. coli Fpg and Nei and human NEIL1, excise with a high efficiency psoralen-induced MAs in duplex DNA. Consistent with this result, HeLa cells lacking APE1 and/or NEIL1 became hypersensitive to 8-MOP+UVA exposure (23Couve-Privat S. Mace G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that BER may provide an alternative pathway to classic NER to eliminate bulky DNA adducts. The next step of our investigation was to examine how a genuine ICL in an oligonucleotide covalently linked to another oligonucleotide is repaired. For this purpose, we constructed a three-stranded DNA structure with unhooked ICL, a physiologically relevant structure derived from the endonuclease incisions of the template strand containing ICL, and examined its repair by the BER proteins. The present study provides new biochemical and genetic insights into the molecular mechanism of ICL repair. Reagents, Oligonucleotides, Plasmids, and Proteins—Chemical reagents including 8-MOP, 4′-hydroxy-methyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT), Ang, 3CP, and MePy were generously provided by Dr. Dietrich Averbeck (Institut Curie, Orsay, France). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), including regular oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, and those containing thymine glycol residue. 21-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides C21, d(GCTCTCGTCTGXACACCGAAG), where X is either T or thymine glycol, and complementary D21, d(CTTCGGTGTACAGACGAGAGC), were hybridized to obtain duplexes referred to as D21·C21. These sequence contexts were previously used to study the repair of psoralen-induced ICLs in human cells (24Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 21-mer chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides R1 5′(gcucucgucugTacaccgaag)-3′, R2 5′(gcucucgucugTAcaccgaag)-3′, R3 5′(gcucucgucuGTAcaccgaag)-3′,R45′(gcucucgucTGTAcaccgaag)-3′, R4′ 5′(gcucucgucuGTACaccgaag)-3′,R2′ 5′(gcucucgucuGTacaccgaag)-3′, and D9 d(TCTGTACAC) consisting of ribonucleotides (lowercase italic font letters) and one or more deoxyribonucleotides (capital letters) were hybridized with the complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide D21. To avoid potential sequence context effect for ICL repair, we switched the bottom and upper DNA strands in a cross-linked duplex. For this purpose, a 21-mer chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotide R1′ 5′-(cuucggugTacagacgagagc)-3′ and D9′ d(GGTGTACAG) were hybridized with the complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide C21. The resulting oligonucleotide duplexes were used to generate MAs and ICLs as described (23Couve-Privat S. Mace G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that all psoralen-induced MAs used in this work were pyrone-sided (MAp) and obtained by incubation of purified cross-linked duplex in alkali as described (25Kumaresan K.R. Ramaswamy M. Yeung A.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6774-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified BER proteins including APE1 and NEIL1 were from laboratory stock. The activities of various DNA repair proteins were tested using their principal substrates and were checked just prior to use (data not shown). The bacterial expression vector phNEIL1 was generously provided by Dr. Hiroshi Ide (Hiroshima University, Japan), DNA polymerase β was generously provided by Dr. Grigory Dianov (Medical Research Council Harwell, Oxfordshire, UK), and the E. coli Nei protein was generously provided by Dr. Dmitry Zharkov (Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Novosibirsk, Russia). Preparation of Three-stranded DNA Substrate—Oligonucleotides containing psoralen mono- and diadducts were prepared as described previously (23Couve-Privat S. Mace G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Shortly, oligonucleotide duplex was incubated for 15 min in the dark with 0.1 mm 8-MOP or other furanocoumarins in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl and then irradiated with 365 nm light at a dose of 240 kJ/m2 at room temperature. To prepare unhooked ICL substrate, the gel-purified cross-linked duplexes were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml RNase A in 20 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml protease K for 10 min at 50 °C and purified by denaturing PAGE. Oligonucleotides containing unhooked ICL referred to as XL21-n (n, number of remaining deoxyribonucleotides) were annealed with an excess of D21 or C21 oligonucleotide to obtain three-stranded DNA structures referred as XL21-n·C21 and XL21-n·D21, respectively, composed of the n-mer oligomer cross-linked to the 21-mer DNA duplex (see Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). DNA Repair Assay—The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) for ICL-specific DNA glycosylase activity contained 5 nm of 5′-32P-labeled XL21-1·C21, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 6% glycerol, and 20 nm NEIL1 for 10 min at 37 °C, unless otherwise stated. The incision assays with various BER proteins of different origins and the analysis of the reaction products were performed as described previously (23Couve-Privat S. Mace G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the reconstitution of the repair pathway for unhooked ICLs in vitro, 400 fmol of cold oligonucleotide containing unhooked ICL, XL21-1·C21, was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with pure proteins, 5 nm APE1, 20 nm NEIL1, 10 nm polymerase β, and 2 units of T4 DNA ligase, in buffer (20 μl) containing 2 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis at a constant temperature of 42 °C on denaturing 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (29:1, 7 m urea, 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA) for 2.5 h at 600 V. Gels were exposed to a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphor screen and analyzed using the Image Gauge Version 3.12 software. Construction and Characterization of the Three-stranded DNA Structure Containing Unhooked Adducted Oligomer—Although the yield of psoralen MAs to pyrimidine bases is 3-fold higher than that of ICLs, the latter class of damage appears to have a more severe biological effect (3Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In vitro NEIL1 is not able to excise psoralen-induced ICLs within duplex DNA; however, the sensitivity of NEIL1-depleted human cells to UVA+8-MOP exposure suggests that NEIL1 may be directly involved in the removal of psoralen-induced ICLs (23Couve-Privat S. Mace G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Previously, the DNA repair intermediate containing unhooked psoralen-induced ICL was constructed and used as a substrate for E. coli UV-endonuclease (UvrABC) nuclease (26Sladek F.M. Munn M.M. Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6755-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cheng S. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we constructed and characterized three-stranded DNA structures containing a single ICL that mimics DNA repair intermediates resulting after XPF/ERCC1-mediated unhooking and TLS through ICL (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). The single-stranded 21-mer DNA oligonucleotide D21, containing a single 5′-TpA site at position 9, was annealed either to complementary 21-mer chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (R1–R4) or to a 9-mer DNA oligonucleotide, D9 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). R1–R4 fragments were used to obtain short unhooked ICL oligomers, whereas D9 was used to obtain a longer one. After annealing, the oligonucleotide duplexes were exposed to 8-MOP+UVA, and the resulting cross-linked DNA were purified by denaturing PAGE. Photoreaction of asymmetric psoralens with helix DNA yields two orientational isomers of the ICL that can be separated by denaturing PAGE (28Van Houten B. Gamper H. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14135-14141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the cross-linked duplexes migrated as two bands in the gel, suggesting the presence of two orientational isomers of psoralen-induced ICL exhibiting different helix instabilities (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 4, and 5) (25Kumaresan K.R. Ramaswamy M. Yeung A.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6774-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cross-linked RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes were treated by RNase A to remove ribonucleotides from the R strand generating a very short 1–4-mer DNA oligomer covalently bound to D21, XL21-n (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). Extensive RNase A degradation of the 21-mer cross-linked duplexes (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5) yields “fast migrating” XL21-2 and XL21-4 products (lanes 6 and 7), which still migrate slower than the 21-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide, indicating that they contain adducted DNA oligomers resistant to ribonuclease hydrolysis. Following this, the XL21-1, -2, -3, -4, and XL21-9 oligonucleotides containing an unhooked ICL were hybridized to C21, a complementary 21-mer DNA oligonucleotide, to obtain the three-stranded DNA substrate, XL21-n·C21 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). DNA Glycosylase-catalyzed Excision of Unhooked ICLs within Three-stranded DNA Structure—When using the 5′-32P-labeled XL21-1·C21 as a DNA substrate for E. coli Fpg, Nei, and human NEIL1 DNA glycosylases, we observed an 8-mer cleavage product suggesting excision of a cross-linked thymine at position 9 of D21 (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–8). Consequently, excision of adducted thymine residue within the ICL structure should also remove away the covalently bound short oligomer from XL21-1·C21. None of the DNA glycosylases tested were able to cleave XL21-1 when it was not annealed to C21 (lanes 2–4). It should be stressed that the appearance of the 5′-32P-labeled 8-mer product upon incubation with the DNA glycosylases was accompanied by the loss of XL21-1 (lanes 6–8), suggesting that Fpg, Nei, and NEIL1 specifically recognize an unhooked ICL within the three-stranded DNA structure but not in duplex DNA. Similar results were obtained with the other three-stranded DNA substrates containing unhooked oligomers of varying length and different sequence context (data not shown). Interestingly, when acting upon the three-stranded DNA substrate, in addition to the major 8-mer product, Nei and NEIL1 generate a minor slow migrating fragment (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 8). It was shown that Nei and NEIL1 can mediate β-elimination in addition to β,σ-lyase activity when acting on 5,6-dihydropyrimidines containing oligonucleotides. Subsequently, these bifunctional DNA glycosylases generate two cleavage products, one containing a 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and another containing 3′-phosphate, respectively (22Bandaru V. Sunkara S. Wallace S.S. Bond J.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we suggest that the minor slow migrating band in lanes 6 and 8 is a product of β-elimination reaction catalyzed by Nei-like DNA glycosylases. Next we investigated whether the unhooked ICLs were also substrates for previously characterized BER enzymes. We challenged the 5′-32P-labeled XL21-3·C21 containing an unhooked 3-mer DNA oligomer with the purified DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases of E. coli, yeast, and human origins listed below. Because not all DNA glycosylases are endowed with AP-nicking activity, the assays were made in the presence of an AP endonuclease to cleave DNA duplex at the potential abasic sites generated after base excision. Among various DNA repair enzymes tested, only incubation with Nei and NEIL1, and with less efficiency, Fpg generated an 8-mer fragment (Fig. 4A, lanes 4, 6, and 13). Interestingly, excision of the unhooked DNA fragment by the Nei-like enzymes was more proficient than by Fpg (lanes 4 and 6 versus lane 13). Despite being used in an excess amount, Nfo, AlkA, Nth, MUG, MutY, UDG, Apn1, APE1, OGG1, NEIL2, TDG, SMUG1, hUNG, ANPG, and NTH1 proteins did not excise the unhooked ICL in XL21-3·C21 (Fig. 4A and data not shown). For quantitative comparison of the substrate specificity of NEIL1 toward an unhooked ICL, the amounts of incised oligonucleotides containing thymine glycol (canonical DNA substrate), MAp, and ICL were measured. Protein concentration-dependent cleavage reveals that all three DNA substrates were excised with high efficiency, showing that the unhooked ICL is one of the preferred substrates for NEIL1 (supplemental Fig. S3). The unhooked ICL fragment can be adducted to thymine in the duplex either via the furan side or via the pyrone side of a psoralen cross-link, resulting in two orientational isomers. Previously, it was shown that E. coli UvrABC nuclease selectively incises the pyrone side strand of the psoralen ICL within a three-stranded structure (29Cheng S. Van Houten B. Gamper H.B. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15110-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The question arises whether Nei-like DNA glycosylases excise both orientational isomers in a three-stranded DNA substrate. When analyzing DNA glycosylase activities on the 5′-32P-labeled XL21-1·C21 and XL21-3·C21, we found that Nei and NEIL1 cleaves more than 90% of the substrate (Figs. 3B, lanes 6 and 8, and 4A, lanes 6 and 13). Assuming an equal probability for the formation of each isomer, these results suggest that the DNA glycosylases are able to excise both orientational isomers. However, we cannot exclude that Nei and NEIL1 might display some preference for one of the isomers. Activities of Nei-like DNA Glycosylases toward Bulky DNA Adducts Induced by Various Psoralen and Isopsoralen Derivatives—An important issue is whether any bulky DNA adduct is a good substrate for the bifunctional DNA glycosylases when present in a three-stranded DNA construct or whether Nei and NEIL1 are highly specific to 8-MOP-induced mono- and di-DNA adducts and not to ICL as a general structure. To address this question, the specific activities of the DNA glycosylases were tested on DNA adducts induced by various furanocoumarins, distinct from 8-MOP: HMT and isopsoralens Ang, 3CP, and MePy. HMT is a structural analogue of 8-MOP containing in addition three methyl groups and one hydroxymethyl group. In contrast to 8-MOP, HMT has higher dark binding activity to DNA and forms less than 2% pyrone side monoadduct (30Kanne D. Rapoport H. Hearst J.E. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequently, HMT induces higher yield of ICLs in duplex DNA as compared with 8-MOP. Using the approach described above, we constructed a duplex C21·D21 containing a single ICL and three-stranded DNA structures XL21-1·D21 containing an unhooked ICL induced by HMT+UVA exposure. To obtain the HMT-derived MAp, cross-linked C21·D21 was incubated under hot alkali conditions. The primary structure of XL21-1·D21 with 5′-32P-labeled C21 strand containing cross-linked thymine at position 12 is shown in Fig. 2B. Nei and NEIL1 incise XL21-1· D21 and MAp-containing C21·D21 to generate an 11-mer cleavage products, indicating the excision of both HMT-thymine monoadduct (Fig. 4B, lanes 11–12) and unhooked HMT-ICL (lanes 3 and 4) at position 12 of C21 strand. Although we did not previously observe any activity on the duplex oligonucleotide containing 8-MOP-induced ICL (23Couve-Privat S. Mace G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), NEIL1 but not Nei incises with a very low efficiency HMT cross-linked duplex oligonucleotide C21·D21 and generates an ∼9-mer cleavage fragment, indicating the excision of a thymine at position 10 of the 21-mer C21 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lane 8). Therefore, we may propose that in addition to thymine 12, a second minor photoreactive site is present in C21 oligonucleotide thymine 10. Becaus"
https://openalex.org/W2101147288,"Arginine methylation is a widespread post-translational modification of proteins catalyzed by a family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). The ancient protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, possesses five putative PRMTs, a relatively large number for a single-celled eukaryote. Trypanosomatids lack gene regulation at the level of transcription, instead relying on post-transcriptional control mechanisms that act at the levels of RNA turnover, translation, and editing, all processes that likely involve multiple RNA-binding proteins, which are common targets of arginine methylation. Here, we report the characterization of a trypanosome PRMT, TbPRMT7, which is homologous to human PRMT7. Interestingly, trypanosomatids are the only single-celled eukaryotes known to harbor a PRMT7 homologue. TbPRMT7 differs dramatically from all known metazoan PRMT7 homologues in lacking the second AdoMet binding-like domain that is required for activity of the human enzyme. Nevertheless, bacterially expressed TbPRMT7 exhibits robust methyltransferase activity toward multiple targets in vitro. High resolution ion exchange chromatography analysis of methylated substrates reveals that TbPRMT7 is a type III PRMT, catalyzing the formation of only monomethylarginine, thereby representing the only exclusively type III PRMT identified to date. TbPRMT7 is expressed in both mammalian and insect stage T. brucei and is apparently dispensable for growth in both life cycle stages. The enzyme is cytoplasmically localized and is a component of several higher order complexes in vivo. Together, our studies indicate that TbPRMT7 is a Type III PRMT, and its robust activity and presence in numerous complexes suggest it plays multiple roles during the complex T. brucei life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1970693350,"The anti-inflammatory effect of mammalian heparin analogues, named dermatan sulfate and heparin, isolated from the ascidian Styela plicata was accessed in a TNBS-induced colitis model in rats. Subcutaneous administration of the invertebrate compounds during a 7-day period drastically reduced inflammation as observed by the normalization of the macroscopic and histological characteristics of the colon. At the molecular level, a decrease in the production of TNF-α, TGF-β, and VEGF was observed, as well as a reduction of NF-κB and MAPK kinase activation. At the cellular level, the heparin analogues attenuated lymphocyte and macrophage recruitment and epithelial cell apoptosis. A drastic reduction in collagen-mediated fibrosis was also observed. No hemorrhagic events were observed after glycan treatment. These results strongly indicate the potential therapeutic use of these compounds for the treatment of colonic inflammation with a lower risk of hemorrhage when compared with mammalian heparin.

The etiology of IBD is complex and multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, as well as microbial and immune factors (1.Xavier R.J. Podolsky D.K. Nature. 2007; 448: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). In CD, the chronic inflammatory process is a consequence of an imbalance in the production of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines, which results in a T helper cell type 1 (Th1) phenotype (2.Papadakis K. Targan S. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2000; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3.Reinecker H. Steffen M. Witthoeft T. Pflueger I. Schreiber S. MacDermott R. Raedler A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Th1-type response is characterized by the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-γ, among other proinflammatory cytokines, and also involves the production of growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (4.Fiocchi C.

In this context, the nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) was identified as a key regulator of the expression of proinflammatory genes, determining the course of mucosal inflammation in IBD (7.Atreya I. Atreya R. Neurath M.F. J. Intern. Med. 2008; 263: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in IBD intestinal mucosa is accompanied by the over expression of adhesion molecules, including the selectins (8.Schurmann G.M. Bishop A.E. Facer P. Vecchio M. Lee J.C. Rampton D.S. Polak J.M. Gut. 1995; 36: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9.Andoh A. Tsujikawa T. Hata K. Araki Y. Kitoh K. Sasaki M. Yoshida T.

Animal models of mucosal inflammation have been utilized to investigate the pathogenesis of IBD and to evaluate possible new therapies. The trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis constitutes an established experimental model, which exhibits clinical and histological similarities to CD, and the course of colonic damage has been well characterized as a Th1-type immune response, with the resulting production of proinflammatory cytokines (10.Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) largely utilized in the clinical practice for anticoagulation and prevention and treatment of vascular thromboembolism (11.Roden L. Ananth S. Campbell P.

Apart from its well-established anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects, heparin has anti-inflammatory properties such as inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and migration (13.Papa A. Danese S. Gasbarrini A. Gasbarrini G. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 1403-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and modulation of cytokine production (14.Elsayed E. Becker R.C. J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 2003; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on these activities, and the suggested efficacy observed in several open clinical studies (15.Gaffney P.R. Doyle C.T. Gaffney A. Hogan J. Hayes D.P. Annis P. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1995; 90: 220-223PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Folwaczny C. Wiebecke B. Loeschke K. Am. J.

However, heparin therapy may cause hemorrhage and other adverse side effects (18.Schulman S. Beyth R. Kearon C. Levine M. Chest. 2008; 133: 257S-298SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has isolated and characterized several heparin analogues from marine invertebrates (19.Santos J. Mesquita J. Belmiro C. da Silveira C. Viskov C. Mourier P. Pavao M. Thromb.

The study of the anticoagulant properties of the marine invertebrate glycans indicated that although they are capable of inhibiting venous and arterial thrombosis, they are less anticoagulant and have no bleeding effect after intravenous administration to experimental animals. Therefore, in the present work, we investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of heparin analogues obtained from the ascidian Styela plicata in a rat model of colon inflammation. Animals—Male Wistar rats (each weighing between 250 and 300 g) obtained from a local supplier were maintained on a 12-h/12-h light and dark cycle in a temperature-controlled room (24 °C). Animals were housed in rack-mounted, wire cages with 3 animals per cage. Standard laboratory pelleted formula and tap water were provided ad libitum. The care and use of animals, as well as procedures reported in this study were approved by the institutional care committee of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and are in accordance with the guidelines of the International Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health, and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (25.Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Live Sciences, National Research Council (1996), National Academic Press, Washington, D.C.Google Scholar). Induction of Colitis—On day (d) 0, rats were anesthetized subcutaneously with ketamine (35 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg), and colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of 0.8 ml of a solution containing 20 mg of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (Sigma) in 20% ethanol (Merck, Damstadt, Germany) using a rubber cannula (8-cm long) inserted through the rectum. Thereafter, animals were allowed access to standard chow and water ad libitum. Clinical manifestations such as diarrhea, bleeding, and weight loss were observed during this period. Experimental Design—After an initial acclimation period of 1 week, animals were assigned randomly to one of five groups of 10 animals each, and followed during 1 week. The colitis group (TNBS) was submitted to colitis induction but did not receive any treatment, and animals were sacrificed on experimental day 7. There were 4 GAG-treated groups: mam Hep, mammalian heparin (Hep); mam DS, mammalian dermatan sulfate (DS); S. plicata Hep and S. plicata DS. These groups were submitted to colitis induction followed by treatment with the indicated GAG (4 or 8 mg/kg per day) by a subcutaneous route over 7 days. In control experiments, the ascidian GAGs were either treated with chondroitin ABC-lyase or nitrous acid. Normal rats not submitted to any intervention constituted the control group, which was sacrificed after the acclimation period. For the surgical procedure, animals were anesthetized as described in the previous paragraph and submitted to a mild laparotomy under sterile technique. The distal colon was removed, opened longitudinally, rinsed with sterile saline, and scored. After scoring, three tissue samples were excised from the colon for histological assessment. A quick death procedure by cervical dislocation was uniformly performed in all animals. Histological Inflammatory Scores of the Colon—Specimens were fixed in 40 g/liter formaldehyde saline, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm sections, stained with hematoxylin-eosin stain, and examined microscopically by two independent observers. The following histological parameters were studied: ulceration, hyperplasia, and inflammatory infiltrate. For both inflammatory infiltrate and hyperplasia, grading was considered: 3, severe; 2, moderate; 1, mild; 0, absent. For ulcers, grading was: 4, diffuse glandular disruption or extensive deep ulceration; 3, glandular disruption or focal deep ulceration; 2, diffuse superficial ulceration; 1, focal superficial ulceration; and 0, absent (26.Hahm K. Im Y. Parks T. Park S. Markowitz S. Jung H. Green J. Kim S. Gut. 2001; 49: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Analysis of the Colon—Tissue samples were immediately embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Miles Scientific Laboratories Ltd, Naperville, IL) and snap-frozen in isopentane in a liquid nitrogen bath. Samples were then stored at -80 °C until processing, and cut into 6-μm section in a cryostat maintained at -20 °C. Tissue sections were air-dried and fixed for 10 min in a 1:1 solution of chloroformacetone. Immunologic assessment of the intestinal mucosa was made using indirect immunoperoxidase technique using the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-rat ED1 (Serotec Ltd., Oxford, UK) to macrophages; mouse monoclonal anti-rat CD3 (PC3/188) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to lymphocytes; mouse monoclonal anti-rat p65 (F-6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to NF-κB. Briefly, frozen sections were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 10 min, tissue sections were incubated with nonimmune horse serum for 30 min and, subsequently, with the respective monoclonal antibody in a humidified chamber overnight, at room temperature. Two sections from each sample were incubated with either PBS alone or mouse monoclonal IgG1 (concentration-matched) (Dako A/S) and served as negative controls. After rinsing in PBS for 10 min, all tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with a goat anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc., San Francisco, CA). Additional rinsing was followed by development with a solution containing hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine, dehydrated, and mounted in histological mounting medium. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—For the indirect immunofluorescence study, frozen sections were incubated at room temperature with 2.5% bovine serum albumin + 2.0% nonfat milk + 8.0% fetal calf serum blocking buffer under shaking for 30 min. The sections were then incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies in PBS solution + 1.0% fetal calf serum for 1 h in wet atmosphere at 37 °C. The primary antibody used was the monoclonal mouse anti-rat P-ERK1/2 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After rinsing three times in PBS for 5 min each, tissue sections were incubated for 1 h with a FITC-conjugated Fab fraction of goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako A/S). Slides were counterstained with Evan blue-diluted 0.01% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, mounted in an anti-fading medium containing buffered glycerol and p-phenylenediamine (Sigma), and then observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. At least four representative images from each slide were captured. Two sections from each sample were incubated with either PBS alone or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and served as negative controls. Assessment of Collagen Deposition in the Colon—Specimens were fixed in 40 g/liter formaldehyde saline, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. The phosphomolibidic acid-picro-sirius red dye was used to stain collagen fibers in tissue (27.Dolber P. Spach M. Stain Technol. 1987; 62: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28.Dolber P. Spach M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At least 15 different areas per tissue section were analyzed under light microscopy. Detection of Apoptosis using TUNEL Assay—Paraffin-embedded colon samples were de-waxed in xylene twice for 5 min each time and then rehydrated in graded ethanol (100-70%) three times, followed by rehydration in PBS for 30 min. Apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUDP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, using the in situ apoptosis detection kit ApopTag Fluorescein (Chemicon International, Inc. Temecula, CA), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Sections were analyzed in a confocal microscope. Quantitative Assessment of Colon Sections—Quantitative analysis of tissue sections (under light microscopy) and captured immunofluorescence images (under confocal laser-scanning microscope) was carried out using a computer-assisted image analyser (Image-Pro Plus Version 4.1 for Windows, Media Cybernetics, LP, Silver Spring, MD). Any epithelial and lamina propria cells exhibiting identifiable reactivity distinct from background were regarded as positive. In the immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence studies, the densities of the different cell subsets were defined by the number of immunoreactive cells in the lamina propria per millimeter-squared (counted in at least 10 different areas). In the epithelium, the density of apoptotic cells was defined as the percentage of immunoreactive cells within at least 500 epithelial cells in the crypts and in the surface epithelium of longitudinally sectioned colonic pits. The density of collagen fibers was defined by the area positively stained for collagen in relation to total intestinal tissue per millimeter-squared using an imaging analysis system. Two independent observers who were unaware of the experimental animal data examined all tissue sections and captured images. Organ Culture and Cytokine Measurements—Colonic mucosal explants were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES (Promega), penicillin (100 killiunits/liter) and streptomycin (100 mg/liter) (Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. After incubation for 24 h, the supernatant was collected and stocked at -20 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants used for measurement of the concentration of cytokines TNF-α, TGF-β, and VEGF by a commercial sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (R&D System, MN). The total protein content of the biopsy specimens was estimated by the Lowry method. In our data, biopsy specimen wet weight was shown to correlate closely with protein content of tissue homogenates. The minimum detectable concentration of rat TNF-α, TGF-β, and VEGF was typically less than 5.0 ng/liter. Isolation and Quantification of GAGs—The dried intestinal samples (∼0.5 g) were individually suspended in 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing 50 mg of papain, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm cysteine, and incubated at 60 °C for 24 h. The mixtures were centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature). Another 50 mg of papain in 10 ml of the same buffer, containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm cysteine was added to the precipitate. The mixture was then incubated for another 24 h. The clear supernatants from the two extractions were combined, and the GAGs precipitated with a solution of cetylpyridinum chloride (0.5% final concentration), followed by 2 vol. of 95% ethanol and maintained at 4 °C for 24 h. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature), freeze-dried, and dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water. The amount of GAGs in the renal samples was estimated by the content of hexuronic acid, using the carbazole reaction (29.Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—The intact or enzyme-degraded GAGs from the different intestinal samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously (23.Pavao M. Aiello K. Werneck C. Silva L. Valente A. Mulloy B. Colwell N. Tollefsen D. Mourao P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27848-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 1.5 μg (as uronic acid) of the glycans, and a mixture of standard GAGs, containing chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate (1.5 μg as uronic acid of each) were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel in 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0), and run for 1 h at 110 mV. After electrophoresis, the GAGs were fixed with aqueous 0.1% cetylmethylammonium bromide solution and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v/v). The relative proportions of the GAGs were estimated by densitometry of the metachromatic bands on a Bio-Rad densitometer, following agarose gel electrophoresis. The identity of GAGs was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis before and after incubation with specific GAG-lyases (Chondroitin AC-lyase, Chondroitin ABC-lyase) or deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid as described previously (23.Pavao M. Aiello K. Werneck C. Silva L. Valente A. Mulloy B. Colwell N. Tollefsen D. Mourao P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27848-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Macrophage Activation Assay—Rat peritoneal macrophages were obtained by washing out the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml of ice-cold sterile RPMI 1640 serum-free medium and cultured at 37 °C for 4 h in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with serum-free medium. Adherent cells were incubated in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 106 cells per well with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) for 24 h in the presence of a range of heparin concentrations (5.0, 10, 20, and 40 μg/ml) plus LPS (1 μg/ml) (Sigma), added either concomitantly or 2 h after heparin under 5% CO2 atmosphere. In some experiments LPS was omitted to check the effect of heparin on macrophages. Determination of TNF-α Production—The cell culture supernatant was collected from the cultures of macrophages cells stimulated with heparin or LPS or heparin plus LPS. The concentration of TNF-α was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Ex Vivo Anticoagulant Action Measured by aPTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time)—At experimental day 7, animals from the different groups were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 100 mg/kg of ketamine (Cristália, São Paulo, Brazil) and 16 mg/kg of xylazine (Bayer AS, São Paulo, Brazil), supplemented as needed. The right carotid artery was isolated and cannulated with a 22-gauge catheter (Jelco, Johnson & Johnson Medical Inc.) for blood collection. Blood samples (∼500 μl) were collected into 2.8% sodium citrate (9:1, v/v) for analysis of aPTT. At least 5 animals were used per group. aPTT was carried out as following: rat plasma (100 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of aPTT reagent (Celite-Biolab) at 37 °C. After 2 min of incubation 100 μl of 0.25 m CaCl2 were added to the mixtures and the clotting time recorded in a coagulometer (Amelung KC4A). Platelet Counts—Blood samples were carefully drawn on heparin from the portal vein during surgery just prior to colon removal. The platelet count in the whole blood was measured on an automatic hematology analyzer. Results are expressed as number of cells per cubic millimeter. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software SPSS for Windows (Version 10.1, SPSS Inc., 1989–1999). Statistical differences among the experimental groups were evaluated with the one-way ANOVA test in which pairwise multiple comparisons were carried out using the Dunnett T3 test. Correlations between inflammatory scores, the densities of positive cells measured by immunohistochemistry, and the cytokine levels were assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Histomorphological Changes in the Colonic Tissue—We found that animals subjected to TNBS treatment developed colitis accompanied by a significant weight loss. Evident morphological changes were observed predominantly in the distal colon of the animals. Inflammatory lesions in the colon included mucosal edema, ulceration, and evidence of transmural inflammation. Therapeutic approach consisted of subcutaneous administration of ascidian or mammalian heparin and dermatan sulfate (DS), initiated concomitantly with TNBS treatment and continued for 7 days. A drastic attenuation of the inflammatory lesions was observed macroscopically in the animals after subcutaneous administration of mammalian or ascidian GAGs at the dose of 8 mg/kg. No significant changes were observed at the dose of 4 mg/kg (not shown). Histological analysis of formalin-fixed HE-stained intestinal sections revealed an increase in the microscopic damage score in all TNBS-treated animals, when compared with the normal mucosa of control animals (Fig. 1, A and B). Administration of mammalian or ascidian GAGs (8 mg/kg) significantly reduced the inflammatory scores in the TNBS-treated group. However, the scores obtained by ascidian heparin were significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that obtained by the mammalian counterpart. Administration of nitrous acid-treated S. plicata heparin or chondroitin ABC-lyase-treated S. plicata DS to the TNBS group abolished the beneficial effect of the GAGs (Fig. 1C). Cellular Infiltration in the Colonic Tissue—TNBS colitis is characterized by a Th1-mediated immune response with intense infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages (10.Strober W. Fuss I.J. Blumberg R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 495-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the infiltrating cell profile in inflamed colonic tissue. The number of macrophages and T-cells significantly increased in the colonic lamina propria of all TNBS-treated animals, when compared with that of the control group (Fig. 2). Subcutaneous administration of mammalian or ascidian GAGs reduced the number of both macrophages (Fig. 2) and T-cells (Fig. 3) in TNBS-treated animals. Heparin administration, regardless of its source, was more effective in reducing infiltrating cells, when compared with DS (Figs. 2 and 3). However, ascidian heparin was more efficient in reducing macrophages than the mammalian counterpart (Fig. 2). Mammalian or ascidian DS reduced macrophages and CD4+ T-cells at the same extent (Figs. 2 and 3).FIGURE 3Effect of heparin analogues on lymphocyte infiltration into the inflamed colon. Colonic samples from Wistar rats after TNBS-induced colitis without or with heparin or ascidian heparin analogues administration were immediately embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound, snap-frozen in isopentane in a liquid nitrogen bath, and submitted to immunohistochemical analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-rat CD3. Heparin and heparin analogues were administered to the animals as described in the legend of Fig. 1. The number of immunoreactive cells per millimeter-squared was counted in at least 10 different areas. Quantitative analysis of tissue sections were carried out under light microscopy at ×400 magnification. Values are mean ± S.E. of 10 animals/group.

Therefore, we investigated whether the administration of mammalian or ascidian GAG could reduce TNF-α production and NF-κB activation in the inflamed colon. TNBS treatment induced a ∼4-fold increase in the levels of TNF-α in the colonic tissue (Fig. 4A). The increase of the cytokine was accompanied by a clear increase in NF-κB activation (Fig. 5). Subcutaneous administration of GAGs, regardless of its source, drastically reduced TNF-α production to values observed in the basal level (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A), and no significant difference was observed on the effect of DS or heparin. Similarly, NF-κB activation drastically reduced in inflamed colon after GAG administration (Fig. 5). No significant difference was observed in the effect of mammalian or ascidian DS and heparin. However, ascidian heparin induced the highest reduction in NF-κB activation.FIGURE 5Effect of heparin analogues on NF-κB activation in the inflamed colon.

https://openalex.org/W2032222595,"Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) are dual specificity enzymes with an ability to catalyze hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions. Recently, these enzymes have become the focus of intense research because of their potential for synthesis of glycopeptides. We have determined the 3D structures of an ENGase from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) in 3 forms, one in native form, one in complex with Man(3)GlcNAc-thiazoline and another in complex with GlcNAc-Asn. The carbohydrate moiety sits above the TIM-barrel in a cleft region surrounded by aromatic residues. The conserved essential catalytic residues - E173, N171 and Y205 are within hydrogen bonding distance of the substrate. W216 and W244 regulate access to the active site during transglycosylation by serving as ""gate-keepers"".

https://openalex.org/W2072507746,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease are serious autoimmune sequelae to infections with Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcal M-proteins have been implicated in ARF pathogenesis. Their interaction with collagen type IV (CIV) is a triggering step that induces generation of collagen-specific auto-antibodies. Electron microscopy of the protein complex between M-protein type 3 (M3-protein) and CIV identified two prominent binding sites of which one is situated in the CB3-region of CIV. In a radioactive binding assay, M3-protein expressing S. pyogenes and S. gordonii bound the CB3-fragment. Detailed analysis of the interactions by surface plasmon resonance measurements and site directed mutagenesis revealed high affinity interactions with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range that depend on the recently described collagen binding motif of streptococcal M-proteins. Because of its role in the induction of disease-related collagen autoimmunity the motif is referred to as “peptide associated with rheumatic fever” (PARF). Both, sera of mice immunized with M3-protein as well as sera from patients with ARF contained anti-CB3 auto-antibodies, indicating their contribution to ARF pathogenesis. The identification of the CB3-region as a binding partner for PARF directs the further approaches to understand the unusual autoimmune pathogenesis of PARF-dependent ARF and forms a molecular basis for a diagnostic test that detects rheumatogenic streptococci."

https://openalex.org/W2072470057,"ABCA1 plays a major role in cholesterol homeostasis and high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. ABCA1 contains disulfide bond(s) between its N- and C-terminal halves, but it remains unclear whether disulfide bond formation is important for the functions of ABCA1 and which cysteines are involved in disulfide bond formation. To answer these questions, we constructed >30 ABCA1 mutants in which 16 extracellular domain (ECD) cysteines were replaced with serines and examined disulfide bond formation, apoA-I binding, and HDL formation in these mutants. From the single cysteine replacements, two cysteines (Cys75 and Cys309) in ECD1 were found to be essential for apoA-I binding. In contrast, in ECD2, only Cys1477 was found to be essential for HDL formation, and no single cysteine replacement impaired apoA-I binding. The concurrent replacement of two cysteines, Cys1463 and Cys1465, impaired apoA-I binding and HDL formation, suggesting that four of five extracellular cysteines (Cys75, Cys309, Cys1463, Cys1465, and Cys1477) are involved in these functions of ABCA1. Trypsin digestion experiments suggested that one disulfide bond is not sufficient and that two intramolecular disulfide bonds (between Cys75 and Cys309 in ECD1 and either Cys1463 or Cys1465 and Cys1477 in ECD2) are required for ABCA1 to be fully functional.

ABCA1 is a member of the ABCA subclass of ABC transporters, which contain the basic architecture of the “full-length” ABC transporters organized into two tandemly arranged halves. Each half contains several transmembrane α-helices (TMs), which provide a translocation pathway, followed by a cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain, which hydrolyze ATP. In the case of “half-size” ABC transporters, such as ABCG1, ABCD1, TAP1/TAP2 (transporter associated with antigen processing), and the bacterial homolog Sav1866, they dimerize to form the full transporter. Crystallographic analysis of the bacterial homolog Sav1866 revealed that the TMs of one subunit are closely related to the TMs of the other subunit, forming two “wings” in an outward-facing conformation (8.Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). When ABCA1 is partially digested by trypsin, ABCA1 is cleaved at site A, just C-terminal to TM6, and at site B, just N-terminal to TM7, to produce four fragments of 170 and 150 kDa and subsequently of 125 and 110 kDa (Fig. 1A) (9.Takahashi K.

When these fragments are analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, they co-migrate with undigested ABCA1. These results suggest that the N- and C-terminal halves of ABCA1 are connected by disulfide bond(s), as reported for ABCA4 (ABCR) (10.Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

ECD1 and ECD2 of ABCA1 contain nine and five cysteine residues, respectively, and each connecting loop between TM5 and TM6 and between TM11 and TM12 contains a cysteine residue. These cysteine residues were assigned numbers, C1 to C16, based on their distance from the N terminus (Fig. 1A). These cysteine residues are well conserved among ABCA1, ABCA4, and ABCA7 (Fig. 1B). All of the cysteine residues in ECD1 are conserved between ABCA1 and ABCA4, and seven cysteine residues (except C4 and C5) are conserved in ABCA7. All five of the cysteine residues in ECD2 are conserved between ABCA1 and ABCA4, and three cysteine residues (except C11 and C12) are conserved in ABCA7. Because ABCA7, like ABCA1, mediates apoA-I-dependent lipid efflux (13.Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Okazaki M. Ueda K. Yokoyama S. J.

It remains unclear, however, whether disulfide bond formation is important for the proper folding and/or the functions of ABCA subclass proteins. In this study, we analyzed which cysteine residues are involved in disulfide bond formation and examined whether disulfide bond formation is necessary for the functions of ABCA1. Cysteine substitution experiments suggested that two disulfide bonds are formed between C2 and C6 in ECD1 and between either C13 or C14 and C15 in ECD2 and that this two-disulfide bond formation is necessary for apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. Materials—N-Ethylmaleimide was purchased from Nacalai Tesque; dithiothreitol (DTT) was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Collagen solution and trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, from bovine pancreas) were from Sigma. Antibodies—Rat anti-human ABCA1 monoclonal antibody KM3073 was generated against the first ECD (amino acids 45–639) of human ABCA1 as described previously (3.Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15091-15095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 100-mm culture dishes were transfected with 8 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells in 12-well culture plates were transfected with 3 μg of DNA using calcium phosphate buffer (2.5 m CaCl2, 1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 2× BES (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm BES, and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.95)). ApoA-I Binding Assay—HEK293 cells were subcultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips in 12-well dishes at a density of 2 × 104 cells in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 18 h of incubation, cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ABCA1 using calcium phosphate buffer. Cells were washed with DMEM 28 h after transfection and then incubated with DMEM containing 5 μg/ml Alexa 546-labeled apoA-I as described previously (22.Azuma Y. Takada M. Shin H.-W. Kioka N. Nakayama K. Ueda K. Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Constructions of Mutants—Site-directed mutations were introduced into ABCA1; in individual mutants, each cysteine residue was replaced with serine. Mutations were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides (supplemental Table I). The integrity of the mutated DNA was confirmed by sequencing the entire DNA. Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins—HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged ABCA1. 28 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 g/liter CaCl2 and MgCl2·6H2O (PBS+) and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin solubilized in PBS+ for 30 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed with PBS+ to remove unbound sulfo-NHS-biotin and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). ImmunoPure immobilized monomeric avidin gel (Pierce) was added to the cell lysate to precipitate the biotinylated proteins. The biotinylated proteins were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by immunoblotting (23.Hozoji M. Munehira Y. Ikeda Y. Makishima M. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30057-30063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Limited Trypsin Digestion of ABCA1—HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged ABCA1. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed with suspension buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Protein (20 μg) was digested by 5 μg/ml trypsin on ice for 15 or 40 min. The digested proteins were denatured with or without DTT, electrophoresed on a 5% PAGEL (ATTO), and detected by immunoblotting. Two fragments of ABCA1, 170 and 150 kDa, were recognized by anti-ABCA1 antibody KM3073. Cellular Lipid Release Assay—HEK293 cells subcultured on 100-mm dishes were transfected with GFP-tagged ABCA1 using Lipofectamine 2000. 12 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and subcultured in 6-well dishes at a density of 6 × 105 cells in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 12 h of incubation, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with DMEM containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin. Next, cells were incubated with DMEM containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg/ml apoA-I for 24 h at 37 °C. The lipid content of the medium was determined as described previously (23.Hozoji M.

Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS+ for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 5 Pascal). Effect of DTT Treatment of Cells on ApoA-I Binding—ABCA1 contains disulfide bond(s) between the N- and C-terminal halves, but it is unclear whether disulfide bond formation is important for the functions of ABCA1. To explore the roles of disulfide bonding in ABCA1, we first examined the effects of DTT treatment of cells on apoA-I binding. When Alexa 546-conjugated apoA-I was added to cells expressing ABCA1-GFP, apoA-I binding to the cell surface was clearly observed after 15 min (Fig. 2A). ApoA-I colocalized with ABCA1 and did not bind to untransfected HEK293 host cells (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that apoA-I binding is ABCA1-dependent. When 2 mm DTT was subsequently added to the medium and cells were incubated for 5 min in the presence of DTT, apoA-I bound to the cell surface dissociated, and no apoA-I binding was detected (Fig. 2B). Next, cells were washed with fresh medium, and Alexa 546-conjugated apoA-I was added again (Fig. 2C); apoA-I bound to cells just as it had before the DTT treatment, indicating that the inhibitory effect of DTT on apoA-I binding is reversible. When cells were treated with DTT and subsequently with 3 mm N-ethylmaleimide, which covalently modifies free thiol groups, apoA-I did not bind to cells even after washing with fresh medium (Fig. 2D), although subcellular localization of ABCA1 was not much affected. ApoA-I treated with DTT and N-ethylmaleimide bound to cells expressing ABCA1-GFP (data not shown). These results suggest that disulfide bonding is important for ABCA1-dependent apoA-I binding to cells. Construction and Expression of Cysteine Mutants—To investigate the role of ECD cysteine residues in the structure and functions of ABCA1, each of the 16 extracellular cysteine residues was replaced with serine using site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutant was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells as a GFP fusion protein; expression was validated by immunoblotting. Wild-type ABCA1 and all 16 single cysteine mutants yielded a product with an apparent mass of 280 kDa as the major product, although some mutants, such as C13S and C14S also yielded significant levels of a 250-kDa product, which we speculate contains an immature oligosaccharide. Although each mutant showed considerable variation in expression (Fig. 3), the variation was not due to the mutation but due to the transient expression because C4S and C5S showed higher expression than the wild type in separate experiments (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of wild-type and mutant ABCA1 did not differ between reducing and nonreducing conditions. Subcellular localization of most mutants was similar to that of wild-type ABCA1-GFP. Some mutants, however, such as C13S and C14S, showed significantly higher accumulation in intracellular compartments (supplemental Fig. 1). Effect of Mutations on ApoA-I Binding—ApoA-I binding to cells expressing the wild type or any one of the 16 single cysteine mutants was examined. ApoA-I bound to cells expressing wild-type ABCA1 but not to cells expressing ABCA1-MM (ABCA1(K939M/K1952M)), a mutant in which the Walker A lysines in both nucleotide-binding domains are replaced by methionines, although the expression level (data not shown) and surface expression (Fig. 4A) of the mutant were comparable with those of the wild-type protein, as reported (24.Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J. Devaux P. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). ApoA-I bound to cells expressing almost all of the cysteine mutants as efficiently as to cells expressing the wild type (Fig. 4A, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. 2). However, apoA-I did not bind to cells expressing mutant C2S or C6S. These results suggested that only two cysteine residues in ECD1 (C2 and C6) are essential for apoA-I binding.TABLE 1Cysteine mutants of ABCA1ProteinApoA-I bindingCholesterol effluxMutationsWild type++NoneC1S++C54SC2S––C75SC3S++C81SC4S++C195SC5S++C215SC6S––C309SC7S++C355SC8S++C504SC9S++C626SC10S++C791SC11S++C1418SC12S++C1429SC13S++C1463SC14S++C1465SC15S+–C1477SC16S++C1814SC2/6S––C75S/C309SC11/12S++C1418S/C1429SC13/14S––C1463S/C1465SC13/14/15S––C1463S/C1465S/C1477SC11/12/13/14S––C1418S/C1429S/C1463S/C1465SC11/12/13/15S––C1418S/C1429S/C1463S/C1477SC11/12/14/15S––C1418S/C1429S/C1465S/C1477SC11/13/14/15S––C1418S/C1463S/C1465S/C1477SC12/13/14/15S––C1429S/C1463S/C1465S/C1477SC11/12/13/14/15S––C1418S/C1429S/C1463S/C1465S/C1477SC2/6/13/14/15S––C75S/C309S/C1463S/C1465S/C1477SCys4#1++C54S/C81S/C195S/C215S/C355S/C504S/C626S/C791S/C1418S/C1429S/C1465S/1814SCys4#2++C54S/C81S/C195S/C215S/C355S/C504S/C626S/C791S/C1418S/C1429S/C1463S/1814SCys5++C54S/C81S/C195S/C215S/C355S/C504S/C626S/C791S/C1418S/C1429S/C1814S Open table in a new tab Although previous reports have suggested that ABCA1 contains disulfide bond(s) between the N- and C-terminal halves, no cysteine in ECD2 has been shown to be important for apoA-I binding. To analyze the roles of cysteine residues in ECD2, we replaced all of the five cysteines (C11–C15) in ECD2 with serines but found that mutant C11/12/13/14/15S was localized mainly in the intracellular compartment and was scarcely expressed on the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. 3). Next, we constructed the quad cysteine mutants C11/12/13/14S, C11/12/13/15S, C11/12/14/15S, C11/13/14/15S, and C12/13/14/15S. ApoA-I did not bind to cells expressing any of these mutants, although at least a fraction of the mutant proteins was observed on the cell surface (supplemental Fig. 3). These results suggested that more than one cysteine residue in ECD2 could be required for the function. Therefore, we next examined the effects of double and triple cysteine substitutions and found that apoA-I bound to cells expressing the double cysteine mutant C11/12S but not to cells expressing mutant C13/14S or C13/14/15S, even though the surface expression of these mutants was comparable with that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that C13 and C14 are important for apoA-I binding. To confirm that replacement of these cysteines by serines did not affect the surface expression of ABCA1, we performed biotinylation experiments to identify surface proteins. Cysteine mutants C2S, C6S, C13S, C14S, C15S, C2/6S, C13/14S, C13/14/15S, and C2/6/13/14/15S were expressed at a level comparable with that of wild-type ABCA1 and also exhibited considerable surface expression (Fig. 5). ABCA1(Cl–16S)-GFP, in which all of the cysteines (C1–C16) in ECDs were replaced by serines, showed a comparable expression level but no surface expression. However, ABCA1(Cys5)-GFP, which contains only the five cysteines C2, C6, C13, C14, and C15 but in which the other 11 extracellular cysteines are replaced by serine residues, showed considerable surface expression (Fig. 5). These results support the importance of C13 and C14 in apoA-I binding. Four of Five Cysteine Residues (C2, C6, C13, C14, and C15) in ECDs of ABCA1 Are Involved in ApoA-I-dependent Cholesterol Efflux—We examined whether five cysteine residues (C2, C6, C13, C14, and C15) in ECD1 and ECD2 are involved in the function of ABCA1. ApoA-I bound to cells expressing ABCA1(Cys5)-GFP as efficiently as to cells expressing the wild-type protein (Fig. 6A). However, apoA-I did not bind to cells expressing C2/6/13/14/15S even though it located on the cell surface comparable with ABCA1(Cys5)-GFP (Fig. 5). When cells expressing ABCA1-(Cys5)-GFP were treated with DTT, bound apoA-I dissociated from cells; apoA-I re-bound to cells again after subsequent washing with fresh medium. DTT treatment of cells in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide irreversibly abolished apoA-I binding to cells expressing ABCA1(Cys5)-GFP (supplemental Fig. 4). We next examined apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux from cells expressing the cysteine mutants (Fig. 7). Like ABCA1-MM, cysteine mutants C2S, C6S, C2/6S, and C13/14S did not show apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux, whereas C13S and C14S showed apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux as efficiently as the wild type. Interestingly, C15S did not show apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux, although this mutation did not affect apoA-I binding. ABCA1(Cys5) showed apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux as efficiently as the wild type, whereas C2/6/13/14/15S did not show any activity. These results suggest that four cysteine residues (C2, C6, C15, and either C13 or C14) in ECD1 and ECD2 of ABCA1 are required for apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. Finally, we examined apoA-I binding to and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux from cells expressing ABCA1(Cys4#1), containing four extracellular cysteine residues (C2, C6, C13, and C15) or ABCA1(Cys4#2), containing four extracellular cysteine residues (C2, C6, C14, and C15). ApoA-I bound to the cells expressing both of these mutants as efficiently as to cells expressing the wild type (Fig. 6B). ApoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux from these cells was as high as that from cells expressing wild-type ABCA1 (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that four cysteine residues in ECD1 and ECD2 of ABCA1 are sufficient for apoA-I binding and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. Analysis of Trypsin-digested Wild-type and Mutant ABCA1 under Reducing and Nonreducing Conditions—To determine whether the five cysteine residues are involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation, the migration behavior of ABCA1 upon SDS-PAGE was analyzed under disulfide reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 8 and supplemental Fig. 5). The 280-kDa band greatly decreased when wild-type ABCA1 was digested with trypsin for 15 min and separated on the gel under reducing conditions, and the band disappeared when digested for 40 min. Instead, faster migrating bands (∼150 kDa) appeared after trypsin digestion, as reported (9.Takahashi K. Kimura Y. Kioka N. Matsuo M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10760-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, under nonreducing conditions, the trypsin-digested ABCA1 co-migrated with undigested ABCA1, indicating that the N- and C-terminal halves of ABCA1 were connected with disulfide bonds. Among the single cysteine mutants, C2S, C6S, C13S, C14S, and C15S retained disulfide bond(s) between the N- and C-terminal halves. However, mutants C2/6S and C13/14/15S retained no disulfide bond between the N- and C-terminal halves. Finally, we analyzed the electrophoretic mobility of ABCA1(Cys4#1), ABCA1(Cys4#2), and ABCA1(Cys5) under disulfide reducing and nonreducing conditions and found it to be identical to that of the wild type. ABCA1 contains disulfide bond(s) between the N- and C-terminal halves, and cysteine residues in the two characteristic ECDs are predicted to be involved in disulfide bond formation. However, it remains unclear which cysteines are involved in disulfide bond formation, how many disulfide bonds are formed, and most importantly, whether disulfide bond formation is important for the functions of ABCA1. To identify the cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation in ABCA1, we constructed >30 mutants in which extracellular cysteine residues were replaced by serines and analyzed their function in assays of apoA-I binding and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. Two cysteine residues, C2 and C6 in ECD1, were found by single cysteine replacement to be essential for apoA-I binding and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. In contrast, in ECD2, only one cysteine residue, C15, was found to be essential for apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux, and no single cysteine replacement in ECD2 impaired apoA-I binding. Instead, the concurrent replacement of two cysteine residues, C13 and C14, by serines impaired apoA-I binding and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. These results can be interpreted as follows: three cysteine residues (C2, C6, and C15) and either C13 or C14 are essential for the functions of ABCA1. Indeed, ABCA1(Cys4#1) and ABCA1(Cys4#2), containing only four extracellular cysteines (C2/C6/C13/C15 and C2/C6/C14/C15, respectively) were capable of binding apoA-I and participating in apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux as efficiently as wild-type ABCA1. These results suggest that four cysteine residues in ECD1 and ECD2 are necessary for the functions of ABCA1 expressed in HEK293 cells. Trypsin digestion experiments suggested that five cysteine residues (C2, C6, C13, C14, and C15) are involved in disulfide bond formation between ECD1 and ECD2. Replacement of any one of these residues could not abolish disulfide bond formation between ECD1 and ECD2, but no disulfide bonds were formed in ABCA1 containing either the C2/6S or C13/14/15S substitution. These results suggest that more than one disulfide bond can be formed between ECD1 and ECD2. Because C13 and C14 can substitute for each other functionally, two distinct disulfide bonds can be formed between ECD1 and ECD2. These results suggest that the formation of one disulfide bond between two halves is not sufficient to support ABCA1 function; two intramolecular disulfide bonds between ECD1 and ECD2 are necessary for the functions of ABCA1. We tried to determine which pairs of disulfide bonds, C2-C15 and C6-C13/14 or C2-C13/14 and C6-C15, are formed between ECD1 and ECD2. However, we found that both disulfide bonds C2-C14 and C2-C15 could be formed when ECDs contained only two cysteine residues (C2 and C14 or C2 and C15) (supplemental Fig. 5B). Furthermore, both disulfide bonds (C6-C14 and C6-C15) could form when ECDs contained only two cysteine residues (C6 and C14 or C6 and C15). Because C13, C14, and C15 reside within 15 amino acids in the region predicted as a flexible loop, they may be able to substitute for each other in disulfide bond formation. C13 and C14, with one residue between them, seem to be functionally equivalent and can substitute for each other; they cannot functionally substitute for C15, however, because C15S replacement impaired apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. C13 and C14 are conserved among ABCA1, ABCA4, and ABCA7, and mutations of both C13 (C1488R) and C14 (C1490Y) of ABCA4 are linked to Stargardt disease (20.Webster A.R. Heon E. Lotery A.J. Vandenburgh K. Casavant T.L. Oh K.T. Beck G. Fishman G.A. Lam B.L. Levin A. Heckenlively J.R. Jacobson S.G. Weleber R.G. Sheffield V.C. Stone E.M. Investig. Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1179-1189PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these two cysteines are functionally important and cannot substitute for each other in ABCA4. ABCA4 prepared from bovine retina rod outer segment was reported to migrate on an SDS gel more rapidly under nonreducing conditions than under reducing conditions (10.Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). C13 or C14 might be involved in intermolecular disulfide bond formation, and the resulting bond might affect the structure or functions of ABCA4. Because ABCA1 expressed in human fibroblasts forms a covalently linked tetramer (25.Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L. Genest J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41529-41536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), either C13 or C14 of ABCA1 might be involved in intermolecular disulfide bond formation in vivo, although it is not necessary for ABCA1 expressed in HEK293 cells. ApoA-I did not bind to cells expressing ABCA1-MM. The electrophoretic mobility of the trypsin-digested ABCA1-MM was identical to that of the wild type under disulfide reducing and nonreducing conditions (data not shown), suggesting normal disulfide bond formation in ABCA1-MM. Therefore, conformational changes of ABCA1 caused by ATP binding and/or hydrolysis could be required for apoA-I binding. The single cysteine substitutions C2S and C6S impaired apoA-I binding, suggesting that two disulfide bonds between ECD1 and ECD2 are required for the conformation for apoA-I binding. In contrast, the C15S mutation did not impair apoA-I binding. Two disulfide bonds may be formed between C2 and C6 and between C13 and C14 in the C15S mutant, and the resulting structure may mimic the conformation after ATP binding/hydrolysis. However, these disulfide bonds were not able to support cholesterol efflux, probably because they cannot allow the conformational changes coupled with ATP hydrolysis. The Tangier mutation W590S impairs apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux but not apoA-I binding (15.Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The replacement of C15 by serine may cause conformational changes similar to those caused by the W590S mutation. These results also suggest that apoA-I binding and apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux are separable because C15S did not impair apoA-I binding but did impair apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux. In summary, our results indicate that two intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed in ABCA1, between C2 and C6 in ECD1 and between either C13 or C14 and C15 in ECD2, and that these two disulfide bonds are necessary for apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux by ABCA1 expressed in HEK293 cells. These cysteine residues are conserved among ABCA1, ABCA4, and ABCA7. This study will facilitate our understanding of the mechanism of HDL formation by ABCA1, as well as the function of other ABCA subfamily proteins. Download .pdf (.57 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W1978618548,"Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is an intracellular enzyme that is vital in innate immunity, but also is a tumor suppressor candidate. Here, we show that overexpression of RNase L decreases cellular growth and downmodulates the RNA-binding protein, HuR, a regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. The effect is temporal, occurring in specific cell-cycle phases and correlated with the cytoplasmic localization of RNase L. Both cellular growth and HuR were increased in RNASEL-null mouse fibroblast lines when compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, the stability of HuR mRNA was enhanced in RNASEL-null cells. The HuR 3' untranslated region (UTR), which harbors U-rich and adenylate-uridylate-rich elements, was potently responsive to RNase L when compared to control 3' UTR. Our results may offer a new explanation to the tumor suppressor function of RNase L."

Type 2B mutant pVHL is predicted to be defective in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-α regulation. Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells in which the endogenous wild-type Vhl gene was replaced with the representative Type 2B VHL hotspot mutation R167Q (Vhl2B/2B) displayed preserved physiological regulation of both HIF factors with slightly greater normoxic dysregulation of HIF-2α. Differentiated Vhl2B/2B-derived teratomas overexpressed joint HIF targets Vegf and EglN3 but not the HIF-1α-specific target Pfk1. Vhl2B/2B teratomas additionally displayed a growth advantage over Vhl−/−-derived teratomas, suggestive of a tight connection between perturbations in the degree and ratio of HIF-1α and HIF-2α stabilization and cell growth. Vhl2B/2B mice displayed mid-gestational embryonic lethality, whereas adult Vhl2B/+ mice exhibited susceptibility to carcinogen-promoted renal neoplasia compared with wild-type littermates at 12 months. Our experiments support a model in which the representative Type 2B R167Q mutant pVhl produces a unique profile of HIF dysregulation, thereby promoting tissue-specific effects on cell growth, development and tumor predisposition."

For stoichiometry of the GSTP1 phosphorylation by EGFR, the phosphorylation reaction was set up containing 1 μg of GSTP1, 0.05 μm EGFR, and a saturating (100 μm) ATP concentration. Over 0–4 h, aliquots were removed and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated GSTP1 bands were excised and solubilized, and the radioactivity counted by β-scintillation. The incorporated 32P phosphate was computed from the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP, expressed per mol of the dimeric GSTP1 protein, and plotted against time. GSTP1 was 32P-phosphorylated by EGFR, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After autoradiography, the phospho-GSTP1 bands were excised, hydrolyzed at 110 °C in 5 m HCl for 1 h, vacuum-dried, and resuspended in a loading buffer of acetic acid:pyridine:water (10:1:189) containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards, and electrophoresed at pH 3.5 on a cellulose TLC plate. The plate was dried, stained with ninhydrin, and autoradiographed. A mixture of GSTP1 preincubated with or without 5 mm GSH was applied to the GSTP1 phosphorylation assay with 50 nm EGFR and 200 μm ATP followed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody. After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with anti-GSTP1 antibody to control for loading. To inhibit the EGFR activation, a 50 nm EGFR preincubated for 30 min with 0–1 mm lapatinib, an EGFR inhibitor, was used for the GSTP1 phosphorylation assay. Tyrosine-phosphorylated GSTP1 was normalized against total GSTP1 protein. Tumor cells grown in serum-free medium for 24 h were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitors mixture (Pierce). The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatants were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P), phospho-EGFR, and GSTP1 antibodies. For a combined immunoprecipitation (IP)-Western blotting, supernatants (1 mg total protein) were incubated (4 °C; overnight) with anti-GSTP1, phospho-EGFR antibodies, or normal mouse IgG (as a negative control). The protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with immunocomplexes for 1 h and washed 4 times with the lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting. To examine the effect of EGFR inhibition, tumor cells with activated EGFR were treated with 2.5 μm lapatinib for 30 min, as per experimental protocol before lysis and Western blotting. These were performed as we had previously described (22Lo H.W. Antoun G. Ali-Osman F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9131-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 unit each of unphosphorylated recombinant GSTP1 and GSTP1 phosphorylated by EGFR as described earlier were used to set up reactions containing 0.05–0.5 mm GSTP1-specific substrate, ethacrynic acid (EA), and 0.25 mm GSH in a 0.1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The rate of formation of the reaction product between EA and GSH was monitored at 270 nm. Reaction rates, normalized against that of the nonenzymatic reaction, were computed and used to generate double reciprocal plots from which the enzyme kinetic constants, Km, Vmax, Kcat, and Kcat/Km, were computed for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GSTP1 (28Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 208-318Google Scholar), and the results are presented as the mean ± 1 S.D. of triplicate experiments. Xenografts (approximately, 200 mm2 in diameter) of U87MG and U87MG.wtEGFR growing subcutaneously in the flanks of 4-week-old male athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice were excised, minced, and sonicated on ice in the lysis buffer. Supernatants were subjected to the IP (anti-GSTP1)-Western (anti-Tyr(P)) procedure as described earlier. Recombinant GSTP1 was EGFR-phosphorylated GSTP1, reduced, and alkylated, and second dimension acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. SYPRO Ruby-stained protein spots were robotically excised, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, digested with trypsin, and subjected to LC-MS/MS. MS/MS data were analyzed using the MASCOT MS/MS Ions Search, and de novo sequence analysis performed with the Scaffold Software (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR). Details of the protocols used are available online at Proteome Software Inc. and in supplemental material. Peptides containing each of the 12 tyrosine residues in the GSTP1 protein, namely, Tyr-3, Tyr-7, Tyr-49, Tyr-63, Tyr-79, Tyr-103, Tyr-108, Tyr-111, Tyr-118, Tyr-153, Tyr-179, and Tyr-198 as well as human angiotensin II peptide (DRVYIHPF as a positive control; Calbiochem) and Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG as a negative control; AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA), were EGFR-phosphorylated using [32P]ATP, spotted on Whatman P81 cellulose phosphate filters, acetone-washed, and air-dried. The radioactivity was quantitated by β-scintillation counting and used to compute the incorporated phosphate in each peptide. To better ascertain the GSTP1 phospho-acceptor residues, Tyr-3/Tyr-7, Tyr-63, Tyr-118, and Tyr-198 in six peptides selected from the LC-MS/MS analysis were mutated to aspartic acid (BioSynthesis, Louisville, TX), and the level of EGFR phosphorylation was determined as described above. Peptide information is available in supplemental Table S1. Mutant GSTP1 cDNAs were created by PCR on a template plasmid vector pBK-CMV/GSTP1A (16Goto S. Iida T. Cho S. Oka M. Kohno S. Kondo T. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using GSTP1-specific primers containing tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at Tyr-3, -7, and -198. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Cloning was performed using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen) with the pcDNA-DEST40 destination vector to allow C-terminal fusions with a six-histidine tag. Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 × 105 U87MG.wtEGFR cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA-DEST40 expression vector carrying the wild-type GSTP1, the single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants Y3F, Y7F, and Y198F, the double mutants, Y3F/Y7F, Y3F/Y198F and Y7F/Y198F, the triple mutant Y3F/Y7F/Y198F, and the empty vector (negative control). After 48 h the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min and lysed. The histidine-tagged GSTP1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with TALON cobalt Dynabeads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody as described earlier. The relative levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant GSTP1 proteins relative to the wild-type GSTP1 were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ Version 1.34s software. Primer information is available in supplemental Table S2. X-ray crystallographic data were imported from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, and using the Insight II modeling program (Accelerys Software, San Diego), the three-dimensional structures of the GSH-bound GSTP1 monomer with and without the hydroxyl group of Tyr-7 phosphorylated were created. The modeled structures were soaked in a cubic box of water molecules and subjected to energy minimization and long-duration molecular dynamics simulation using the NAMD program 2.5 running on a 5 node Scyld Beowulf linux cluster. The coordinate and parameter files for input were generated using the “psfgen” utility in the CHARMM PARAM 22 topology file, whereas the all atom CHARMM PARAM 22 force field was used to describe the potential energy. The results of the analyses of energies and structure frames of the simulated system were extracted using the VMD software and illustrations produced with both the VMD and SYBYL software. Details of the simulation procedure are provided in the supplemental material. EGFR was activated in exponentially growing tumor cells by a 10-min treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF. Extracts from cells with and without subsequent treatment with 2.5 μm EGFR inhibitor, lapatinib, for 30 min were assayed for specific GSTP1 activity as we described earlier (22Lo H.W. Antoun G. Ali-Osman F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9131-9138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These studies were performed with the GSTP1- and EGF-overexpressing human inflammatory breast cancer cell line, SUM 149. Approximately 5 × 106 cells in exponential growth were pretreated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min in triplicate, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 100 μm cisplatin. After an additional 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice, harvested, and homogenized in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Supernatants after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min were removed, and protein was precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10% (final concentration) and incubating at 4 °C for 3 h. After final centrifugation, the supernatants (normalized for equal protein content) were used for glutathionylplatinum metabolite quantitation, as we previously described (30Ishikawa T. Ali-Osman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20116-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the supernatant were diluted 1:10 with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the absorbance was measured by scanning spectrophotometry over a wavelength range of 240–400 nm (Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer). The absorbance at 265 nm, A265 (peak absorbance of the glutathionylplatinum conjugate), of the supernatants with and without EGF pretreatment were normalized against that of control without cisplatin treatment, and the resulting ΔA265 was used as a measure of the level of glutathionylcisplatin in the cells. Tumor cells with activated EGFR were treated with and without 2.5 μm lapatinib for 30 min followed by 0–50 μm cisplatin for 3 h. The cells were washed, and cell survival was examined after 48 h using the CellTiter-Blue Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MGR3 and SUM 149 cells were plated at 1 × 103–104 cells in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a flat-bottomed microtiter plate. After 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were transfected with siRNA with the sequence (5′-ACCAGAUCUCCUUCGCUGACUACAA-3′) targeting the N-terminal region of GSTP1 mRNA using LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 6 h the cultures were refed with fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C for a further 24 h. Untransfected cells and cells transfected with scrambled siRNA served as controls. After 24 h the cells were treated with and without 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min followed by 0–50 μm cisplatin. Cell survival was determined as described earlier. Cisplatin sensitivity (surviving fraction) after each treatment relative to controls (normalized against scrambled siRNA) was determined, and IC50 values were computed. Replicate cells after siRNA treatment were lysed and subjected to Western blotting for GSTP1 expression to monitor the level of GSTP1 knockdown. Figs. 1, A–C, summarizes the results of the cell-free analysis of the phosphorylation of GSTP1 by EGFR, performed with recombinant GSTP1 and EGFR proteins. The 32P-labeling results (Fig. 1A) show that, after its pre-equilibration with GSH, GSTP1 undergoes dose-dependent phosphorylation by EGFR. The Western blots with an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-specific antibody (Fig. 1B) show that, while for GSTP1, tyrosine phosphorylation required GSH and was significantly reduced in its absence, the presence of GSH resulted in a slight reduction in the level of EGFR autophosphorylation, consistent with previous reports that EGFR is a redox-regulated protein and that its intracellular activation is suppressed by reducing agents (31Kamata H. Shibukawa Y. Oka S.I. Hirata H. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2000; 267: 1933-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Equal loading of GSTP1 in the lanes is shown by the Western blots for GSTP1 (lowest panel in Fig. 1B). To determine which amino acids in the GSTP1 protein undergo phosphorylation by EGFR, recombinant GSTP1 was 32P-phosphorylated by EGFR, acid-hydrolyzed, and subjected to thin layer electrophoresis and autoradiography. The results (Fig. 1C) show tyrosine to be the only amino acid residue phosphorylated by EGFR in the GSTP1 protein. No phosphoserines or phosphothreonines were detected. In the cell-free system and at saturating ATP concentrations EGFR phosphorylated the dimeric GSTP1 protein with a stoichiometry of 0.0436 ± 0.0003 mol of phosphate/mol of GSTP1. Intracellular EGFR-dependent GSTP1 phosphorylation was examined using the isogenic pair of human GBM cell lines, U87MG and U87MG.wtEGFR, with low and high constitutive wild-type EGFR expression, respectively. Protein extracts prepared from tumor cells that had been treated with and without 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody. The results, Fig. 2A, show no detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of around 23 kDa in either EGF-treated and untreated U87MG cells. Similarly, phospho-EGFR was undetectable in control untreated U87MG cells and increased only modestly after EGF treatment. In contrast, in untreated U87MG.wtEGFR cells moderate levels of phospho-EGFR were observed even without EGF treatment, and after EGF treatment these levels increased by more than 10-fold. Western blotting with Tyr(P) antibody showed the level of 23-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, absent in the non-EGF treated cells, to be significantly increased after EGF treatment. After stripping and reprobing with anti-GSTP1 antibody, this 23-kDa band was confirmed to be GSTP1. The results of GSTP1 tyrosine phosphorylation in GBM cells examined by immunoprecipitation with an anti-GSTP1 antibody followed by Western blotting for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 2B) were similar to those of the direct Western blotting and showed that, in U87MG.wtEGFR, levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated GSTP1 were low in non-EGF-treated cells but increased significantly after EGF treatment. Western blotting with anti-GSTP1 confirmed the amount of GSTP1 immunoprecipitated to be e"
https://openalex.org/W2022764080,"Cell membranes predominantly consist of lamellar lipid bilayers. When studied in vitro, however, many membrane lipids can exhibit non-lamellar morphologies, often with cubic symmetries. An open issue is how lipid polymorphisms influence organelle and cell shape. Here, we used controlled dimerization of artificial membrane proteins in mammalian tissue culture cells to induce an expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with cubic symmetry. Although this observation emphasizes ER architectural plasticity, we found that the changed ER membrane became sequestered into large autophagic vacuoles, positive for the autophagy protein LC3. Autophagy may be targeting irregular membrane shapes and/or aggregated protein. We suggest that membrane morphology can be controlled in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985621664,"Calmodulin (CaM) is a highly conserved intracellular calcium sensor. In plants, CaM also appears to be present in the apoplasm, and application of exogenous CaM has been shown to influence a number of physiological functions as a polypeptide signal; however, the existence and localization of its corresponding apoplasmic binding sites remain controversial. To identify the site(s) of action, a CaM-conjugated quantum dot (QD) system was employed for single molecule level detection at the surface of plant cells. Using this approach, we show that QD-CaM binds selectively to sites on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, which was further confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Measurements of Ca(2+) fluxes across the plasma membrane, using ion-selective microelectrodes, demonstrated that exogenous CaM induces a net influx into protoplasts. Consistent with these flux studies, calcium-green-dextran and FRET experiments confirmed that applied CaM/QD-CaM elicited an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels. These results support the hypothesis that apoplasmic CaM can act as a signaling agent. These findings are discussed in terms of CaM acting as an apoplasmic peptide ligand to mediate transmembrane signaling in the plant kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2083223096,"gamma-Secretase is a multisubunit membrane protein complex consisting of presenilin (PS1), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-1, and presenilin enhancer 2. To analyze the activity of familial Alzheimer disease mutants and to understand the roles of the subunits, we established a yeast transcriptional activator Gal4p system with artificial gamma-secretase substrates containing amyloid precursor protein or Notch fragments. The gamma-secretase activities were evaluated by transcriptional activation of reporter genes upon Gal4p release from the membrane-bound substrates, i.e. growth of yeast on histidine and adenine, or beta-galactosidase assay. We screened and evaluated gamma-secretase mutants using this reconstitution system in yeast, which does not possess endogenous gamma-secretase activity. When we introduced familial Alzheimer mutants of PS1 in this system, their activities were shown to be loss of function. Although the protease activity of wild type PS1 depends on the other three subunits introduced, we obtained 15 new PS1 mutants, which are active in the absence of NCT. They possessed a S438P mutation at the ninth transmembrane domain (TM9) together with one missense mutation distributed through transmembrane and loop regions. These mutations were not related to familial Alzheimer mutations of PS1 as identified so far. The S438P mutant was partially active but required other mutations for full activation. Results of the beta-galactosidase assay suggested that they have wild type protease activities, which were further confirmed by the endoproteolysis of PS1, amyloid beta peptides, and Notch intracellular domain production in mammalian cells. These results suggest that NCT is dispensable for the protease activity of gamma-secretase."
https://openalex.org/W2030106923,"Proteins secreted from Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) play important roles in regulating inflammatory and hemostatic responses. Inflammation is associated with the extracellular acidification of tissues and blood, conditions that can alter the behavior of secreted proteins. The effect of extracellular pH (pHo) on the release of von Willebrand factor (VWF), the VWF-propolypeptide (Proregion), interleukin-8, eotaxin-3, P-selectin, and CD63 from WPBs was investigated using biochemical approaches and by direct optical analysis of individual WPB fusion events in human endothelial cells expressing green or red fluorescent fusions of these different cargo proteins. Between pHo 7.4 and 7.0, ionomycin-evoked WPB exocytosis was characterized by the adhesion of VWF to the cell surface and the formation of long filamentous strands. The rapid dispersal of Proregion, interleukin-8, and eotaxin-3 into solution, and of P-selectin and CD63 into the plasma membrane, was unaltered over this pHo range. At pHo 6.8 or lower, Proregion remained associated with VWF, in many cases WPB failed to collapse fully and VWF failed to form filamentous strands. At pHo 6.5 dispersal of interleukin-8, eotaxin-3, and the membrane protein CD63 remained unaltered compared with that at pHo 7.4; however, P-selectin dispersal into the plasma membrane was significantly slowed. Thus, extracellular acidification to levels of pHo 6.8 or lower significantly alters the behavior of secreted VWF, Proregion, and P-selectin while rapid release of the small pro-inflammatory mediators IL-8 and eotaxin-3 is essentially unaltered. Together, these data suggest that WPB exocytosis during extracellular acidosis may favor the control of inflammatory processes.

Endothelial cells regulate inflammatory, vascular and hemostatic responses through the secretion of a wide range of bioactive molecules from specialized secretory organelles, the Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). 3The abbreviations used are: WPB, Weibel-Palade body; VWF, von Willebrand factor; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IL, interleukin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. The major WPB core proteins are von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the VWF-propolypeptide (Proregion). VWF is synthesized as a pre-proprotein comprising an N-terminal signal peptide (pre-), and several distinct repeating structural domains (termed A, B, C, and D) arranged as D1-D2-D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2-CK (9Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). During translation, the signal peptide is removed to yield proVWF, which then undergoes disulfide-linked dimerization to produce proVWF dimers (10Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Proregion domains (D1-D2) are cleaved from the main peptide in the Golgi apparatus, and further disulfide bond formation produces VWF multimers. The two resulting proteins, VWF and Proregion are co-packaged into the WPB where they noncovalently associate to form ordered tubules in a pH- and Ca2+-dependent fashion (11Huang R.H. Wang Y. Roth R.

Other physiologically important WPB proteins include P-selectin, interleukin-8 (IL-8), eotaxin-3, osteoprotegerin, and angiopoietin-2, (reviewed in Ref. 12Rondaij M.G. Bierings R. Kragt A. van Mourik J.A. Voorberg J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). At physiological extracellular pH (pHo 7.4) the majority of agonist-evoked WPB fusion events (∼75-90%) result in complete exocytosis and release of the stored molecules (13Erent M. Meli A. Moisoi N.

Skehel P. Hannah M.J. Carter T. Blood. 2008; 111: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Secreted VWF adheres to the cell surface and can form long filamentous strands, particularly under flow conditions, that are essential for the efficient capture of platelets from solution both in vitro and in vivo (e.g. Ref. 15Michaux G.

Imaging individual WPB exocytotic events in live endothelial cells expressing fluorescent WPB cargo molecules has shown that Proregion, along with IL-8, disperse quickly into solution, while P-selectin rapidly diffuses into the plasma membrane at sites of fusion (14Babich V.

At pHo 6.4 or lower Proregion remains associated with VWF, either at the cell surface after stimulated exocytosis of WPBs (17Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the cell following removal of the WPB membrane by detergent treatment (15Michaux G. Abbitt K.B. Collinson L.M. Haberichter S.L. Norman K.E. Cutler D.F. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, the unfurling of VWF to form long filamentous strands is attenuated (15Michaux G. Abbitt K.B. Collinson L.M. Haberichter S.L. Norman K.E. Cutler D.F. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D.

Retention of Proregion at the cell surface has led to speculation that it might play some biological role at such sites (17Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro Proregion is a ligand for the integrins α4β1 (VLA-4) (18Isobe T. Hisaoka T. Shimizu A. Okuno M. Aimoto S. Takada Y. Saito Y.

Thus it is possible that at sites of local acidosis produced during inflammation or ischemia, Proregion could play a role, along with other secreted factors, in regulating inflammatory responses. The influence of extracellular acidification on the release of these other secreted factors (e.g. IL-8, eotaxin-3, and P-selectin) is not known. pHo values of 6.4 or lower represent extreme conditions of acidosis, with decreases in pHo between 7.2 and 6.5 more typically reported during inflammation or ischemia (7Kellum J.A.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of extracellular acidification in this range (pHo 7.4-6.5) on the release of a variety of soluble and membrane proteins of the WPB involved in coagulant and inflammatory responses. Specifically, we define more precisely the value of pHo at which VWF fails to form filamentous strands and remains associated with Proregion at the cell surface, demonstrate the rapid reversibility of this pH-dependent association at individual sites of WPB fusion, and examine in detail the influence of extracellular acidification on the release and dispersal of fluorescent fusion proteins of the soluble mediators IL-8, eotaxin-3, and the membrane proteins P-selectin and CD63 from individual WPBs. The data show that the external conditions into which WPB deliver their cargo has significant effects on the dispersal and behavior of some but not other secreted molecules. Under acidic conditions, these changes could lead to a subtle shift from a coagulant to a more inflammatory phenotype. The data also highlight a more general problem of interpreting biochemical data of soluble secreted proteins in terms of underlying secretory granule exocytosis.

Monomeric EGFP was made from the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) by site-directed mutagenesis utilizing QuikChange (Stratagene) strategy.

EGFP-CD63 was a gift from Prof. Paul Luzio, Cambridge University. Exotaxin-3-mEGFP was made as follows, a sequence-verified human eotaxin-3 image clone (7262706 (BR7-d4) was purchased from Geneservice Ltd (Cambridge, UK), amplified using primers CTAAGCTTATGATGGGCCTCTCCTTG (forward) and CTTGGATCCCGCAATTGTTTCGGAGTTTTCAG (reverse), digested with HindIII/BamHI and ligated into HindIII/BamHI digested pmEGFP-N1. Experiments were carried out in physiological saline solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) or bicarbonate-free M199 culture medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and buffered between pH 8.0 and 6.5 using a combination of HEPES (10 mm) and PIPES (10 mm). Stock solutions of 0.5 m PIPES and 0.5 m HEPES at the required pH (8.0-6.5) were made by combining appropriate amounts of HEPES free acid, disodium HEPES, PIPES free acid, and disodium PIPES, calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation; pH = pKa + log[base]/[acid], where the pKa of PIPES and HEPES were taken as 6.8 and 7.5, respectively. The pH of all solutions was measured and final small adjustments made with 4 m NaOH as required. Immunocytochemistry—Nucleofected HUVEC were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (16Hannah M.J. Skehel P. Erent M. Knipe L. Ogden D. Carter T. J. Biol.

Endogenous IL-8 or eotaxin-3 was up-regulated by incubating with rhIL-1β (24 h, 1 ng/ml) or rhIL-4 (24 h, 20 ng/ml). To differentiate between secreted and non-secreted VWF, cells were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with vehicle (0.01% ethanol) or ionomycin (2 μm), at different extracellular pH, after which the coverslips of cells were placed into fresh buffer containing either a sheep or a rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF antibody at 4 °C (see figure legends 2 and 4) and incubated for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times prior to fixation and permeabilization and probed with either a rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal anti-VWF antibody (see figure legends 2 and 4), to detect intracellular VWF, and either a rabbit or chicken polyclonal antibody specific for the cleaved and processed form of Proregion found in WPBs (30Giblin J.P.

Measurement of Endogenous and Secreted VWF, Proregion, and IL-8 by Specific ELISA—Cells were transferred into serum, bicarbonate-free M199 buffered with HEPES to pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 50 min. The medium was changed for fresh serum-free medium buffered to pHo 7.4 or 6.5 as described above, and cells incubated for 10 min before fresh medium (pHo 7.4 or 6.5) containing 2 μm ionomycin or vehicle (0.01% ethanol) was added for 5 min (1st 5-min period; see Fig. 5). Medium was then removed for assay and replaced in all cases with fresh ionomycin-free medium at pHo7.4 for 5 min (2nd 5-min period; see Fig. 5) followed by collection of this medium. All medium samples were centrifuged to remove cell debris and stored at -20 °C. Cell lysates were prepared in serum and bicarbonate-free M199 containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, Gillingham, UK; 1/100 dilution,) and 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged (13,200 rpm, 5 min), and the supernatant collected and stored at -20 °C. Prior to assay, the pH of medium and lysate samples from pHo 6.5 experiments was adjusted to pHo 7.4 using 22.5 μl (into 900 μl of medium sample) or 25 μl (into 1000 μl of lysate sample) of 200 mm unbuffered TRIS base and analyzed for VWF and IL-8 in duplicate by ELISA using commercial reagents and standard protocols (VWF; Dako, Ely, UK, IL-8; human IL-8 ELISA construction kit; Anti-genix America, Huntington Station, NY). The concentrations of VWF, in milliinternational unit per milliliter (mIU/ml), were calculated from a standard curve as previously described (30Giblin J.P. Hewlett L.J. Hannah M.J. Blood. 2008; 112: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Medium and lysates were also assayed for Proregion using a sandwich ELISA.

Association of Endogenous Proregion with Secreted VWF Occurs between pHo 7.0 and 6.8—To establish more precisely the level of extracellular acidification required for the retention of Proregion with VWF at the cell surface, we first determined, by immunofluorescence, the localization of Proregion, extracellular VWF (VWFo), and non-secreted VWF (within WPB) following stimulation at pHo buffered to 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.8, and 6.5. Ionomycin was used as the secretagogue in all experiments because its ability to evoke WPB fusion was only marginally affected by extracellular acidification over the range pHo 7.4 to pHo 6.5 (supplemental Fig. S1). In nonstimulated cells, very little VWFo could be observed between pHo 7.4 and 6.5, and all Proregion immunoreactivity co-localized with intracellular VWF within WPB (supplemental Fig. S2a). Following stimulation at pHo 7.4, 7.2, or 7.0 extracellular deposits of VWF often comprising long filamentous strands were observed, but found to be devoid of Proregion immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A, pHo 7.4, and supplemental Fig. S2b, pHo 7.4, 7.2, or 7.0). Proregion immunoreactivity was seen within morphologically distinct WPB that had not undergone exocytosis (negative for the extracellular VWF antibody). At pHo 6.8, Proregion immunoreactivity could be observed associated with VWFo, and VWFo no longer formed long filamentous strands (Fig. 1B). At pHo 6.5, Proregion was exclusively associated with VWFo, comprising dense patches on the cell surface or within membrane cavities or partially or noncollapsed WPB, and again no filamentous strands of VWFo could be observed (Fig. 1C). These data confirm and extend the observations of Vischer and Wagner (17Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to show that the association of secreted Proregion with VWFo at the cell surface occurs between pHo 7.0 and 6.8, conditions that are more commonly associated with inflammation and ischemia (see above for references). pHo-dependence of the Dynamics of Proregion Dispersal from Individual WPBs—We next determined directly the pHo-dependence of Proregion-mEGFP dispersal from individual WPBs in living HUVEC over the range pHo 8.0-6.5. The fluorescence of EGFP is sensitive to pH and was used here to indicate the point of WPB fusion, whereupon the intra-WPB pH increases to that of the bathing medium (13Erent M. Meli A. Moisoi N. Babich V. Hannah M.J. Skehel P. Knipe L. Zupancic G. Ogden D. Carter T.D. J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fusion of WPBs into more acidic medium results in smaller absolute increases in intra-WPB pH, and consequently smaller increases in EGFP fluorescence (13Erent M. Meli A. Moisoi N. Babich V. Hannah M.J. Skehel P. Knipe L. Zupancic G. Ogden D. Carter T.D. J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This manifests itself in plots of the WPB fluorescence intensity, normalized to the peak of the fluorescence increase due to fusion versus time, as an elevated baseline value for the normalized fluorescence prior to fusion (e.g. Fig. 2, A and B, black traces). At pHo 8.0 and 7.4 there were no differences in the half-times for dispersal of Proregion-mEGFP (pH 8.0; 2.7 ± 3.17s, S.D. n = 24 WPBs, pH 7.4; 2.7 ± 3.33s, S.D. n = 120 WPB, pH 7.0). At pHo 7.0 the time for dispersal increased slightly, although this was not significantly different from that at pHo 7.4 (pH 7.0; 4.3 ± 3.17s, S.D. n = 48 WPBs); however, at pHo 6.5 its dispersal from the cell surface was dramatically slowed (pHo 6.5; 266.3 ± 26.26s, S.D. n = 153 WPBs; Fig. 2A), and Proregion-mEGFP remained associated with VWF in globular deposits on the cell surface or within partially collapsed or noncollapsed WPB (e.g. supplemental Fig. S3). The cell surface retention of Proregion-mEGFP could be rapidly reversed by switching the extracellular pH from pHo 6.5 to pHo 7.4 (Fig. 2B). pHo and the Relationship between WPB Exocytosis and the Appearance of Soluble VWF and Proregion—The extent of WPB exocytosis is often inferred from the amounts of soluble VWF or Proregion that appear in the medium of stimulated cells. However, the data described above, and those of Vischer and Wagner (17Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), predict that the relationship between WPB fusion and the appearance of soluble VWF and Proregion in the medium will be more complex under acidic conditions. To examine this, we looked at the appearance of soluble VWF and Proregion in cells stimulated for 5 min at either pHo 7.4 or 6.5 and then during a second 5-min period of exposure to fresh stimulus-free medium at pHo 7.4. Consistent with the prediction we found that ionomycin-evoked WPB exocytosis at pHo 6.5 resulted in a profound decrease (70-80%) in the appearance of soluble Proregion or VWF, and that the secreted material was readily recovered by subsequently exposing the stimulated cells to fresh stimulus-free medium at pHo 7.4 (Fig. 3). Release of IL-8 or Eotaxin-3 Is Largely Unaffected by Extracellular Acidification to pHo 6.5—IL-8-mCherry released from single WPBs at physiological pHo disperses rapidly from the site of exocytosis (14Babich V. Meli A. Knipe L. Dempster J.E. Skehel P. Hannah M.J. Carter T. Blood. 2008; 111: 5282-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); however, its behavior following release under acidic conditions is not known. The behavior of eotaxin-3 released from individual WPBs has not been directly determined under any conditions. We first determined, by immunofluorescence, the cell surface localization of VWFo and endogenous IL-8 or eotaxin-3 following WPB exocytosis evoked by ionomycin between pHo 7.4 and 6.5. Endogenous IL-8 or eotaxin-3 was up-regulated prior to stimulation with ionomycin by IL-1β or IL-4 pretreatment, respectively. In nonstimulated cells, no extracellular IL-8 or eotaxin-3 immunoreactivity could be observed associated with the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S4A). Following WPB exocytosis at pHo 7.4 or 6.5, neither IL-8 (Fig. 4A) nor eotaxin-3 (Fig. 4B) could be detected associated with filamentous strands (pHo 7.4; Fig. 4, Ai and Bi) or globular patches (pHo 6.5; Fig. 3, Aii and Bii) of VWFo. These data indicate that the IL-8 and eotaxin-3 released from WPBs do not remain associated with VWFo during extracellular acidosis. To determine directly the dynamics of IL-8 release from individual WPBs, live cells co-expressing IL-8-mCherry and Proregion-mEGFP were imaged, using the Proregion-mEGFP fluorescence to determine the point of WPB fusion during stimulation. The half-times for dispersal of IL-8-mCherry from individual WPB sites were the sam"
https://openalex.org/W1968368402,"In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic protein disulfide isomerase, DsbC, is maintained reduced by transfer of electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) via the cytoplasmic membrane protein, DsbD. The transmembrane domain of DsbD (DsbDbeta), which comprises eight transmembrane segments (TMs), contains two redox-active cysteines (Cys-163 and Cys-285), each of which is water-exposed to both sides of the membrane. Cys-163 in TM1 and Cys-285 in TM4 can interact with cytoplasmic Trx1 and a periplasmic Trx-like domain of DsbD, respectively. When Cys-163 and Cys-285 are disulfide-bonded, the C-terminal halves of TM1 and TM4 are water-exposed, whereas the N-terminal halves of these TMs are not. To assess possible conformational changes of DsbDbeta when its two cysteines are reduced, we have determined the accessibility of portions of TM1 and TM4. We substituted cysteines for amino acids in these TM segments and determined alkylation accessibility. We find that the alkylation accessibility of single Cys replacements in TM1 and TM4 is the same in oxidized and reduced DsbDbeta, indicating a relatively static conformation of DsbDbeta between the two redox states. We also find that the accessibility of amino acids of TM2 and TM3 when Cys-163 and Cys-285 are oxidized or reduced shows no change. Together, these results support a relatively static structure of DsbDbeta in the switch between the oxidized and the reduced state but raise the possibility of conformational changes when interacting with Trx proteins. In addition, we also find water-exposed residues in the cytoplasmic proximal portion of TM3, allowing a more detailed characterization of the cavity in DsbDbeta."
https://openalex.org/W2088106795,"The production of erythrocytes requires the massive synthesis of red cell-specific proteins including hemoglobin, cytoskeletal proteins, as well as membrane glycoproteins glycophorin A (GPA) and anion exchanger 1 (AE1). We found that during the terminal differentiation of human CD34(+) erythroid progenitor cells in culture, key components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein translocation (Sec61alpha), glycosylation (OST48), and protein folding machinery, chaperones BiP, calreticulin (CRT), and Hsp90 were maintained to allow efficient red cell glycoprotein biosynthesis. Unexpected was the loss of calnexin (CNX), an ER glycoprotein chaperone, and ERp57, a protein-disulfide isomerase, as well as a major decrease of the cytosolic chaperones, Hsc70 and Hsp70, components normally involved in membrane glycoprotein folding and quality control. AE1 can traffic to the cell surface in mouse embryonic fibroblasts completely deficient in CNX or CRT, whereas disruption of the CNX/CRT-glycoprotein interactions in human K562 cells using castanospermine did not affect the cell-surface levels of endogenous GPA or expressed AE1. These results demonstrate that CNX and ERp57 are not required for major glycoprotein biosynthesis during red cell development, in contrast to their role in glycoprotein folding and quality control in other cells."
https://openalex.org/W2125948158,"Recent reports showed an unexpected worsening of endothelial function by aldosterone antagonism in diabetic patients, suggesting that aldosterone could interfere with the detrimental consequences of diabetes on microvasculature and thus on cardiac function. To test this hypothesis, diabetes (D) was induced using streptozotocin in transgenic (Tg) male mice overexpressing aldosterone-synthase in the heart and in wild-type (Wt) mice. Eight weeks after streptozotocin injection, impairment of left ventricular systolic function, measured by echocardiography (fractional shortening), was accompanied by a decrease in capillaries/cardiomyocyte ratio (-20%) and VEGFa expression (-40%) in Wt-D mice compared with normoglycemic littermates. Furthermore, Wt-D mice demonstrated an increase in superoxide production (+100%) and protein carbonylation (+33%), hallmarks of oxidative stress. Except for a slight increase in protein carbonylation, all of these diabetes-associated cardiac alterations were undetectable in Tg-D mice. Fibrosis was induced similarly in both diabetic groups. Eplerenone (an aldosterone antagonist) abolished all of the effects of aldosterone-synthase overexpression but had no effect in Wt-D mice. Thus, aldosterone prevents systolic dysfunction through a mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanism that may include preventing VEGFa down-regulation and maintaining capillary density. Understanding how aldosterone prevents VEGFa down-regulation in experimental diabetes could be important to define new strategies targeting the prevention of a decrease in capillary density."
https://openalex.org/W1968013733,"The Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 plays a critical role in mammalian innate immune response against viral attacks by recognizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or its synthetic analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I∶C)). This leads to the activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB which results in the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat the viral infection. To understand the complex interplay of the various intracellular signaling molecules in the regulation of NF-κB and MAP kinases, we developed a computational TLR3 model based upon perturbation-response approach. We curated literature and databases to determine the TLR3 signaling topology specifically for murine macrophages. For initial model creation, we used wildtype temporal activation profiles of MAP kinases and NF-κB and, for model testing, used TRAF6 KO and TRADD KO data. From dynamic simulations we predict i) the existence of missing intermediary steps between extracellular poly (I∶C) stimulation and intracellular TLR3 binding, and ii) the presence of a novel pathway which is essential for JNK and p38, but not NF-κB, activation. Our work shows activation dynamics of signaling molecules can be used in conjunction with perturbation-response models to decipher novel signaling features of complicated immune pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2047544531,"Aggregation of the Ure2 protein is at the origin of the [URE3] prion trait in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The N-terminal region of Ure2p is necessary and sufficient to induce the [URE3] phenotype in vivo and to polymerize into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. However, as the N-terminal region is poorly ordered in the native state, making it difficult to detect structural changes in this region by spectroscopic methods, detailed information about the fibril assembly process is therefore lacking. Short fibril-forming peptide regions (4-7 residues) have been identified in a number of prion and other amyloid-related proteins, but such short regions have not yet been identified in Ure2p. In this study, we identify a unique cysteine mutant (R17C) that can greatly accelerate the fibril assembly kinetics of Ure2p under oxidizing conditions. We found that the segment QVNI, corresponding to residues 18-21 in Ure2p, plays a critical role in the fast assembly properties of R17C, suggesting that this segment represents a potential amyloid-forming region. A series of peptides containing the QVNI segment were found to form fibrils in vitro. Furthermore, the peptide fibrils could seed fibril formation for wild-type Ure2p. Preceding the QVNI segment with a cysteine or a hydrophobic residue, instead of a charged residue, caused the rate of assembly into fibrils to increase greatly for both peptides and full-length Ure2p. Our results indicate that the potential amyloid stretch and its preceding residue can modulate the fibril assembly of Ure2p to control the initiation of prion formation."
https://openalex.org/W2076086966,"Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals is regulated by SNARE complex-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion. Tomosyn, a negative regulator of neurotransmitter release, which is composed of N-terminal WD40 repeats, a tail domain, and a C-terminal VAMP-like domain, is known to inhibit SNARE complex formation by sequestering target SNAREs (t-SNAREs) upon interaction of its C-terminal VAMP-like domain with t-SNAREs. However, it remains unclear how the inhibitory activity of tomosyn is regulated. Here we show that the tail domain functions as a regulator of the inhibitory activity of tomosyn through intramolecular interactions. The binding of the tail domain to the C-terminal VAMP-like domain interfered with the interaction of the C-terminal VAMP-like domain with t-SNAREs, and thereby repressed the inhibitory activity of tomosyn on the SNARE complex formation. The repressed inhibitory activity of tomosyn was restored by the binding of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats. These results indicate that the probable conformational change of tomosyn mediated by the intramolecular interactions of the tail domain controls its inhibitory activity on the SNARE complex formation, leading to a regulated inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals is regulated by SNARE complex-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion. Tomosyn, a negative regulator of neurotransmitter release, which is composed of N-terminal WD40 repeats, a tail domain, and a C-terminal VAMP-like domain, is known to inhibit SNARE complex formation by sequestering target SNAREs (t-SNAREs) upon interaction of its C-terminal VAMP-like domain with t-SNAREs.

Here we show that the tail domain functions as a regulator of the inhibitory activity of tomosyn through intramolecular interactions. The binding of the tail domain to the C-terminal VAMP-like domain interfered with the interaction of the C-terminal VAMP-like domain with t-SNAREs, and thereby repressed the inhibitory activity of tomosyn on the SNARE complex formation.

Synaptic vesicles are transported to the presynaptic plasma membrane where Ca2+ channels are located. Depolarization induces Ca2+ influx into the cytosol of nerve terminals through the Ca2+ channels, and this Ca2+ influx initiates the fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane, finally leading to exocytosis of neurotransmitters (1Südhof T.C.

Synaptic vesicles are endowed with vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) as a vesicular SNARE, whereas the presynaptic plasma membrane is endowed with syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 as target SNAREs. VAMP-2 interacts with SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 to form a stable SNARE complex (6Trimble W.S. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The formation of the SNARE complex then brings synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane into close apposition, and provides the energy that drives the mixing of the two lipid bilayers (3Weber T.

Tomosyn is a syntaxin-1-binding protein that we originally identified (10Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Tomosyn contains N-terminal WD40 repeats, a tail domain, and a C-terminal domain homologous to VAMP-2. The C-terminal VAMP-like domain (VLD) of tomosyn acts as a SNARE domain that competes with VAMP-2. Indeed, a structural study of the VLD revealed that the VLD, syntaxin-1, and SNAP-25 assemble into a SNARE complex-like structure (referred to as tomosyn complex hereafter) (11Pobbati A.V. Razeto A. Boddener M. Becker S. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47192-47200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tomosyn inhibits SNARE complex formation by sequestering t-SNAREs through the tomosyn complex formation, and thereby inhibits SNARE-dependent neurotransmitter release. The large N-terminal region of tomosyn shares similarity to the Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal giant larvae (Lgl), the mammalian homologues M-Lgl1 and M-Lgl2, and yeast proteins Sro7p and Sro77p (12Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Wirtz-Peitz F. Knoblich J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 234-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with the function of tomosyn, Lgl family members play an important role in polarized exocytosis by regulating SNARE function on the plasma membrane in yeast and epithelial cells (12Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Wirtz-Peitz F. Knoblich J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 234-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, only tomosyn, Sro7, and Sro77 have the tail domains and the VLDs, suggesting that their structural regulation is evolutionally conserved. Recently, the crystal structure of Sro7 was solved and revealed that the tail domain of Sro7 binds its WD40 repeats (14Hattendorf D.A. Andreeva A. Gangar A. Brennwald P.J. Weis W.I. Nature. 2007; 446: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sec9, a yeast counterpart of SNAP-25, also binds the WD40 repeats of Sro7. This binding inhibits the SNARE complex formation and exocytosis by sequestering Sec9. In addition, binding of the tail domain to the WD40 repeats causes a conformational change of Sro7 and prevents the interaction of the WD40 repeats with Sec9, leading to regulation of the inhibitory activity of Sro7 on the SNARE complex formation (14Hattendorf D.A. Andreeva A. Gangar A. Brennwald P.J. Weis W.I. Nature. 2007; 446: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the solved structure of Sro7 lacks its VLD. Therefore, involvement of the activity of the VLD in the conformational change of Sro7 remains elusive. Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that TOM-1, an ortholog of vertebrate tomosyn, inhibits the priming of synaptic vesicles, and that this priming is modulated by the balance between TOM-1 and UNC-13 (15Gracheva E.O.

Madison J.M. Dybbs M. Kaplan J.M. Neuron. 2006; 51: 303-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Tomosyn was also shown to be involved in inhibition of the exocytosis of dense core granules in adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells (17Constable J.R. Graham M.E. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31615-31623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Yizhar O. Lipstein N. Gladycheva S.E. Matti U. Ernst S.A. Rettig J. Stuenkel E.L. Ashery U. J.

Thus, evidence is accumulating that tomosyn acts as a negative regulator for formation of the SNARE complex, thereby inhibiting various vesicle fusion events. However, the precise molecular mechanism regulating the inhibitory action of tomosyn has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that the tail domain of tomosyn binds both the WD40 repeats and the VLD and functions as a regulator for the inhibitory activity of tomosyn on the SNARE complex formation. Our results indicate that the probable conformational change of tomosyn mediated by the intramolecular interactions of the tail domain serves for controlling the inhibitory activity of the VLD. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein—Expression vectors for full-length rat m-tomosyn (1-1116 aa) and a large N-terminal fragment of rat m-tomosyn (tomosyn-N) (1-949 aa) were constructed in pFastBac1-MBP using standard molecular biology methods. The pFastBac1-MBP vector was constructed from a baculovirus transfer vector, pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), to express a fusion protein with N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) (19Yasumi M. Sakisaka T.

MBP-fused full-length tomosyn (MBP-tomosyn) and MBP-fused tomosyn-N (MBP-tomosyn-N) were expressed in Sf21 cells. A cDNA encoding the VLD (1031-1116 aa) of rat m-tomosyn and a cDNA encoding the tail domain and the VLD (933-1116 aa) of rat m-tomosyn were subcloned into the pMAL-C2 vector (New England Biolabs Inc.). MBP-fused VLD (MBP-VLD) and MBP-fused tail-VLD (MBP-tail-VLD) were expressed in Escherichia coli. MBP-tomosyn, MBP-tomosyn-N, MBP-VLD, and MBP-tail-VLD were purified with amylose resin in accordance with the manufacturers manual. MBP-VLD and MBP-tail-VLD were further purified using Mono-Q (GE Healthcare). For the expression of His6-tagged tail-VLD (His-tail-VLD), and His6-tagged VLD (His-VLD), the cDNAs of tail-VLD and VLD were subcloned into pRSET vector and pTrc vector, respectively. For the expression of the His6-tagged tail domain (His-tail), a cDNA encoding the peptide encompassing the tail domain (933-1050 aa) was subcloned into pRSET vector. His-tail-VLD, His-VLD, and His-tail were expressed in E. coli and purified with TALON resin (Clontech).

GST-VLD, GST-syntaxin-1, GST-SNAP-25, and GST-VAMP-2 were expressed in E. coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B in accordance with the manufacturer's manual. To cut off the GST tags, GST-VLD and GST-SNAP-25 were digested with PreScission protease, and GST-syntaxin-1 and GST-VAMP-2 were digested with thrombin. The GST tag and PreScission protease were removed by glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The thrombin was removed by benzamidine-Sepharose. Syntaxin-1 was further purified using Mono-Q as previously described (20Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol.

Synaptic Transmission between SCG Neurons—Postnatal day 7 Wistar ST rats were decapitated under diethyl ether anesthesia according to the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan. Isolated SCG neurons were maintained in culture for 5-6 weeks as described (21Mochida S. Nonomura Y. Kobayashi H. Microsc. Res.

In brief, SCGs were dissected, desheathed, and incubated with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml; Worthington Biochemical) in L-15 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 10 min. Following enzyme digestion, semi-dissociated ganglia were triturated gently through small-pore glass pipettes until a cloudy suspension was observed. After washing by low speed centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 3 min, the collected cells were plated onto coverslips in plastic dishes (Corning; 35-mm diameter, approximately one ganglion per dish) containing a growth medium of 84% Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 25 ng/ml nerve growth factor (2.5 S, grade II; Alomone Laboratories). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2-humidified incubator and the medium was changed twice per week. Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recording and injection of the recombinant proteins were performed as described previously (21Mochida S. Nonomura Y. Kobayashi H. Microsc. Res.

Tauc (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) were analyzed with Origin (Microcal Software Inc.). Assays for Tomosyn Complex Formation and SNARE Complex Formation—For tomosyn complex formation, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 were reacted in the presence or absence of MBP-VLD, MBP-tail-VLD, or MBP-tomosyn in Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C overnight. For SNARE complex formation, the samples were further reacted with VAMP-2 in Buffer A at room temperature for 60 min. The formed tomosyn complex and SNARE complex were detected by native PAGE as previously described (20Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were suspended in a loading buffer (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% glycerol), and then separated on 3% stacking (Tris/HCl, pH 6.7) and 9% separation gel (Tris/HCl, pH 8.8) in an identical manner as SDS-PAGE except that SDS was omitted from all buffers. The SNARE complex was also detected by SDS-PAGE as previously described (23Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer A (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 2% SDS) at room temperature for 10 min. Then the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-syntaxin-1 mAb (a generous gift from Dr. Masami Takahashi (Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan)). Assays for Effects of the Tail Domain Binding on Tomosyn Complex Formation and SNARE Complex Formation—To examine the effect of the binding of the tail domain to the VLD on the tomosyn complex formation and the SNARE complex formation, 1 μm VLD and various concentrations of His-tail were preincubated, and then the mixtures of VLD and His-tail were incubated with 1 μm syntaxin-1 and 1 μm SNAP-25 for 60 min. For tomosyn complex formation, the samples were subjected to native PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For SNARE complex formation, the samples were further incubated with 1 μm VAMP-2 for 60 min at 4 °C, and the samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer A at room temperature for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin-1 mAb. To examine the effect of binding of the tail domain to the WD40 repeats on the SNARE complex formation, 0.25 μm His-tail-VLD or 0.25 μm His-VLD were preincubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm MBP-tomosyn-N at 4 °C overnight. 0.25 μm Syntaxin-1 and 0.25 μm SNAP-25 were incubated with His-tail-VLD, His-VLD, the mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N and His-tail-VLD, or the mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N and His-VLD at 4 °C for 6 h, and then 0.25 μm VAMP-2 was added. After a subsequent 60-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer A at room temperature for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin-1 mAb. Pull-down Assay for Binding of the Tail Domain to the VLD—For detection of the direct binding of His-tail to GST-VLD, 18 μmol of GST-VLD or GST alone was immobilized on 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and then incubated with 12 nmol of His-tail in Buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C overnight. After the resins were extensively washed with Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer B (60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-His mAb (Novagen). Pull-down Assay for Binding of the Tail Domain to the N-terminal WD40 Repeats—For detection of the direct binding of His-tail to MBP-tomosyn-N, 150 pmol of MBP-tomosyn-N or MBP alone was immobilized on 50 μl of amylose resin, and then incubated with 405 pmol of His-tail-VLD or His-VLD in Buffer B at 4 °C overnight. After the resins were extensively washed with Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer B for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-His polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). For quantitative analysis of the binding, 130 pmol of MBP-tomosyn-N were immobilized on 20 μl of amylose resin, and incubated with various concentrations of His-tail in Buffer B. After the resins were extensively washed with Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer B for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Different Inhibitory Effects of Tomosyn Fragments on Synaptic Transmission between SCG Neurons—Tomosyn is composed of N-terminal WD40 repeats, a tail domain, and a VAMP-like domain (VLD) (Fig. 1A). To examine how the activity of the VLD of tomosyn is regulated, we utilized a synapse formed between superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons in culture (24Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), because samples to be tested, such as proteins, can be easily introduced into the relatively large presynaptic cell bodies of SCG neurons by microinjection, allowing the effects on the stimulated release of acetylcholine to be accurately monitored by recording the EPSPs evoked by action potentials in the presynaptic neurons. The VLD is known to compete for VAMP-2 binding to syntaxin-1, leading to inhibition of SNARE complex formation (11Pobbati A.V. Razeto A. Boddener M. Becker S. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47192-47200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with these facts, microinjection of an MBP-fused fragment encompassing the VLD (MBP-VLD) inhibited acetylcholine release (Fig. 1B). By contrast, microinjection of an MBP-fused fragment encompassing the tail domain and the VLD (MBP-tail-VLD) did not inhibit acetylcholine release. Repression of the VLD-mediated Inhibition of the SNARE Complex Formation by the Tail Domain—To understand why MBP-tail-VLD did not inhibit neurotransmitter release, we examined the effect of the tail domain on the SNARE complex formation. SNAP-25, VAMP-2 lacking the transmembrane domain (referred to as VAMP-2 hereafter), and various concentrations of syntaxin-1 lacking the transmembrane domain (referred to as syntaxin-1 hereafter) were reacted in the presence or absence of MBP-VLD or MBP-tail-VLD. Then the samples were subjected to native PAGE as previously described (20Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. In the control reaction, the SNARE complex was efficiently formed in a dose-dependent manner of syntaxin-1 (Fig. 2A). The SNARE complex in the control reaction began to form at 0.5 μm syntaxin-1. The reaction with MBP-VLD potently inhibited SNARE complex formation relative to the control reaction. The SNARE complex was not detected below 2.0 μm syntaxin-1. On the other hand, the reaction with MBP-tail-VLD moderately inhibited the formation of the SNARE complex relative to the control reaction. The amount of formed SNARE complex in the reaction with MBP-tail-VLD was less than that in the control reaction at all tested concentrations of syntaxin-1. However, the reaction with MBP-tail-VLD began to form the SNARE complex at 0.5 μm syntaxin-1. These results indicate that the ability of MBP-tail-VLD to inhibit SNARE complex formation is much weaker than that of MBP-VLD. Similar results were obtained by assessing SDS-resistant SNARE complex formation. Various concentrations of syntaxin-1 were reacted with SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 in the presence or absence of MBP-VLD or MBP-tail-VLD. The samples were solubilized in the SDS sample buffer at room temperature, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin-1 mAb. Consistent with the previous report that the SNARE complex is resistant to the SDS sample buffer at room temperature (23Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), 60-kDa immunoreactive bands indicative of the SNARE complex were detected. MBP-VLD inhibited SDS-resistant SNARE complex formation much more than MBP-tail-VLD (Fig. 2B). To validate these in vitro results, we examined inhibitory activities of Tail-VLD and VLD on the SNARE complex formation at a cell level. A vector to express HA-tagged VLD (HA-VLD) or FLAG-tagged Tail-VLD (FLAG-tail-VLD) was transfected into a neuroblastoma cell line, NG108 cells. After neuronal differentiation upon 1 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP application, SNAP-25 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-SNAP-25 mAb, and the SNARE complex formation was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation of VAMP-2. HA-VLD and FLAG-tail-VLD were co-immunoprecipitated from the cells expressing HA-VLD and FLAG-tail-VLD, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that tomosyn complexes were formed in the cells. VAMP-2 co-immunoprecipitated from cells expressing HA-VLD or FLAG-tail-VLD was less than that from the untransfected cells, indicating that tomosyn complexes inhibited SNARE complex formation. Importantly, HA-VLD decreased coimmunoprecipitation of VAMP-2 more potently than FLAG-tail-VLD. Taken together, all these results indicate that the ability of Tail-VLD to inhibit SNARE complex formation is much weaker than that of VLD, explaining why microinjection of MBP-tail-VLD into the SCG neuron did not inhibit neurotransmitter release. Regulation of Tomosyn Complex Formation by the Tail Domain—We next examined the effect of the tail domain on tomosyn complex formation. Syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 were reacted in the presence of various concentrations of MBP-VLD or MBP-tail-VLD. The samples were subjected to native PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and the bands indicative of tomosyn complex (MBP-VLD-SNARE complex or MBP-tail-VLD SNARE complex) were quantified. MBP-VLD formed the tomosyn complex in a dose-dependent manner more efficiently than MBP-tail-VLD (Fig. 3). Next, we examined the time course of tomosyn complex formation by native PAGE. Syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and MBP-VLD or MBP-tail-VLD were incubated for various periods of time at room temperature. Because native PAGE analysis does not allow the use of SDS sample buffer to terminate the reaction, we cannot exclude the possibility that the reaction proceeds during the native PAGE procedure. Indeed, some degree of tomosyn complex was formed without incubation at room temperature (supplemental Fig. S2). Under this condition, the tomosyn complex was still formed in a time-dependent manner. MBP-VLD-SNARE complex formation was saturated at 5 min incubation, whereas MBP-tail-VLD-SNARE complex formation was saturated at 60 min incubation. These results indicate that MBP-VLD forms the tomosyn complex more efficiently than MBP-tail-VLD. To further confirm the effects of MBP-VLD and MBP-tail-VLD on tomosyn complex formation, we titrated syntaxin-1 and examined the formation of the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 binary complex by native PAGE. SNAP-25 and various concentrations of syntaxin-1 were reacted in the presence or absence of MBP-VLD or MBP-tail-VLD. The syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 binary complex was formed in the reaction with MBP-tail-VLD more efficiently than in that with MBP-VLD (supplemental Fig. S3A), indicating that MBP-VLD consumed the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 binary complex for tomosyn complex formation more than MBP-tail-VLD. Taken together, all these results indicate that the activity of VLD to form the tomosyn complex is stronger than that of Tail-VLD, and suggest that the tail domain interferes with the activity of the VLD. Of note, the vague staining of MBP-tail-VLD alone on the native gel does not mean insufficient purity of the protein or loading smaller amounts of the protein. To confirm these results, the same samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (supplemental Fig. S3B). Given that migration of a protein on a native gel is influenced by its surface charge, such vague migration of MBP-tail-VLD may reflect a frequent change of the surface charge upon equilibration between association and dissociation of the tail domain to the VLD as discussed later. SNAP-25 migration on the native gel is much slower than syntaxin-1 although the molecular mass of SNAP-25 is lower than that of syntaxin-1. These results indicate that syntaxin-1 is more negatively charged than SNAP-25 under the native PAGE conditions. These observations are also consistent with the previous report (20Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Role of the Binding of the Tail Domain to the VLD in Regulation of SNARE Complex Formation—The above results prompted us to examine whether the tail domain directly bound the VLD. GST or GST-fused VLD (GST-VLD) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was reacted with histidine-tagged peptide encompassing the tail domain (His-tail). After extensive wash of the resins, the bound proteins were eluted with the SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-His mAb. Specific binding of His-tail to GST-VLD was detected (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the tail domain has an ability to bind the VLD. Consistent with these results, we observed coimmunoprecipitation of HA-tagged tail-VLD with FLAG-tagged tail-VLD but not that of HA-tagged VLD with FLAG-tagged VLD in HEK 293 cells (supplemental Fig. S4A). We next examined the functional role of the binding of the tail domain to the VLD in tomosyn complex formation by native PAGE. Syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VLD were reacted in the presence or absence of His-tail. His-tail decreased formation of the tomosyn complex (VLD-SNARE complex) (Fig. 4B). We further confirmed these observations by assessing the effect of the binding of the tail peptide to VLD on SNARE complex formation. Syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 were reacted in the presence of VLD and various concentrations of His-tail. The samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer at room temperature, and then SNARE complex formation was examined by immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin-1 mAb. His-tail increased the SNARE complex formation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C), indicating that binding of the tail domain to the VLD hinders the activity of the VLD to consume the binary complex for tomosyn complex formation. Collectively, these results suggest that the tail domain interferes with tomosyn complex formation upon its direct binding to the VLD, and thereby reduces the inhibition of SNARE complex formation. Direct Binding of the Tail Domain to the N-terminal WD40 Repeats—We next compared the activity of full-length tomosyn to inhibit SNARE complex formation with those of Tail-VLD and VLD. The SNARE proteins were reacted in the absence or presence of MBP-fused full-length tomosyn (MBP-tomosyn), MBP-tail-VLD, or MBP-VLD, and then SNARE complex formation was examined by immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin-1 mAb. MBP-tomosyn potently inhibited SNARE complex formation as much as MBP-VLD did (Fig. 5A). The fact that despite the existence of both the tail domain and the VLD, that full-length tomosyn potently inhibited SNARE complex formation prompted us to examine whether the N-terminal WD40 repeats bound the tail domain. An MBP-fused large N-terminal fragment of tomosyn encompassing the WD40 repeats but lacking the tail domain and the VLD (MBP-tomosyn-N) as shown in Fig. 1A and MBP alone were immobilized on amylose resins, respectively, and then the resins were incubated with His-tail. Specific binding of His-tail to MBP-tomosyn-N was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-His polyclonal antibody (Fig. 5B). Next, we examined the affinities of the interactions of the tail domain with the N-terminal WD40 repeats and the VLD quantitatively. Equal amounts of MBP-tomosyn-N and GST-VLD were immobilized on amylose resin and glutathione-Sepharose, respectively, and incubated with various concentrations of His-tail. The binding of His-tail to MBP-tomosyn-N was detected on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue gel (Fig. 5C). The binding was saturated at ∼5000 nm free His-tail. By contrast, the binding of His-tail to GST-VLD was not detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining but detected by immunoblotting with the anti-His mAb under the same condition as the binding of His-tail to MBP-tomosyn-N was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (supplemental Fig. S5A). These results indicate that the affinity of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats is stronger than that to the VLD. To further confirm these observations, we examined whether the N-terminal WD40 repeats interfered with binding of the tail domain to the VLD. GST-VLD immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with the His-tail in the presence of various amounts of MBP-tomosyn-N. MBP-tomosyn-N reduced the binding of His-tail to GST-VLD in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S5B). In addition, we detected binding of Tail-VLD but not VLD to tomosyn-N by in vitro assay using the purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 5D) and coimmunoprecipitation assay using HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S4B). These results also support that the tail domain binds the N-terminal WD40 repeats and that the affinity of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats is stronger than that to the VLD. Role of the Binding of the Tail Domain to the N-terminal WD40 Repeats in Regulation of the SNARE Complex Formation—Based on the above results, we reasoned that the N-terminal WD40 repeats had an ability to displace the tail domain from the VLD, leading to the VLD-mediated potent inhibition of SNARE complex formation. To test this, we examined the effect of the binding of the N-terminal WD40 repeats to Tail-VLD on inhibition of SNARE complex formation. The SNARE proteins were reacted in the presence or absence of His-VLD alone, His-tail-VLD alone, MBP-tomosyn-N alone, the mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N and His-tail-VLD, or the mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N and His-VLD, and SNARE complex formation was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-syntaxin-1 mAb. Consistent with the results using MBP-VLD and MBP-tail-VLD as shown in Fig. 2, His-tail-VLD moderately inhibited SNARE complex formation relative to His-VLD (Fig. 6). By contrast, the mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N and His-tail-VLD potently inhibited SNARE complex formation as much as His-VLD. These results indicate that the N-terminal WD40 repeats displaces the tail domain from the VLD, leading to the VLD-mediated potent inhibition of the SNARE complex formation. Roles of the Reciprocal Bindings of the Tail Domain to the N-terminal WD40 Repeats and the VLD in Regulation of Neurotransmitter Release—We electrophysiologically characterized the interactions of the tail domain with the VLD and the N-terminal WD40 repeats. Various combinations of tomosyn fragments were microinjected into SCG neurons and acetylcholine release was monitored by recording EPSPs. Whereas microinjection of MBP-VLD alone potently inhibited acetylcholine release, microinjection of the mixture of His-tail and MBP-VLD slightly inhibited acetylcholine release (Fig. 7). Microinjection of His-tail alone had no influence on acetylcholine release. These results indicate that the inhibitory activity of MBP-VLD is inhibited by its binding to the His-tail, and are in good agreement with the biochemical results that the inhibitory activity of the VLD on SNARE complex formation is reduced by its binding to the tail domain as shown in Fig. 4C. Moreover, microinjection of the mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N, His-tail, and MBP-VLD inhibited acetylcholine release more than microinjection of the mixture of His-tail and MBP-VLD, indicating that binding of MBP-tomosyn-N to His-tail displaces His-tail from MBP-VLD, resulting in restoration of the inhibitory activity of MBP-VLD. These results are in good agreement with the biochemical results that the binding of the N-terminal WD40 repeats to the tail domain restores the inhibitory activity of the VLD on SNARE complex formation as shown in Fig. 6. Taken together, these results indicate that the reciprocal intramolecular interactions of the tail domain with the VLD and N-terminal WD40 repeats control the inhibitory activity of tomosyn on the SNARE complex formation, leading to regulation of neurotransmitter release. We recently reported that the N-terminal WD40 repeats inhibit neurotransmitter release through oligomerization of the SNARE complex (26Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, microinjection of MBP-tomosyn-N alone potently inhibited acetylcholine release (supplemental Fig. S6). The mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N, His-tail, and MBP-VLD inhibited acetylcholine release less than MBP-tomosyn-N alone. Therefore, the inhibitory activity of the N-terminal WD40 repeats may be modulated via its binding to the tail domain. In this study, we biochemically and electrophysiologically demonstrated that the tail domain of tomosyn acts as a regulatory domain for the VLD. The tail domain directly binds to the VLD, and thereby represses the VLD-mediated inhibition of SNARE complex formation. Binding of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats restores the repressed VLD-mediated inhibition of SNARE complex formation. Tomosyn might be in a state of equilibrium between two conformational states upon the tail domain binding (Fig. 8). In one conformational state (state I), the tail domain binds the N-terminal WD40 repeats, leading to exposure of the VLD. The exposed VLD efficiently forms the tomosyn complex with t-SNAREs, resulting in the potent inhibition of SNARE complex formation. In the other conformational state (state II), the tail domain masks the VLD and thereby blocks tomosyn complex formation, resulting in loss of the inhibition of the SNARE complex formation. In support of the idea of equilibrium, full-length tomosyn moderately inhibited SNARE complex formation relative to the VLD alone in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that full-length tomosyn exists in both forms (data not shown). MBP-tail-VLD but not MBP-VLD shows the vague migration on the native gel (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the surface charge of MBP-tail-VLD is variable presumably due to both binding and dissociation between the tail domain and the VLD. These results provide other lines of evidence that tomosyn is in a state of equilibrium between the two conformational states upon the tail domain binding. The binding affinity of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats was stronger than that to the VLD. Despite the existence of both the tail domain and the VLD in full-length tomosyn, full-length tomosyn inhibited SNARE complex formation more than Tail-VLD. Therefore, state I is probably a dominant state. What drives the conformational change from state I to state II? We previously reported that protein kinase A phosphorylates tomosyn, resulting in reducing the binding of the VLD to syntaxin-1 (25Baba T. Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1113-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein kinase A may be a possible regulator to drive the conformational change. Physiological meaning of the structural regulation of tomosyn upon tail binding still remains elusive. We recently generated tomosyn-deficient mice, characterized them electrophysiologically, and revealed that the tomosyn-deficient mice lacked short-term potentiation (26Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structural regulation of tomosyn may be important for short-term memory. We also reported that the N-terminal WD40 repeats have an activity to inhibit neurotransmitter release through oligomerization of the SNARE complex (26Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given that microinjection of a mixture of MBP-tomosyn-N, His-tail, and MBP-VLD into the SCG neurons inhibited acetylcholine release less than microinjection of MBP-tomosyn-N alone, binding of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats might modulate the activity of the N-terminal WD40 repeats to oligomerize the SNARE complex. Further studies will be needed for understanding the regulation of the conformational change of tomosyn. The N-terminal WD40 repeats of tomosyn shares similarity to the Drosophila tumor suppressor D-Lgl, its mammalian homologues M-Lgl1 and M-Lgl2, and yeast proteins Sro7p and Sro77p, which play important roles in polarized exocytosis by regulating SNARE function on the plasma membrane in Drosophila neuroblasts, mammalian epithelial cells, and yeast, respectively (13Wirtz-Peitz F. Knoblich J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 234-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, only tomosyn, Sro7, and Sro77 have tail domains and C-terminal VAMP-like domains, raising the possibility that structural regulation of those may be evolutionally conserved (27Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A recent structural study of Sro7 revealed that the tail domain of Sro7 binds the bottom surface of the N-terminal WD40 repeats, in good agreement with our results of direct binding of the tail domain of tomosyn to the N-terminal WD40 repeats (14Hattendorf D.A. Andreeva A. Gangar A. Brennwald P.J. Weis W.I. Nature. 2007; 446: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The study also suggested that binding of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats causes a conformational change of Sro7, and interferes with interaction of the N-terminal WD40 repeats with Sec9, a yeast counterpart of SNAP-25, leading to regulation of the inhibitory activity of Sro7 on SNARE complex formation (14Hattendorf D.A. Andreeva A. Gangar A. Brennwald P.J. Weis W.I. Nature. 2007; 446: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These are inconsistent with our present finding that binding of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats leads to exposure of the VLD, resulting in inhibition of SNARE complex formation. However, the solved structure of Sro7 lacks the C-terminal domain corresponding to the VLD. Therefore, involvement of activity of the VLD in the conformational change of Sro7 upon tail domain binding remains elusive, as mentioned recently (27Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Considering the evolutionally conserved molecular structure of Sro7, Sro7 may use the binding of the tail domain to the N-terminal WD40 repeats to regulate the activity of its VLD in the same manner as tomosyn. Future structural studies of full-length tomosyn and full-length Sro7 will elucidate these concerns. In summary, we propose here a structural regulation of the inhibitory activity of the VLD of tomosyn upon tail domain bindings, which plays an important role in controlling SNARE complex formation.

https://openalex.org/W2026561540,"The mechanisms by which prenatal events affect development of adult disease are incompletely characterized. Based on findings in a murine model of maternal transmission of asthma risk, we sought to test the role of the pro-asthmatic cytokines interleukin IL-4 and -13. To assess transplacental passage of functional cytokines, we assayed phosphorylation of STAT-6, a marker of IL-4 and -13 signaling via heterodimeric receptor complexes which require an IL-4 receptor alpha subunit. IL-4 receptor alpha-/- females were mated to wild-type males, and pregnant females were injected with supraphysiologic doses of IL-4 or 13. One hour after injection, the receptor heterozygotic embryos were harvested and tissue nuclear proteins extracts assayed for phosphorylation of STAT-6 by Western blot. While direct injection of embryos produced a robust positive control, no phosphorylation was seen after maternal injection with either IL-4 or -13, indicating that neither crossed the placenta in detectable amounts. The data demonstrate a useful approach to assay for transplacental passage of functional maternal molecules, and indicate that molecules other than IL-4 and IL-13 may mediate transplacental effects in maternal transmission of asthma risk."
https://openalex.org/W2108498652,"To determine how endogenously secreted beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) aggregates regulate synaptic functions, we examined effects of Abeta42 at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila larvae. Voltage-clamp recordings of synaptic transmission and optical analysis of vesicle recycling at presynaptic terminals show that expression of Abeta42 in neurons leads to a reduction of neurotransmitter release. However, expression of Abeta42 in postsynaptic muscle cells enhanced neurotransmitter release. Both effects are neutralized by Abeta antibody, suggesting a role for secreted Abeta42 peptides. Application of exogenously prepared Abeta42 oligomers leads to a reduction in synaptic responses, whereas mixed Abeta42 aggregates with mainly fibrils elicit an opposite effect by increasing synaptic transmission. Further analysis of long-term depression (LTD) confirms differential effects of different Abeta42 aggregates. Taken together, our data suggest that Abeta42 is secreted from neurons primarily as oligomers that inhibit neurotransmitter release and exert no effect on LTD. Whereas larger-sized aggregates, possibly fibrils, are major components secreted from muscle cells, which enhance synaptic transmission and LTD. Thus, different types of cells may secrete distinct forms of Abeta42 aggregates, leading to different modulation of synaptic functions."
https://openalex.org/W1982725690,"Background Research ethics consultation programs are being established with a goal of addressing the ethical, societal, and policy considerations associated with biomedical research. A number of these programs are modelled after clinical ethics consultation services that began to be institutionalized in the 1980s. Our objective was to determine biomedical science researchers' perceived need for and utility of research ethics consultation, through examination of their perceptions of whether they and their institutions faced ethical, social or policy issues (outside those mandated by regulation) and examination of willingness to seek advice in addressing these issues. We conducted telephone interviews and focus groups in 2006 with researchers from Stanford University and a mailed survey in December 2006 to 7 research universities in the U.S. Findings A total of 16 researchers were interviewed (75% response rate), 29 participated in focus groups, and 856 responded to the survey (50% response rate). Approximately half of researchers surveyed (51%) reported that they would find a research ethics consultation service at their institution moderately, very or extremely useful, while over a third (36%) reported that such a service would be useful to them personally. Respondents conducting human subjects research were more likely to find such a service very to extremely useful to them personally than respondents not conducting human subjects research (20% vs 10%; chi2 p<0.001). Conclusion Our findings indicate that biomedical researchers do encounter and anticipate encountering ethical and societal questions and concerns and a substantial proportion, especially clinical researchers, would likely use a consultation service if they were aware of it. These findings provide data to inform the development of such consultation programs in general."
https://openalex.org/W1991785165,"Ca2+ modulates the visual response in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In Drosophila photoreceptors, an increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ mimics light adaptation. Little is known regarding the mechanism, however. We explored the role of the sole Drosophila Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to mediate light adaptation. CaMKII has been implicated in the phosphorylation of arrestin 2 (Arr2). However, the functional significance of Arr2 phosphorylation remains debatable. We identified retinal CaMKII by anti-CaMKII antibodies and by its Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of CaMKII is greatly enhanced by okadaic acid, and indeed, purified PP2A catalyzes the dephosphorylation of CaMKII. Significantly, we demonstrate that anti-CaMKII antibodies co-immunoprecipitate, and CaMKII fusion proteins pull down the catalytic subunit of PP2A from fly extracts, indicating that PP2A interacts with CaMKII to form a protein complex. To investigate the function of CaMKII in photoreceptors, we show that suppression of CaMKII in transgenic flies affects light adaptation and increases prolonged depolarizing afterpotential amplitude, whereas a reduced PP2A activity brings about reduced prolonged depolarizing afterpotential amplitude. Taken together, we conclude that CaMKII is involved in the negative regulation of the visual response affecting light adaptation, possibly by catalyzing phosphorylation of Arr2. Moreover, the CaMKII activity appears tightly regulated by the co-localized PP2A. Ca2+ modulates the visual response in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

Moreover, the CaMKII activity appears tightly regulated by the co-localized PP2A. Visual transduction is the process that converts the signal of light (photons) into a change of membrane potential in photoreceptors (see Ref. 1.Wang T. Montell C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 454: 821-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar for review). Visual signaling is initiated upon the activation of rhodopsins by light: light switches on rhodopsin to generate metarhodopsin, which activates the heterotrimeric Gq in Drosophila (2.Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the GTP-bound Gαq subunit activates phospholipase Cβ4 encoded by the norpA (no receptor potential A) gene (3.Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H.

TRP is the major Ca2+ channel that mediates the light-dependent depolarization response leading to an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in photoreceptors. The rise of intracellular Ca2+ modulates several aspects of the visual response including activation, deactivation, and light adaptation (6.O'Tousa J.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 514: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For example, Ca2+ together with diacylglycerol activates a classical protein kinase C, eye-PKC, which is critical for the negative regulation of visual signaling by modulating deactivation and light adaptation (7.Adamski F.M.

Light adaptation is the process by which photoreceptors adjust the visual sensitivity in response to ambient background light by down-regulating rhodopsin-mediated signaling. Light adaptation can be arbitrarily subdivided into long term and short term adaptation and may involve multiple regulations to reduce the efficiency of rhodopsin, G protein, or cation channels. For example, translocation of both Gq (12.Frechter S. Elia N. Tzarfaty V. Selinger Z. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5571-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13.Cronin M.A. Diao F.

In contrast, short term adaptation may be orchestrated by modulating the activity of signaling proteins by protein kinases. Hardie and co-workers (16.Gu Y. Oberwinkler J. Postma M. Hardie R.C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1228-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an increase of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] mimicked light adaptation, leading to inhibition of the light-induced current. These authors also showed that light adaptation is independent of eye-PKC. Thus the effect of cytoplasmic Ca2+ to control light adaptation is likely mediated via calmodulin and CaMKII. The contribution of CaMKII to light adaptation has not been explored. CaMKII is a multimeric Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that modulates diverse signaling processes (17.Hudmon A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 473-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Drosophila contains one CaMKII gene (18.Cho K.O. Wall J.B. Pugh P.C. Ito M. Mueller S.A. Kennedy M.B.

Kinumi T. Tobin S.L. Matsumoto H. Comp Biochem. Physiol B Biochem. Mol Biol. 1998; 119: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26.Kahn E.S. Matsumoto H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, how phosphorylation of Arr2 by CaMKII modifies the visual signaling remains to be elucidated. Here we report the biochemical and electrophysiological analyses of CaMKII in Drosophila retina. We demonstrate that suppression of CaMKII in ala1 transgenic flies leads to a phenotype indicative of defective light adaptation. The ala1 flies also display greater visual response, suggesting a defect in Arr2. These results support the notion that CaMKII plays a role in the negative regulation of the visual response. Our biochemical analyses demonstrate that dephosphorylation of CaMKII is mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Importantly, we show that PP2A interacts with CaMKII, indicating that CaMKII forms a stable protein complex with PP2A to ensure a tight regulation of the kinase activity. Thus a partial loss of function in PP2A would elevate the CaMKII activity. Indeed, we show that mts heterozygotes display reduced prolonged depolarizing potential (PDA) amplitude. This PDA phenotype strongly suggests that Arr2 becomes more effective to terminate the visual signaling in mts flies. Together, our findings indicate that the ability of Arr2 to terminate metarhodopsin is increased upon phosphorylation by CaMKII, and the retinal CaMKII activity is regulated by PP2A. Recombinant DNA and Molecular Biology—cDNA fragments coding for two Arr2 peptides (Arr2-Ser366, SNAMKKMKSIEQH, and Arr2-Ala366, SNAMKKMKAIEQH) and autocamtide (KKALRRQETVDAL) (27.Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare) for expression as a terminal peptide of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Briefly, for each peptide, a set of oligonucleotides flanking with sequences ready for ligating into vectors with EcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites were annealed, and ligated with predigested pGEX-4T-1. The recombinant DNA constructs were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotides used were listed below. AA TTC TCG AAT GCC ATG AAG AAA ATG AAG TCC ATC GAG CAG CAC TAA C (Arr2-Ser366-5′), TC GAG TTA GTG CTG CTC GAT GGA CTT CAT TTT CTT CAT GGC ATT CGA G (Arr2-Ser366-3′), AA TTC TCG AAT GCC ATG AAG AAA ATG AAG GCC ATC GAG CAG CAC TAA C (Arr2-Ala366-5′), TC GAG TTA GTG CTG CTC GAT GGC CTT CAT TTT CTT CAT GGC ATT CGA G (Arr2-Ala366-3′), AA TTC AAG AAA GCC CTC CGC AGG CAG GAG ACC GTC GAT GCC TTG TAG C (autocamtide-5′), and AG CTA CAA GGC ATC GAC GGT CTC CTG CCT GCG GAG GGC TTT CTT G (autocamtide-3′). Recombinant pGEX-4T-1 constructs containing Arr2 or CaMKII were obtained by inserting the cDNA sequence generated by PCR, into the EcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites. In Vitro Phosphorylation—In vitro kinase assays were carried out according to Alloway and Dolph (28.Alloway P.G. Dolph P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 heads (or 30 retinas) from 1–3-day-old dark-reared flies were dissected and homogenized in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 ng/ml leupeptin, 5 ng/ml pepstatin, and 5 ng/ml aprotinin). Homogenates (1 μl) were added into the kinase reaction buffer (6 μl) containing 16 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with either Ca2+ (0.5 mm) or EGTA (2 mm). Phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min and analyzed by SDS/PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray films or subjected to phosphorimaging analysis (GE Healthcare). Alternatively, the kinase reaction was performed in the presence of cold ATP (200 μm), and the level of phosphorylated Thr287 or Thr306 was determined by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. Expression of CaMKII1–275 for in Vitro Kinase Assays—cDNA encoding the kinase domain (1–275 amino acids) of Drosophila CaMKII with added EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites was obtained by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 for expression as a GST fusion protein. For the kinase assay, affinity-purified CaMKII1–275 fusion protein was mixed with immobilized substrates in the presence of the kinase reaction buffer at 30 °C for 20 min. The incorporation of radioactive phosphate into substrates was analyzed by SDS/PAGE followed by autoradiography or phosphorimaging. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—Radiolabeled phosphorylated substrates were incubated with purified PP2A (Millipore, Billerica, MA) containing the A/C dimer in the phosphatase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Tween 20) at 30 °C for 20 min. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Protein bands corresponding to phosphorylated protein were excised and quantitated by liquid scintillation counter. Preparation of Fly Head Extracts and Western Blotting—Proteins in fly heads were extracted with the extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) as previously described (8.Popescu D.C. Ham A.J. Shieh B.H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8570-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein content of the extract was determined by BCA (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For quantitative Western blotting, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor® 680 goat anti-mouse IgG; Invitrogen) were used, and the signals were visualized and quantified by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Anti-Arr2 antibodies were a gift from Dr. Rangananthan (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) (29.Mishra P. Socolich M. Wall M.A. Graves J. Wang Z. Ranganathan R. Cell. 2007; 131: 80-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Rh1 rhodopsin antibody was from Development Studies Hybridomo Bank (University of Iowa). Monoclonal anti-PP2Acα, which recognizes the catalytic subunit of Drosophila PP2A (MTS) was obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Polyclonal antibodies for phosphorylated CaMKII at Thr306 were obtained from PhosphoSolutions (Aurora, CO), and the antibodies recognizing phosphorylated CaMKII at Thr287 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Pulldown Assays Using GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, plus a mixture of protease inhibitors). Bacterial lysates were incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Thermo Scientific) to recover GST fusion proteins according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Approximately 10 μg of immobilized GST fusion proteins (or GST alone) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with wild-type fly head extracts containing 1% Triton X-100 prepared as described above. Following incubation, the pulled down mixture containing GST fusion proteins and interacting proteins was briefly washed three times with lysis buffer to remove nonspecific binding proteins and analyzed by SDS/PAGE. GST fusion proteins and co-purified associating proteins were detected by Coomassie staining or Western blotting (30.Peng L. Popescu D.C. Wang N. Shieh B.H. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 1526-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Calmodulin-Agarose Binding—Fly extracts prepared with the extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 were incubated with calmodulin-agarose (Sigma) in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA, as recommended by the supplier. Following three washes, proteins that bind to the beads were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting. Generation of Anti-CaMKII Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with the GST fusion protein containing CaMKII382–490 (382–490 amino acids, CG18069-PA) expressed in bacteria. The rabbit sera were collected after the second injection and tested by Western blotting. The antibodies used for both Western blotting and immunoprecipitations were obtained after the sixth injection of the antigen. Immunoprecipitation and Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—Fly head extracts (300 μg of total protein) were incubated with anti-CaMKII antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were recovered by protein A-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific). Following three washes with extraction buffer, the immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS/PAGE or proceeded with an in vitro kinase reaction by incubating with 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing Ca2+ at 30 °C for 20 min. The kinase reaction was terminated upon the addition of the sample buffer and analyzed by SDS/PAGE followed by phosphorimaging analysis or autoradiography. Fractionation of Cytosol and Membranes—Fly heads were collected and homogenized in binding buffer. The membrane was separated from the cytosol following centrifugation at 14,000 × g (48.Byk T. Bar-Yaacov M. Doza Y.N. Minke B. Selinger Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1907-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cytosol and membrane (from approximately four fly heads equivalents, ∼25 and 16 μg of total protein, respectively) were analyzed by Western blotting. Electroretinogram (ERG) Recordings—ERG was performed on 3–5-day-old flies as previously described (31.Larrivee D.C. Conrad S.K. Stephenson R.S. Pak W.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 521-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A 300-Watt Halogen lamp (OSRAM) was used for light stimuli. The unattenuated intensity at the level of the fly was 810 μW/cm2. Both recording and ground electrodes were filled with Hoyle's solution. Orange and blue stimuli were generated by the use of Corning CS2-73 and 5433 filters, respectively. At each stimulus, the flies were first dark-adapted for 3 min and then given a blue light stimulus of various durations. The PDA amplitude was measured 70 s post-stimulation. Then a pulse of the orange light of the same duration as the preceding blue light was applied, and the peak amplitude was recorded. To ensure photoconversion of metarhodopsin back to rhodopsin, an orange light stimulus was given prior to the blue light stimulation. All of the recordings were made at 25 °C. The signals were sampled at 2 kHz with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1200A), and the data were acquired and analyzed in a computer with Axoscope (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fly Stocks—Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C in a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. The mtsXE2258 was obtained from Bloomington Stock Center, and the ras transgene was removed (11.Wang N. Leung H.T. Pak W.L. Carl Y.T. Wadzinski B.E. Shieh B.H. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The ala1 transgenic line, in which the transgene was integrated in the X-chromosome, was provided by Dr. L. Griffith (Brandeis University). The ala1 fly was crossed into the genetic background of cn, bw to generate white-eyed ala1; cn, bw lines. Identification of CaMKII in Retinal Extracts—CaMKII is critically involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of signal transduction in the nervous system. In particular, CaMKII mediates activity-dependent alteration of neuronal functions by modulating the function of receptors and ion channels. Drosophila has one CaMKII gene (18.Cho K.O. Wall J.B. Pugh P.C. Ito M. Mueller S.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) whose gene product has been implicated in the light-dependent phosphorylation of Arr2 in photoreceptors (25.Kahn E.S. Kinumi T. Tobin S.L. Matsumoto H. Comp Biochem. Physiol B Biochem. Mol Biol. 1998; 119: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26.Kahn E.S. Matsumoto H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the biochemistry of CaMKII in the eye and how it may contribute to fine-tuning of the visual response. To identify CaMKII in the retina, we first looked for proteins that undergo Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation. Experimentally, retinal homogenates from wild-type flies (W1118) were used for in vitro phosphorylation assays in the presence of radioactive ATP (28.Alloway P.G. Dolph P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, several retinal proteins were phosphorylated; however, only a broad band that migrates near 55–65 kDa (bracket) consistently displayed enhanced phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). This Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation was also observed in inaCP209 homogenates, indicating that phosphorylation is not regulated by eye-PKC (10.Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the 55–65-kDa protein that showed Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation is CaMKII, we first tested its enrichment by calmodulin-agarose. We performed calmodulin pulldown assays and show that calmodulin-agarose isolated phosphorylated 55–65-kDa protein (Fig. 1B, left panel, second and third lanes), supporting that this diffuse protein band may be CaMKII. Importantly, polyclonal antibodies raised against Drosophila CaMKII (Fig. 2A) recognized a band in the Western blot, which co-migrated with the putative phosphorylated CaMKII isolated by calmodulin-agarose (Fig. 1B, right panel). Together, we demonstrate the presence of CaMKII in the fly retina.FIGURE 2Characterization of anti-CaMKII antibodies. A, Western blot (WB) analysis. Anti-CaMKII recognized multiple polypeptide species in fly head extracts (lane 1), which were enriched by calmodulin-agarose (lane 3), but not by protein A-agarose, a negative control (lane 2). The specificity of antibodies was established as pretreatment with excess antigen greatly diminished the signals in the Western blot (lanes 4 and 5). Lane 4 contains CaMKII enriched by calmodulin-agarose, and lane 5 contains fly head extracts equivalent to the amount loaded in lane 1. B, anti-CaMKII immunoprecipitated CaMKII from fly head extracts. CaMKII was detected by autoradiography following phosphorylation by in vitro kinase assays (lane 2). In contrast, preimmune IgG did not isolate CaMKII (lane 1). The phosphorylated protein of high molecular mass (>104 kDa) may represent undissociated antibody-CaMKII complex. C, subcellular fractionation of CaMKII and phosphorylation of CaMKII at Thr306. CaMKII is present in both cytosol (left panel, lane 2) and membrane (lane 3) following fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast, Rh1 rhodopsin is only detected in the membrane (bottom panels). Lane 1 contains total fly head extracts. The level of phosphorylated CaMKII at Thr306 following in vitro kinase assay with Ca2+ (right panels, lane 6) or EGTA (lane 5) was similar. Lane 4 contains total fly head extracts. D, phosphorylation of CaMKII at Thr287 is greatly increased by Ca2+. Shown is a Western blot probing with antibodies specific for either phosphorylated Thr287 (left panels) or total CaMKII (right panels). The in vitro kinase reactions were performed in the presence of EGTA (lane 1) or Ca2+ (lane 2). Protein size standards are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Anti-CaMKII Polyclonal Antibodies Immunoprecipitate CaMKII and Recognize CaMKII by Western Blotting—As mentioned, we obtained antibodies against Drosophila CaMKII. Specifically, we immunized rabbits with a fusion protein containing a portion of the association domain, CaMKII382–490 (isoform A, accession: NP_726633; see Fig. 4B). This region of CaMKII is more divergent than the corresponding domain of the vertebrate CaMKII but is present in all predicted Drosophila isoforms. The predicted CaMKII isoforms consist of 490, 509, 516, and 530 amino acids in length with variations in the regulatory domain (32.GuptaRoy B. Marwaha N. Pla M. Wang Z. Nelson H.B. Beckingham K. Griffith L.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain of CaMKII encompassing an autoinhibitory and a calmodulin-binding site is important for modulation of the kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blotting using anti-CaMKII antibodies revealed multiple protein species of CaMKII near 55–65 kDa from the fly head extracts (lane 1), which can be enriched by calmodulin-agarose (lane 3) but not by protein A-agarose (lane 2). The specificity of our anti-CaMKII antibodies was supported by immunodepletion studies (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5); CaMKII signals in the Western blot were greatly diminished when antiserum was immunodepleted upon incubating with immobilized CaMKII382–490, but not with GST (not shown). The observed multiple species of CaMKII could be due to different protein isoforms, as well as phosphorylation states. Consistently, a monoclonal antibody specific for Drosophila CaMKII obtained by Takamatsu et al. (33.Takamatsu Y. Kishimoto Y. Ohsako S. Brain Res. 2003; 974: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) also recognized multiple bands in fly head extracts. The polyclonal anti-CaMKII antibodies were also evaluated by immunoprecipitation assays. To reveal immunoprecipitated CaMKII, which co-migrates with the heavy chain of the IgG in SDS/PAGE, we carried out in vitro kinase assays following immunoprecipitation to radiolabeled CaMKII because CaMKII is capable of autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2B, lane 2). We demonstrate that anti-CaMKII antibodies, but not the preimmune IgG, isolated CaMKII (Fig. 2B). Taken together, we identified CaMKII by both immunological and biochemical methodologies. Like its vertebrate CaMKII, Drosophila CaMKII undergoes Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation. CaMKII Is Detected in the Cytosol and Membrane—To investigate whether CaMKII is localized in the cytosol or associated with the membrane, we performed subcellular fractionation. Fly heads were homogenized without detergents, and cytosol was separated from the membrane by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2C (top left panel), we found that ∼60% of total CaMKII (lane 3) is present in the membrane fraction with the remaining 40% in the cytosol (lane 2). It is interesting to note the differential distribution of the CaMKII isoforms. As a control, Rh1 rhodopsin is detected predominantly in the membrane (bottom left panel, lane 3). Phosphorylation at Thr287 of CaMKII Is Elevated By Ca2+—It has been well established that CaMKII undergoes autophosphorylation at two residues in its regulatory domain, which critically modulates the kinase activity. The Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation at Thr287 of Drosophila CaMKII is important for its activation, because phosphorylation drastically increases its affinity for calmodulin leading to the Ca2+/calmodulin independent kinase activity (34.Wang Z.

https://openalex.org/W2091900230,"The characterization of new proteins will aid in our explanation of normal biology and disease. Toward that goal, we describe the initial characterization of the small protein rich in arginine and glycine (SRAG). Human and mouse SRAG are 248/249-amino acid arginine- and glycine-rich proteins that are widely expressed in tissues and cell lines. Two SRAG isoforms, SRAG-5 and SRAG-3, which are truncations of full-length SRAG, were also identified. Although all SRAG proteins reside in the nucleus, they were also found within the nucleolus. Localization within the nucleolus was regulated by the N terminus of the protein. Our initial studies indicated that SRAG can interact with RNA. Full-length SRAG protein levels were highest in resting cells and were reduced in proliferating cells. The reduction in SRAG protein that occurs in proliferating cells was mapped with inhibitors to the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. As expected, the overexpression of SRAG reduced the percentage of cells in the G(2)/M phase and increased cell death. In sum, we have identified a new and intriguing member of the nucleolar proteome."
https://openalex.org/W1966357058,"Quality control mechanisms during protein synthesis are essential to fidelity and cell survival. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) misactivates non-leucine amino acids including isoleucine, methionine, and norvaline. To prevent translational errors, mischarged tRNA products are translocated 30A from the canonical aminoacylation core to a hydrolytic editing-active site within a completely separate domain. Because it is transient, the tRNA translocation mechanism has been difficult to isolate. We have identified a ""translocation peptide"" within Escherichia coli LeuRS. Mutations in the translocation peptide cause tRNA to selectively bypass the editing-active site, resulting in mischarging that is lethal to the cell. This bypass mechanism also rescues aminoacylation of an editing site mutation that hydrolyzes correctly charged Leu-tRNA(Leu). Thus, these LeuRS mutants charge tRNA(Leu) but fail to translocate these products to the hydrolytic site, where they are cleared to guard against genetic code ambiguities."
https://openalex.org/W2053128630,"Background The Drosophila ovary is a tissue rich in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Many of the regulatory factors are proteins identified via genetic screens. The more recent discovery of microRNAs, which in other animals and tissues appear to regulate translation of a large fraction of all mRNAs, raised the possibility that they too might act during oogenesis. However, there has been no direct demonstration of microRNA-dependent translational repression in the ovary. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, quantitative analyses of transcript and protein levels of transgenes with or without synthetic miR-312 binding sites show that the binding sites do confer translational repression. This effect is dependent on the ability of the cells to produce microRNAs. By comparison with microRNA-dependent translational repression in other cell types, the regulated mRNAs and the protein factors that mediate repression were expected to be enriched in sponge bodies, subcellular structures with extensive similarities to the P bodies found in other cells. However, no such enrichment was observed. Conclusions/Significance Our results reveal the variety of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that operate in the Drosophila ovary, and have implications for the mechanisms of miRNA-dependent translational control used in the ovary."
https://openalex.org/W1992527768,"Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a frequent complication in immunosuppressive therapy. To better understand the molecular events associated with PTDM we investigated the effect of cyclosporine on expression and activity of hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha and 4alpha and on genes coding for glucose metabolism in cultures of the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1E, the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 and with Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. In the pancreas of untreated but diabetic animals expression of HNF4alpha, insulin1, insulin2 and of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was significantly repressed. Furthermore, cyclosporine treatment of the insulinoma-1E cell line resulted in remarkable reduction in HNF4alpha protein and INS1 as well as INS2 gene expression, while transcript expression of HNF4alpha, apolipoprotein C2, glycerolkinase, pyruvatekinase and aldolase B was repressed in treated Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, with nuclear extracts of cyclosporine treated cell lines protein expression and DNA binding activity of hepatic nuclear factors was significantly repressed. As cyclosporine inhibits the calcineurin dependent dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) we also searched for binding sites for NFAT in the pancreas specific P2 promoter of HNF4alpha. Notably, we observed repressed NFAT binding to a novel DNA binding site in the P2 promoter of HNF4alpha. Thus, cyclosporine caused inhibition of DNA binding of two important regulators for insulin signaling, i.e. NFAT and HNF4alpha. We further investigated HNF4alpha transcript expression and observed >200-fold differences in abundance in n = 14 patients. Such variability in expression might help to identify individuals at risk for developing PTDM. We propose cyclosporine to repress HNF4alpha gene and protein expression, DNA-binding to targeted promoters and subsequent regulation of genes coding for glucose metabolism and of pancreatic beta-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2167901693,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the amphiphysin-like orthologs, Rvs161 or Rvs167, are unable to thrive under many stress conditions. Here we show cells lacking Rvs161 require Cdc55, the B subunit of the yeast ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, for viability under heat stress. By using specific rvs mutant alleles, we linked this lethal genetic interaction to loss of Rvs161 endocytic domain function. Recessive mutations in the sphingolipid pathway, such as deletion of the very long-chain fatty acid elongase, Sur4, suppress the osmotic growth defect of rvs161 cells. We demonstrate that Cdc55 is required for sur4-dependent suppressor activity and that protein phosphatase activation, through overexpression of CDC55 alone, can also remediate this defect. Loss of SUR4 in rvs161 cells reinitiates Ste3 a-factor receptor endocytosis and requires Cdc55 function to do so. Moreover, overexpression of CDC55 reinitiates Ste3 endocytic-dependent degradation and restores fluid phase endocytosis in rvs161 cells. In contrast, loss of SUR4 or CDC55 overexpression does not remediate the actin polarization defects of osmotic stressed rvs161 cells. Importantly, remediation of rvs161 defects by protein phosphatase activation requires the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, Sit4, and the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits, Pph21/Pph22. Finally, genetic analyses reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of CDC55 and gene deletions lethal with rvs161, all of which function in endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2119016501,"Background The Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis Capitata (DIPTERA: Tephritidae) is a major agricultural pest in Argentina. One main cause for the success of non-contaminant control programs based on genetic strategies is compatibility between natural and laboratory germplasms. A comprehensive characterization of the fruit fly based on genetic studies and compatibility analysis was undertaken on two founder populations from the provinces of Buenos Aires and Mendoza, used in pioneering sterile male technique control programmes in our country. The locations are 1,000 km apart from each other. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the genetic composition of both populations based on cytological, physiological and morphological characterization. Compatibility studies were performed in order to determine the presence of isolation barriers. Results indicate that the Buenos Aires germplasm described previously is partially different from that of the Mendoza population. Both laboratory colonies are a reservoir of mutational and cytological polymorphisms. Some sexual chromosome variants such as the XL and the YL resulting from attachment of a B-chromosome to the X-chromosome or Y-chromosome behave as a lethal sex-linked factor. Our results also show incompatibility between both germplasms and pre-zygotic isolation barriers between them. Our evidence is consistent with the fact that polymorphisms are responsible for the lack of compatibility. Conclusions The genetic control mechanism should be directly produced in the germplasm of the target population in order to favour mating conditions. This is an additional requirement for the biological as well as economic success of control programs based on genetic strategies such as the sterile insect technique. The analysis of representative samples also revealed natural auto-control mechanisms which could be used in modifying pest population dynamics."
