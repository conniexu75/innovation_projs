https://openalex.org/W2025559409,Tobacco plants displayed ozone-type injury when exposed to mixtures of ozone and sulfur dioxide at subthreshold concentrations. The syndrome suggests synergism between ozone and sulfur dioxide that lowers thresholds to injury; exposure to the individual gases at the mixed-gas concentrations caused no symptoms.
https://openalex.org/W2011229145,"The archeological sequence in the Bisitun and Kangovar valleys promises to fill a number of gaps in the prehistory of this part of southwestern Asia. Ghar-i Khar should yield data concerning the degree of cultural continuity or discontinuity in the Upper Pleistocene and early Holocene ranges of prehistory. This cave site should also be helpful in gaining further insight into the climatic conditions during these times, and in particular on the prevalent fauna and flora (and the human use of them) at the close of the Pleistocene, when some groups may already have been leading ways of life foreshadowing the Neolithic. Ganj-i Dareh offers the opportunity of examining in detail what seems to be an early farming community at or very near the beginning of an important shift in methods of subsistence. The geographical position of this latter site may also be of unusual significance in studying the spread of the Neolithic; located as it is near the traditional route across the Zagros Mountains into Iraq, this site, as well as others in the region, may have played an important role in the diffusion of the new elements and methods to other parts of the mountainous zone. That is, within the broad ""natural habitat zone"" it may be useful to distinguish optimum areas of development and diffusion during the early phases of the Neolithic. Comparison with small sites like Tepe Asiab in the Kermanshah Valley (considered to have been a temporary encampment of clam collectors) may place such sites in their proper perspective as seasonally occupied satellites of more permanent villages such as Ganj-i Dareh; the same possibility is open for the later ceramic Neolithic phase now that the oldest level of Godin Tepe shows a community to which nearby sites on this time horizon can probably be related. However, it will require an intimate study of the two valleys as microenvironments, and comparison of them with each other and with the Kermanshah and Hulailan valleys, in order to reach a fuller understanding of the interrelationships of the various aceramic and ceramic Neolithic sites from the 9th to the 6th millennium. Again, only further exploration in the region will reveal whether the absence of recognizable farming-community sites in the Zagros region during the 8th millennium reflects a genuine hiatus or simply insufficient investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2043199029,"X-ray studies of sodium chloride near 20 kilobars were made in an attempt to verify the reported highpressure-stable, cesium chloride-type structure. Experiments employing extreme shear forces, elevated temperature, and various moisture contents have shown no indication of a second phase. A reexaminatino of the original x-ray evidence suggests that the data may be explained by lithium found in the apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W1993675113,"The ability of the lunar surface to support statically the Luna 9 copsule indicates that the surface can bear at least 5 x 10(3) dyne per square centimeter (10(-1) lb/in.(2)). Analysis of the landing dynamics, using available data, gives a lower bound of about 1 to 2 x 10(5) dyne/cm(2), but this estimate may not be conservative because of uncertainties regarding the shock-absorbing system used and the direction of the velocity vector at impact."

https://openalex.org/W2046491531,"Drawings used to illustrate replication of the DNA molecule [ 153 , 445 (22 July 1966)] were from the forthcoming book, The New Genetics , by the late Leonard Engel. Mr. Engel, a well- known science writer, was the author of The Operation, The Medicine Makers of Kalamazoo , and The Sea. The New Genetics is being edited by Edward Tatum and will be published by Doubleday early in 1967."

The neutral hydrogen is concentrated in the spiral arm regions, with but relatively small amounts near the center of the galaxy. Similar deficiencies have been found near the center of M33 and our galaxy, suggesting similar evolutionary processes in the three galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2071691454,Welding of olivine was demonstrated by grinding it in a ball mill in an atmosphere of about 2 Ã— 10-7 torr. Most of the sample adhered strongly to the container and grinding balls although adhesion in air is only slight. Similar adhesion should be expected on the lunar surface and may account for the roughness needed to explain the optical properties of the moon and the detail of the Luna 9 photographs.

https://openalex.org/W2091411554,"Soil that contained thirty parts per million of arsenic and a soil of similar type containing eight parts per million were transferred to a greenhouse. Oats and cowpeas were planted and samples of roots and tops were obtained and analyzed. In all cases the concentration of arsenic in the tops and roots was appreciably higher in the plants grown on the high arsenic soil although the tops had much lower concentrations of arsenic than did the roots. Portions of the soil from the low arsenic soil were then spiked with additional calcium arsenate and planted to cowpeas. Marked differences in germination and rates of growth were apparent. The addition of large amounts of calcium arsenate to gray light sandy loam soils may be expected to interfere seriously, sooner or later with the subsequent growing of such arsenic sensitive crops such as cowpeas, oats, cotton, and various grasses. 1 table."
