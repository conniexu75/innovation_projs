https://openalex.org/W2886785109,"An annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage-related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development. Dynamics of complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. This community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2886541918,"The coordinated expression of highly related homoeologous genes in polyploid species underlies the phenotypes of many of the world's major crops. Here we combine extensive gene expression datasets to produce a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of homoeolog expression patterns in hexaploid bread wheat. Bias in homoeolog expression varies between tissues, with ~30% of wheat homoeologs showing nonbalanced expression. We found expression asymmetries along wheat chromosomes, with homoeologs showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation, most often located in high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps toward neo- or subfunctionalization of wheat homoeologs. Coexpression networks reveal extensive coordination of homoeologs throughout development and, alongside a detailed expression atlas, provide a framework to target candidate genes underpinning agronomic traits in wheat."

Wang et al. looked for signatures of MBSs in this material by using scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the vortex cores formed by the application of a magnetic field. In addition to conventional states, they observed the characteristic zero-bias peaks associated with MBSs and were able to distinguish between the two, owing to the favorable ratios of energy scales in the system.

Chowdhury et al. show that thinner, smoother membranes can be made with an electrospray technique. Using high voltage, the two precursors are finely sprayed onto a substrate and polymerize on contact. The composition of the resulting membrane can be tuned on the basis of the proportion of the two components. At optimum conditions, the membranes appear to be better at desalination than current commercial reverse osmosis membranes. Science , this issue p. 682"

Yu et al. and Petryk et al. found in mouse and yeast, respectively, that modified histones are segregated to both DNA daughter strands in a largely symmetric manner (see the Perspective by Ahmad and Henikoff). However, the mechanisms ensuring this symmetric inheritance in yeast and mouse were different. Yeasts use subunits of DNA polymerase to prevent the lagging-strand bias of parental histones, whereas in mouse cells, the replicative helicase MCM2 counters the leading-strand bias.

https://openalex.org/W2887055365,"The chemistry of the carbonyl group is essential to modern organic synthesis. The preparation of substituted, enantioenriched 1,3- or 1,5-dicarbonyls is well developed, as their disconnection naturally follows from the intrinsic polarity of the carbonyl group. By contrast, a general enantioselective access to quaternary stereocenters in acyclic 1,4-dicarbonyl systems remains an unresolved problem, despite the tremendous importance of 2,3-substituted 1,4-dicarbonyl motifs in natural products and drug scaffolds. Here we present a broad enantioselective and stereodivergent strategy to access acyclic, polysubstituted 1,4-dicarbonyls via acid-catalyzed [3,3]-sulfonium rearrangement starting from vinyl sulfoxides and ynamides. The stereochemistry at sulfur governs the absolute sense of chiral induction, whereas the double bond geometry dictates the relative configuration of the final products."

https://openalex.org/W2885562630,"There is evidence to suggest that social isolation is associated with poor cognitive health, although findings are contradictory. One reason for inconsistency in reported findings may be a lack of consideration of underlying mechanisms that could influence this relationship. Cognitive reserve is a theoretical concept that may account for the role of social isolation and its association with cognitive outcomes in later life. Therefore, we aimed to examine the relationship between social isolation and cognition in later life, and to consider the role of cognitive reserve in this relationship. Baseline and two year follow-up data from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study–Wales (CFAS-Wales) were analysed. Social isolation was assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (LSNS-6), cognitive function was assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), and cognitive reserve was assessed using a proxy measure of education, occupational complexity, and cognitive activity. Linear regression modelling was used to assess the relationship between social isolation and cognition. To assess the role of cognitive reserve in this relationship, moderation analysis was used to test for interaction effects. After controlling for age, gender, education, and physically limiting health conditions, social isolation was associated with cognitive function at baseline and two year follow-up. Cognitive reserve moderated this association longitudinally. Findings suggest that maintaining a socially active lifestyle in later life may enhance cognitive reserve and benefit cognitive function. This has important implications for interventions that may target social isolation to improve cognitive function."

Grandjean et al. studied silver clusters in zeolites, using x-ray excited optical luminescence to monitor only the emissive structures (see the Perspective by Quintanilla and Liz-Marzán). Aided by theoretical calculations, they identified the electronic states of four-atom silver clusters bound with water molecules that produce bright green emission—thus identifying candidate materials for application in lighting, imaging, and therapeutics.

FMR1 is thought to reduce protein synthesis (translation) at synapses. In Drosophila oocytes, Greenblatt and Spradling found that Fmr1 loss leads to oocytes that generate embryos exhibiting neural defects (see the Perspective by Aryal and Klann). Ribosome profiling of oocytes identified a specific role for FMR1 in enhancing the translation of large proteins, including many associated with autism. FMR1 seems to help maintain translation of large mRNAs that otherwise condense into inactive ribonucleoprotein particles. This mechanism may underlie other causes of autism and mental dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2885778751,"Spatio-temporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatio-temporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the laser performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatio-temporal instabilities using wave-chaotic or disordered cavities. The interference of many propagating waves with random phases in such cavities disrupts the formation of self-organized structures like filaments, resulting in stable lasing dynamics. Our method provides a general and robust scheme to prevent the formation and growth of nonlinear instabilities for a large variety of high-power lasers."
https://openalex.org/W2887961350,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. The poor survival may be due to a high proportions of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) is highly expressed in a variety of neoplasms and is a potential marker for non-small cell lung cancer or ovarian adenocarcinoma metastasis. Nevertheless, the role of KIFC1 in HCC metastasis remains obscure. We investigated this in the present study using HCC cell lines and clinical specimens. Our results indicated that increased levels of KIFC1 were associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in HCC. In addition, KIFC1 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. This tumorigenic effect depended on gankyrin; inhibiting gankyrin activity reversed EMT via activation of protein kinase B (AKT)/Twist family BHLH transcription factor 1 (AKT/TWIST1). We also found that KIFC1 was directly regulated by the microRNA miR-532-3p, whose downregulation was associated with metastatic progression in HCC. These results denote that a decrease in miR-532-3p levels results in increased KIFC1 expression in HCC, leading to metastasis via activation of the gankyrin/AKT/TWIST1 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2885175055,"Keratin is the structural protein in hair, nails, feathers and horns. Keratin is recalcitrant, highly disulfide bonded and is generally inaccessible to common proteases. Only certain types of proteases, called keratinases, are able to cleave the peptide bonds within the keratin structure. Due to this outstanding activity, keratinases have potential application in industries such as livestock, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Yet, the process of enzymatic keratin degradation is poorly understood, affecting the development of industrial enzyme formulations that may require full or only partial modification or weakening. Here we investigate the dynamics of keratin weakening and hydrolysis, showing that the decrease in hair mechanical strength is associated with cuticle removal and damage to the cortex and complete breakdown is dependent on reducing agents. Proteases with keratinolytic activity were selected and applied to hair with degradation examined by mechanical, biochemical and microscopic techniques. The extent of keratin degradation was highly enhanced by the presence of reducing agents, principally sodium thioglycolate, exceeding 90% degradation within 16 h of enzymatic treatment. Application was extended to feathers showing that the findings are relevant to improving the use of keratinases in a variety of industries. Overall, the outcomes provide valuable insights into the keratin degradation process by enzymes for the optimization of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products and for livestock waste recycling among other important applications."
https://openalex.org/W2886946739,"The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with modern contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy among young women and men in Accra, Ghana. From September-December 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with 250 women and 100 men aged 18–24. We explored determinants of modern contraceptive use among males and females and unintended pregnancy among females. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and multivariable logistic regression were used. Participants had an average of three lifetime sexual partners, and 91% had one current partner. Overall, 44% reported current modern contraceptive use. In multivariate modeling, modern contraceptive use was associated with higher education compared to primary (AORs 2.1–4.3); ever talking with someone about contraception (AOR 4.7); feeling unsupported by a healthcare provider for contraception (AOR 2.2); and not feeling at risk of unintended pregnancy (AOR 2.7). While ≥70% of participants recognized most contraceptive methods, awareness of some methods was lacking. Nearly all respondents (91%) felt at least one modern method was unsafe. Nearly half of all females (45%) reported their last pregnancy was unintended, and 63% of females and 58% of males felt at risk for future unintended pregnancy. Women were more likely to experience unintended pregnancy if they had ever given birth (AOR 6.7), their sexual debut was 8–14 years versus 20–24 years (AOR 3.4), or they had 3–4 lifetime sexual partners versus 1–2 (AOR 2.4). Targeted interventions are needed to improve understanding of the safety of modern contraceptive methods, increase awareness of long-acting methods, and consequently increase modern contraceptive access and use."

https://openalex.org/W2887099960,"Arsenic, a naturally occurring element, contaminates the drinking water of over 200 million people globally. Chronic arsenic exposure causes multiple cancers including those originating from skin, lung and bladder, and is associated with liver, kidney, and prostate cancers. Skin is the primary target organ for arsenic toxicity; chronic toxicity initially manifests as non-malignant hyperkeratoses (HK) and subsequently advances to malignant lesions, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In this study, we evaluate the miRNA expression profiles of premalignant (3 HK) and malignant (3 BCC and 3 SCC) skin lesions from individuals chronically exposed to high levels of arsenic (59-172 ppb) in their drinking water in West Bengal, India. The lesions were histologically complex requiring histopathologic identification of keratinocytes to be isolated for RNA analyses. Keratinocytes were harvested using Laser Capture Microdissection and miRNA expression profiles were determined using TaqMan® Array Human MiRNA A Card v2.0. Thirty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed among the three lesion types analyzed. Two miRNAs (miR-425-5p and miR-433) were induced in both BCC and SCC relative to HK indicating their association with malignancy. Two other miRNAs (miR-184 and miR-576-3p) were induced in SCC relative to both BCC and HK suggesting selective induction in tumors capable of metastasis. Six miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-381, miR-452, miR-487b, miR-494 and miR-590-5p) were selectively suppressed in BCC relative to both SCC and HK. In conclusion, the differential miRNA expression was both phenotype- and stage-related. These miRNAs are potential biomarkers and may serve as therapy targets for arsenic-induced internal tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2887669487,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by deleterious expansion of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene and production of neurotoxic mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The key pathological feature of HD is a profound degeneration of the striatum and a loss of cortical volume. The initial loss of indirect pathway (D2) medium spiny neuron (MSN) projections in early stages of HD, followed by a loss of direct pathway (D1) projections in advanced stages has important implications for the trajectory of motor and cognitive dysfunction in HD, but is not yet understood. Mouse models of HD have yielded important information on the effects and mechanisms of mHTT toxicity; however, whether these models recapitulate differential vulnerability of D1 vs. D2 MSNs is unknown. Here, we employed 12-month-old Q175+/- x D2-eGFP mice to examine the detailed structural and functional properties of D1 vs. D2 MSNs. While both D1 and D2 MSNs exhibited increased input resistance, depolarized resting membrane potentials and action potential threshold, only D1 MSNs showed reduced rheobase, action potential amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Furthermore, D1 but not D2 MSNs showed marked proliferative changes to their dendritic arbors and reductions in spine density. Immunohistochemical assessment showed no loss of glutamatergic afferent inputs from cortical and subcortical sources onto identified D1 and D2 MSNs. Computational models constrained by empirical data predict that the increased dendritic complexity in Q175+/- D1 MSNs likely leads to greater dendritic filtering and attenuation of signals propagating to the soma from the dendrites. Together these findings reveal that, by twelve months, D1 and D2 MSNs exhibit distinctive responses to the presence of mHTT in this important mouse model of HD. This further highlights the need to incorporate findings from D1 and D2 MSNs independently in the context of HD models."
https://openalex.org/W2885783242,"Depression represents a condition characterized by cognitive deficits and neural dysfunction and has recently been correlated with microRNAs (miRs) and their respective target genes. The present study was conducted with the goal of investigating the expression of miR-192-5p and its target gene fibulin (Fbln)-2 in an attempt to evaluate their roles in the occurrence and progression of cognitive impairment and neural function in mice with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)–induced depression through regulation of the TGF-β1 signal transduction pathway. Verification of the targeting relationship between miR-192-5p and Fbln2 was provided in the form of initial bioinformatics prediction, followed by a further verification in the form of a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Normal mice and models induced by CUMS were assigned into various groups, whereas mimics, inhibitors, and small interfering RNA were introduced to validate the regulatory mechanism by which miR-192-5p regulates Fbln2 depression. Novel object recognition, tail suspension testing, and Morris water maze were all employed 28 d after transfection. Hippocampal electrophysiological recordings, Golgi staining, HPLC mass spectrometry, and fluorescence immunohistochemistry were performed to further evaluate cognitive function and neuron regeneration. CUMS-induced depression was determined to represent a predisposing factor for cognitive impairment and damage to neural function in mice, highlighted by novel object recognition, learning and memory abilities, population spike amplitude, synaptic transmission, cAMP levels, neuronal regeneration, and increased behavioral changes that resemble depression. Furthermore, increased Fbln2 expression, an activated TGF-βl signaling pathway, and decreased expression of miR-192-5p, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II were noted. Up-regulated miR-192-5p targeting Fbln2 acts to alleviate CUMS-induced depression by inhibiting the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, resulting in the enhanced cognitive function in novel object recognition, learning and memory ability, population spike amplitude, synaptic transmission, neuron regeneration, and alleviation of behavioral symptoms. The central findings of the present study indicate that up-regulated levels of miR-192-5p expression act to suppress activation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway by means of binding to Fbln2, thereby ameliorating cognitive impairment and strengthening neural function in a mouse model of depression.—Tang, C.-Z., Yang, J.-T., Liu, Q.-H., Wang, Y.-R., Wang, W.-S., Up-regulated miR-192-5p expression rescues cognitive impairment and restores neural function in mice with depression via the Fbln2-mediated TGF-β1 signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2886385071,"Objective Here, we applied a multi-omics approach (i) to examine molecular pathways related to de- and remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions; and (ii) to translate these findings to the CSF proteome in order to identify molecules that are differentially expressed among MS subtypes. Methods To relate differentially expressed genes in MS lesions to de- and remyelination, we compared transcriptome of MS lesions to transcriptome of cuprizone (CPZ)-induced de- and remyelination. Protein products of the overlapping orthologous genes were measured within the CSF by quantitative proteomics, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Differentially regulated proteins were correlated with molecular markers of inflammation by using MesoScale multiplex immunoassay. Expression kinetics of differentially regulated orthologous genes and proteins were examined in the CPZ model. Results In the demyelinated and remyelinated corpus callosum, we detected 1239 differentially expressed genes; 91 orthologues were also differentially expressed in MS lesions. Pathway analysis of these orthologues suggested that the TYROBP (DAP12)-TREM2 pathway, TNF-receptor 1, CYBA and the proteasome subunit PSMB9 were related to de- and remyelination. We designed 129 peptides representing 51 orthologous proteins, measured them by PRM in 97 individual CSF, and compared their levels between relapsing (n = 40) and progressive MS (n = 57). Four proteins were differentially regulated among relapsing and progressive MS: tyrosine protein kinase receptor UFO (UFO), TIMP-1, apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). The orthologous genes/proteins in the mouse brain peaked during acute remyelination. UFO, TIMP-1 and B2M levels correlated inversely with inflammation in the CSF (IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, TARC/CCL17). APOC2 showed positive correlation with IL-2, IL-16 and eotaxin-3/CCL26. Conclusions Pathology-based multi-omics identified four CSF markers that were differentially expressed in MS subtypes. Upregulated TIMP-1, UFO and B2M orthologues in relapsing MS were associated with reduced inflammation and reflected reparatory processes, in contrast to the upregulated orthologue APOC2 in progressive MS that reflected changes in lipid metabolism associated with increased inflammation."

Methods We used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to enroll 252 alcohol-using MSM in San Francisco from March 2015-July 2017. We examined heavy alcohol use patterns and conducted RDS-adjusted multivariable analyses to characterize correlates of hazardous alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Results RDS-adjusted prevalence of weekly and at least weekly binge drinking was 24.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Hazardous consumption was common; prevalence of mid- and high-levels of hazardous drinking was 11.4% and 29.9%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, identifying as Hispanic/Latino or mixed/other race; being moderately or extremely interested in reducing alcohol use; ever receiving alcohol treatment; using ecstasy; reporting syphilis diagnosis; and having more than 5 male partners were independently associated with hazardous alcohol consumption. Less hazardous consumption was associated with having a bachelor's degree or completing post-graduate studies; and not being in a relationship. Reporting chlamydia infection; being somewhat, moderately or extremely interested in reducing alcohol use; and having multiple male sex partners were associated with higher odds of at least weekly binge drinking. Lower odds of binge drinking were associated with completing post-graduate studies. Moreover, for the outcomes of hazardous alcohol consumption and binge-drinking, we observed significant interaction effects between race/ethnicity and interest in reducing alcohol, past receipt of alcohol treatment, use of ecstasy, syphilis diagnosis, and number of male partners. Conclusion Among alcohol-using MSM in San Francisco, heavy drinking patterns were common and independently associated with greater number of male sexual partners and sexually transmitted infections (STI). Moreover, significant racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities related to heavy alcohol use were observed and race/ethnicity modified the effect of the risk factors associated with these outcomes. These findings underscore the need to develop more MSM-specific interventions that jointly address heavy alcohol use and HIV/STI risk, as well as culturally-tailored and targeted strategies to alleviate health disparities."

Both humans and mice lacking IRAK4 expression do not respond to challenge from ligands for Toll-like receptors or IL-1 and IL-18 and are resistant to septic shock. Heterozygotes are normal, indicating that a single copy of the WT allele is sufficient for activity.

IRAK4 has two well-characterized domains: an N-terminal death domain, which is a homotypic binding domain that binds to other death domain–containing proteins, and a C-terminal serine-threonine kinase domain. Ligation of Toll-like receptors or IL-1 family receptors by their cognate ligands induces receptor dimerization, which causes aggregation of the TIR domains located on the cytoplasmic side of the receptors. This TIR aggregation forms a platform for other adaptor proteins, chiefly MyD88. MyD88 contains an N-terminal TIR domain that interacts with other TIR domains and a C-terminal death domain. Clustering of MyD88 then recruits IRAK4 through death domain interactions to the receptor complex, known as the myddosome. The IRAK4–MyD88 complex then recruits the kinases IRAK1 and IRAK2 to the myddosome. IRAK1 subsequently becomes modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which is readily observed by a mobility shift upon Western blotting (5Vollmer S. Strickson S. Zhang T. Gray N. Lee K.L. Rao V.R. Cohen P. The mechanism of activation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 by interleukin-1 and Toll-like receptor agonists.Biochem. J. 2017; 474 (28512203): 2027-203810.1042/BCJ20170097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the myddosome has been solved with the death domains of MyD88 and the IRAK4 and IRAK2 kinases showing an exquisite symmetric architecture that demonstrates the cooperativity of the complex and its role in potentiating signaling (6Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H. Helical assembly in the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex in TLR/IL-1R signalling.Nature. 2010; 465 (20485341): 885-89010.1038/nature09121Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). We have shown that IRAK4 trans-autophosphorylates to become a fully active kinase and that the death domain is important in regulating kinase activity in the cell (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L. Picard C. Puel A. Lin L.L. Rao V.R. Interleukin 1/Toll-like receptor-induced autophosphorylation activates interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 and controls cytokine induction in a cell type-specific manner.J. Biol.

Shan Y. Liu Q. Li Q. Shaw D.E. Li X. Wu H. IRAK4 dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation are induced by myddosome assembly.Mol.

Thus, the formation of the myddosome controls the autophosphorylation of IRAK4. Therefore, it follows that the autophosphorylation of IRAK4 fully activates the kinase to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The role of IRAK4 kinase activity in the control of TLR and IL-1 receptor–induced cytokines is the subject of much interest, as IRAK4 kinase inhibitors are potential therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancer (9Chaudhary D. Robinson S. Romero D.L. Recent advances in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) as a therapeutic target for inflammation and oncology disorders.J. Med. Chem. 2015; 58 (25479567): 96-11010.1021/jm5016044Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in vitro experiments show that overexpression of kinase-inactive IRAK4 can still reconstitute IL-1–induced NF-κB activation in IRAK4 kinase-deficient fibroblasts (10Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. IRAK4 kinase activity is redundant for interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase phosphorylation and IL-1 responsiveness.J. Biol.

Additionally, we have shown that whereas complete inhibition of IRAK4 autophosphorylation has minimal effects on IL-1–induced cytokines and MAPK and NF-κB signaling, it has profound effects on TLR-induced cytokines (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L. Picard C. Puel A. Lin L.L. Rao V.R. Interleukin 1/Toll-like receptor-induced autophosphorylation activates interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 and controls cytokine induction in a cell type-specific manner.J. Biol.

Recently, we demonstrated that cytokines produced by TLR signaling in monocytes are controlled by the IRAK4 kinase-dependent activation of the transcription factor IRF5 (11Cushing L. Winkler A. Jelinsky S.A. Lee K. Korver W. Hawtin R. Rao V.R. Fleming M. Lin L.L. IRAK4 kinase activity controls Toll-like receptor-induced inflammation through the transcription factor IRF5 in primary human monocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28924041): 18689-1869810.1074/jbc.M117.796912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of IRAK4 in IL-1 signaling is still not completely understood. Due to its central role in mediating inflammation, IL-1 has been the subject of investigation and therapeutic intervention for many years (12Schett G. Dayer J.M. Manger B. Interleukin-1 function and role in rheumatic disease.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2016; 12 (26656658): 14-2410.1038/nrrheum.2016.166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Use of anti-IL-1 antibodies has been shown to be of therapeutic benefit in several diseases, notably cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular disease (12Schett G. Dayer J.M. Manger B. Interleukin-1 function and role in rheumatic disease.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2016; 12 (26656658): 14-2410.1038/nrrheum.2016.166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The IL-1 receptor is expressed mainly on nonmyeloid cells, such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. IL-1 is produced by monocytes and macrophages upon detection of pathogens through TLRs, which are mainly expressed on myeloid cells. Activation of the IL-1 receptor then causes the secretion of cytokines and the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules that are essential to the inflammatory response in nonmyeloid cells. Due to the observed differences of the role of IRAK4 kinase activity in TLR and IL-1 signaling, we focus here on analyzing the role of IRAK4 in IL-1 signaling separately from TLR signaling. To better understand the differential contributions of IRAK4 scaffolding and the kinase activity in IL-1 signaling, we characterized the expression and biochemical activities of two naturally occurring variants, G298D (4Picard C. Casanova J.L. Puel A. Infectious diseases in patients with IRAK-4, MyD88, NEMO, or IκBα deficiency.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 24 (21734245): 490-49710.1128/CMR.00001-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and the compound mutant R12C/R391H/T458I (13Hoarau C. Gérard B. Lescanne E. Henry D. François S. Lacapère J.J. El Benna J. Dang P.M. Grandchamp B. Lebranchu Y. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Elbim C. TLR9 activation induces normal neutrophil responses in a child with IRAK-4 deficiency: involvement of the direct PI3K pathway.J. Immunol. 2007; 179 (17878374): 4754-476510.4049/jimmunol.179.7.4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In both cases, the patients carry one null allele for IRAK4 and a mutated copy of the full-length protein. As one copy of IRAK4 is sufficient for normal innate immune function in humans, we initially sought to understand the molecular defects of these two variants that lead to innate immune deficiency. As both proteins contain mutations in the N-terminal kinase domain, we determined whether abnormal kinase activity was the reason for the phenotype of loss of signaling. Next, we examined the ability of the variants to form complexes in the cell with the components of the myddosome to determine whether loss of myddosome formation was the reason for loss of function. Further, we quantified the ability of these variants to reconstitute signaling and IL-1–induced cytokine production in IRAK4-deficient cells. Finally, we confirmed these findings in primary human fibroblasts using a selective IRAK4 inhibitor. We find that the IRAK4 kinase activity controls IL-1 signaling by regulating the formation and stability of the myddosome and that scaffolding function is essential for both assembly of the myddosome and IL-1 signaling.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the R12C dermal fibroblasts expressed an IRAK4 protein at the same molecular weight as that of the healthy (WT) control and at levels that, when quantitated and normalized to tubulin, were ∼10–20% that of the healthy control (Fig. 1B). No IRAK4 was detected in the P15 patient cells. Following stimulation by IL-1β, cytokine and phosphoprotein responses were only observed in the healthy dermal fibroblasts, and no cytokine or phosphoprotein responses were observed in either the P15 or R12C patient cells (Fig. 1, A and C). This indicates that the IRAK4 protein in the R12C patient cells is nonfunctional. To further characterize the IRAK4 protein expressed in the R12C patient cells, total RNA was extracted and made into ssDNA by reverse transcriptase. This library was then used to clone IRAK4 using primers to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the ORF. Following sequencing, two forms of IRAK4 were isolated, a full-length form containing three missense mutations, R12C/R391H/T458I (subsequently designated as the R12C compound mutation), and a form containing a premature stop codon at position 249 caused by a frameshift at position 240 that has been described previously (13Hoarau C.

To characterize the G298D mutation in the kinase domain of IRAK4 described previously (16Picard C. von Bernuth H. Ghandil P. Chrabieh M. Levy O. Arkwright P.D. McDonald D. Geha R.S. Takada H.

All of the full-length constructs were cloned with a C-terminal FLAG tag for ease of expression and isolation of the protein. The R12C compound variant and G298D variant were overexpressed in COS7 cells along with WT and the kinase-inactive D329A variant. Proteins were purified by anti-FLAG antibody chromatography and assayed for expression via Western blotting and for kinase activity as described previously (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L. Picard C. Puel A. Lin L.L. Rao V.R. Interleukin 1/Toll-like receptor-induced autophosphorylation activates interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 and controls cytokine induction in a cell type-specific manner.J. Biol.

The level of expression of the R12C variant correlates well with what is observed in the compound heterozygote R12C patient cell, which is 12% of the WT (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the R12C compound mutation is slightly less stable the WT protein. Importantly, the G298D variant was not detected in the cell lysate. Western blots of FLAG-immunoprecipitated protein showed that the G298D protein was expressed, but detection of the protein required immunoprecipitation of significantly more cell lysate (>10-fold) than either WT or the R12C compound variant (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the G298D variant is highly unstable and is degraded rapidly. We have previously shown that purified WT IRAK4 protein can undergo rapid autophosphorylation on its activation loop in the presence of 1 mm ATP and that these phosphorylation sites are easily detected by a phosphospecific antibody to pThr-345/pSer-346 of IRAK4 (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L. Picard C. Puel A. Lin L.L. Rao V.R. Interleukin 1/Toll-like receptor-induced autophosphorylation activates interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 and controls cytokine induction in a cell type-specific manner.J. Biol.

When FLAG immunoprecipitates of overexpressed FLAG-tagged IRAK4 variants were incubated with 1 mm ATP for 1 h, neither the G298D nor the D329A kinase-inactive variant were able to autophosphorylate as detected by Western blotting of phosphorylated IRAK4 (Fig. 2B). However, both WT and the R12C compound variant robustly autophosphorylated in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrate that the G298D variant, like the D329A variant, lacks kinase activity, whereas the R12C compound variant possesses WT kinase activity. To precisely determine the kinase activity of the variants, we overexpressed and purified the full-length R12C compound variant, the WT, and D329A variant from COS7 cells by FLAG immunoprecipitation. Kinase activity was determined by the DELFIA kinase assay described under “Experimental procedures” and previously (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L. Picard C. Puel A. Lin L.L. Rao V.R. Interleukin 1/Toll-like receptor-induced autophosphorylation activates interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4 and controls cytokine induction in a cell type-specific manner.J. Biol.

For each kinase assay, levels of IRAK4 protein were determined by Western blotting against a standard curve of recombinant IRAK4 to normalize kinase activity to protein concentration across experiments. In these assays, the R12C compound variant unexpectedly showed 50% higher activity than the WT protein (Fig. 2C). As expected, the D329A did not show any activity when assayed at levels equivalent to WT. We were unable to accurately determine the kinase activity of the G298D variant due to its low expression levels, but given its inability to autophosphorylate, it is likely that the lack of kinase activity is due to the protein being misfolded. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the G298D IRAK4 variant is kinase-inactive, unstable, and likely unfolded and that the R12C compound variant is enzymatically active and properly folded, albeit with slightly reduced stability compared with the WT protein. Analysis of the crystal structure of the kinase domain explains the reason for the catastrophic nature of the G298D mutation and the relatively benign effects of the mutations R12C, R391H, and T458I. Fig. 3A shows the position of the R12C mutation in the N-terminal death domain and the mutations G298D, R391H, and T458I in the C-terminal kinase domain. The Gly-298 residue is deeply buried in a hydrophobic interface between two α-helices in the kinase domain (Fig. 3B). The substitution of a bulky and negatively charged aspartic acid for the neutral and smaller glycine would be expected to significantly disrupt the protein packing of the kinase domain. Yamamoto et al. (17Yamamoto T. Tsutsumi N. Tochio H. Ohnishi H. Kubota K. Kato Z. Shirakawa M. Kondo N. Functional assessment of the mutational effects of human IRAK4 and MyD88 genes.Mol. Immunol. 2014; 58 (24316379): 66-7610.1016/j.molimm.2013.11.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have also examined the G298D mutation and showed reduced expression. In contrast, the R12C, R391H, and T458I mutations occur near the surface of the protein and would not be expected to be highly destabilizing to the protein (Fig. 3, C and D). It is likely that the reason for the loss-of-function phenotype in the G298D patient is that the protein is misfolded and rapidly degraded, thus behaving as a complete null allele. The cause of the loss of function of the R12C compound mutation is less clear. Despite the apparent stability and WT kinase activity of this variant, the expression level is ∼10–20% of the WT protein. To determine the ability of the R12C compound mutation to form an active myddosome, we performed reconstitution experiments of IRAK4 variants in IRAK4-null (P15) dermal fibroblasts. To control the relative expression levels of overexpressed IRAK4 in IRAK4-deficient cells, we created adenoviral constructs for the WT, D329A, and R12C/R391H/T458I IRAK4 variants and were able to quantitatively control protein expression by titrating multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the virus. IRAK4-null dermal fibroblasts were infected at multiple MOIs to test the ability of the different variants to reconstitute IL-1–induced cytokines, signaling, and the ability to interact with components of the myddosome. As shown in Fig. 4A, infection with increasing MOI of WT IRAK4 gave dose-dependent increases in IL-1–induced IL-8 production. Dose-dependent effects were also observed for the R12C compound mutation and D329A constructs, but at cytokine levels significantly lower than WT, indicating that both variants can reconstitute some degree of function at high levels of expression. A dose-dependent increase in protein expression levels with increasing MOI was verified and quantified by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). There was no observed effect of empty virus in the IRAK4-null cells when treated with IL-1β. When levels of cytokine induction were normalized for protein expression across multiple experiments, using IRAK4 expression levels quantitated from Fig. 4B, the kinase-inactive D329A variant reconstituted cytokine expression to ∼50% that of WT (Fig. 4C). The R12C compound variant was also able to reconstitute IL-1–induced IL-8 cytokine production to about 10–15% of the WT, indicating that despite the lack of activity observed in the R12C patient dermal fibroblasts, this variant still retains some activity at high levels of expression. We examined the ability of the IRAK4 variants to associate with components of the myddosome, the adaptor protein MyD88 and the kinase IRAK1, in IRAK4-deficient cells by immunoprecipitation. We infected the IRAK4-deficient cells to give equivalent expression of all of the variant proteins. Following FLAG immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, it was found that overexpressed WT IRAK4 was constitutively autophosphorylated in unstimulated cells, as described previously (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L. Picard C. Puel A. Lin L.L. Rao V.R.

The R12C compound variant was also constitutively autophosphorylated, albeit at a lower level than WT, but it did not associate with either MyD88 or IRAK1 either constitutively or following IL-1 stimulation. This behavior is likely due to the change of the Arg to Cys in the R12C mutation, the arginine of which forms a critical salt bridge interaction with residue Glu-102 in MyD88 (see Fig. 3B and Lin et al. (6Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H. Helical assembly in the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex in TLR/IL-1R signalling.Nature. 2010; 465 (20485341): 885-89010.1038/nature09121Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In support of this, Yamamoto et al. (17Yamamoto T. Tsutsumi N. Tochio H. Ohnishi H. Kubota K. Kato Z. Shirakawa M. Kondo N. Functional assessment of the mutational effects of human IRAK4 and MyD88 genes.Mol.

However, the fact that the R12C compound variant can still partially reconstitute IL-1–induced IL-8 at high levels of expression indicates that there is some residual interaction between the R12C compound variant and the myddosome that can drive a low level of IL-1–induced signaling. It is likely that the observed loss of function in the R12C compound variant patient is due to both the reduced ability to bind MyD88 and the reduced expression of the protein. As expected, the D329A kinase-inactive variant did not autophosphorylate, as previously reported (7Cushing L. Stochaj W. Siegel M. Czerwinski R. Dower K. Wright Q. Hirschfield M. Casanova J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2887515245,"Until recently, most phylogenetic and population genetics studies of nonhuman primates have relied on mitochondrial DNA and/or a small number of nuclear DNA markers, which can limit our understanding of primate evolutionary and population history. Here, we describe a cost-effective reduced representation method (ddRAD-seq) for identifying and genotyping large numbers of SNP loci for taxa from across the New World monkeys, a diverse radiation of primates that shared a common ancestor ~20–26 mya. We also estimate, for the first time, the phylogenetic relationships among 15 of the 22 currently-recognized genera of New World monkeys using ddRAD-seq SNP data using both maximum likelihood and quartet-based coalescent methods. Our phylogenetic analyses robustly reconstructed three monophyletic clades corresponding to the three families of extant platyrrhines (Atelidae, Pitheciidae and Cebidae), with Pitheciidae as basal within the radiation. At the genus level, our results conformed well with previous phylogenetic studies and provide additional information relevant to the problematic position of the owl monkey (Aotus) within the family Cebidae, suggesting a need for further exploration of incomplete lineage sorting and other explanations for phylogenetic discordance, including introgression. Our study additionally provides one of the first applications of next-generation sequencing methods to the inference of phylogenetic history across an old, diverse radiation of mammals and highlights the broad promise and utility of ddRAD-seq data for molecular primatology."
https://openalex.org/W2887845392,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-dependent visual cycle provides 11-cis-retinal to opsins in the photoreceptor outer segments to generate functional visual pigments that initiate phototransduction in response to light stimuli. Both RPE65 isomerase of the visual cycle and the rhodopsin visual pigment have recently been identified as critical players in mediating light-induced retinal degeneration. These findings suggest that the expression and function of RPE65 and rhodopsin need to be coordinately controlled to sustain normal vision and to protect the retina from photodamage. However, the mechanism controlling the development of the retinal visual system remains poorly understood. Here, we show that deficiency in ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) up-regulates the levels of rod and cone opsins accompanied by an increase in the thickness of the outer nuclear layers and the lengths of cone and rod outer segments in the mouse retina. Moreover, retinoid isomerase activity, expression levels of RPE65 and lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), which synthesizes the RPE65 substrate, were also significantly increased in the Cntf−/− RPE. Rod a-wave and cone b-wave amplitudes of electroretinograms were increased in Cntf−/− mice, but rod b-wave amplitudes were unchanged compared with those in WT mice. Up-regulated RPE65 and LRAT levels accelerated both the visual cycle rate and recovery rate of rod light sensitivity in Cntf−/− mice. Of note, rods and cones in Cntf−/− mice exhibited hypersusceptibility to light-induced degeneration. These results indicate that CNTF is a common extracellular factor that prevents excessive production of opsins, the photoreceptor outer segments, and 11-cis-retinal to protect rods and cones from photodamage. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-dependent visual cycle provides 11-cis-retinal to opsins in the photoreceptor outer segments to generate functional visual pigments that initiate phototransduction in response to light stimuli. Both RPE65 isomerase of the visual cycle and the rhodopsin visual pigment have recently been identified as critical players in mediating light-induced retinal degeneration. These findings suggest that the expression and function of RPE65 and rhodopsin need to be coordinately controlled to sustain normal vision and to protect the retina from photodamage. However, the mechanism controlling the development of the retinal visual system remains poorly understood. Here, we show that deficiency in ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) up-regulates the levels of rod and cone opsins accompanied by an increase in the thickness of the outer nuclear layers and the lengths of cone and rod outer segments in the mouse retina. Moreover, retinoid isomerase activity, expression levels of RPE65 and lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), which synthesizes the RPE65 substrate, were also significantly increased in the Cntf−/− RPE. Rod a-wave and cone b-wave amplitudes of electroretinograms were increased in Cntf−/− mice, but rod b-wave amplitudes were unchanged compared with those in WT mice. Up-regulated RPE65 and LRAT levels accelerated both the visual cycle rate and recovery rate of rod light sensitivity in Cntf−/− mice. Of note, rods and cones in Cntf−/− mice exhibited hypersusceptibility to light-induced degeneration. These results indicate that CNTF is a common extracellular factor that prevents excessive production of opsins, the photoreceptor outer segments, and 11-cis-retinal to protect rods and cones from photodamage."
https://openalex.org/W2885491418,"Background Thromboses is a rapidly growing medical problem worldwide. Low-cost, high-scale production of thrombotic drugs is needed to meet the demand. The production of biomolecules in transgenic animals might help address this issue. To our knowledge, the expression of recombinant human plasminogen activator (rhPA) in goat mammary glands has never been reported before. Methods We constructed a mammary gland–specific expression vector, BLC14/rhPA, which encodes only the essential K2 fibrin-binding and P domains of wild-type tPA (deletion mutant of tPA lacking the F, E, and K1 domains), along with the goat β-lactoglobulin gene signal peptide-coding sequence. The mammary gland–specific expression vector BLC14/rhPA was transfected into goat fetal fibroblast cells by electroporation. After selection for 3 weeks by G418, stably transfected cell colonies were obtained. PCR analysis results indicated that 24 of the resistant clones were transgenic cell lines; of these, 8 lines were selected as the donor cells. The positive cells were starved for 72 h with DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.5% FBS and were then used as do. Finally, 256 reconstructed oocytes were transferred into 26 recipients, and 7 of them became pregnant (pregnancy rate, 26.9%). Two kids were obtained (BP21 and BP22). PCR analysis confirmed that both were transgenic goats. To analyze the heredity of the rhPA expressed in BP21 F0 and F1 transgenic goats, the F0 transgenic goat BP21 was mated with a normal male goat to generate an F1 transgenic goat. Enucleated metaphase II (MII) oocytes and positive donor cells were used to reconstruct embryos, which were transplanted into the oviducts of the recipients. Results Western blot results showed a specific 39 kDa band. The rhPA expression level in transgenic goat whey was about 78.32 μg/mL by ELISA. Results of ELISA and the in vitro thrombolysis test (FAPA) showed that specific activity of the rhPA in the milk of F0 and F1 transgenic goats was 13.3 times higher than that of the reteplase reference material. Conclusion Thus, we demonstrated that BLC14/rhPA was reasonably effective for expression in the mammary glands of transgenic goats, and was stably inherited by the offspring. This study provides the basis for the large-scale production of biological pharmaceuticals in transgenic animals. The expression of biopharmaceuticals by transgenic animals can be used for pharmacological research and bioactive analysis, and transgenic goats were demonstrated to be promising animals for the large-scale production of thrombolytic biopharmaceuticals."

This study evaluated the effects of a series of quinoxaline-derived chalcones against laboratorial strains and clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. Six molecules, namely N5, N9, N10, N15, N16, and N23 inhibited the growth of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv laboratorial strain. The three compounds (N9, N15 and N23) with the lowest MIC values were further tested against clinical isolates and laboratory strains with mutations in katG or inhA genes. From these data, N9 was selected as the lead compound for further investigation. Importantly, this chalcone displayed a synergistic effect when combined with moxifloxacin. Noteworthy, the anti-tubercular effects of N9 did not rely on inhibition of mycolic acids synthesis, circumventing important mechanisms of resistance. Interactions with cytochrome P450 isoforms and toxic effects were assessed in silico and in vitro. The chalcone N9 was not predicted to elicit any mutagenic, genotoxic, irritant, or reproductive effects, according to in silico analysis. Additionally, N9 did not cause mutagenicity or genotoxicity, as revealed by Salmonella/microsome and alkaline comet assays, respectively. Moreover, N9 did not inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. N9 can be considered a potential lead molecule for development of a new anti-tubercular therapeutic agent."

https://openalex.org/W2887634219,"The incidence of canine rabies cases in El Salvador has decreased in the last decade since the establishment of intense control programs, such as massive vaccination campaigns implemented by the Ministry of Health. Socioeconomic crises in recent years have limited the access to certain areas across the country and have impacted surveillance and prevention campaigns, which places the country at risk for a resurgence of canine rabies.We aimedto describe the spatiotemporal patterns of canine rabies and its association with critical social factors in El Salvador from 2005 to 2014.We included 459 cases of canine rabies. Several socioeconomic, demographic, and surveillance variables were modeled using a Poisson regression to evaluate their associations with the incidence of canine rabies. Spatial scan statistics were adjusted or unadjusted with covariates and applied to identify statistically significant clusters of canine rabies. Finally, a canine rabies risk map was created.A positive association and higher risk of canine rabies were found for low poverty zones, where it is suspected that urban slums contribute to ongoing rabies transmission (RR = 7.74). Violence had a negative association with rabies (RR = 0.663), which is likely due to reporting bias. Significant clusters were identified in all five epidemiological regions, and the Eastern region had the highest risk (RR = 50.62). The influences of the selected variables in cluster detection were confirmed by the adjusted analysis. Higher-risk townships were distributed from the Western to the Eastern regions of the country.Social factors are determinants of rabies in El Salvador and play a major role in national spatial patterns of the disease. There are high-risk areas for canine rabies across the country, and there were two persistent rabies foci during the study period. Examining the role of social factors can provide better insight into rabies in vulnerable countries, and socioeconomic factors can be key elements in developing better policies and interventions for rabies control."
https://openalex.org/W2887410137,"Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAHs) are known to degrade asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous inhibitor of NOS, and maintain vascular homeostasis; however, the regulatory pathways of DDAHs remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to define the role of transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in the expression of DDAHs and investigate the potential roles of NRP1 in regulation of blood pressure. Short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of NRP1 reduced the level and mRNA stability of DDAH1 but not DDAH2 in HUVECs, whereas overexpression of NRP1 increased the mRNA stability of DDAH1. Meanwhile, mesenteric arteries and lung vascular endothelial cells of tamoxifen-inducible endothelial cell–specific NRP1 knockout mice exhibited decreased expression of DDAH1 and slightly increased expression of DDAH2. Mechanistically, the regulation of NRP1 on DDAH1 expression is mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism involving miR-219-5p in HUVECs. Although the endothelial cell–specific NRP1 knockout mice did not exhibit any significant change in blood pressure at the basal level, they were more sensitive to low-dose angiotensin II infusion–induced increases in blood pressure. Our results show that NRP1 is required for full expression of DDAH1 in endothelial cells and that NRP1 contributes to protection from low-dose angiotensin II–induced increases in blood pressure.—Wang, Y., Wang, E., Zhang, Y., Madamsetty, V.

Termed arteriogenesis, this phenomenon proceeds via a complex combination of events, with nitric oxide (NO) playing an essential role. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of supplemental administration of NO donors, i.e., short-acting nitroglycerin (NTG) or slow-release pelleted isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), on collateral development in a repetitive coronary artery occlusion model in rats.Coronary collateral growth was induced via a repetitive occlusion protocol (ROP) of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in rats. The primary endpoints were the histological evaluation of rat heart infarct size and ST-segment elevation (ECG-analysis) upon final permanent occlusion of the LAD (experimentally induced myocardial infarction). The effects of NTG or ISDN were also evaluated by administration during 5 days of ROP. We additionally investigated whether concomitant application of NTG can compensate for the anti-arteriogenic effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).After 5 days of ROP, the mean infarct size and degree of ST-elevation were only slightly lower than those of the SHAM group; however, after 10 days of the protocol, the ROP group displayed significantly less severe infarct damage, indicating enhanced arteriogenesis. Intermittent NTG application greatly decreased the ST-elevation and infarct size. The ISDN also had a positive effect on arteriogenesis, but not to the same extent as the NTG. Administration of ASA increased the infarct severity; however, concomitant dosing with NTG somewhat attenuated this effect.Intermittent treatment with the short-acting NTG decreased the size of an experimentally induced myocardial infarct by promoting coronary collateral development. These new insights are of great relevance for future clinical strategies for the treatment of occlusive vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2886267534,"Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). It is usually administered with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), many of which are substrates of OCT uptake solute carriers (SLC22A) and MATE (SLC47A), P-gp (MDR1, ABCB1), BCRP (ABCG2), or MRP2 (ABCC2) efflux transporters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory potential of efavirenz towards these transporters and investigate its effects on the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of a known Oct/Mate substrate, lamivudine, in rats. Accumulation and transport assays showed that efavirenz inhibits the uptake of metformin by OCT1-, OCT2- and MATE1-expressing MDCK cells and reduces transcellular transport of lamivudine across OCT1/OCT2- and MATE1-expressing MDCK monolayers. Only negligible inhibition of MATE2-K was observed in HEK-MATE2-K cells. Efavirenz also reduced the efflux of calcein from MDCK-MRP2 cells, but had a rather weak inhibitory effect on Hoechst 33342 accumulation in MDCK-MDR1 and MDCK-BCRP cells. An in vivo pharmacokinetic interaction study in male Wistar rats revealed that intravenous injection of efavirenz or the control Oct/Mate inhibitor cimetidine significantly reduced the recovery of lamivudine in urine and greatly increased lamivudine retention in the renal tissue. Co-administration with efavirenz or cimetidine also increased the AUC0-∞ value and reduced total body clearance of lamivudine. These data suggest that efavirenz is a potent inhibitor of OCT/Oct and MATE/Mate transporters. Consequently, it can engage in drug-drug interactions that reduce renal excretion of co-administered substrates and enhance their retention in the kidneys, potentially compromising therapeutic safety."

Glycosylation sites and glycan composition/structure at each site on gp120 along with the interactions of gp120 glycan shield with broadly neutralizing antibodies have been extensively studied. However, a method for directly and selectively tracking gp120 glycans has been lacking. Here, we integrate metabolic labeling and click chemistry technology with recombinant gp120 expression to demonstrate that gp120 glycans could be specifically labeled and directly detected. Selective labeling of gp120 by N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz) and N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) incorporation into the gp120 glycan shield was characterized by MS of tryptic glycopeptides. By using metabolically labeled gp120, we investigated the impact of gp120 glycosylation on its interaction with host cells and demonstrated that oligomannose enrichment and sialic acid deficiency drastically enhanced gp120 uptake by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Collectively, our data reveal an effective labeling and detection method for gp120, serving as a tool for functional characterization of the gp120 glycans and potentially other glycosylated proteins."

Six F1 HxG and six Gyr cows with 130 days in milking (DIM) fed corn silage and concentrate were evaluated. The experiment consisted of four periods with different levels of feeding: 1st ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI) and the others with 5, 10 and 20% restricted DMI, related to the first one. An apparent digestibility assay was performed before measurements in the respiration chamber. Total feces were collected for three days. The cows were confined for 24h in the chamber in each period to determine methane and heat production (HP). F1 HxG had higher gross energy intake (GEI), metabolisable energy intake (MEI) and digestible energy intake (DEI). GE lost in feces was higher in F1 HxG (23.7% GEI) than in Gyr (20.5%) cows. Energy lost as methane and urine was similar between the groups. The metabolisability (q) was 0.67, and the efficiency of converting ME to NE (k) was 0.56. There was no difference in the energy requirements for maintenance between breeds (426.6 MJ/kg BW0,75 average value). The energy requirements for lactation were higher in F1 HxG animals due to the higher volume of milk produced, since there was no difference in energy requirements for production of one kg of milk."

Demographic, clinical, laboratory and anthropometric data were collected. Serum PGRN was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after overnight fasting. Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire validated for Brazilian southern population. Focused principal component analyses (FPCA) was used to verify the association of dietary components and food groups with PGRN levels. Sensitivity analyses were performed including only subjects with reporting according to the Goldberg and Black cut-offs of energy intake-energy expenditure ratio between 0.76 and 1.24.The median PGRN was 51.96 (42.18 to 68.30) ng/mL. Analyzing all sample, the FPCA showed no association of serum PGRN with total energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat and its types, fiber intake and dietary glycemic index; but a significant and positive association between solid fats and PGRN levels (p<0.05). Including only subjects with reporting according cut-off of energy intake-energy expenditure ratio between 0.76 and 1.24, FCPA showed significant and positive association of serum PGRN with saturated fatty acids and solid fats intake (p<0.05). In this subgroup, PGRN correlated with saturated fatty acids (r = 0.341; p = 0.031). Solid fats intake was independently associated to serum PGRN (beta = 0.294; p = 0.004) in multivariate model.The dietary intake of solid fats, mainly represented by saturated fatty acids, is associated to serum PGRN concentration in human subjects."

Here, we used chromatin-associated RNA immunoprecipitation (CARIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (CARIP-Seq) to survey RNAs associated with H4K20me3- and H3K4me3-marked chromatin on a global scale in embryonic stem (ES) cells. We identified thousands of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs that associate with H4K20me3- and H3K4me3-marked chromatin. H4K20me3- and H3K4me3-interacting RNAs are involved in chromatin organization and modification and RNA processing, whereas H4K20me3-only RNAs are involved in cell motility and differentiation, and H3K4me3-only RNAs are involved in metabolic processes and RNA processing. Expression of H3K4me3-associated RNAs is enriched in ES cells, whereas expression of H4K20me3-associated RNAs is enriched in ES cells and differentiated cells. H4K20me3- and H3K4me3-interacting RNAs originate from genes that co-localize with features of active chromatin, including transcriptional machinery and active promoter regions, and the histone modification H3K36me3 in gene body regions.

Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyping using Restriction Fragment Polymorphism was done.A total of 123 malaria cases (91 uncomplicated, 32 severe) and 100 controls were sampled. Their corresponding mean Hbs were 9.6, 9.3 and 11.2g/dl and geometric mean parasite densities of 32097, 193252 and 0 parasites/ml respectively.

When dividing plentiful, low-value resources, in contrast, children expect people to share equally with friends and siblings. Even when distributing limited resources-one instead of many-and distributing to their own social partners rather than fictional characters, children share more with kin and friends than with strangers but do not favor kin over friends until 5.5 years of age. However, no study has tested whether children would preferentially benefit kin if the rewards require that children incur a higher personal cost of their own time and effort. In the present experiment, therefore, we asked if children would work harder for kin over non-kin when playing a challenging geometry game that allowed them to earn rewards for others. We found that 4.5-year-old children calibrated their time and effort in the game differently according to who received the rewards-they played for more trials and answered more trials correctly for kin over non-kin, but 5.5-year-old children did not. The older children may have found the task easier and less costly or may have different social experiences affecting their efforts to benefit others. Nonetheless, 4.5-year-old children's social decisions favored kin as recipients of their generosity."

Two managers and thirteen physicians (from four community health centers and stations) participated. The data were analyzed using a thematic inductive analysis approach.Based on our interviews, most of the physicians were not fully trained as general practitioners but still assumed the duties of that position; they were supposed to eventually become fully trained in line with the reforms of the Chinese primary care system. However, they reported a lack of in-service training opportunities to fulfill this goal. Even those who said that they had such opportunities perceived the efficacy of that training as being poor. The managers and most of the physicians reacted positively to the idea of using augmented reality in continuing professional development, and they suggested antibiotics treatment, surgery, and emergency care as learning areas in which augmented reality could be applied.Due to the Chinese reforms of the primary care system, both managers and the physicians themselves expect general practitioners to become qualified by engaging in continuing professional development.

https://openalex.org/W2887743083,"The synapse between auditory Johnston's Organ neurons (JONs) and the giant fiber (GF) of Drosophila is structurally mixed, being composed of cholinergic chemical synapses and Neurobiotin- (NB) permeable gap junctions, which consist of the innexin Shaking-B (ShakB). Previous observations showed that misexpression of one ShakB isoform, ShakB(N+16), in a subset of JONs that do not normally form gap junctions results in their de novo dye coupling to the GF. Misexpression of the transcription factor Engrailed (En) in these neurons also has this effect, and in addition causes the formation of new chemical synapses. These results, along with earlier studies suggesting that gap junctions are required for the development of some chemical synapses, led to the hypothesis that ShakB would, like En, have an instructive effect on the distribution of mixed chemical/electrical contacts. To test this, we first confirmed quantitatively that ShakB(N+16) misexpression increased the dye-coupling of JONs with the GF, indicating the formation of ectopic gap junctions. Conversely, expression of the 'incorrect' isoform, ShakB(N), abolished dye coupling. Immunocytochemistry of the ShakB protein showed that ShakB(N+16) increased gap junctional plaques in JON axons but ShakB(N) did not. To test our hypothesis, fluorescently-labeled presynaptic active zone protein (Brp) was expressed in JONs and the changes in its distribution on the GF dendrites was assayed with confocal microscopy in animals with misexpression of ShakB(N+16), ShakB(N) or, as a positive control, En. Using different methods of image analysis, we confirmed our previous result that En misexpression increased the chemical synapses with the GF and the amount of GF medial dendrite branching. However, contrary to our hypothesis, misexpression of ShakB did not increase these parameters. Immunostaining showed no association between presynaptic active zones and the new ShakB plaques, further evidence against the hypothesis. We conclude that both subsets of JON form chemical synapses onto the GF dendrites but only one population forms gap junctions, comprised of ShakB(N+16). Misexpression of this isoform in all JONs does not instruct the formation of new mixed chemical/electrical synapses, but results in the insertion of new gap junctions, presumably at the sites of existing chemical synaptic contacts with the GF."

We tested the cutting of synthetic hairpins containing all possible combinations of dinucleotides following the recognition site and our results show that all sequences containing one adenine following GGATG were digested more efficiently. We further show that the same sequence preference is also observable in double stranded DNA at higher Mg2+ concentrations and even in optimal conditions. Kinetic results show that BtsCI has a noteworthy difference in the first-rate constants between different sequences and between the two catalytic domains. An increase in Mg2+ resulted in a drastic decrease in the catalytic activity of the top (sense) strand that wasn't always accompanied by a nick in the bottom strand (antisense)."

Firstly, we construct a smaller representative dataset on which sparse spectral clustering is performed. Then the labels of ground object are extending to whole dataset based on the local information according to two extending strategies. The first one is that the local interpolation is utilized to improve the extension of the clustering result. The other one is that the label extension is turned to a problem of subspace embedding, and is fulfilled by locally linear embedding (LLE). Several experiments on HSIs demonstrated that the proposed algorithms are effective for HSIs clustering."

Ever since my first experience as a teaching assistant in graduate school, I've looked forward to the day I would be the person standing behind that podium. Now that I'm there, I can't shake the feeling that some cosmic accident delivered me. What qualifies me to stand in front of a classroom and explain the mysteries of biology to hundreds of eager students? Three recently earned letters behind my name? A carefully ironed blue Oxford?

In my classes, I preach the gospel of facts and data. But intellectual knowledge and emotional conviction don't always match up. I've spent immeasurable hours convincing my students and peers that they are qualified, that they are good enough, that they are extraordinary. I worry that I may be the exception. Am I a qualified biologist? Am I a good enough mentor? Am I an extraordinary teacher? My degrees and teaching awards should theoretically provide some evidence of my abilities, but emotional conviction remains elusive.

A few days later, as I lay in bed dwelling on my resume of perceived failures and shortcomings, my phone buzzed: an email from a former student. “Dear Dr. Maloy,” it read. “Your class was my very first college lecture. You made an amazing impression with your kindness, approachability, and encouragement. I discovered that I love learning about the molecular processes of life so much that I really want to continue learning more.” I smiled and dragged the email to my reminders folder, for reference in future moments of doubt.

Maybe I am faking it. Maybe students can see through my facade of confidence in class every day as I navigate a landscape littered with landmines of uncertainty. And in the expanse of the universe, my classroom is just an infinitesimal stage. But I cannot brush off the small dent my existence has made in the experience of one student. One student who sat down at her computer on a Friday evening to say that I made a difference.

The next morning at 8 o'clock, 360 students trickled into the classroom, the groan of folding plastic chairs announcing their arrival. I exhaled and allowed the clamor of the lecture hall to wash over me and drown out my doubts. I plugged my laptop into the projector and walked to the back of the classroom to greet the students.

https://openalex.org/W2887067296,"We propose a new approach, Bayesian Probability of Association (BPA) which takes into account the probability distributions of information and noise in the variables and uses Bayesian statistics to predict associations better than existing approaches. Our approach overcomes the limitations of linearity of the relationship and normality of the data, assumed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. It is different from the current measures of association because considering information separately from noise helps identify the association in information more accurately, makes the approach less sensitive to noise and also helps identify causal directions. We tested the approach on 15 datasets with no underlying association and on 75 datasets with known causal relationships and compared the results with other measures of association. No false associations were detected and true associations were predicted in more than 90% cases whereas the Pearson correlation coefficient and mutual information content predicted associations for less than half of the datasets."
