When enzyme secretion was stimulated by carbamylcholine or acetylcholine (with eserine) in slices of pigeon pancreas, the incorporation of P32 into the phospholipide fraction of the stimulated slices was, after 2 hours, 4.8 to 8.7 (average, 7.0) times greater than the incorporation of P32 into the phospholipides of control slices. Neither respiration nor the incorporation of P32 into acid-soluble phosphate esters was increased. 2. Pilocarpine, which on a weight for weight basis was much less effective than carbamylcholine or acetylcholine in stimulating enzyme secretion in pancreas slices, was also much less effective in stimulating the uptake of P32 into phospholipides. 3. The stimulatory effects of carbamylcholine on both enzyme secretion and the incorporation of P32 into phospholipides were abolished by atropine. 4. The specific activity of the phospholipides from slices incubated anaerobically was less than 5 per cent of that observed aerobically. Anaerobically, carbamylcholine did not stimulate the incorporation of P32 into phospholipides to any significant extent. The specific activity of the acid-soluble phosphate esters after anaerobic incubation was 34 per cent of that found aerobically. 5. Cholinergic drugs had little or no effect on the incorporation of P32 into the phospholipides of the following tissue slices: pigeon and guinea pig liver, guinea pig heart ventricle, pigeon gizzard (smooth muscle), and guinea pig kidney cortex. A relatively slight stimulation of P32 uptake into phospholipides was observed in slices of pigeon brain (65 per cent) and guinea pig brain cortex (40 per cent). 6. Stimulation of amylase synthesis in slices of pigeon pancreas by the addition of a mixture of amino acids had no effect on the incorporation of P32 into phospholipides."

https://openalex.org/W2026857114,"DURING the course of an investigation into the conductivity induced in insulating materials by X-rays, it was observed that the conductivity of a length of polythene cable that had been irradiated six months before showed very marked dependence on temperature. In the case of similar cable unirradiated the effect was much less pronounced. Two samples of unirradiated cable were tested."

https://openalex.org/W2005147184,"I HAVE already reported1 that some human urine specimens made strongly alkaline yield distillates presenting spectroscopic and polarographic properties of o-aminoacetophenone. This was interpreted as indicating the presence of kynurenine in human urine, since (1) o-aminoacetophenone is not present in untreated urine, and (2) no substance other than kynurenine was known to behave in the way described under the condition of experiment. Tabone's interpretation2, that the source of o-aminoacetophenone in human urine is tryptophane, was based on rather different and qualitative experiments."

Recent studies made by using lead salts labelled with thorium B1,2, and with radium D3, showed that the lead is mainly held by the erythrocytes. The present communication deals with the isolation of the component mainly responsible for the uptake of thorium B by the erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2081958011,"AN investigation of the carbohydrates present in the Victoria plum has revealed the presence of small amounts (c. 0.1 per cent fresh weight) of free xylose in the juice of ripe and immature fruits. The origin of this sugar is uncertain; it may arise from enzymic hydrolysis of a xyloside, but we consider this unlikely."

https://openalex.org/W2040767964,"The radioactive compounds to be observed when algae or green leaves are allowed to photosynthesize in C{sup 14}O{sub 2} for short periods are almost all phosphorylated derivatives of sugars. Of these, phosphate esters of trioses, sedoheptulose and fructose are the first to incorporate C{sup 14} followed closely by ribulose diphosphate, glucose-6-phosphate and a phosphate of mannose. It has been noted, in earlier papers of this series, that on radiograms of the products of photosynthesis, a dark area appeared in a position occupied by no known sugar phosphate and which gave glucose on acid hydrolysis or on treatment with a phosphatase preparation. This has hitherto been referred to as an 'unknown glucose phosphate'. It was found that this substance was more labile to acid than glucose-l-phosphate, itself a readily hydrolysable phosphate, and furthermore that other labile glucose derivatives were formed as intermediates during the acid hydrolysis. Accumulation of labeled glucose in this area precedes that in sucrose and suggests its synthetic relationship to sucrose phosphate synthesis."

We have now investigated this problem. Bone marrow from long tubular bones of domestic fowls, after removal of lipids with alcohol, acetone and ether, was extracted with physiological saline and then the extract was deproteinized with sulphosalicylic acid. After removal of excess sulphosalicylic acid with calcium carbonate, the filtrate was concentrated to a small volume. This filtrate showed a remarkable accelerating action on the blood coagulation."
