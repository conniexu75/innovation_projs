https://openalex.org/W2022840517,"Antisera against murine Son of sevenless (Sos) recognize a protein of M(r) 155,000 in rat-1 fibroblasts with specific guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward p21c-Ha-ras. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor coimmunoprecipitates with Sos from EGF-stimulated, but not quiescent, cells. The SH2 and SH3 domain-containing ""adapter"" protein Grb2 is also found in Sos immunoprecipitates in an EGF-inducible manner. In vitro reconstitution shows that Grb2 is required for the binding of activated EGF receptor to Sos. A phosphopeptide corresponding to tyrosine 1068 of the EGF receptor blocks both the assembly of the complex and EGF stimulation of nucleotide exchange on p21ras in a permeabilized cell system. These results suggest that EGF-induced activation of nucleotide exchange on p21ras proceeds through the recruitment of cytosolic Sos to a complex with EGF receptor and Grb2 at the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2018494368,"Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene transcription in vitro can be reconstituted with a minimal reaction containing only TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II (pol II) when the template is negatively supercoiled. Transcription from linear DNA templates containing either the IgH or the adenovirus major late promoters (MLPs) requires in addition TFIIF, TFIIE, TFIIH, and a fraction containing TFIIA and TFIIJ. Promoters vary in their activities in the minimal reaction. Initiation at the adenovirus MLP site was not observed in this reaction, even with templates containing negative superhelical density. When only TBP, TFIIB, and pol II were present in the reaction, the more negatively supercoiled the IgH template DNA was, the more active the transcription. It is suggested that the free energy of supercoiling promotes the formation of an open complex for initiation of transcription by the minimal set of transcription factors."

https://openalex.org/W2064426988,"CD45, a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), is required for TCR signaling. Multiple CD45 isoforms, differing in the extracellular domain, are expressed in a tissue- and activation-specific manner, suggesting an important function for this domain. We report that a chimeric protein in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD45 are replaced with those of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is able to restore TCR signaling in a CD45-deficient cell. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is necessary and sufficient for TCR signal transduction. Moreover, EGFR ligands functionally inactivate the EGFR-CD45 chimera in a manner that is dependent on dimerization of the chimeric protein. Inactivation of EGFR-CD45 chimera function results in the loss of TCR signaling, indicating that CD45 function is continuously required for TCR-mediated proximal signaling events. These results suggest that ligand-mediated regulation of receptor-PTPases may have mechanistic similarities with receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2020554721,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) DNA and messenger RNA sequences in both cell lines and blood obtained directly from HIV-1-infected patients were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and hybridized to fluorescein-labeled probes in situ, and the individually labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. After flow cytometric analysis, heterogeneous cell populations were reproducibly resolved into HIV-1-positive and -negative distributions. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the cellular morphology was preserved and intracellular localization of amplified product DNA was maintained. Retention of nonspecific probe was not observed. Analysis of proviral DNA and viral messenger RNA in cells in the blood of HIV-1-infected patients showed that the HIV-1 genome persists in a large reservoir of latently infected cells. With the use of this technique it is now possible to detect single-copy DNA or low-abundance messenger RNA rapidly and reproducibly in a minor subpopulation of cells in suspension at single-cell resolution and to sort those cells for further characterization."
https://openalex.org/W1500880970,"We previously identified a third type of the calpain large subunit named p94 as a cDNA whose mRNA is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle at levels approximately 10-fold more abundant than those of the conventional calpain subunit. Rat skeletal muscle fractions were screened by two anti-peptide antibodies raised against two specific sequences in p94, but the p94 protein could not be found. To examine this apparent discrepancy between the amounts of mRNA and protein, wild-type p94 was expressed in COS cells. Although p94 mRNA was expressed normally in COS cells, only very small amounts of the protein and its presumed degradation products were detected by the antibodies described above. A series of COOH-terminal deletion mutants was constructed and expressed in COS cells and L8 cells, a rat myoblast cell line. When IS2, one of the specific regions of p94, was completely eliminated, the truncated p94 proteins were expressed normally, and the amount of the expressed proteins was at least 100-fold higher than with wild-type p94. Moreover, when site-directed mutagenesis was introduced to change the presumed active-site cysteine of p94 to serine or alanine, the mutated p94 proteins were highly expressed like the IS2-deleted mutants. These results indicate the following. 1) The mRNA for p94 is normally transcribed in COS, L8, and muscle cells; 2) the p94 protein becomes active in the cytosol immediately after translation; 3) the p94 protein virtually disappears from cells by autocatalytic degradation; and 4) the p94-specific IS2 region plays an important role in this degradation. In vitro translation experiments support this idea. Furthermore, p94 shows nuclear localization when expressed in COS cells. The physiological function of p94 in muscle is discussed on the basis of the analysis of these transfectants."

https://openalex.org/W1988096153,"Antigen receptor genes are assembled by site-specific DNA rearrangement. The recombination activator genes RAG-1 and RAG-2 are essential for this process, termed V(D)J rearrangement. The activity and stability of the RAG-2 protein have now been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation. In fibroblasts RAG-2 was phosphorylated predominantly at two serine residues, one of which affected RAG-2 activity in vivo. The threonine at residue 490 was phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro; phosphorylation at this site in vivo was associated with rapid degradation of RAG-2. Instability was transferred to chimeric proteins by a 90-residue portion of RAG-2. Mutation of the p34cdc2 phosphorylation site of the tumor suppressor protein p53 conferred a similar phenotype, suggesting that this association between phosphorylation and degradation is a general mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1522344193,"Onconase, or P-30, is a protein initially purified from extracts of Rana pipiens oocytes and early embryos based upon its anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. It is a basic single-chain protein with an apparent molecular mass of 12,000 daltons and is homologous to RNase A. In cultured 9L glioma cells, onconase inhibits protein synthesis with an IC50 of about 10(-7) M. The inhibition of protein synthesis correlates with cell death determined by clonogenic assays. 125I-Labeled onconase binds to specific sites on cultured 9L glioma cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data shows that onconase appears to bind to cells with two different affinities, one with a Kd of 6.2 x 10(-8) and another of 2.5 x 10(-7) M. Each cell could bind about 3 x 10(5) molecules of onconase at each of the two affinity sites. The low affinity Kd is similar to the IC50 for onconase toxicity. Onconase also demonstrates a saturability of cytotoxicity at a concentration that would saturate the low affinity binding site. Incubation at 4 degrees C increased the binding of onconase to cells relative to 37 degrees C binding and also increased the sensitivity of cells to onconase toxicity, indicating that receptor binding may be an initial step in cell toxicity. Onconase cytotoxicity can be blocked by metabolic inhibitors, NaN3 and 2-deoxyglucose, and cytotoxicity is potentiated 10-fold by monensin. Ribonuclease activity appears necessary for onconase toxicity because alkylated onconase, which only retains 2% of the ribonuclease activity, was at least 100-fold less potent in inhibiting protein synthesis in cells. Onconase inhibition of protein synthesis in 9L cells coincides with the degradation of cellular 28 S and 18 S rRNA. In contrast to RNase A, onconase is resistant to two RNase inhibitors, placental ribonuclease inhibitor and Inhibit-Ace. Northern hybridization with placental ribonuclease inhibitor cDNA probe indicates that 9L glioma cells contain endogenous placental ribonuclease inhibitor mRNA. Based on these results, we propose that onconase toxicity results from onconase binding to cell surface receptors, internalization to the cell cytosol where it degrades ribosomal RNA, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing cell death."

https://openalex.org/W1564932287,"Stimulation of leukocytes with chemoattractant ligands activates phospholipid turnover and calcium release, ultimately leading to chemotaxis, degranulation, and the inflammatory response. The leukocyte response to these ligands is transduced by the interaction of transmembrane receptors with GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). To examine the mechanisms of signal transduction by these receptors, we transfected cDNA clones encoding the receptors for the active cleavage product of the fifth component of complement (C5a) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) into COS-7 cells, then measured the production of inositol phosphates (IP) in response to stimulation with these chemoattractant ligands. Cells transfected with the C5a receptor showed no increase in IP production when stimulated with ligand (5-120 nM). However, in cells co-transfected with these receptors and with the cDNA for G alpha 16, a G-protein alpha subunit that is specific to cells of hematopoietic lineage, addition of ligand caused up to a 5-fold increase in IP production. This interaction was specific, as co-transfection of receptors with the G-proteins G alpha q or G alpha 11 did not allow ligand-dependent increase in IP production. In contrast, ligand-dependent activation of IP production was seen in COS cells transfected solely with the PAF receptor. These results indicate that the C5a receptor utilizes signaling pathways distinct from the PAF receptor and suggest that a pertussis toxin-resistant G-protein, G alpha 16, may play a role in the leukocyte response to inflammatory ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1566257366,"We have recently shown that a template-associated protein kinase, which phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, is a two-component system. We describe here the purification of these two components to apparent homogeneity from human (HeLa) cell nuclear extract. Kinase component A has a 340-kDa native molecular mass, consists of a single large polypeptide, and contains the kinase active site. Kinase component B, which is identical to the Ku autoantigen, has a 180-kDa native molecular mass, and consists of apparently equimolar 67- and 83-kDa polypeptides. Component B stimulates the activity of component A, and under some conditions, confers DNA dependence on the reaction. The purified kinase converts the CTD to the multiply phosphorylated CTD0 form. Conversion occurs processively, and this processivity is an inherent property of component A. The in vitro phosphorylated CTD0 form contains approximately equimolar phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but no detectable phosphotyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W2139776404,"The translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction in IIC9 fibroblasts has been studied to define the functions of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) derived from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). alpha-Thrombin caused a biphasic change in DAG, with two peaks at 15-60 s and 5-15 min, derived from PIP2 and PC, respectively, while platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced a monophasic DAG increase from PC at 5-15 min. alpha-Thrombin also induced a rapid, but transient, increase of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cytosolic Ca2+, whereas PDGF did not. Three PKC isozymes, alpha, epsilon, and zeta, were identified by Western blotting in IIC9 cells and were mainly localized in the cytosol. A fraction of cytosolic PKC alpha was rapidly translocated by alpha-thrombin at 15 s, but its membrane association was lost within 1 min. PKC epsilon was also rapidly translocated; however, its membrane association was sustained for almost 60 min. PKC zeta was not translocated by alpha-thrombin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. PDGF translocated PKC epsilon at 5 min but had little effect at 15 s and did not translocate PKC alpha or zeta. Incubation with Bacillus cereus PC- or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which increased DAG but not phosphatidic acid, stimulated translocation of PKC epsilon, but not PKC alpha or zeta. Addition of chelators to inhibit the rise in intracellular Ca2+ largely blocked PKC alpha translocation induced by alpha-thrombin but had no effect on PKC epsilon translocation. Addition of ionomycin allowed alpha-thrombin to induce PKC alpha translocation at 5 min. PKC alpha translocation was mimicked by 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol plus ionomycin, but not by either alone. On the other hand, PKC epsilon was translocated by the DAG alone. These results support the conclusion that PIP2 hydrolysis activates both PKC alpha and epsilon at 15 s, whereas PC hydrolysis activates only PKC epsilon at 5 min. The differential activation at 5 min can be attributed to the failure of PC hydrolysis to increase Ca2+ and not to a difference in the molecular species of DAG derived from the phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1583208437,"Male sterility due to abnormal sperm morphology or motion has been widely reported, although relatively little has been published on the sperm nuclear protein abnormalities. We report the first cases worldwide of infertile patients having a complete selective absence of protamine P2 in the sperm nucleus. This provides a selective phenotype that will aid understanding of the mechanisms of synthesis, processing, or function of the P2 protamines. In addition, it is of marked immediate relevance to medicine as it allows the diagnosis of this type of human male sterility and the opportunity to understand the basis of this defect."

https://openalex.org/W1665138641,"The molecular mechanisms involved in the degradation of individual cellular proteins are probably unique and characteristic. We have investigated in rat liver the degradation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an abundant cytosolic enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. Immunoblot analysis of isolated liver lysosomes from rats treated with lysosomal inhibitors show that this protein is degraded, at least in part, by a lysosomal pathway. This pathway was further investigated by incubating the enzyme with lysosomes in a cell-free system, followed by proteolysis measurements, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lysosomes, and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. We postulate that the degradative mechanism of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase includes a temperature-dependent lysosomal pathway, different from classical nonspecific macroautophagy. The postulated pathway involves: binding of the enzyme to the lysosomal membrane, entry into the lysosomal matrix, and degradation. This cell-free system, which can also incorporate in vitro synthesized proteins, should allow further advances toward clarifying the complex signals that regulate protein degradation as well as its close interrelationship with protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1593795070,"A major in vivo substrate of Ca(2+)-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (MARCKS) shows phosphorylation-dependent translocation between the cytoplasmic and the membrane fractions. The mechanism of the translocation was studied with purified MARCKS and various membranes. MARCKS was found to bind to pure phospholipid membranes as well as to the synaptic vesicle membranes. Although the interaction of MARCKS with the latter was phosphorylation-dependent, phosphorylation by protein kinase C showed no significant effect on the binding to the phosphatidylcholine liposomes. However, when phosphatidylserine was included in the membranes, the association became phosphorylation-dependent. A synthetic phosphorylation domain peptide showed a similar phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the negatively charged liposomes. Phosphatidylserine but not phosphatidylcholine inhibited phosphorylation of MARCKS by protein kinase C. MARCKS seems to bind to the biomembranes through two binding sites: the N-terminal myristoyl moiety and the basic phosphorylation domain of amphiphilic nature. Phosphorylation of this domain lowers its affinity to phosphatidylserine and makes the whole molecule strongly negatively charged, which causes its dissociation from the membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1574519829,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gas1 protein is synthesized as a precursor with a hydrophobic extension at the carboxyl terminus which is removed and replaced with an inositol containing glycolipid that anchors the protein to the plasma membrane. We performed saturation mutagenesis on the anchor attachment site (Asn506) and showed that only a subset of amino acids with small side chains could act as substrates for peptide cleavage and glycolipid addition. After Asn, which is the most efficient anchor attachment site, Ser, Gly, Ala, Asp, and Cys function with decreasing effectiveness. Mutational analysis also revealed that the 2 adjacent amino acids to the carboxyl side of the anchor attachment site are important for efficient anchoring. These two amino acids should have relatively short side chains with the second position being more critical. Analysis of the region between the anchor attachment site and the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region indicated that this region may not simply perform a spacer function."
https://openalex.org/W1531287894,"The oligomeric structure of bacteriophage T7 gene 4 helicase/primase proteins was investigated using protein cross-linking and high pressure gel-filtration chromatography. Studies were carried out with both 4A' and 4B proteins. 4A' is a M64L mutant of 4A which has similar helicase and primase activities as the wild-type mixture of 4A and 4B proteins (Patel, S. S., Rosenberg, A. H., Studier, F. W., and Johnson, K. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15013-15021), and 4B is the smaller protein which has only helicase activity. Chemical cross-linking of 4A' and 4B proteins with dimethyl suberimidate resulted in cross-linked species ranging from dimers to hexamers and beyond. The cross-linking time course, however, indicated that hexamers were the predominant species to accumulate in both 4A' and 4B proteins. The effect of MgNTP and DNA binding on oligomerization of the gene 4 proteins was investigated using high pressure gel-filtration chromatography at increasing protein concentrations. In the absence of added ligands, close to 100 microM protein concentrations were required to form stable oligomers beyond dimers. However, in the presence of Mg-beta, gamma-methylene deoxythymidine triphosphate (nonhydrolyzable analog of dTTP), 4A' and 4B protein assembled into stable hexamers at protein concentrations less than 8 microM. Addition of single-stranded DNA further stabilized the hexamer structure. Therefore, in the presence of a 60-nucleotide-long single-stranded DNA, hexamers were observed at protein concentrations as low as 0.2 microM. Nuclease protection experiments indicated that the 4A' and 4B hexamers protect about 60-65 bases of single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1530397717,"Peripheral myelin protein, 22 kDa (PMP22), is a myelin molecule associated with Schwann cells in peripheral nerves (Snipes, G. J., Suter, U., Welcher, A. A., and Shooter, E. M. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 117, 225-238). Mutations affecting the PMP22 gene have been implicated in the trembler mutation in mice (Suter, U., Welcher, A. A., Ozcelik, T., Snipes, G.

L., Buchberg, A. M., and Shooter, E. M. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 4382-4386) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease in humans (Patel, P. I., Roa, B. B., Welcher, A. A., Schoener-Scott, R., Trask, B. J., Pentao, L., Snipes, G. J., Garcia, C. A., Francke, U., Shooter, E. M., Lupski, J. R., and Suter, U. (1992) Nature genet. 1, 159-165). In this report, we have studied PMP22 production in cultured rat Schwann cells. Schwann cells contain a 1.8-kilobase mRNA transcript coding for PMP22, and its production is up-regulated in vitro by forskolin. Metabolic labeling combined with immunoprecipitation methods using antibodies raised against synthetic peptides of PMP22 reveal that Schwann cells generate the protein from an 18-kDa precursor form which is post-translationally modified by N-linked glycosylation. A second molecule (molecular mass, 48 kDa) that reacted with PMP22 antibodies was also detected in Schwann cells but is not related chemically to PMP22 as determined by pulse-chase labeling. Metabolic labeling of rat sciatic nerve and Western blot analyses of purified rat sciatic nerve myelin reveal that deglycosylation of PMP22 gives rise to an 18-kDa protein similar in size to that in Schwann cells. These results indicate that cultured Schwann cells may provide a good model in which to investigate the production and function of PMP22 and to establish the cellular basis for the protein's involvement in inherited peripheral neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W1560373908,"The adenovirus (Ad) genome in virion exists in the form of the Ad core, which is a complex of Ad DNA and viral basic proteins. The Ad core supported only initiation and limited elongation in DNA replication in a cell-free system which was developed for DNA replication of naked Ad DNA. We found that addition of a cytoplasmic fraction from uninfected HeLa cells on the top of the system stimulated Ad core DNA replication, although it had no effect on DNA replication of naked Ad DNA. The factor stimulating Ad core DNA replication, designated as template activating factor I (TAF-I), was purified by successive steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, column chromatographies on phosphocellulose and Q-Sepharose, and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified fraction revealed the presence of proteins with molecular masses of 41 and 39 kDa. TAF-I stimulated both initiation and elongation in Ad core DNA replication. Judging from its behavior in purification steps, TAF-I could be acidic. These findings suggest that TAF-I stimulates Ad core DNA replication by interaction with viral basic core proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1529049840,"Aminium radicals have been proposed as intermediates in amine N-dealkylations and N-oxygenations catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) and some other enzymes. P450s can form some N-oxides and hydroxylamines but these are not favored whenever N-dealkylation is possible. However, if a paradigm involving 1-electron oxidation is valid, then some finite level of partitioning of aminium radicals between N-oxygenation and N-dealkylation might be expected in all cases. Methods were developed for the selective and sensitive measurement of N,N-dialkylaniline N-oxides using high performance liquid chromatography, radiochromatography, and TiCl3 reduction. These N-oxides were relatively stable in the presence of P450 2B1. In the presence of NADPH and NADPH-P450 reductase some reduction to N,N-dialkylamines occurred, along with N-dealkylation (to monoalkylanilines); there was also slow N-dealkylation in the absence of NADPH, which is interpreted in terms of homolytic scission of the N-O bond; N,N-dialkylanilines were not formed nor did the N-oxides support other oxygenation reactions. P450 2B1 (with its reductase and NADPH) formed N-oxides at low rates from several N,N-dialkylaniline derivatives, including N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-diethylaniline, N-ethyl-N-methylaniline, 4-methyl-N,N-dimethylaniline, 4-cyano-N,N-dimethylaniline, N-phenylpyrrolidine, and N,N-dimethyl-2-aminofluorene. The ratio of N-dealkylation:N-oxygenation varied from 1020 to 6 in this series. These results are consistent with the view that aminium radicals are a branch point in N-oxygenation and N-dealkylation reactions catalyzed by metalloproteins, although some alternate explanations cannot be ruled out. While N-dealkylation is the dominant process in all of the P450-catalyzed amine oxidations, there should be a finite partition ratio between these reactions depending upon the particular enzyme and substrate. The N-oxygenation reaction is probably more complex than a direct radical recombination event and is postulated to involve one or more intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2122479695,"O-Acetylation of sialic acids has previously been considered an uncommon modification found on certain salivary mucins and neural gangliosides. We show here that glycosidically bound sialic acids from total membranes of rat liver have surprisingly high levels (approximately 20%) of O-acetylation at the 7- or 9-position. This O-acetylation is further enriched in N-linked oligosaccharides but is barely detectable in ganglioside fractions from the same tissue. The position of O-acetylation on the sialic acid side chain varies between different subcellular fractions. In particular, 7-O-acetylation was enriched in lysosomal membranes and 9-O-acetylation in plasma membranes, whereas Golgi membranes contained both types. This distribution fits with the ability of the rat liver sialate: O-acetyltransferase(s) to synthesize both 7- and 9-O-acetyl esters (Diaz, S., Higa, H. H., Hayes, B. K., and Varki, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19416-19426) and the fact that 7-O-acetyl esters can migrate to the 9-position at physiological temperature but only under neutral or mildly alkaline conditions. Subcellular fractionation shows that sialate:O-acetyltransferase activity directed toward endogenous acceptors is enriched in Golgi fractions, whereas an intralumenal sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase activity is not. The O-acetyltransferase is labile and difficult to solubilize in the intact state and cannot be assayed with exogenous acceptors. However, a prelabeled [3H]acetyl intermediate can be solubilized from Golgi membranes with Triton X-100 and is stable for a prolonged time in the cold. In contrast to the transferase, the lumenal esterase is easily released in a stable and water-soluble form from membrane fractions by saponin permeabilization or repeated freeze-thaw. In keeping with this finding, differential subcellular fractionation and continuous sucrose gradients indicate that this enzyme is enriched in lysosomal fractions (see also the accompanying paper (Butor, C., Higa, H. H., and Varki, A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10207-10213). Based upon findings reported in this and previous studies, a model is proposed for the biosynthesis, maturation, and turnover of 7- and 9-O-acetyl esters on the sialic acids of N-linked oligosaccharides that are attached to membrane-bound proteins in the rat liver."

https://openalex.org/W1539001193,"Abstract Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a hereditary form of elliptocytosis resulting in rigid, oval-shaped erythrocytes resistant to invasion by malaria parasites. The molecular defect is due to deletion of codons 400-408, encoding a 9-amino-acid sequence located at the boundary between the cytosol and the first transmembrane segment in Band 3, the erythrocyte anion transport protein. We have carried out an extensive characterization of Band 3 isolated from SAO erythrocytes which contain about 50% mutant Band 3. A slightly higher proportion of Band 3 in SAO erythrocytes was left associated with the cytoskeleton after extraction of ghost membranes with non-ionic detergents. Size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that SAO Band 3 contained a higher proportion of tetramers relative to dimers (50% tetramer) than normal Band 3 (33% tetramer). The circular dichroism spectrum of Band 3 from SAO erythrocytes was very similar to the spectrum for normal Band 3. Enzymatic deglycosylation and tomato lectin binding showed that SAO Band 3 lacked the polylactosaminyl oligosaccharide found on normal Band 3. SAO Band 3 was unable to bind the anion transport inhibitor 4-benzamido-4'-aminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, suggesting a dramatic alteration in the inhibitor binding site. In conclusion, deletion of 9 amino acids from Band 3 on the cytosolic side of the membrane affects the properties (glycosylation and inhibitor binding) of Band 3 on the opposite side of the membrane without dramatic changes in the secondary and quaternary structure of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1560865570,"Toward studying the genetics, biosynthesis, and roles in the pathogenesis of the dominant surface glycopeptidolipid antigens of Mycobacterium avium, colony variants of M. avium serovar 2 were picked, cultured in quantity, and their lipid composition examined. Two of the (Rg) variants, Rg-3 and Rg-4, were devoid of glycopeptidolipids or any more elemental structures and thus were similar to those described previously. Two others, Rg-0 and Rg-1, each contained two novel lipopeptides, devoid of any of the carbohydrate substituents that confer serotypic activity on the glycopeptidolipids. The application of gas chromatography, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and 1H NMR to lipopeptide I established the structure C32:2-beta-OH-fatty acyl-D-Phe-D-allo-Thr-D-Ala-L-alaninol. Lipopeptide II represented a minor variation of this structure: C32:1-beta-OH-fatty acyl-D-Phe-D-allo-Thr-D-Ala-L-alaninol. These newly discovered lipopeptides are identical to the fatty acyl-tripeptide-amino alcohol core component of the glycopeptidolipids of the M. avium complex, and thus the Rg-0 and Rg-1 variants represent a form of deep rough mutation in M. avium. Separately, we report that these variants of M. avium differ genetically from the smooth, virulent form by major deletions of portions of the genes responsible for glycopeptidolipid synthesis (Belisle, J. T., Klaczkiewicz, K., Brennan, P. J., Jacobs, W. R., Jr., and Inamine, J. M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10517-10523). The isolation of different sets of spontaneous mutants of M. avium differentially defective in the capacity to synthesize glycopeptidolipids provides the means to explore their biosynthesis and roles in opportunistic pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1539381312,"The alpha-saturation reaction involved in the biosynthesis of dolichol has been investigated with rat liver preparations. Under improved in vitro conditions with 10,000 x g supernatant of rat liver homogenates in the presence of NADPH at pH 8.0, dolichol was synthesized from isopentenyl diphosphate and Z,E,E-geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Neither dolichyl diphosphate nor dolichyl phosphate was detected. The chain length distribution of the dolicohol was the same as that of dehydrodolichyl products. In an assay system containing dehydrodolichol, dehydrodolichyl phosphate, or dehydrodolichyl diphosphate as a substrate, dehydrodolichol was predominantly converted into dolichol. The enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dehydrodolichol to dolichol was localized in microsomes. The reductase activity was stimulated 9-fold by the addition of a 100,000 x g soluble fraction. The reductase had an opimal pH at 8.0. These results indicate that dolichol is formed from dehydrodolichol in rat liver microsomes. The formation of dolichol from dehydrodolichol was also catalyzed by 10,000 x g supernatant of rat or pig testis homogenates."
https://openalex.org/W1483070770,"Abstract The immunoglobulin G binding site in the globular regions of human complement subcomponent C1q has been investigated by chemical modification of histidine residues with diethylpyrocarbonate and arginine residues with phenylglyoxal and cyclohexane-1,2-dione (CHD). Only the modification of arginine residues with CHD fulfills the requirements of a specific modification without unwanted side reactions. Specific modification of arginine residues with CHD results in loss of immune complex recognition without affecting the binding of C1r2S2 to form C1. The gross structure of C1q is not changed by CHD treatment, and immune complex binding is restored to 82% of the control upon NH2OH treatment. Enzymic digestion and isolation of the modified peptides indicate that the modification by CHD of 4 to 5 arginine residues (A162, B114, B129, C156, and possibly B163) per C1q globular head abolishes the ability of C1q to interact with immune complexes. These residues define two areas (and possible binding sites for IgG) on the globular region of C1q: B114-B129 (site 1) and A162-(B163)-C156 (site 2). Sequence comparison and solvent exposure predictive studies favor site 2 as the immunoglobulin G binding site on the globular regions of C1q, although the participation of site 1 cannot be ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1544939074,"To determine the functional conformation of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, we have constructed mutant proteins by inserting 4-12 amino acid residues from the RGD region of human fibronectin between Val74 and Asn75 of human lysozyme. RGDS-, GRGDSP-, TGRGDSPA-, VTGRGDSPAS-, and AVTGRGDS-PASS-introduced mutant lysozymes were expressed in yeast, purified, and designated as RGD4, -6, -8, -10, and -12, respectively. Using baby hamster kidney cells, RGD8, RGD10, and RGD12 were shown to possess high cell adhesion activity nearly equal to 10% of human vitronectin activity. RGD4 and RGD6 exhibited somewhat lower cell adhesion activity. The activities of these mutant proteins were inhibited by the addition of either GRGDSP peptide or polyclonal antibody against vitronectin receptor, as was the case for the vitronectin activity. The results suggest that the cell adhesion signals are transduced to cells through the interaction with the vitronectin receptor. The three-dimensional structures of RGD4 and RGD8 were determined at 1.8-A resolution by x-ray crystallography. A model of the inserted region in RGD4 could be built in the electron density map, but the positions of the preceding residues, Ala73-Val74, were uncertain. The inserted region in RGD8 did not demonstrate continuous electron densities. The results suggest that these RGD sequence-containing regions are highly flexible and that such flexibility could allow the conformation of the RGD regions to be induced to fit into the binding pocket of the integrin receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1957345023,"The tyrosine at position 13 of epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been implicated as playing a role in receptor binding due to its close proximity to the critical arginine 41 residue as well as its high degree of conservation in EGF and EGF-like proteins that can bind to the EGF receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 13 in human EGF (hEGF) was employed to examine the role of this residue in ligand-receptor interaction. The removal of the hydroxyl moiety of the tyrosine by substitution with phenylalanine had little effect on the binding, indicating that it is not involved in any crucial hydrogen bonds with either the receptor or with other regions of the EGF molecule. The substitution of the aromatic tyrosine side-chain with the nonpolar leucine side-chain caused the receptor affinity to decrease only slightly, indicating that aromaticity of the amino acid at this site is also not critical. Substitutions with other hydrophobic residues, isoleucine, valine, and alanine, resulted in a significant decrease in receptor affinity as a function of decreasing hydrophobicity. Substitution of tyrosine 13 with the polar residues histidine and arginine markedly decreased receptor binding affinity, and complete removal of the side-chain by substitution with glycine dramatically lowered the binding affinity to 0.3% as compared to wild type. Analysis of three hEGF mutants, Tyr13-->Leu, Tyr13-->Arg, and Tyr13-->Gly, by circular dichroism showed that the major structural features of hEGF were not significantly altered. The results demonstrate that the decreased receptor affinities of these hEGF mutants are due to disruption of the functional contribution(s) of the tyrosine 13 residue rather than alteration(s) in the overall structural integrity. Overall, the results suggest that the tyrosine 13 side-chain plays a critical role in receptor binding by contributing to hydrophobic receptor-ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1529003499,"The melanoma-associated disialogangliosides 9(7)-O-acetyl-GD3 and 9(7)-O-acetyl-GD2 have been structurally well characterized. However, the compartmentalization and sequence of action of the biosynthetic activities responsible for synthesizing these molecules remain obscure. Here, we have studied the spatial and temporal interrelationships among the activities responsible for the later stages of ganglioside biosynthesis and those for O-acetylation in cultured human melanoma cells. First, brefeldin A treatment was used to separate biosynthetic steps into compartments distal or proximal to the transport block imposed by the drug. In keeping with prior reports, GM2/GD2 synthase was consistently rendered inaccessible to its acceptors GM3 and GD3. In contrast, the effect on GD3 biosynthesis was cell line-specific. Synthesis of GD3 was nearly abrogated in two lines, while it accumulated in a third line. This indicates that the spatial organization of ganglioside processing activities can vary even between similar cell lines. However, in all cell lines studied, the ratio of 9(7)-O-acetyl-GD3 to GD3 was not changed by brefeldin A, indicating that the majority of ganglioside O-acetyltransferase activity is co-localized with GD3 biosynthetic activity in the same Golgi subcompartment(s). As an alternative approach, Golgi-enriched fractions from melanoma cells were incubated with radiolabeled and nonlabeled nucleotide sugars or acetyl-CoA. In these preparations, biosynthesis is dependent upon the co-localization of appropriate sugar nucleotide transporters, glycosyltransferases, and acceptors that are endogenously present within intact topologically correct compartments. Incubations with CMP-Neu5Ac and acetyl-CoA corroborated the results with brefeldin A, co-localizing ganglioside O-acetyltransferase activity in compartments where GD3 biosynthesis takes place. Analyses with CMP-Neu5Ac and UDP-GalNAc showed that GD2 and GD3 synthesis occur in partially overlapping compartments. Labeling with acetyl-CoA and UDP-GalNAc indicated that although labeled acetate can be transferred from acetyl-CoA directly to GD2, ganglioside O-acetyltransferase activity does not substantially overlap with the biosynthetic compartment(s) for GD2. Instead, O-acetyl-GD3 appears to be co-localized with the compartment of GD2 biosynthesis and serves as an acceptor for GD2 synthase. Thus, both 9-O-acetyl-GD3 and GD2 can be precursors of 9-O-acetyl-GD2, but apparently in distinct compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1532726328,"Platelet-derived growth factor-AA and -BB homodimers and -AB heterodimers bind with high affinity to the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha-receptor. Basic polypeptides such as polylysine and protamine sulfate compete with PDGF for receptor binding, suggesting a role for ligand positive charge in the binding interaction. A pentapeptide amino acid sequence with a cationic tripeptide core is perfectly conserved between the A- and B-chains (Val158-Arg159-Lys160-Lys161-Pro162) and was therefore considered as a possible alpha-receptor-binding domain. We have investigated the functional importance of positive charge within this region of the PDGF A-chain by using site-directed mutagenesis to convert the cationic core amino acids to the acidic sequence triglutamic acid. cDNAs encoding wild-type (PDGF-AAwt) and charge mutant (PDGF-AAcm) proteins were expressed following stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Proper assembly and secretion of PDGF-AAcm was verified by metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis under nonreducing and reducing conditions. PDGF-AAcm was secreted as two major species of disulfide-linked A-chain homodimers identical in molecular mass to those observed for PDGF-AAwt (32 and 35 kDa). Secreted PDGF-AAwt and PDGF-AAcm proteins were purified to homogeneity and subjected to structural and functional analyses. Compared to purified PDGF-AAwt, PDGF-AAcm displayed a marked reduction in both binding affinity for PDGF alpha-receptors and mitogenic activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. Large reductions were also observed in the ability of semipurified PDGF-AAcm to stimulate calcium influx and the production of inositol phosphates. Measurement of circular dichroism spectra of highly purified PDGF-AAcm and PDGF-AAwt revealed no significant difference in secondary structure. Collectively, these results indicate that the cationic Arg159-Lys160-Lys161 region plays a critical role in the biological activity of PDGF-AA by direct participation in ligand binding to the PDGF alpha-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1557139473,"The x-ray crystal structure of pea lectin, in complex with a methyl glycoside of the N-linked-type oligosaccharide trimannosyl core, methyl 3,6-di-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranoside, has been solved by molecular replacement and refined at 2.6-A resolution. The R factor is 0.183 for all data in the 8.0 to 2.6 A resolution range with an average atomic temperature factor of 26.1 A2. Strong electron density for a single mannose residue is found in the monosaccharide-binding site suggesting that the trisaccharide binds primarily through one of the terminal alpha-linked mannose residues. The complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds involving the protein residues Asp-81, Gly-99, Asn-125, Ala-217, and Glu-218, and the carbohydrate oxygen atoms O3, O4, O5, and O6. In addition, the carbohydrate makes van der Waals contacts with the protein, involving Phe-123 in particular. These interactions are very similar to those found in the monosaccharide complexes with concanavalin A and isolectin 1 of Lathyrus ochrus, confirming the structural relatedness of this family of proteins. Comparison of the pea lectin complex with the unliganded pea lectin and concanavalin A structures indicates differences in the conformation and water structure of the unliganded binding sites of these two proteins. Furthermore, a correlation between the position of the carbohydrate oxygen atoms in the complex and the bound water molecules in the unliganded binding sites is found. Binding of the trimannose core through a single terminal monosaccharide residue strongly argues that an additional fucose-binding site is responsible for the high affinity pea lectin-oligosaccharide interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1560684249,"We previously observed that transcription of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain gene is enhanced in cells stimulated by PDGF through a serum response element (SRE) in its 5'-flanking sequence. We now show that the region of the SRE is sensitive to S1 nuclease in vitro. We also identify a single-stranded DNA-binding protein in HeLa cell nuclear extracts that binds to the noncoding strand of the PDGF A-chain SRE but not to its double-stranded counterpart or to the single-stranded coding sequence. Competition assays using oligonucleotides with sequence-specific mutations that diminished or eliminated detectable complex formation were used to establish the specificity of this protein/DNA interaction. Remarkably, the sequence-specific single-stranded binding protein binds to this region only when it is highly supercoiled. The data suggest that the single-stranded DNA-binding protein specifically interacts with a highly supercoiled region of the PDGF A-chain promoter and that this interaction may have a role in the transcriptional regulation of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1480619861,"Acute myeloid leukemia blasts express dual affinity (high and low) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) binding, and the high affinity GM-CSF binding is counteracted by excess interleukin-3 (IL-3). Neutrophils express a single class of GM-CSF-R with intermediate affinity that lack IL-3 cross-reactivity. Here we demonstrate the differentiation associated changes of GM-CSF binding characteristics in three models representative of different stages of myeloid maturation. We find that high affinity GM-CSF binding is converted into intermediate affinity binding, which still cross-reacts with IL-3, beyond the stage of promyelocytes. During terminal maturation towards neutrophils, IL-3 cross-reactivity is gradually lost. We sought to determine the mechanism underlying the affinity conversion of the GM-CSF-R. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of GM-CSF-R alpha and -beta c (KH97) transcripts did not provide indications for the involvement of GM-CSF-R splice variants in the formation of the intermediate affinity GM-CSFR complex. In COS-cell transfectants with increasing amounts of beta c in the presence of a fixed number of GM-CSF-R alpha chains, the high affinity GM-CSF binding converted into intermediate affinity GM-CSF binding. These results are discussed in view of the concept that increasing expression of beta c subunits may cause alternative oligomerization of the GM-CSF-R alpha and -beta c subunits resulting in the formation of intermediate rather than high affinity GM-CSFR alpha.beta c complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1567776138,"The vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a proton-translocating ATPase that acidifies the vacuolar lumen and generates an electrochemical potential across the vacuole membrane. Strains with chromosomal disruptions of the genes encoding the A, B, and c subunits of the vacuolar ATPase accumulate precursor forms of the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline phosphatase, and the soluble vacuolar hydrolases carboxypeptidase Y and proteinase A. We have found that the intracellular precursors in delta vat strains accumulate within the secretory pathway at some point before delivery to the vacuole but after transit to the Golgi complex. Purified vacuoles from delta vat cells do not contain the precursor forms of carboxypeptidase Y or alkaline phosphatase. In addition, vacuolar hydrolase-invertase hybrid proteins are inefficiently delivered to the vacuole in delta vat strains as demonstrated by vacuole isolation. Further subcellular fractionation to separate organelles indicate that significant amounts of the carboxypeptidase Y-invertase and alkaline phosphatase-invertase hybrid proteins are located in the late Golgi complex and/or post Golgi compartments."

https://openalex.org/W1601584819,"The binding of 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) to carboxypeptidase-inactivated thymidylate synthase obtained from methotrexate-resistant Lactobacillus casei was investigated using [3H]FdUMP in a trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay and by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The cleavage of 1 valine residue from the carboxyl terminus of one of the identical subunits of the enzyme dimer correlates with complete loss of thymidylate synthesis (Aull, J. L., Loeble, R. B., and Dunlap, R. B. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1167-1172). We have further investigated the phenomenon of carboxypeptidase A-dependent inactivation of thymidylate synthase by employing immobilized carboxypeptidase A in order to facilitate the isolation and characterization of the inactivated enzyme. The time course of carboxypeptidase treatment of thymidylate synthase has been profiled by the spectrophotometric assay, tritium release assay, trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay (covalent adduct analysis), 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and amino acid analysis. The techniques utilized in this study yielded results which showed that the completely inactivated enzyme (failure to catalyze thymidylate formation) continued to catalyze both covalent FdUMP-enzyme interactions and the formation of the covalent inhibitory ternary complex with the cofactor, 5,1O-methylenetetrahydrofolate, although to a reduced extent, thus effectively uncoupling these processes from thymidylate synthesis activity."
https://openalex.org/W1514899258,"In the rat hepatoma (HTC) cell line, transcription of the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) gene is prominently stimulated by dexamethasone. Although interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 synergistically enhance expression of the AGP gene in liver, they have no detectable effect on this gene in HTC cells. Nevertheless, HTC cells have mRNA encoding the IL-6 receptor subunits and respond to IL-6 by increasing expression of the junB gene. The mRNA for the 80-kDa IL-6 receptors is increased severalfold following dexamethasone treatment. Even with elevated IL-6 receptor expression, no IL-6 regulation of the AGP gene is observed. The lack of response to IL-6 is also found with the transfected AGP gene sequence, suggesting the absence of specific trans-acting factors. Since IL-6 promotes only a minimal stimulation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta, HTC cells lack the indirect IL-6 signaling pathway to acute phase plasma protein genes that has been found to be crucial in other hepatoma cell lines. Considering that a similar IL-6 regulation of the junB gene is manifested in HTC cells and normal liver, a separate IL-6 signal-transducing pathway controlling the AGP gene is assumed to be missing in HTC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1576282369,"The DNA-binding domain of the mouse uterine estrogen receptor (ER) was characterized using site-specific polyclonal antibodies. The peptides used as antigens have sequences corresponding to amino acids 185-199 and 227-245, the two zinc finger regions of the DNA-binding domain of the human ER, and produced anti-sera designated A-1542 and A-1554, respectively. Mouse uterine nuclear ER and salt-activated 4 S cytosol receptor, as well as 8 S untransformed cytosol receptor, were observed to react with the antisera by Western blot and sucrose density gradient centrifugation analyses indicating that the DNA-binding domain of the 8 S cytosol receptor is not completely masked by heat shock protein 90 or other proteins. Only A-1554 detected a nuclear-specific doublet form of the ER on Western blot analysis. In a gel shift assay, neither antisera altered the pattern of the nuclear ER interaction with the vitellogenin A2 estrogen response element (VRE). In contrast, antiserum A-1554 partially shifted the 8 S cytosol receptor-VRE complex. This concurs with mutational analysis and x-ray crystallography studies with the human ER that have shown that the second finger is not in contact with the DNA. The results of the gel shift assay were confirmed by sucrose density gradient analysis using the same buffer conditions. The nuclear receptor-VRE complex did not react with either antisera, suggesting that when the dimeric nuclear receptor form binds the VRE, the specific receptor epitopes involved with the DNA binding may be blocked and unable to bind the antisera. The cytosol receptor-VRE complex reacted only partially with the second finger antisera A-1554, suggesting that on receptor monomers the second finger epitope is not completely blocked by DNA binding or dimer formation."
