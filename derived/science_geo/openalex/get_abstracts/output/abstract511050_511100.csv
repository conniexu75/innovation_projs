https://openalex.org/W1990741430,"Heme is an essential cofactor for aerobic organisms. Its redox chemistry is central to a variety of biological functions mediated by hemoproteins. In blood stages, malaria parasites consume most of the hemoglobin inside the infected erythrocytes, forming nontoxic hemozoin crystals from large quantities of heme released during digestion. At the same time, the parasites possess a heme de novo biosynthetic pathway. This pathway in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been considered essential and is proposed as a potential drug target. However, we successfully disrupted the first and last genes of the pathway, individually and in combination. These knock-out parasite lines, lacking 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase and/or ferrochelatase (FC), grew normally in blood-stage culture and exhibited no changes in sensitivity to heme-related antimalarial drugs. We developed a sensitive LC-MS/MS assay to monitor stable isotope incorporation into heme from its precursor 5-[13C4]aminolevulinic acid, and this assay confirmed that de novo heme synthesis was ablated in FC knock-out parasites. Disrupting the FC gene also caused no defects in gametocyte generation or maturation but resulted in a greater than 70% reduction in male gamete formation and completely prevented oocyst formation in female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Our data demonstrate that the heme biosynthesis pathway is not essential for asexual blood-stage growth of P. falciparum parasites but is required for mosquito transmission. Drug inhibition of pathway activity is therefore unlikely to provide successful antimalarial therapy. These data also suggest the existence of a parasite mechanism for scavenging host heme to meet metabolic needs."

The oral mucosa is susceptible to injury because of its location; nonetheless, it has faster wound healing than the skin and less scar formation. However, the molecular pathways regulating this wound healing are unclear. Here, we show that transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 (TRPV3), a thermosensitive Ca2+-permeable channel, is more highly expressed in murine oral epithelia than in the skin by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that temperatures above 33°C activated TRPV3 and promoted oral epithelial cell proliferation. The proliferation rate in the oral epithelia of TRPV3 knockout (TRPV3KO) mice was less than that of wild-type (WT) mice. We investigated the contribution of TRPV3 to wound healing using a molar tooth extraction model and found that oral wound closure was delayed in TRPV3KO mice compared with that in WT mice. TRPV3 mRNA was up-regulated in wounded tissues, suggesting that TRPV3 may contribute to oral wound repair. We identified TRPV3 as an essential receptor in heat-induced oral epithelia proliferation and wound healing. Our findings suggest that TRPV3 activation could be a potential therapeutic target for wound healing in skin and oral mucosa.—Aijima, R., Wang, B., Takao, T., Mihara, H., Kashio, M., Ohsaki, Y., Zhang, J.-Q., Mizuno, A., Suzuki, M., Yamashita, Y., Masuko, S., Goto, M., Tominaga, M., Kido, M.

https://openalex.org/W2078120333,"The Maasai of northern Tanzania, a semi-nomadic ethnic group predominantly reliant on pastoralism, face a number of challenges anticipated to have negative impacts on child health, including marginalisation, vulnerabilities to drought, substandard service provision and on-going land grabbing conflicts. Yet, stemming from a lack of appropriate national survey data, no large-scale comparative study of Maasai child health has been conducted. Savannas Forever Tanzania surveyed the health of over 3500 children from 56 villages in northern Tanzania between 2009 and 2011. The major ethnic groups sampled were the Maasai, Sukuma, Rangi, and the Meru. Using multilevel regression we compare each ethnic group on the basis of (i) measurements of child health, including anthropometric indicators of nutritional status and self-reported incidence of disease; and (ii) important proximate determinants of child health, including food insecurity, diet, breastfeeding behaviour and vaccination coverage. We then (iii) contrast households among the Maasai by the extent to which subsistence is reliant on livestock herding. Measures of both child nutritional status and disease confirm that the Maasai are substantially disadvantaged compared to neighbouring ethnic groups, Meru are relatively advantaged, and Rangi and Sukuma intermediate in most comparisons. However, Maasai children were less likely to report malaria and worm infections. Food insecurity was high throughout the study site, but particularly severe for the Maasai, and reflected in lower dietary intake of carbohydrate-rich staple foods, and fruits and vegetables. Breastfeeding was extended in the Maasai, despite higher reported consumption of cow's milk, a potential weaning food. Vaccination coverage was lowest in Maasai and Sukuma. Maasai who rely primarily on livestock herding showed signs of further disadvantage compared to Maasai relying primarily on agriculture. We discuss the potential ecological, socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors responsible for these differences and the implications for population health research and policy."
https://openalex.org/W2172252559,"Polycomb protein chromobox homolog 7 (CBX7) is involved in several biologic processes including stem cell regulation and cancer development, but its roles in breast cancer remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CBX7 negatively regulates breast tumor initiation. CD44(+)/CD24(-)/ESA(+) breast stem-like cells showed diminished CBX7 expression. Furthermore, small hairpin RNA-mediated CBX7 knockdown in breast epithelial and cancer cells increased the CD44(+)/CD24(-)/ESA(+) cell population and reinforced in vitro self-renewal and in vivo tumor-initiating ability. Similarly, CBX7 overexpression repressed these effects. We also found that CBX7 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin/T cell factor pathway by enhancing the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), a Wnt antagonist. In particular, CBX7 increased DKK-1 transcription by cooperating with p300 acetyltransferase and subsequently enhancing the histone acetylation of the DKK-1 promoter. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of DKK-1 in CBX7-overexpressing cells showed recovery of Wnt signaling and consequent rescue of the CD44(+)/CD24(-)/ESA(+) cell population. Taken together, these findings indicate that CBX7-mediated epigenetic induction of DKK-1 is crucial for the inhibition of breast tumorigenicity, suggesting that CBX7 could be a potential tumor suppressor in human breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2018401454,"Expressed in somatosensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion, the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel activated by cold, voltage, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and menthol. Although TRPM8 channel gating has been characterized at the single channel and macroscopic current levels, there is currently no consensus regarding the extent to which temperature and voltage sensors couple to the conduction gate. In this study, we extended the range of voltages where TRPM8-induced ionic currents were measured and made careful measurements of the maximum open probability the channel can attain at different temperatures by means of fluctuation analysis. The first direct measurements of TRPM8 channel temperature-driven conformational rearrangements provided here suggest that temperature alone is able to open the channel and that the opening reaction is voltage-independent. Voltage is a partial activator of TRPM8 channels, because absolute open probability values measured with fully activated voltage sensors are less than 1, and they decrease as temperature rises. By unveiling the fast temperature-dependent deactivation process, we show that TRPM8 channel deactivation is well described by a double exponential time course. The fast and slow deactivation processes are temperature-dependent with enthalpy changes of 27.2 and 30.8 kcal mol−1. The overall Q10 for the closing reaction is about 33. A three-tiered allosteric model containing four voltage sensors and four temperature sensors can account for the complex deactivation kinetics and coupling between voltage and temperature sensor activation and channel opening."
https://openalex.org/W2005128600,"Calsyntenin 3 (Cstn3 or Clstn3), a recently identified synaptic organizer, promotes the development of synapses. Cstn3 localizes to the postsynaptic membrane and triggers presynaptic differentiation. Calsyntenin members play an evolutionarily conserved role in memory and learning. Cstn3 was recently shown in cell-based assays to interact with neurexin 1α (n1α), a synaptic organizer that is implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. Interaction would permit Cstn3 and n1α to form a trans-synaptic complex and promote synaptic differentiation. However, it is contentious whether Cstn3 binds n1α directly. To understand the structure and function of Cstn3, we determined its architecture by electron microscopy and delineated the interaction between Cstn3 and n1α biochemically and biophysically. We show that Cstn3 ectodomains form monomers as well as tetramers that are stabilized by disulfide bonds and Ca(2+), and both are probably flexible in solution. We show further that the extracellular domains of Cstn3 and n1α interact directly and that both Cstn3 monomers and tetramers bind n1α with nanomolar affinity. The interaction is promoted by Ca(2+) and requires minimally the LNS domain of Cstn3. Furthermore, Cstn3 uses a fundamentally different mechanism to bind n1α compared with other neurexin partners, such as the synaptic organizer neuroligin 2, because Cstn3 does not strictly require the sixth LNS domain of n1α. Our structural data suggest how Cstn3 as a synaptic organizer on the postsynaptic membrane, particularly in tetrameric form, may assemble radially symmetric trans-synaptic bridges with the presynaptic synaptic organizer n1α to recruit and spatially organize proteins into networks essential for synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W1990004288,"In this study we use economic input-output analysis to calculate the inequality footprint of nations. An inequality footprint shows the link that each country's domestic economic activity has to income distribution elsewhere in the world. To this end we use employment and household income accounts for 187 countries and an historical time series dating back to 1990. Our results show that in 2010, most developed countries had an inequality footprint that was higher than their within-country inequality, meaning that in order to support domestic lifestyles, these countries source imports from more unequal economies. Amongst exceptions are the United States and United Kingdom, which placed them on a par with many developing countries. Russia has a high within-country inequality nevertheless it has the lowest inequality footprint in the world, which is because of its trade connections with the Commonwealth of Independent States and Europe. Our findings show that the commodities that are inequality-intensive, such as electronic components, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals, and agricultural products often originate in developing countries characterized by high levels of inequality. Consumption of these commodities may implicate within-country inequality in both developing and developed countries."
https://openalex.org/W2119674791,"Reduced adenosine uptake via human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is reversed by insulin by restoring hENT1 expression. Insulin receptors A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) are expressed in HUVECs, and GDM results in higher IR-A mRNA expression vs. cells from normal pregnancies. We studied whether the reversal of GDM effects on transport by insulin depends on restoration of IR-A expression. We specifically measured hENT1 expression [mRNA, protein abundance, SLC29A1 (for hENT1) promoter activity] and activity (adenosine transport kinetics) and the role of IR-A/IR-B expression and signaling [total and phosphorylated 42 and 44 kDa mitogen-activated protein kinases (p44/42(mapk)) and Akt] in IR-A, IR-B, and IR-A/B knockdown HUVECs from normal (n = 33) or GDM (n = 33) pregnancies. GDM increases IR-A/IR-B mRNA expression (1.8-fold) and p44/42(mapk):Akt activity (2.7-fold) ratios. Insulin reversed GDM-reduced hENT1 expression and maximal transport capacity (V(max)/K(m)), and GDM-increased IR-A/IR-B mRNA expression and p44/42(mapk):Akt activity ratios to values in normal pregnancies. Insulin's effect was abolished in IR-A or IR-A/B knockdown cells. Thus, insulin requires normal IR-A expression and p44/42(mapk)/Akt signaling to restore GDM-reduced hENT1 expression and activity in HUVECs. This could be a protective mechanism for the placental macrovascular endothelial dysfunction seen in GDM."
https://openalex.org/W2021482422,"Background Age-related balance impairments, particularly in mediolateral direction (ML) may cause falls. Sufficiently sensitive and reliable ML balance tests are, however, lacking. This study is aimed to determine (1) the effect of age on and (2) the reliability of ML balance performance using Center of Mass (CoM) tracking. Methods Balance performance of 19 young (26±3 years) and 19 older (72±5 years) adults on ML-CoM tracking tasks was compared. Subjects tracked predictable and unpredictable target displacements at increasing frequencies with their CoM by shifting their weight sideward. Phase-shift (response delay) and gain (amplitude difference) between the CoM and target in the frequency domain were used to quantify performance. Thirteen older and all young adults were reassessed to determine reliability of balance performance measures. In addition, all older adults performed a series of clinical balance tests and conventional posturography was done in a sub-sample. Results Phase-shift and gain dropped below pre-determined thresholds (−90 degrees and 0.5) at lower frequencies in the older adults and were even lower below these frequencies than in young adults. Performance measures showed good to excellent reliability in both groups. All clinical scores were close to the maximum and no age effect was found using posturography. ML balance performance measures exhibited small but systematic between-session differences indicative of learning. Conclusions The ability to accurately perform ML-CoM tracking deteriorates with age. ML-CoM tracking tasks form a reliable tool to assess ML balance in young and older adults and are more sensitive to age-related impairment than posturography and clinical tests."
https://openalex.org/W1971877737,"In many parts of the world, livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) are a relatively new and increasingly popular method for controlling the impact of wild predators on livestock. On large grazing properties in Australia, LGDs are often allowed to range freely over large areas, with minimal supervision by their owners. How they behave in this situation is mostly unknown. We fitted free-ranging Maremma sheepdogs with GPS tracking collars on three properties in Victoria, Australia; on two properties, four sheep were also fitted with GPS collars. We investigated how much time the Maremmas spent with their livestock, how far they moved outside the ranges of their stock, and tested whether they use their ranges sequentially, which is an effective way of maintaining a presence over a large area. The 95% kernel isopleth of the Maremmas ranged between 31 and 1161 ha, the 50% kernel isopleth ranged between 4 and 252 ha. Maremmas spent on average 90% of their time in sheep paddocks. Movements away from sheep occurred mostly at night, and were characterised by high-speed travel on relatively straight paths, similar to the change in activity at the edge of their range. Maremmas used different parts of their range sequentially, similar to sheep, and had a distinct early morning and late afternoon peak in activity. Our results show that while free-ranging LGDs spend the majority of their time with livestock, movements away from stock do occur. These movements could be important in allowing the dogs to maintain large territories, and could increase the effectiveness of livestock protection. Allowing LGDs to range freely can therefore be a useful management decision, but property size has to be large enough to accommodate the large areas that the dogs use."
https://openalex.org/W2071303062,"Genetic correlations between performance traits with meat quality and carcass traits were estimated on 6,408 commercial crossbred pigs with performance traits recorded in production systems with 2,100 of them having meat quality and carcass measurements. Significant fixed effects (company, sex and batch), covariates (birth weight, cold carcass weight, and age), random effects (additive, litter and maternal) were fitted in the statistical models. A series of pairwise bivariate analyses were implemented in ASREML to estimate heritability, phenotypic, and genetic correlations between performance traits (n = 9) with meat quality (n = 25) and carcass (n = 19) traits. The animals had a pedigree compromised of 9,439 animals over 15 generations. Performance traits had low-to-moderate heritabilities (±SE), ranged from 0.07±0.13 to 0.45±0.07 for weaning weight, and ultrasound backfat depth, respectively. Genetic correlations between performance and carcass traits were moderate to high. The results indicate that: (a) selection for birth weight may increase drip loss, lightness of longissimus dorsi, and gluteus medius muscles but may reduce fat depth; (b) selection for nursery weight can be valuable for increasing both quantity and quality traits; (c) selection for increased daily gain may increase the carcass weight and most of the primal cuts. These findings suggest that deterioration of pork quality may have occurred over many generations through the selection for less backfat thickness, and feed efficiency, but selection for growth had no adverse effects on pork quality. Low-to-moderate heritabilities for performance traits indicate that they could be improved using traditional selection or genomic selection. The estimated genetic parameters for performance, carcass and meat quality traits may be incorporated into the breeding programs that emphasize product quality in these Canadian swine populations."
https://openalex.org/W2014947812,"Anoctamin-1 (Ano1) is a widely expressed protein responsible for endogenous Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents. Ano1 is overexpressed in cancer. Differential expression of transcriptional variants is also found in other diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of Ano1 are unknown. This study identifies the Ano1 promoter and defines a mechanism for regulating its expression. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in human gastric muscle found a new exon upstream of the reported exon 1 and identified a promoter proximal to this new exon. Reporter assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed a 6.7 ± 2.1-fold increase in activity over empty vector. Treatment with a known regulator of Ano1 expression, IL-4, increased promoter activity by 1.6 ± 0.02-fold over untreated cells. The promoter region contained putative binding sites for multiple transcription factors including signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), a downstream effector of IL-4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments on T84 cells, which endogenously express Ano1, showed a 2.1 ± 0.12-fold increase in binding of STAT6 to P0 after IL-4 treatment. These results were confirmed by mutagenesis, expression, and RNA interference techniques. This work allows deeper understanding of the regulation of Ano1 in physiology and as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2063748325,"Recovery of sensory and motor functions following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is dependent on injury severity. Here we identified 49 proteins from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SCI patients, eight of which were differentially abundant among two severity groups of SCI. It was observed that the abundance profiles of these proteins change over a time period of days to months post SCI. Statistical analysis revealed that these proteins take part in several molecular pathways including DNA repair, protein phosphorylation, tRNA transcription, iron transport, mRNA metabolism, immune response and lipid and ATP catabolism. These pathways reflect a set of mechanisms that the system may adopt to cope up with the assault depending on the injury severity, thus leading to observed physiological responses. Apart from putting forward a picture of the molecular scenario at the injury site in a human study, this finding further delineates consequent pathways and molecules that may be altered by external intervention to restrict neural degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1992093036,"Minimization is a valuable method for allocating participants between the control and experimental arms of clinical studies. The use of minimization reduces differences that might arise by chance between the study arms in the distribution of patient characteristics such as gender, ethnicity and age. However, unlike randomization, minimization requires real time assessment of each new participant with respect to the preceding distribution of relevant participant characteristics within the different arms of the study. For multi-site studies, this necessitates centralized computational analysis that is shared between all study locations. Unfortunately, there is no suitable freely available open source or free software that can be used for this purpose. OxMaR was developed to enable researchers in any location to use minimization for patient allocation and to access the minimization algorithm using any device that can connect to the internet such as a desktop computer, tablet or mobile phone. The software is complete in itself and requires no special packages or libraries to be installed. It is simple to set up and run over the internet using online facilities which are very low cost or even free to the user. Importantly, it provides real time information on allocation to the study lead or administrator and generates real time distributed backups with each allocation. OxMaR can readily be modified and customised and can also be used for standard randomization. It has been extensively tested and has been used successfully in a low budget multi-centre study. Hitherto, the logistical difficulties involved in minimization have precluded its use in many small studies and this software should allow more widespread use of minimization which should lead to studies with better matched control and experimental arms. OxMaR should be particularly valuable in low resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2071917759,"Highly Infectious Diseases (HIDs) are (i) easily transmissible form person to person; (ii) cause a life-threatening illness with no or few treatment options; and (iii) pose a threat for both personnel and the public. Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary.Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime.There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of isolation facilities. With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised."

The tetrameric protein was structurally characterized by small angle X-ray scattering, and compared with each single recombinant lipocalin allergen or an equimolar mix of the four allergens by analytical size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism, allergen-specific IgE in serum by ELISA and allergen-dependent capacity to activate basophils. The immunogenicity of the fusion protein was evaluated in immunized mice by assessing splenocyte proliferation and antibody production.The linked tetrameric construct was produced as a soluble fusion protein, with the specific folds of the four individual allergens conserved. This multi-allergen molecule was significantly more efficient (p<0.001) than each single recombinant allergen in binding to dog-specific IgE, and the epitope spectrum was unaffected compared to an equimolar mix of the four allergens.

We adjusted for ten a priori selected covariates, including age, sex, diabetes and number of visits to a family doctor.Baseline characteristics of the groups were relatively well matched, except for age, sex, diabetes and frequency of family doctor visits. 128 of the 86 775 patients (0.15%) initiated on an ACE inhibitor and 43 of the 33953 patients (0.13%) of patients initiated on an ARB were hospitalized with pneumonia in the subsequent 90 days. 135 of 64 186 patients (0.21%) initiated on a thiazide, 112 of 35 331 patients (.32%) initiated on a BB, and 89 of 34 240 (0.26%) patients initiated on a CCB achieved the primary outcome. Compared to calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors (adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81) and ARBs (adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.76) were associated with a lower risk of pneumonia. No benefit was seen with thiazides (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.14) or beta blockers (adjusted OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.60).Initiating medications that block the renin angiotensin system, compared to other anti-hypertensive medications, is associated with a small absolute reduction in the 90 day risk of hospitalization with pneumonia."

We demonstrated that EmbC has a functional signal peptide in M. tuberculosis. Over- or underexpression of EmbC resulted in reduced or increased sensitivity to ethambutol, respectively.

The C-terminal domain of the closely related arabinosyltransferase EmbB was unable to complement the function of the EmbC C-terminal domain. Two functional motifs were identified. The GT-C motif contains two aspartate residues essential for function in the DDX motif. The proline-rich region contains two highly conserved asparagines (Asn-638 and Asn-652). Mutation of these residues was tolerated, but loss of Asn-638 resulted in the synthesis of truncated LAM, which appeared to lack arabinose branching.

https://openalex.org/W2048624175,"Successful decision making in our daily lives requires weighing an option's costs against its associated benefits. The neuromodulator acetylcholine underlies both the etiology and treatment of a number of illnesses in which decision making is perturbed, including Alzheimer's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Nicotine acts on the cholinergic system and has been touted as a cognitive enhancer by both smokers and some researchers for its attention-boosting effects; however, it is unclear whether treatments that have a beneficial effect on attention would also have a beneficial effect on decision making. Here we utilize the rodent Cognitive Effort Task (rCET), wherein animals can choose to allocate greater visuospatial attention for a greater reward, to examine cholinergic contributions to both attentional performance and choice based on attentional demand. Following the establishment of baseline behavior, four drug challenges were administered: nicotine, mecamylamine, scopolamine, and oxotremorine (saline plus three doses for each). As per previous rCET studies, animals were divided by their baseline preferences, with ""worker"" rats choosing high-effort/high-reward options more than their ""slacker"" counterparts. Nicotine caused slackers to choose even fewer high-effort trials than at baseline, but had no effect on workers' choice. Despite slackers' decreased willingness to expend effort, nicotine improved their attentional performance on the task. Nicotine also increased measures of motor impulsivity in all animals. In contrast, scopolamine decreased animals' choice of high-effort trials, especially for workers, while oxotremorine decreased motor impulsivity for all animals. In sum, the cholinergic system appears to contribute to decision making, and in part these contributions can be understood as a function of individual differences. While nicotine has been considered as a cognitive enhancer, these data suggest that its modest benefits to attention may be coupled with impulsiveness and decreased willingness to work hard, especially in individuals who are particularly sensitive to effort costs (i.e. slackers)."
https://openalex.org/W2094984096,"The human leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains (LRIG) gene family contains LRIG1, 2 and 3, encoding integral membrane proteins with an ectodomain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. LRIG1 negatively regulates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases signaling including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is a proposed tumor suppressor. The soluble LRIG1 ectodomain is demonstrated to be shed naturally and inhibit the progression of glioma. However, little is known regarding the functions of LRIG2. In oligodendroglioma, LRIG2 expression is associated with poor survival, suggesting that LRIG2 might have different functions compared with LRIG1. Since soluble LRIG1 ectodomain has a similar function to the full-length LRIG1, we hypothesize that the different roles exerted by LRIG2 and LRIG1 result from the difference of their ectodomains. Here, we addressed the functions of LRIG2 and LRIG2 ectodomain in the proliferation and apoptosis of glioma and the possible underlying mechanisms. Firstly, we found that LRIG2 expression levels positively correlated with the grade of glioma. Further, we demonstrated for the first time that soluble LRIG2 ectodomain was capable of being released from glioblastoma cells and exerted a pro-proliferative effect. Overexpression of LRIG2 ectodomain promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo in a similar manner to the full-length LRIG2. Both full-length LRIG2 and LRIG2 ectodomain were found to physically interact with EGFR, enhance the activation of EGFR and its downstream PI3 K/Akt pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that soluble LRIG2 ectodomain is capable of being released from glioblastoma cells and exerts a similar role to the full-length LRIG2 in the regulation of EGFR signaling in the progression of glioblastoma. LRIG2 ectodomain, with potent pro-tumor effects, holds promise for providing a new therapeutic target for the treatment of glioblastoma."

Despite the significant global impact of urogenital schistosomiasis, the mechanisms of bladder granulomogenesis and fibrosis are ill defined due to the prior lack of tractable animal models. We combined a mouse model of urogenital schistosomiasis with macrophage-depleting liposomal clodronate (LC) to define how macrophages mediate bladder granulomogenesis and fibrosis. Mice were injected with eggs purified from infected hamsters or vehicle prepared from uninfected hamster tissues (xenoantigen and injection trauma control). Empty liposomes were controls for LC: 1) LC treatment resulted in fewer bladder egg granuloma-infiltrating macrophages, eosinophils, and T and B cells, lower bladder and serum levels of eotaxin, and higher bladder concentrations of IL-1α and chemokines (in a time-dependent fashion), confirming that macrophages orchestrate leukocyte infiltration of the egg-exposed bladder; 2) macrophage-depleted mice exhibited greater weight loss and bladder hemorrhage postegg injection; 3) early LC treatment postegg injection resulted in profound decreases in bladder fibrosis, suggesting differing roles for macrophages in fibrosis over time; and 4) LC treatment also led to egg dose-dependent mortality, indicating that macrophages prevent death from urogenital schistosomiasis.

Although both mitochondrial function and UV radiation insults are well-documented promoters of increased cellular stress, their individual molecular relationships with skin pigmentation have not been clearly resolved. This study provides evidence for a direct relationship between cellular melanin content, superoxide flux, and mitochondrial function at complex II. Direct and significant correlation between increased pigmentation and complex II turnover was observed in genetically different melanoma cell lines of varied basal pigmentation states (P < 0.01). The same trend was also observed when comparing genetically identical cell cultures with increasing levels of induced pigmentation (P < 0.005). The observation of increased steady-state levels of the catalytic complex II succinate dehydrogenase subunit A alongside hyperpigmentation suggested coregulation of activity and pigment production (P < 0.01). The study also presents novel evidence for a relationship between hyperpigmentation and increased superoxide-generating capacity at complex II. By amperometrically monitoring superoxide flux from differently pigmented FM55 melanocytes and their isolated mitochondria, a dynamic and responsive relationship between pigmentation, complex II function, and intracellular superoxide generation was observed (P < 0.005).

To date, the predominant animal models used to investigate the role of P-gp have been the mouse and rat, which have two distinct genes, Abcb1a and Abcb1b. In contrast, the human has a single gene, ABCB1, for which only a single isoform has been validated. We and others have previously shown important differences between Abcb1a and Abcb1b, limiting the extrapolation from rodent findings to the human. Since the guinea pig has a relatively long gestation, hemomonochorial placentation and neuroanatomically mature offspring, it is more similar to the human, and may provide a more comparable model for investigating the regulation of P-gp in the brain and placenta, however, to date, the Abcb1 gene in the guinea pig remains to be characterized. The placenta and fetal brain are barrier sites that express P-gp and that play a critical role of protection of the fetus and the fetal brain from maternally administered drugs and other xenobiotics. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (QPCR) to sequence the expressed isoforms of guinea pig Abcb1, we demonstrate that like the human, the guinea pig genome contains one gene for Abcb1 but that it is expressed as at least three different isoforms via alternative splicing and alternate exon usage. Further, we demonstrate that these isoforms are more closely related to human than to rat or mouse isoforms. This striking, overall similarity and evolutionary relatedness between guinea pig Abcb1 and human ABCB1 indicate that the guinea pig represents a relevant animal model for investigating the function and regulation of P-gp in the placenta and brain."

https://openalex.org/W2103700457,"Background Although human breast development is mediated by hormonal and non-hormonal means, the mechanisms that regulate breast progenitor cell activity remain to be clarified. This limited understanding of breast progenitor cells has been due in part to the lack of appropriate model systems to detect and characterize their properties. Methods To examine the effects of WNT signaling and TBX3 expression on progenitor activity in the breast, primary human mammary epithelial cells (MEC) were isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues and transduced with lentivirus to overexpress WNT1 or TBX3 or reduce expression of their cognate receptors using shRNA. Changes in progenitor activity were quantified using characterized assays. We identified WNT family members expressed by cell populations within the epithelium and assessed alterations in expression of WNT family ligands by MECs in response to TBX3 overexpression and treatment with estrogen and progesterone. Results Growth of MECs on collagen gels resulted in the formation of distinct luminal acinar and basal ductal colonies. Overexpression of TBX3 in MECs resulted in increased ductal colonies, while shTBX3 expression diminished both colony types. Increased WNT1 expression led to enhanced acinar colony formation, shLRP6 decreased both types of colonies. Estrogen stimulated the formation of acinar colonies in control MEC, but not shLRP6 MEC. Formation of ductal colonies was enhanced in response to progesterone. However, while shLRP6 decreased MEC responsiveness to progesterone, shTBX3 expression did not alter this response. Conclusions We identified two phenotypically distinguishable lineage-committed progenitor cells that contribute to different structural elements and are regulated via hormonal and non-hormonal mechanisms. WNT signaling regulates both types of progenitor activity. Progesterone favors the expansion of ductal progenitor cells, while estrogen stimulates the expansion of acinar progenitor cells. Paracrine WNT signaling is stimulated by estrogen and progesterone, while autocrine WNT signaling is induced by the embryonic T-box transcription factor TBX3."

The procedure relies entirely on three-dimensional structure analysis of enzymes and does not stem from sequence or structure alignment. The BioGPS descriptors account for chemical, geometrical and physical-chemical features of enzymes and are able to describe comprehensively the active site of enzymes in terms of “pre-organized environment” able to stabilize the transition state of a given reaction. The efficiency of this new bioinformatic strategy was demonstrated by the consistent clustering of four different Ser hydrolases classes, which are characterized by the same active site organization but able to catalyze different reactions. The method was validated by considering, as a case study, the engineering of amidase activity into the scaffold of a lipase. The BioGPS tool predicted correctly the properties of lipase variants, as demonstrated by the projection of mutants inside the BioGPS “roadmap”."

Typical for spider toxins, Hm-3 was found to adopt the so-called “inhibitor cystine knot” or “knottin” fold stabilized by three disulfide bonds. Its molecule is amphiphilic with a hydrophobic ridge on the surface enriched in aromatic residues and surrounded by positive charges.

However, there is little knowledge of the mechanisms by which these tumors develop acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition. To investigate this question we sought to characterize cell line models of ERBB2-amplified gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition. We generated lapatinib-resistant (LR) subclones from an initially lapatinib-sensitive ERBB2-amplified esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line, OE19. We subsequently performed genomic characterization and functional analyses of resistant subclones with acquired lapatinib resistance. We identified a novel, acquired SrcE527K mutation in a subset of LR OE19 subclones. Cells with this mutant allele harbour increased Src phosphorylation. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of Src resensitized these subclones to lapatinib. Biochemically, Src mutations could activate both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase pathways in the lapatinib-treated LR OE19 cells. Ectopic expression of SrcE527K mutation also was sufficient to induce lapatinib resistance in drug-naïve cells. These results indicate that pathologic activation of Src is a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition in ERBB2-amplified gastroesophageal cancer. Although Src mutation has not been described in primary tumor samples, we propose that the Src hyperactivation should be investigated in the settings of acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibition in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2140328086,"DNA damage checkpoints exist to promote cell survival and the faithful inheritance of genetic information. It is thought that one function of such checkpoints is to ensure that cell division does not occur before DNA damage is repaired. However, in unicellular organisms, rapid cell multiplication confers a powerful selective advantage, leading to a dilemma. Is the activation of a DNA damage checkpoint compatible with rapid cell multiplication? By uncoupling the initiation of DNA replication from cell division, the Escherichia coli cell cycle offers a solution to this dilemma. Here, we show that a DNA double-strand break, which occurs once per replication cycle, induces the SOS response. This SOS induction is needed for cell survival due to a requirement for an elevated level of expression of the RecA protein. Cell division is delayed, leading to an increase in average cell length but with no detectable consequence on mutagenesis and little effect on growth rate and viability. The increase in cell length caused by chronic DNA double-strand break repair comprises three components: two types of increase in the unit cell size, one independent of SfiA and SlmA, the other dependent of the presence of SfiA and the absence of SlmA, and a filamentation component that is dependent on the presence of either SfiA or SlmA. These results imply that chronic checkpoint induction in E. coli is compatible with rapid cell multiplication. Therefore, under conditions of chronic low-level DNA damage, the SOS checkpoint operates seamlessly in a cell cycle where the initiation of DNA replication is uncoupled from cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2045552057,"Despite many compelling applications in economics, sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology, group selection is still one of the most hotly contested ideas in evolutionary biology. Here we propose a simple evolutionary model of behavior and show that what appears to be group selection may, in fact, simply be the consequence of natural selection occurring in stochastic environments with reproductive risks that are correlated across individuals. Those individuals with highly correlated risks will appear to form ""groups"", even if their actions are, in fact, totally autonomous, mindless, and, prior to selection, uniformly randomly distributed in the population. This framework implies that a separate theory of group selection is not strictly necessary to explain observed phenomena such as altruism and cooperation. At the same time, it shows that the notion of group selection does captures a unique aspect of evolution-selection with correlated reproductive risk-that may be sufficiently widespread to warrant a separate term for the phenomenon."

The association between protein intake and ΔBW or ΔWC were examined and interactions between SNP-score and protein were investigated. Analyses were based on linear regressions using macronutrient substitution models and meta-analyses.When protein replaced carbohydrate, meta-analyses showed no associations with ΔBW (41.0 gram/y/5 energy% protein, [95% CI: -32.3; 114.3]) or ΔWC (<-0.1 mm/y/5 energy % protein, [-1.1; 1.1]).

In humans agmatine is a neurotransmitter with affinities towards α2-adrenoreceptors, serotonin receptors, and may inhibit nitric oxide synthase. In bacteria agmatine serves as a precursor to polyamine synthesis and was recently shown to enhance biofilm development in some strains of the respiratory pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We determined agmatine is at the center of a competing metabolism in the human lung during airways infections and is influenced by the metabolic phenotypes of the infecting pathogens. Ultra performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection was used to measure agmatine in human sputum samples from patients with cystic fibrosis, spent supernatant from clinical sputum isolates, and from bronchoalvelolar lavage fluid from mice infected with P. aeruginosa agmatine mutants. Agmatine in human sputum peaks during illness, decreased with treatment and is positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines. Analysis of the agmatine metabolic phenotype in clinical sputum isolates revealed most deplete agmatine when grown in its presence; however a minority appeared to generate large amounts of agmatine presumably driving sputum agmatine to high levels. Agmatine exposure to inflammatory cells and in mice demonstrated its role as a direct immune activator with effects on TNF-α production, likely through NF-κB activation. P. aeruginosa mutants for agmatine detection and metabolism were constructed and show the real-time evolution of host-derived agmatine in the airways during acute lung infection. These experiments also demonstrated pathogen agmatine production can upregulate the inflammatory response. As some clinical isolates have adapted to hypersecrete agmatine, these combined data would suggest agmatine is a novel target for immune modulation in the host-pathogen dynamic."

https://openalex.org/W2008381046,"Here we report the characterization of an octopamine/tyramine (OA/TA or TyrR1) receptor (OA/TAMac) cloned from the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, an animal used in the study of agonistic social behavior. The invertebrate OA/TA receptors are seven trans-membrane domain G-protein coupled receptors that are related to vertebrate adrenergic receptors. Behavioral studies in arthropods indicate that octopaminergic signaling systems modulate fight or flight behaviors with octopamine and/or tyramine functioning in a similar way to the adrenalins in vertebrate systems. Despite the importance of octopamine signaling in behavioral studies of decapod crustaceans there are no functional data available for any of their octopamine or tyramine receptors. We expressed OA/TAMac in Xenopus oocytes where agonist-evoked trans-membrane currents were used as readouts of receptor activity. The currents were most effectively evoked by tyramine but were also evoked by octopamine and dopamine. They were effectively blocked by yohimbine. The electrophysiological approach we used enabled the continuous observation of complex dynamics over time. Using voltage steps, we were able to simultaneously resolve two types of endogenous currents that are affected over different time scales. At higher concentrations we observe that octopamine and tyramine can produce different and opposing effects on both of these currents, presumably through the activity of the single expressed receptor type. The pharmacological profile and apparent functional-selectivity are consistent with properties first observed in the OA/TA receptor from the insect Drosophila melanogaster. As the first functional data reported for any crustacean OA/TA receptor, these results suggest that functional-selectivity between tyramine and octopamine is a feature of this receptor type that may be conserved among arthropods."

Here we examine expression of Ace2 and Swi5 target genes and find that an rts1 mutation markedly reduces expression of the HO gene. The decreased HO expression in an rts1 mutant is significantly restored by an additional ace2 mutation, a surprising result because HO is normally activated by Swi5 but not by Ace2. Ace2 normally accumulates only in daughter cells, and only activates transcription in daughters. However, in an rts1 mutant, Ace2 is present in both mother and daughter cells. One of the genes activated by Ace2 is ASH1, a protein that normally accumulates mostly in daughter cells; Ash1 is a transcriptional repressor, and it blocks HO expression in daughters. We show that in the rts1 mutant, Ace2 accumulation in mother cells results in Ash1 expression in mothers, and the Ash1 can now repress HO expression in mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2313578452,"The modest protection afforded by the RV144 vaccine offers an opportunity to evaluate its mechanisms of protection. Differences between HIV-1 breakthrough viruses from vaccine and placebo recipients can be attributed to the RV144 vaccine as this was a randomized and double-blinded trial. CD8 and CD4 T cell epitope repertoires were predicted in HIV-1 proteomes from 110 RV144 participants. Predicted Gag epitope repertoires were smaller in vaccine than in placebo recipients (p = 0.019). After comparing participant-derived epitopes to corresponding epitopes in the RV144 vaccine, the proportion of epitopes that could be matched differed depending on the protein conservation (only 36% of epitopes in Env vs 84-91% in Gag/Pol/Nef for CD8 predicted epitopes) or on vaccine insert subtype (55% against CRF01_AE vs 7% against subtype B). To compare predicted epitopes to the vaccine, we analyzed predicted binding affinity and evolutionary distance measurements. Comparisons between the vaccine and placebo arm did not reveal robust evidence for a T cell driven sieve effect, although some differences were noted in Env-V2 (0.022≤p-value≤0.231). The paucity of CD8 T cell responses identified following RV144 vaccination, with no evidence for V2 specificity, considered together both with the association of decreased infection risk in RV 144 participants with V-specific antibody responses and a V2 sieve effect, lead us to hypothesize that this sieve effect was not T cell specific. Overall, our results did not reveal a strong differential impact of vaccine-induced T cell responses among breakthrough infections in RV144 participants."
https://openalex.org/W2013357542,"The retrotransposon DIRS-1 is the most abundant retroelement in Dictyostelium discoideum and constitutes the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the six chromosomes in D. discoideum. The vast majority of cellular siRNAs is derived from DIRS-1, suggesting that the element is controlled by RNAi-related mechanisms. We investigated the role of two of the five Argonaute proteins of D. discoideum, AgnA and AgnB, in DIRS-1 silencing. Deletion of agnA resulted in the accumulation of DIRS-1 transcripts, the expression of DIRS-1-encoded proteins, and the loss of most DIRS-1-derived secondary siRNAs. Simultaneously, extrachromosomal single-stranded DIRS-1 DNA accumulated in the cytoplasm of agnA− strains. These DNA molecules appear to be products of reverse transcription and thus could represent intermediate structures before transposition. We further show that transitivity of endogenous siRNAs is impaired in agnA− strains. The deletion of agnB alone had no strong effect on DIRS-1 transposon regulation. However, in agnA−/agnB− double mutant strains strongly reduced accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA compared with the single agnA− strains was observed.

However, in agnA−/agnB− double mutant strains strongly reduced accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA compared with the single agnA− strains was observed. Argonaute proteins are key players in all known RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways and are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Small regulatory RNAs of 20–30 nucleotides guide the Argonaute proteins to complementary RNA targets that lead typically to reduced expression levels of the respective genes. Silencing is achieved by mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, or by chromatin remodeling (1.Ghildiyal M. Zamore P.D. Small silencing RNAs: an expanding universe.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). The main classes of small regulatory RNAs are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs, and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that differ in their biogenesis and the mode of target regulation. The canonical triggers of siRNA-mediated gene silencing pathways are linear and perfectly base-paired dsRNA molecules that are processed by Dicer in the cytoplasm (2.Mello C.C. Conte Jr., D. Revealing the world of RNA interference.Nature. 2004; 431: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Endogenous siRNAs arise for example from transposons, pericentromeric repeats, or other repetitive sequences, whereas exogenous siRNAs originate from viruses or transgenes (3.Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Origins and Mechanisms of miRNAs and siRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 642-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3801) Google Scholar). The primary siRNA duplex is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex that contains an Argonaute protein at its center. After unwinding the duplex and removal of the passenger strand, the RNA-induced silencing complex assembly is completed (4.Meister G. Argonaute proteins: functional insights and emerging roles.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The siRNA usually guides the complex to perfectly complementary target RNAs that are cleaved by the Piwi domain and further degraded by exonucleases (5.Orban T.I. Izaurralde E. Decay of mRNAs targeted by RISC requires XRN1, the Ski complex, and the exosome.RNA. 2005; 11: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Some siRNA classes induce transcriptional rather than posttranscriptional silencing. In plants for example, cis-acting siRNAs (casiRNAs) derived from transposons initiate heterochromatin formation at loci from which they originate (6.Zheng X. Zhu J. Kapoor A. Zhu J.K. Role of Arabidopsis AGO6 in siRNA accumulation, DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1691-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7.Zilberman D. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. ARGONAUTE4 control of locus-specific siRNA accumulation and DNA and histone methylation.Science. 2003; 299: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Some organisms like plants, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Caenorhabditis elegans require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) 3The abbreviations used are: RdRPRNA-dependent RNA polymeraseLTRlong terminal repeatntnucleotidesqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionsnoRNAsmall nucleolar RNArcfrelative centrifugal forceITRinverted terminal repeat. for efficient RNA-mediated gene silencing on the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase long terminal repeat nucleotides quantitative reverse transcription small nucleolar RNA relative centrifugal force inverted terminal repeat. In the case of transgenes and some viruses, plant RdRPs initiate an RNAi response by catalyzing the synthesis of double-stranded RNA molecules (8.Luo Z. Chen Z. Improperly terminated, unpolyadenylated mRNA of sense transgenes is targeted by RDR6-mediated RNA silencing in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 943-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9.Voinnet O. Use, tolerance and avoidance of amplified RNA silencing by plants.Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This can lead to a >20-fold amplification of viral siRNAs and reduces virus accumulation efficiently (10.Wang X.B. Wu Q. Ito T. Cillo F. Li W.X. Chen X. Yu J.L. Ding S.W. RNAi-mediated viral immunity requires amplification of virus-derived siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of RdRP target specificity is not yet well understood. In contrast to plants, C. elegans RdRPs can directly synthesize short secondary siRNAs from an RNA template (11.Pak J. Fire A. Distinct populations of primary and secondary effectors during RNAi in C. elegans.Science. 2007; 315: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12.Sijen T. Steiner F.A. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H. Secondary siRNAs result from unprimed RNA synthesis and form a distinct class.Science. 2007; 315: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These secondary siRNAs are of antisense polarity and loaded onto Argonaute proteins of the WAGO-clade (12.Sijen T. Steiner F.A. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H. Secondary siRNAs result from unprimed RNA synthesis and form a distinct class.Science. 2007; 315: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The complexes contribute to target degradation, transposon silencing, and chromosomal segregation (13.Maida Y. Masutomi K. RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in RNA silencing.Biol. Chem. 2011; 392: 299-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary siRNAs, which are produced by Dicer, and secondary siRNAs, which are individual RdRP products, differ in that the latter have a 5′-triphosphate (11.Pak J. Fire A. Distinct populations of primary and secondary effectors during RNAi in C. elegans.Science. 2007; 315: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12.Sijen T. Steiner F.A. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H. Secondary siRNAs result from unprimed RNA synthesis and form a distinct class.Science. 2007; 315: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Primary siRNAs that associate with the Argonaute protein Rde-1 (14.Yigit E. Batista P.J. Bei Y. Pang K.M. Chen C.C. Tolia N.H. Joshua-Tor L. Mitani S. Simard M.J. Mello C.C. Analysis of the C. elegans Argonaute family reveals that distinct Argonautes act sequentially during RNAi.Cell. 2006; 127: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) constitute only a small amount of the siRNA pool in C. elegans and thus appear insufficient for robust gene silencing (15.Pak J.

Distinct roles for RDE-1 and RDE-4 during RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans.RNA. 2001; 7: 1397-1402PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the main function of primary RNA-induced silencing complexes appears to guide the RdRP machinery to the target RNAs for siRNA amplification (15.Pak J. Maniar J.M. Mello C.C. Fire A. Protection from feed-forward amplification in an amplified RNAi mechanism.Cell. 2012; 151: 885-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). From an evolutionary point of view, the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is an interesting model as it branched off from the tree of life after the plants but before the animal-fungi split (17.Eichinger L.

The genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.Nature. 2005; 435: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The amoebae are characterized by their ability to alternate between uni- and multicellularity; they grow as single cells, but upon starvation they form multicellular organisms in a developmental process that culminates in a fruiting body consisting predominantly of stalk and spore cells (18.Kessin R.H. Dictyostelium: Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001Crossref Google Scholar). D. discoideum is suitable in studying RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways (19.Martens H. Novotny J. Oberstrass J. Steck T.L. Postlethwait P. Nellen W. RNAi in Dictyostelium: the role of RNA-directed RNA polymerases and double-stranded RNase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as all RNAi key components, namely the Dicer homologues DrnA and DrnB, the RdRP homologues RrpA to RrpC, and five Argonaute proteins AgnA to AgnE, homologous to the Piwi-clade, are encoded in the genome (20.Cerutti H. Casas-Mollano J.A. On the origin and functions of RNA-mediated silencing: from protists to man.Curr. Genet. 2006; 50: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). RrpC is known to be involved in the accumulation of DIRS-1 siRNAs and transposon silencing (21.Wiegand S. Meier D. Seehafer C. Malicki M. Hofmann P. Schmith A. Winckler T. Földesi B. Boesler B. Nellen W. Reimegård J. Käller M. Hällman J. Emanuelsson O. Avesson L. Söderbom F. Hammann C. The Dictyostelium discoideum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RrpC silences the centromeric retrotransposon DIRS-1 post-transcriptionally and is required for the spreading of RNA silencing signals.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3330-3345Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Argonaute proteins are expressed at very different levels and at different times in development (Fig. 1A) (22.Rot G. Parikh A. Curk T. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Zupan B. dictyExpress: a Dictyostelium discoideum gene expression database with an explorative data analysis web-based interface.BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10: 265Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Developmental regulation is not surprising as retroelements and microRNAs, which are most likely regulated by Argonaute proteins, are differentially expressed in the developmental cycle (23.Hinas A. Reimegård J. Wagner E.G. Nellen W. Ambros V.R. Söderbom F.

An unusual transposon encoding heat shock inducible and developmentally regulated transcripts in Dictyostelium.Cell. 1983; 35: 243-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but so far no biological functions have been assigned to these proteins. Transposons and repetitive elements add up to 10% of the D. discoideum genome (25.Glöckner G. Szafranski K. Winckler T. Dingermann T. Quail M.A. Cox E. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Rosenthal A. The complex repeats of Dictyostelium discoideum.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transposable elements can be classified in long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, non-LTR retroelements, and DNA transposons. The most abundant transposable element in D. discoideum is the LTR retrotransposon DIRS-1 (26.Zuker C. Cappello J. Chisholm R.L. Lodish H.F. A repetitive Dictyostelium gene family that is induced during differentiation and by heat shock.Cell. 1983; 34: 997-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is present in 16 complete and up to 200 incomplete copies (27.Chung S.

Gonçalves I.R. Higuet D. Bonnivard E. Eukaryote DIRS1-like retrotransposons: an overview.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DIRS-1 elements are only found in clusters at the subtelomeric centromeres of all six chromosomes (17.Eichinger L. Pachebat J.A. Glöckner G. Rajandream M.A. Sucgang R. Berriman M. Song J. Olsen R.

Mobility of LTR retrotransposons is mediated by almost full-length transcripts that are synthesized by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus using a promoter within the 5′-LTR. The LTRs flank an internal region where structural proteins and enzymes for replication and subsequent transposition are encoded. The gag ORF encodes a protein that forms cytoplasmic or virus-like particles within which reverse transcription takes place. The pol ORF encodes several enzymes, among them the reverse transcriptase (RT) and an integrase that mediates cDNA insertion into the genome (30.Havecker E.R. Gao X. Voytas D.F. The diversity of LTR retrotransposons.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). DIRS-1 belongs to the DIRS group of LTR retrotransposons that have some unusual structural features compared with typical LTR elements: the three overlapping reading frames encode 1) a putative Gag protein (ORF1), 2) a tyrosine recombinase (ORF2) instead of an integrase (31.Cappello J. Handelsman K. Lodish H.F. Sequence of Dictyostelium DIRS-1: an apparent retrotransposon with inverted terminal repeats and an internal circle junction sequence.Cell. 1985; 43: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and 3) a RT, an RNase H, and a methyltransferase domain in ORF3 (Fig. 2A) (28.Piednoël M. Gonçalves I.R. Higuet D. Bonnivard E. Eukaryote DIRS1-like retrotransposons: an overview.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The flanking LTRs are inverted (ITR), they are not absolutely identical in their sequence, and a 27-bp extension is present at the edge of the right ITR (27.Chung S. Zuker C. Lodish H.F. A repetitive and apparently transposable DNA sequence in Dictyostelium discoideum associated with developmentally regulated RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4835-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31.Cappello J.

Sequence of Dictyostelium DIRS-1: an apparent retrotransposon with inverted terminal repeats and an internal circle junction sequence.Cell. 1985; 43: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, the element harbors an internal segment close to the right ITR, which is referred to as the internal complementary region, because it contains the reverse complement of the outer nucleotides of both ITRs (31.Cappello J. Handelsman K. Lodish H.F. Sequence of Dictyostelium DIRS-1: an apparent retrotransposon with inverted terminal repeats and an internal circle junction sequence.Cell. 1985; 43: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on these specific features, models for replication and transposition have been proposed (31.Cappello J. Handelsman K. Lodish H.F. Sequence of Dictyostelium DIRS-1: an apparent retrotransposon with inverted terminal repeats and an internal circle junction sequence.Cell. 1985; 43: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32.Poulter R.T. Goodwin T.J. DIRS-1 and the other tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 110: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but without any experimental evidence so far. According to the model, the internal complementary region is suggested to serve as a template to restore the ITR sequences during cDNA synthesis. Self-ligation of the cDNA would generate a single-stranded circular DNA. After conversion to a double-stranded circle, site-specific recombination could occur. This is supported by the fact that DIRS-1 targets pre-existing DIRS-1 elements for integration without generating a target site duplication (31.Cappello J. Handelsman K. Lodish H.F. Sequence of Dictyostelium DIRS-1: an apparent retrotransposon with inverted terminal repeats and an internal circle junction sequence.Cell. 1985; 43: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transcription of the 4.8-kb DIRS-1 element starts within the left ITR and terminates close to the extended sequence of the right ITR (33.Cohen S.M. Cappello J. Lodish H.F. Transcription of Dictyostelium discoideum transposable element DIRS-1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2332-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). DIRS-1 generates a population of several polyadenylated RNAs that accumulate during development and upon heat shock (26.Zuker C. Cappello J. Chisholm R.L. Lodish H.F. A repetitive Dictyostelium gene family that is induced during differentiation and by heat shock.Cell. 1983; 34: 997-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, a long antisense transcript driven by the right ITR has been identified in the D. discoideum wild type strain and in several mutants (21.Wiegand S. Meier D. Seehafer C. Malicki M. Hofmann P. Schmith A. Winckler T. Földesi B. Boesler B. Nellen W. Reimegård J. Käller M. Hällman J. Emanuelsson O. Avesson L. Söderbom F. Hammann C.

Bidirectional transcription and Dicer cleavage of the resulting double-stranded RNAs could, therefore, be the source of primary siRNAs. Hinas et al. (23.Hinas A. Reimegård J. Wagner E.G. Nellen W. Ambros V.R. Söderbom F. The small RNA repertoire of Dictyostelium discoideum and its regulation by components of the RNAi pathway.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6714-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that some of the DIRS-1-derived siRNAs are Dicer and some of them are RdRP products. To elucidate the function of Argonaute proteins in general and specifically in DIRS-1 silencing, we focused on AgnA and AgnB as AgnC, -D, and -E knockouts have no obvious effect on DIRS-1 regulation. 4F. Soederbom and T. Winckler, personal communication. We find that AgnA is involved in generation of siRNAs and in posttranscriptional regulation of DIRS-1. In contrast, AgnB appears to be an unusual positive regulator of DIRS-1 in that its knock-out abolishes accumulation of DIRS-1 cDNA in an AgnA- strain. All D. discoideum strains were grown axenically in HL5+ medium (Formedia) supplemented with Blasticidin S and/or Geneticin at concentrations of 10 μg/ml when required. Transformation into the axenic strain Ax2 or derivates was done by electroporation as described previously (34.Gaudet P. Pilcher K.E. Fey P. Chisholm R.L. Transformation of Dictyostelium discoideum with plasmid DNA.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For agnA gene (accession number DDB_G0276299) disruption a 2531-bp-long fragment (−222 bp upstream and 2309 bp downstream of the ATG) of the agnA gene was amplified by PCR with primers BB049 and BB050 and ligated into pGEM®-T-Easy. The Blasticidin resistance (Bsr) cassette (35.Sutoh K. A transformation vector for Dictyostelium discoideum with a new selectable marker bsr.Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was cloned in the agnA gene fragment via the endogenous BglII site. The vector for the agnB gene (accession number DDB_G0290377) disruption was generated in the following way; the whole 2963-bp-long agnB gene was amplified by PCR using primers BB184 and BB185. A Bsr cassette flanked by LoxP sites was isolated from the pLPBLP vector (36.Faix J. Kreppel L. Shaulsky G. Schleicher M. Kimmel A.R.

Gene disruption plasmids were linearized before transformation. Mutants were analyzed by PCR. For the agnA−/agnB− double mutant, the Bsr cassette from the agnB− strain was removed by transient expression of the Cre recombinase (36.Faix J. Kreppel L. Shaulsky G. Schleicher M. Kimmel A.R.

Single, Blasticidin-sensitive clones were examined by PCR and then supertransformed with the agnA gene disruption construct. Single clones of the double mutant were analyzed by PCR. For the analysis of molecular phenotypes, two independent clones each were used. Overexpressing constructs to monitor 3′-spreading activity in the DIRS-1 element were published previously (21.Wiegand S. Meier D. Seehafer C. Malicki M. Hofmann P. Schmith A. Winckler T. Földesi B.

The Notch family of receptors plays important roles in cell fate specification during development and in adult tissues, and aberrant hyperactive Notch signaling causes some forms of cancer. γ-Secretase-mediated processing of Notch at the cell surface results in the generation of the Notch intracellular domain, which associates with several transcriptional coactivators involved in nuclear signaling events. On the other hand, γ-secretase-mediated processing of amyloid precursor protein leads to the production of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides that play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. We used a phage display approach to identify synthetic antibodies that specifically target NCT and expressed them in the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) format in mammalian cells. We show that expression of a NCT-specific scFv clone, G9, in HEK293 cells decreased the production of the Notch intracellular domain but not the production of amyloid β peptides that occurs in endosomal and recycling compartments. Biochemical studies revealed that scFvG9 impairs the maturation of NCT by associating with immature forms of NCT and, consequently, prevents its association with the other components of the γ-secretase complex, leading to degradation of these molecules. The reduced cell surface levels of mature γ-secretase complexes, in turn, compromise the intramembranous processing of Notch.

In all cases, ectodomain shedding is a prerequisite for intramembranous cleavage. In the case of Notch, a signaling receptor essential for cell lineage determination, cell proliferation, and survival, γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of a membrane-tethered stub of Notch, termed NEXT, on the cell surface leads to the generation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (2Fortini M.E. Notch signaling: the core pathway and its posttranslational regulation.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of Notch signaling has been linked to many diseases, including several types of cancers, such as human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer (3Capaccione K.M. Pine S.R. The Notch signaling pathway as a mediator of tumor survival.Carcinogenesis. 2013; 34: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, shedding of the APP ectodomain leads to the generation of membrane-tethered APP-CTFs, which are then subject to γ-secretase processing in late Golgi and endosomal compartments (4Tolia A. De Strooper B. Structure and function of γ-secretase.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to generate Aβ peptides. Aβ peptides are 38- to 43-amino acid peptides, the principal component of plaques in the brains of patients with AD (5Haass C. Kaether C. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S. Trafficking and proteolytic processing of APP.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006270Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that γ-secretase inhibitors may serve as promising treatments for AD, but recent clinical trials of such reagents have been terminated because of Notch-based liabilities. To overcome these confounding issues, investigations have focused on the development of small molecule γ-secretase modulators that can differentially affect the processing of APP and Notch (6Kounnas M.Z.

During the last step of assembly, PEN-2 is recruited to this immature complex and promotes the endoproteolysis of full-length PS into fragments that remain associated in the mature complex (16Takasugi N.

The role of presenilin cofactors in the γ-secretase complex.Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase then exits the endoplasmic reticulum, and the NCT subunit acquires complex glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus (20Herreman A.

In this regard, we reported that a synthetic antibody fragment that targets the NCT ectodomain (ECD) impairs the γ-secretase-mediated processing of both Notch and APP in in vitro assays (21Zhang X. Hoey R.J. Lin G. Koide A. Leung B. Ahn K. Dolios G. Paduch M. Ikeuchi T. Wang R. Li Y.M. Koide S. Sisodia S.S.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8534-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated additional NCT-specific synthetic antibodies using phage display technology and then reformatted the cDNAs encoding these antibodies to corresponding cDNAs encoding single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) (25Hust M. Jostock T. Menzel C. Voedisch B. Mohr A. Brenneis M. Kirsch M.I. Meier D. Dübel S. Single chain Fab (scFab) fragment.BMC Biotechnol. 2007; 7: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that were then stably expressed in HEK293 cells that constitutively express the APP “Swedish” (APPSwe) variant that causes early onset familial AD (26Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. A pathogenic mutation for probable Alzheimer's disease in the APP gene at the N-terminus of β-amyloid.Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). We now describe the analysis of two anti-NCT-specific antibodies that, following conversion to scFvs, bind to the NCT ECD in vitro. In HEK293 cells that stably express one of these antibodies, termed scFvG9, NCT maturation is impaired and leads to reduced level on the cell surface, where the Notch derivative, NEXT, is subject to γ-secretase processing at the “ϵ” site. On the other hand, γ-secretase that is present in the Golgi apparatus and endosomal/recycling compartments in cells expressing scFvG9 is fully capable of processing APPSwe to generate Aβ peptides. Therefore, we suggest that scFvG9 affects both the maturation of NCT and subcellular distribution of γ-secretase that leads to differential processing of APP versus Notch. Full-length human NCT was C-terminally tagged with a CT11 tag (27Renzi F. Zhang X. Rice W.J. Torres-Arancivia C. Gomez-Llorente Y. Diaz R. Ahn K. Yu C. Li Y.M. Sisodia S.S. Ubarretxena-Belandia I.

The entire ECD segment or a region corresponding to exons 7–16 (716) of nicastrin were C-terminally tagged with a His6 tag (21Zhang X. Hoey R.J. Lin G. Koide A. Leung B. Ahn K. Dolios G. Paduch M.

HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing either wild-type human APP or the human APP Swedish variant were stably transfected with an empty vector or cDNAs encoding an scFv using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen).

Heavy chain and light chain sequences of NCT-specific Fabs A9 and G9 as well as those of the negative control Fab2-2 were used as templates for the amplification of VH and VL regions by PCR. The VH region was amplified using the following primers: human transthyretin-VH, 5′-GTATTTGTGTCTGAGGCTGGCCCTACGGGCACCGGTGAGATCTCCGAGGTTCAGCTG-3′ (forward); LK-VH, 5′-GCCGCCAGAACC GCCGC CACCAGAGCCACCACCACCGGCCGAGGAGACGGTGACCAGGGT-3′ (reverse).

The VH and VL regions were linked by a 15-amino acid peptide containing the three repeats of GGGGS. The human transthyretin signal peptide sequence was fused to the N terminus of the VH region, and a myc-His6 tag was attached to the C terminus of the VL region. The resulting cDNA was cloned into the pAG vector. Conditioned medium from cells secreting ECD and 716 fragments was subjected to immunoprecipitation with Fabs 2-2, 2, 12, A9, and G9 essentially as described earlier (21Zhang X. Hoey R.J. Lin G.

In this study, a mixture of protein A and protein L beads (Thermo Scientific) was used for the capture of Fab-antigen complexes. To obtain secreted scFv proteins, cDNAs encoding scFv 2-2, scFvA9, and scFvG9 were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells for 48 h, and the conditioned media were collected. To assess the interaction between the ECD and these scFv proteins, conditioned medium from stable ECD-expressing cells was mixed with the conditioned medium containing secreted individual scFv protein. The mixture was adjusted with 5× PBS to a final concentration of 1× PBS and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The ECD-scFv complex was captured with protein A beads (Thermo Scientific) and detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-His6 antibody. To assess the conversion of full-length mouse NΔE into the NICD fragment, HEK293 APPSwe/scFv cells were transfected with cDNA encoding mouse NΔE and labeled for 40 min with 250 μCi [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Then the cells were chased for 2 h. In experiments to analyze the processing of APP, HEK293 APPSwe/scFv cells were either labeled for 10 min or 4 h with 250 μCi [35S]methionine. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and the total radioactivity (cpm) was determined after TCA precipitation by a liquid scintillation counter. Cell lysates of equal cpm were used for the immunoprecipitation of mouse NΔE, NICD, and full-length APP and its derivatives. Immunoprecipitated mouse NΔE and NICD fragments were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE; soluble APP was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE; and full-length APP, APP CTFs, and Aβ peptides were resolved on a Tris-Tricine gel. Resolved proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen or to an x-ray film. The PhosphorImager screen was scanned using a Storm Imager (GE Healthcare). Imagequant 5.0 software was used for the image analysis. Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ 42 peptides in conditioned media of HEK293 APPSwe/scFv stable cells were quantitated by ELISA utilizing the Meso Scale Discovery Aβ triplex immunoassay with 4G8 detection (catalog no. K15141E-1, MSD, Rockville, MD). The kit was run according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 25 μl of MSD SULFO-TAG-conjugated 4G8 detection antibody, and 25 μl of sample was added to a blocked MSD multiplex plate precoated with capture antibodies specific for Aβ 38, Aβ 40, and Aβ 42 and incubated for 2 h with shaking at room temperature. The plate was read on an MSD SECTOR® Imager 2400 after addition of read buffer. Concentrations of Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 in samples were back-fitted from the respective standard curves using MSD Workbench software. Membranes were prepared from HEK293swe/scFv-stable cells. Reactions were performed at 37 °C, and the production of NICD was determined using AlphaLISA signals (21Zhang X. Hoey R.J. Lin G. Koide A. Leung B. Ahn K. Dolios G. Paduch M. Ikeuchi T. Wang R.

Mazzarelli L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Analysis of proteins and peptides directly from biological fluids by immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry.Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 439-452PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ peptides in 300 μl of conditioned medium from HEK293 cells stably expressing APPSwe were immunoprecipitated by incubating overnight with 1.5 μl of 4G8 antibody and 5.0 μl of protein A/protein G plus beads. Mass spectra were collected using a TOF/TOF 5800 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). Each mass spectrum was accumulated from 2000 laser shots and calibrated using bovine insulin (an internal mass calibrant). HEK293 APPSwe/scFv cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPSO, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, and 1× protease mixture (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation, 3 μl of 9E10 or N-19 antibody or 1 μl of PS1NT antibody was added to each reaction, respectively. A comparable amount of normal mouse IgG or rabbit IgG was added to the control reactions. The mixtures were then incubated overnight in a cold room. The immunoprecipitated complexes were captured either by protein G beads (for 9E10 and N-19) or by protein A beads (for PS1NT) that were washed three times with lysis buffer. γ-Secretase complexes were released from the beads by incubation in Laemmli buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. HEK293 APPSwe/scFv cells were grown to near confluence in a 10-cm plate and subjected to cell surface biotinylation with 0.8 mm sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[biotinamido]ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Thermo Scientific) essentially as described previously (35Ikeuchi T.

https://openalex.org/W2087665413,"Rod tetrameric arrestin 1 (tet-ARR1), stored in the outer nuclear layer/inner segments in the dark, modulates photoreceptor synaptic activity; light exposure stimulates a reduction via translocation to the outer segments for terminating G-protein coupled photo-transduction signaling. Here, we test the hypothesis that intraretinal spin-lattice relaxation rate in the rotating frame (1/T1ρ), an endogenous MRI contrast mechanism, has high potential for evaluating rod tet-ARR1 and its reduction via translocation. Dark- and light-exposed mice (null for the ARR1 gene, overexpressing ARR1, diabetic, or wild type with or without treatment with Mn2+, a calcium channel probe) were studied using 1/T1ρ MRI. Immunohistochemistry and single-cell recordings of the retinas were also performed. In wild-type mice with or without treatment with Mn2+, 1/T1ρ of avascular outer retina (64% to 72% depth) was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the dark than in the light; a significant (P < 0.05) but opposite pattern was noted in the inner retina (<50% depth). Light-evoked outer retina Δ1/T1ρ was absent in ARR1-null mice and supernormal in overexpressing mice. In diabetic mice, the outer retinal Δ1/T1ρ pattern suggested normal dark-to-light tet-ARR1 translocation and chromophore content, conclusions confirmed ex vivo. Light-stimulated Δ1/T1ρ in inner retina was linked to changes in blood volume. Our data support 1/T1ρ MRI for noninvasively assessing rod tet-ARR1 and its reduction via protein translocation, which can be combined with other metrics of retinal function in vivo.—Berkowitz, B.

https://openalex.org/W2088346145,"Background The incidence of diabetes is increasing. But the impact of diabetes and prediabetes on survival of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has received little evaluation. Methods In a cohort of 5,860 patients, we compared the disease specific survival (DSS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients with diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia defined by pretreatment fasting plasma glucose (FPG) using Kaplan–Meier method, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Results Comparing to normoglycemic patients, the diabetic and the prediabetic were generally older, fatter, had hypertension, heart diseases and hyperlipaemia and usually received radiotherapy alone. But both the diabetic and the prediabetic had similar DSS, LRFS and DMFS to normoglycemic patients, even adjusting for such important factors as age, gender, smoking, drinking, hypertension, heart diseases, body mass index, hyperlipaemia, titer of VCA-IgA and EA-IgA, pathology, T-stage, N-stage, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (P>0.05 for all). Additionally, the findings remained unchanged in sensitivity analysis by excluding patients with known diabetes history and in subgroups of the various factors. Conclusions The diabetic and prediabetic NPC patients had similar survival to normoglycemic NPC patients. These data, in the largest reported cohort, are the first to evaluate the association between diabetes, prediabetes and the survival in NPC. The findings are relevant to patient management and provided evidence of the effect on this disease exerted by comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W1987285391,"Background There is an ongoing debate whether stroke patients presenting with minor or moderate symptoms benefit from thrombolysis. Up until now, stroke severity on admission is typically measured with the NIHSS, and subsequently used for treatment decision. Hypothesis Acute MRI lesion volume assessment can aid in therapy decision for iv-tPA in minor stroke. Methods We analysed 164 patients with NIHSS 0–7 from a prospective stroke MRI registry, the 1000+ study (clinicaltrials.org NCT00715533). Patients were examined in a 3 T MRI scanner and either received (n = 62) or did not receive thrombolysis (n = 102). DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) and PI (perfusion imaging) at admission were evaluated for diffusion - perfusion mismatch. Our primary outcome parameter was final lesion volume, defined by lesion volume on day 6 FLAIR images. Results The association between t-PA and FLAIR lesion volume on day 6 was significantly different for patients with smaller DWI volume compared to patients with larger DWI volume (interaction between DWI and t-PA: p = 0.021). Baseline DWI lesion volume was dichotomized at the median (0.7 ml): final lesion volume at day 6 was larger in patients with large baseline DWI volumes without t-PA treatment (median difference 3, IQR −0.4–9.3 ml). Conversely, in patients with larger baseline DWI volumes final lesion volumes were smaller after t-PA treatment (median difference 0, IQR −4.1–5 ml). However, this did not translate into a significant difference in the mRS at day 90 (p = 0.577). Conclusion Though this study is only hypothesis generating considering the number of cases, we believe that the size of DWI lesion volume may support therapy decision in patients with minor stroke.

https://openalex.org/W2079152431,"At embryonic stages, Olig3 is initially expressed in the dorsal-most region of the spinal cord, but later in the ventral marginal zone as well. Previous studies indicated that Olig3 controlled the patterning of dorsal spinal cord and loss of Olig3 function led to the re-specification of dI2 and dI3 neurons into dI4 interneurons. However, the role of Olig3 in regulating the development of ventral spinal cord has remained unknown. BrdU labeling demonstrated that ventral Olig3 was expressed in the post-mitotic neurons and Olig3+ cells seen at late embryonic stages were born at the earlier stage but remained in the marginal zone throughout embryogenesis. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiment indicated that Nkx2.2 regulated the expression of Olig3 in V3 interneurons. However, Olig3 mutation didn’t apparently affect the generation and migration of ventral neurons. These findings suggest that Olig3 plays different roles in regulating the development of dorsal and ventral spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2093873689,"Background Renal aging is characterized by functional and structural changes like decreased glomerular filtration rate, and glomerular, tubular and interstitial damage. To gain insight in pathways involved in renal aging, we studied aged mouse strains and used genetic analysis to identify genes associated with aging phenotypes. Methods Upon morphological screening in kidneys from 20-month-old mice from 26 inbred strains we noted intracapillary PAS-positive deposits. The severity of these deposits was quantified by scoring of a total of 50 glomeruli per section (grade 0–4). Electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining for apoE, apoB, apoA-IV and perilipin-2 was performed to further characterize the lesions. To identify loci associated with these PAS-positive intracapillary glomerular deposits, we performed haplotype association mapping. Results Six out of 26 mouse strains showed glomerular PAS-positive deposits. The severity of these deposits varied: NOD(0.97), NZW(0.41), NON(0.30), B10(0.21), C3 H(0.9) and C57BR(0.7). The intracapillary deposits were strongly positive for apoE and weakly positive for apoB and apoA-IV. Haplotype association mapping showed a strong association with a 30-Kb haplotype block on Chr 1 within the Esrrg gene. We investigated 1 Mb on each site of this region, which includes the genes Spata17, Gpatch2, Esrrg, Ush2a and Kctd3. Conclusions By analyzing 26 aged mouse strains we found that some strains developed an intracapillary PAS and apoE-positive lesion and identified a small haplotype block on Chr 1 within the Esrrg gene to be associated with these lipoprotein deposits. The region spanning this haplotype block contains the genes Spata17, Gpatch2, Esrrg, Ush2a and Kctd3, which are all highly expressed in the kidney. Esrrg might be involved in the evolvement of these glomerular deposits by influencing lipid metabolism and possibly immune reponses."
https://openalex.org/W2096578607,"Humanized monoclonal antibody KD-247 targets the Gly312-Pro313-Gly314-Arg315 arch of the third hypervariable (V3) loop of the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein. It potently neutralizes many HIV-1 clade B isolates, but not of other clades. To understand the molecular basis of this specificity, we solved a high-resolution (1.55 Å) crystal structure of the KD-247 antigen binding fragment and examined the potential interactions with various V3 loop targets. Unlike most antibodies, KD-247 appears to interact with its target primarily through light chain residues. Several of these interactions involve Arg315 of the V3 loop. To evaluate the role of light chain residues in the recognition of the V3 loop, we generated 20 variants of KD-247 single-chain variable fragments with mutations in the antigen-binding site. Purified proteins were assessed for V3 loop binding using Alpha-Screen technology and for HIV-1 neutralization. Our data revealed that recognition of the clade-specificity defining residue Arg315 of the V3 loop is based on a network of interactions that involve TyrL32, TyrL92, and AsnL27d that directly interact with Arg315, thus elucidating the molecular interactions of KD-247 with its V3 loop target—Kirby, K.
