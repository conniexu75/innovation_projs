https://openalex.org/W2025696977,"A new model has been constructed for calculating the level of atmospheric CO(2) during the past 570 million years. A series of successive steady states for CO(2) is used in order to calculate CO(2) level from a feedback function for the weathering of silicate minerals. Processes considered are: sedimentary burial of organic matter and carbonates; continental weathering of silicates, carbonates, and organic matter; and volcanic and metamorphic degassing of CO(2). Sediment burial rates are calculated with the use of an isotope mass-balance model and carbon isotopic data on ancient seawater. Weathering rates are calculated from estimates of past changes in continental land area, mean elevation, and river runoff combined with estimates of the effects of the evolution of vascular land plants. Past degassing rates are estimated from changes in the rate of generation of sea floor and the shift of carbonate deposition from platforms to the deep sea. The model results indicate that CO(2) levels were high during the Mesozoic and early Paleozoic and low during the Permo-Carboniferous and late Cenozoic. These results correspond to independently deduced Phanerozoic paleoclimates and support the notion that the atmospheric CO(2) greenhouse mechanism is a major control on climate over very long time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2028277546,"Because availability of resources often limits seed or fruit set, increased visits by pollinators may not always lead to increases in maternal reproduction. This observation has led evolutionary biologists to hypothesize that a plant's ability to attract pollinators may have its primary impact on male fitness achieved through the fertlization of ovules. This interpretation of angiosperm reproductive ecology is supported by field experiments. Pollinating insects strongly discriminated between two Mendelian petal-color morphs in Raphanus raphanistrum, a widespread, self-incompatible crucifer. In experimental populations composed of petal-color homozygotes. color discrimination by naturally occurring pollinators had no statistically significant effect on relative maternal function (fruit and seed production) in the two morphs. In contrast, yellow-flowered individuals were far more successful as fathers (pollen donors) than were the less visited whites. These results suggest that the evolution of floral signals such as petal color may be driven primarily by selection on male function."
https://openalex.org/W2049051386,"Individual aerosol particles from the remote marine atmosphere were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe analysis. A large fraction of the silicate mineral component of the aerosol was found to be internally mixed with sea-salt aerosol particles. This observation explains the unexpected similarity in the size distributions of silicates and sea salt that has been observed in remote marine aerosols. Reentrainment of dust particles previously deposited onto the sea surface and collision between aerosol particles can be excluded as possible source mechanisms for these internally mixed aerosols. The internal mixing could be produced by processes within clouds, including droplet coalescence. Cloud processes may also be responsible for the observed enrichment of excess (nonsea-salt) sulfate on sea-salt particles."
https://openalex.org/W1971438331,"Concentrations of the halocrbons CCl(3)F (F-11), CCl(2)F(2) (F-12), CCl(4), and CH(3)CCl(3), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) over the decade between 1975 and 1985 are reported, based on measurements taken every January at the South Pole and in the Pacific Northwest. The concentrations of F-11, F-12, and CH(3)CCl(3) in both hemispheres are now more than twice their concentrations 10 years ago. However, the annual rates of increase of F-11, F-12, and CH(3)CC1(3) are now considerably slower than earlier in the decade, reflecting in part the effects of a ban on their nonessential uses. Continued increases in these trace gas concentrations may warm the earth and deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, which may cause widespread climatic changes and affect global habitability."
https://openalex.org/W1990766352,"Unimolecular reactions are crucial chemical events that have been the focus of increasingly sophisticated investigation in the past decade. Unraveling their details is one fundamental goal of experimental and theoretical studies of chemical dynamics. New techniques are revealing the possibilities, and challenges, of eigenstate- and bondspecific unimolecular reactions. These experiments clearly demonstrate the intimate connection between intramolecular processes and unimolecular reaction dynamics and suggest means of exploiting molecular properties to study and control reactions at the level of individual quantum states."
https://openalex.org/W2032416123,"Colloidal aggregation and other random growth processes produce structures that behave differently from ordinary bulk matter. Much of this behavior can be described in terms of the invariance of the aggregates under changes of spatial length scale: they appear to be fractals. There are two types of basic mechanisms for producing fractal aggregates. Those in which aggregation proceeds cluster by cluster can be understood qualitatively in terms of a solvable schematic model. The diffusion-limited aggregation or deposition of individual particles to make a large cluster is not as well understood. It is closely related to several irreversible processes in other areas of physics, such as two-fluid displacement in porous materials and the dielectric breakdown of insulators. More generally, disorderly growth mechanisms provide structures having unique properties, many of which can be understood by using simple statistical principles."
https://openalex.org/W2017048847,"Real-time synchrotron diffraction has been used to monitor the phase transformations of highly exothermic, fast self-propagating solid combustion reactions on a subsecond time scale down to 100 milliseconds and in some instances to 10 milliseconds. Three systems were investigated: Ti + C --> TiC; Ti + C + xNi --> TiC + Ni-Ti alloy; and Al + Ni --> AlNi. In all three reactions, the first step was the melting of the metal reactants. Formation of TiC in the first two reactions was completed within 400 milliseconds of the melting of the Ti metal, indicating that the formation of TiC took place during the passage of the combustion wave front. In the Al + Ni reaction, however, passage of the wave front was followed by the appearance and disappearance of at least one intermediate in the afterburn region. The final AlNi was formed some 5 seconds later and exhibited a delayed appearance of the (210) reflection, which tends to support a phase transformation from a disordered AlNi phase at high temperature to an ordered CsCl structure some 20 seconds later. This new experimental approach can be used to study the chemical dynamics of high-temperature solid-state phenomena and to provide the needed database to test various models for solid combustion."
https://openalex.org/W2037445741,"Knowledge of the critical temperature, T(*), the temperature at which a phase change occurs, greatly improves the efficiency of simulated annealing when used for optimization or inversion. A numerical method of accurately determining T(*) in a relatively short computation time has been developed. This method is used to recover the seismic soundspeed profile from wavefield data, a problem in which cycle skipping causes many local minima of the energy function and the averaging of the medium by finite length waves results in many states with similar energies. Computations indicate that it is cost-effective to spend about 80 percent of the computing budget looking for T(*) instead of annealing, and that in the course of finding T(*) many states with energies near the global minimum will also be found. The a posteriori probability distribution of the solution has been constructed from trial solutions generated at T(*)."

https://openalex.org/W2018025870,"The large amplitude oscillations of the shape of Neptune's Great Dark Spot are well reproduced by simple dynamical models of an isolated vortex embedded in a background shear flow. From the time series of the aspect ratio and inclination of the vortex values are estimated for the background shear and the mean vorticity of the Great Dark Spot, and a lower bound is placed on the value of the Rossby deformation radius. These models imply the existence of a planetary-scale zone of deterministic chaotic advection in the atmosphere of Neptune."

https://openalex.org/W1977463469,"Analysis of seismograph network data, earthquake catalogs from 1727 to 1982, and paleoseismic data for the central and eastern United States indicate that the Poisson probability of a damaging earthquake (magnitude â‰¥ 6.0) occurring during the next 30 years is at a moderate to high level (0.4 to 0.6). When differences in seismic wave attenuation are taken into account, the central and eastern United States has approximately two-thirds the likelihood of California to produce an earthquake with comparable damage area and societal impact within the next 30 years."
