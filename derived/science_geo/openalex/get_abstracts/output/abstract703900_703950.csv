https://openalex.org/W4308620767,"Metal halide perovskites are attracting a lot of attention as next-generation light-emitting materials owing to their excellent emission properties, with narrow band emission1–4. However, perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), irrespective of their material type (polycrystals or nanocrystals), have not realized high luminance, high efficiency and long lifetime simultaneously, as they are influenced by intrinsic limitations related to the trade-off of properties between charge transport and confinement in each type of perovskite material5–8. Here, we report an ultra-bright, efficient and stable PeLED made of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals with a size of approximately 10 nm, obtained using a simple in situ reaction of benzylphosphonic acid (BPA) additive with three-dimensional (3D) polycrystalline perovskite films, without separate synthesis processes. During the reaction, large 3D crystals are split into nanocrystals and the BPA surrounds the nanocrystals, achieving strong carrier confinement. The BPA shell passivates the undercoordinated lead atoms by forming covalent bonds, and thereby greatly reduces the trap density while maintaining good charge-transport properties for the 3D perovskites. We demonstrate simultaneously efficient, bright and stable PeLEDs that have a maximum brightness of approximately 470,000 cd m−2, maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.9% (average = 25.2 ± 1.6% over 40 devices), maximum current efficiency of 151 cd A−1 and half-lifetime of 520 h at 1,000 cd m−2 (estimated half-lifetime >30,000 h at 100 cd m−2). Our work sheds light on the possibility that PeLEDs can be commercialized in the future display industry. The authors develop a method for the production of ultra-bright, efficient and stable perovskite light-emitting diodes, achieved with a simple in situ reaction process."
https://openalex.org/W4308683905,"Abstract Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral targeting the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to be clinically useful against COVID-19 (refs. 1,2 ). However, because SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities 3–9 , there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here we examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both and their sequences showed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment peformed with many replicates, 53 independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23 different residues of the enzyme. Nevertheless, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones showed that these mutations mediated only low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (around 100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir does readily arise via multiple pathways in vitro, and the specific mutations observed herein form a strong foundation from which to study the mechanism of resistance in detail and to inform the design of next-generation protease inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W4308620586,"Macrophages are important players in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis1. Perivascular and leptomeningeal macrophages reside near the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma2, and their role in CNS physiology has not been sufficiently well studied. Given their continuous interaction with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and strategic positioning, we refer to these cells collectively as parenchymal border macrophages (PBMs). Here we demonstrate that PBMs regulate CSF flow dynamics. We identify a subpopulation of PBMs that express high levels of CD163 and LYVE1 (scavenger receptor proteins), closely associated with the brain arterial tree, and show that LYVE1+ PBMs regulate arterial motion that drives CSF flow. Pharmacological or genetic depletion of PBMs led to accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, obstructing CSF access to perivascular spaces and impairing CNS perfusion and clearance. Ageing-associated alterations in PBMs and impairment of CSF dynamics were restored after intracisternal injection of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing data obtained from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and from non-AD individuals point to changes in phagocytosis, endocytosis and interferon-γ signalling on PBMs, pathways that are corroborated in a mouse model of AD. Collectively, our results identify PBMs as new cellular regulators of CSF flow dynamics, which could be targeted pharmacologically to alleviate brain clearance deficits associated with ageing and AD. Perivascular and leptomeningeal macrophages, collectively termed here parenchymal border macrophages, are shown to regulate flow dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid, implicating this cell population as new therapeutic targets in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s."

https://openalex.org/W4308620811,"Genome sequencing of cancers often reveals mosaics of different subclones present in the same tumour1-3. Although these are believed to arise according to the principles of somatic evolution, the exact spatial growth patterns and underlying mechanisms remain elusive4,5. Here, to address this need, we developed a workflow that generates detailed quantitative maps of genetic subclone composition across whole-tumour sections. These provide the basis for studying clonal growth patterns, and the histological characteristics, microanatomy and microenvironmental composition of each clone. The approach rests on whole-genome sequencing, followed by highly multiplexed base-specific in situ sequencing, single-cell resolved transcriptomics and dedicated algorithms to link these layers. Applying the base-specific in situ sequencing workflow to eight tissue sections from two multifocal primary breast cancers revealed intricate subclonal growth patterns that were validated by microdissection. In a case of ductal carcinoma in situ, polyclonal neoplastic expansions occurred at the macroscopic scale but segregated within microanatomical structures. Across the stages of ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis, subclone territories are shown to exhibit distinct transcriptional and histological features and cellular microenvironments. These results provide examples of the benefits afforded by spatial genomics for deciphering the mechanisms underlying cancer evolution and microenvironmental ecology."
https://openalex.org/W4308655303,"In most cosmological models, rapid expansion of space marks the first moments of the Universe and leads to the amplification of quantum fluctuations1. The description of subsequent dynamics and related questions in cosmology requires an understanding of the quantum fields of the standard model and dark matter in curved spacetime. Even the reduced problem of a scalar quantum field in an explicitly time-dependent spacetime metric is a theoretical challenge2-5, and thus a quantum field simulator can lead to insights. Here we demonstrate such a quantum field simulator in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate with a configurable trap6,7 and adjustable interaction strength to implement this model system. We explicitly show the realization of spacetimes with positive and negative spatial curvature by wave-packet propagation and observe particle-pair production in controlled power-law expansion of space, using Sakharov oscillations to extract amplitude and phase information of the produced state. We find quantitative agreement with analytical predictions for different curvatures in time and space. This benchmarks and thereby establishes a quantum field simulator of a new class. In the future, straightforward upgrades offer the possibility to enter unexplored regimes that give further insight into relativistic quantum field dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4308620595,"Odour plumes in the wild are spatially complex and rapidly fluctuating structures carried by turbulent airflows1–4. To successfully navigate plumes in search of food and mates, insects must extract and integrate multiple features of the odour signal, including odour identity5, intensity6 and timing6–12. Effective navigation requires balancing these multiple streams of olfactory information and integrating them with other sensory inputs, including mechanosensory and visual cues9,12,13. Studies dating back a century have indicated that, of these many sensory inputs, the wind provides the main directional cue in turbulent plumes, leading to the longstanding model of insect odour navigation as odour-elicited upwind motion6,8–12,14,15. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster shape their navigational decisions using an additional directional cue—the direction of motion of odours—which they detect using temporal correlations in the odour signal between their two antennae. Using a high-resolution virtual-reality paradigm to deliver spatiotemporally complex fictive odours to freely walking flies, we demonstrate that such odour-direction sensing involves algorithms analogous to those in visual-direction sensing16. Combining simulations, theory and experiments, we show that odour motion contains valuable directional information that is absent from the airflow alone, and that both Drosophila and virtual agents are aided by that information in navigating naturalistic plumes. The generality of our findings suggests that odour-direction sensing may exist throughout the animal kingdom and could improve olfactory robot navigation in uncertain environments. Odour motion contains valuable directional information that is absent from the airflow alone, and Drosophila use this directional information to shape their navigational decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4308620799,"Malaria infection involves an obligatory, yet clinically silent liver stage1,2. Hepatocytes operate in repeating units termed lobules, exhibiting heterogeneous gene expression patterns along the lobule axis3, but the effects of hepatocyte zonation on parasite development at the molecular level remain unknown. Here we combine single-cell RNA sequencing4 and single-molecule transcript imaging5 to characterize the host and parasite temporal expression programmes in a zonally controlled manner for the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei ANKA. We identify differences in parasite gene expression in distinct zones, including potentially co-adaptive programmes related to iron and fatty acid metabolism. We find that parasites develop more rapidly in the pericentral lobule zones and identify a subpopulation of periportally biased hepatocytes that harbour abortive infections, reduced levels of Plasmodium transcripts and parasitophorous vacuole breakdown. These 'abortive hepatocytes', which appear predominantly with high parasite inoculum, upregulate immune recruitment and key signalling programmes. Our study provides a resource for understanding the liver stage of Plasmodium infection at high spatial resolution and highlights the heterogeneous behaviour of both the parasite and the host hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W4308623141,"Although the psychological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been evaluated in the literature, further research is needed, particularly on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychological outcomes, is needed. This study aims to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety, and insomnia). A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted using the following instruments: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural equation model (SEM), multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling, and differential item functioning (DIF) were performed to analyze the collected data. According to the results, participants with PTSD (n = 360) showed a higher level of depression, anxiety, and insomnia than those without PTSD (n = 639). Among the participants, 36.5% experienced moderate to severe symptoms of depression, and 32.6% had mild depressive symptoms. Moreover, 23.7% of participants experienced moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 33.1% had mild anxiety symptoms. In addition, 51.5% of participants experienced symptoms of insomnia. In conclusion, the PTSD caused by COVID-19 is significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia at the level of latent constructs and observed variables."
https://openalex.org/W4308654044,"Reluctance to make eye contact during natural interactions is a central diagnostic criterion for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the underlying neural correlates for eye contacts in ASD are unknown, and diagnostic biomarkers are active areas of investigation. Here, neuroimaging, eye-tracking, and pupillometry data were acquired simultaneously using two-person functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during live “in-person” eye-to-eye contact and eye-gaze at a video face for typically-developed (TD) and participants with ASD to identify the neural correlates of live eye-to-eye contact in both groups. Comparisons between ASD and TD showed decreased right dorsal-parietal activity and increased right ventral temporal-parietal activity for ASD during live eye-to-eye contact (p≤0.05, FDR-corrected) and reduced cross-brain coherence consistent with atypical neural systems for live eye contact. Hypoactivity of right dorsal-parietal regions during eye contact in ASD was further associated with gold standard measures of social performance by the correlation of neural responses and individual measures of: ADOS-2, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2 nd Edition (r = -0.76, -0.92 and -0.77); and SRS-2, Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (r = -0.58). The findings indicate that as categorized social ability decreases, neural responses to real eye-contact in the right dorsal parietal region also decrease consistent with a neural correlate for social characteristics in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W4308654052,"E-cigarette (EC) and vaping use continue to remain popular amongst teenage and young adult populations, despite several reports of vaping associated lung injury. One of the first compounds that EC aerosols comes into contact within the lungs during a deep inhalation is pulmonary surfactant. Impairment of surfactant's critical surface tension reducing activity can contribute to lung dysfunction. Currently, information on how EC aerosols impacts pulmonary surfactant remains limited. We hypothesized that exposure to EC aerosol impairs the surface tension reducing ability of surfactant.Bovine Lipid Extract Surfactant (BLES) was used as a model surfactant in a direct exposure syringe system. BLES (2ml) was placed in a syringe (30ml) attached to an EC. The generated aerosol was drawn into the syringe and then expelled, repeated 30 times. Biophysical analysis after exposure was completed using a constrained drop surfactometer (CDS).Minimum surface tensions increased significantly after exposure to the EC aerosol across 20 compression/expansion cycles. Mixing of non-aerosolized e-liquid did not result in significant changes. Variation in device used, addition of nicotine, or temperature of the aerosol had no additional effect. Two e-liquid flavours, menthol and red wedding, had further detrimental effects, resulting in significantly higher surface tension than the vehicle exposed BLES. Menthol exposed BLES has the highest minimum surface tensions across all 20 compression/expansion cycles. Alteration of surfactant properties through interaction with the produced aerosol was observed with a basic e-liquid vehicle, however additional compounds produced by added flavourings appeared to be able to increase inhibition.EC aerosols alter surfactant function through increases in minimum surface tension. This impairment may contribute to lung dysfunction and susceptibility to further injury."
https://openalex.org/W4308654415,"Staphylococcus epidermis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections due to biofilm formation. Current reports noted that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics induce biofilm production in some bacteria. Accordingly, we evaluated the effect of exposure of different subinhibitory concentrations of cloxacillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin on the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant S . epidermidis (MRSE). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration of antimicrobial agents were determined. MRSE isolates were selected, and their biofilm formation ability was evaluated. The effect of subinhibitory concentrations of cloxacillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin, antibiotics selected among common choices in the clinic, on MRSE biofilm formation was determined by the microtitre method. Besides, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of cloxacillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin on the expression of the biofilm-associated genes icaA and atlE was evaluated by Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of MRSE strains showed a high level of resistance as follows: 80%, 53.3%, 33.3%, 33.3%, and 26.6%, for erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, clindamycin, and gentamicin, respectively. Besides, 73.3% of S . epidermidis strains were Multidrug-resistant (MDR). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were in the range of 0.5 to512 μg/mL and 1 to1024 μg/mL for cloxacillin, 0.125 to256 μg/mL and 1 to512 μg/mL for cefazolin, 0.125 to64 μg/mL and 4 to&gt;1024 μg/mL for clindamycin, and 2 to32 μg/mL and 4 to32 μg/mL for vancomycin, respectively. The findings showed that subinhibitory concentrations of cloxacillin, cefazolin, and clindamycin induce biofilm production in MRSE strains. In particular, the OD values of strains were in the range of 0.09–0.95, 0.05–0.86, and 0.06–1 toward cloxacillin, cefazolin, and clindamycin, respectively. On the other hand, exposure to subinhibitory vancomycin concentrations did not increase the biofilm formation in MRSE strains. The findings also demonstrated that sub-MIC of antibiotics up-regulated biofilm-associated genes. In particular, atlE and icaA were up-regulated 0.062 to 1.16 and 0.078 to 1.48 folds, respectively, for cloxacillin, 0.11 to 0.8, and 0.1 to 1.3 folds for cefazolin, 0.18 to 0.98, and 0.19 to 1.4 folds, respectively, for clindamycin. In contrast, the results showed that sub-MIC of vancomycin did not increase the biofilm-associated genes. These findings overall show that exposure to sub-MIC of traditional antibiotics can cause biofilm induction in MRSE, thereby increasing the survival and persistence on various surfaces that worsen the condition of comorbid infections."
https://openalex.org/W4308510104,"In albinism, aberrations in the ipsi-/contralateral retinal ganglion cell (RGC) ratio compromise the functional integrity of the binocular circuit. Here, we focus on the mouse ciliary margin zone (CMZ), a neurogenic niche at the embryonic peripheral retina, to investigate developmental processes regulating RGC neurogenesis and identity acquisition. We found that the mouse ventral CMZ generates predominantly ipsilaterally projecting RGCs, but this output is altered in the albino visual system because of CyclinD2 downregulation and disturbed timing of the cell cycle. Consequently, albino as well as CyclinD2-deficient pigmented mice exhibit diminished ipsilateral retinogeniculate projection and poor depth perception. In albino mice, pharmacological stimulation of calcium channels, known to upregulate CyclinD2 in other cell types, augmented CyclinD2-dependent neurogenesis of ipsilateral RGCs and improved stereopsis. Together, these results implicate CMZ neurogenesis and its regulators as critical for the formation and function of the mammalian binocular circuit."
https://openalex.org/W4308620279,"The core-collapse supernova of a massive star rapidly brightens when a shock, produced following the collapse of its core, reaches the stellar surface. As the shock-heated star subsequently expands and cools, its early-time light curve should have a simple dependence on the size of the progenitor1 and therefore final evolutionary state. Measurements of the radius of the progenitor from early light curves exist for only a small sample of nearby supernovae2-14, and almost all lack constraining ultraviolet observations within a day of explosion. The several-day time delays and magnifying ability of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses, however, should provide a powerful tool for measuring the early light curves of distant supernovae, and thereby studying massive stellar populations at high redshift. Here we analyse individual rest-frame exposures in the ultraviolet to the optical taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, which simultaneously capture, in three separate gravitationally lensed images, the early phases of a supernova at redshift z ≈ 3 beginning within 5.8 ± 3.1 hours of explosion. The supernova, seen at a lookback time of approximately 11.5 billion years, is strongly lensed by an early-type galaxy in the Abell 370 cluster. We constrain the pre-explosion radius to be [Formula: see text] solar radii, consistent with a red supergiant. Highly confined and massive circumstellar material at the same radius can also reproduce the light curve, but because no similar low-redshift examples are known, this is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W4308623150,"The World Health Organization recognizes dementia as a public health priority and highlights research as an action to respond to the consequences, with early career dementia researchers (ECDRs) representing the key driving force. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, biomedical and psychosocial dementia research was strained worldwide. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of the pandemic on ECDRs.In autumn 2021, the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) Professional Interest Area to Elevate Early Career Researchers (PEERs) and University College London conducted an online survey querying ECDRs' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was shared through the ISTAART network, social media, podcasts, and emailing lists. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.Survey data from n = 321 ECDRs from 34 countries were analyzed (67.6% women; 78.8% working in academia). Overall, 77.8% of ECDRs surveyed indicated research delays, 53.9% made project adjustments, 37.9% required additional or extended funding, and 41.8% reported a negative impact on career progression. Moreover, 19.9% felt unsupported by their institutions and employers (33% felt well supported, 42.7% somewhat supported). ECDR's conference attendance remained the same (26.5%) or increased (More: 28.6%; a lot more: 5.6%) since the start of the pandemic. Continental differences were visible, while the impact of the pandemic did not differ greatly based on ECDRs' sociodemographic characteristics.The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on ECDRs worldwide and institutions, employers, and funding bodies are urged to consider the implications and lessons-learned when working with, managing, and promoting ECDRs. Strategies related to the pandemic and general career support to improve ECDRs career progression are discussed, including social media training, digital networking, and benefits of hybrid events. Global resources specific for ECDRs are highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W4308623191,"Previous research shows that teams with diverse backgrounds and skills can outperform homogeneous teams. However, people often prefer to work with others who are similar and familiar to them and fail to assemble teams with high diversity levels. We study the team formation problem by considering a pool of individuals with different skills and characteristics, and a social network that captures the familiarity among these individuals. The goal is to assign all individuals to diverse teams based on their social connections, thereby allowing them to preserve a level of familiarity. We formulate this team formation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem to split members into well-connected and diverse teams within a social network. We implement this problem employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which finds team combinations with high familiarity and diversity levels in O(n2) time. We tested this algorithm on three empirically collected team formation datasets and against three benchmark algorithms. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm successfully formed teams that have both diversity in member attributes and previous connections between members. We discuss the benefits of using computational approaches to augment team formation and composition."
https://openalex.org/W4308648848,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination of adolescent and young adults is important for infection control. Factors influencing vaccination behavior in this age group include the source of information about the vaccine and social norms. However, there are few studies on factors influencing vaccination behavior among Japanese university students. This study aimed to assess beliefs, attitudes, and sources of information about the COVID-19 vaccine among university students in Japan. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was conducted among students in Teikyo University, Japan in September, 2021. The survey was designed to collect demographic information, vaccination status, attitudes, beliefs, and anxiety about the vaccine, sources of information, and whether or not the participant watched an educational movie. The factors associated with beliefs and attitudes were analyzed using logistic and linear regression. A total of 4,062 valid questionnaires were retrieved. The positive vaccine behavior group included 3,725 students (91.7%). The most common source of information on the COVID-19 vaccine was TV/radio (75.0%), and the most common Social networking service (SNS) for COVID-19 information was Twitter (31.1%). Approximately 85% students believed in the efficacy of vaccination. Positive attitude was associated with female sex and watching an educational movie by the university. Concern about the vaccine was positively associated with information from acquaintances or Instagram, and negatively associated with information from Twitter, and watching the educational movie. The majority of students had positive beliefs and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination, and social media and educational movies produced by the university had a large influence on their attitude toward vaccination behavior. On the contrary, some students were anxious about vaccination. Promotion of educational movies on social media by the universities is an effective way to encourage vaccination among young people."
https://openalex.org/W4308648983,"Background and purposes The long-term risk of stroke in women with preeclampsia/eclampsia is a concerning issue. In this study we further investigated different stroke subtypes and differentiated follow-up time intervals. Methods Between 2000 and 2017, 1,384,427 pregnant women were registered in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. After excluding women with previous stroke history and exact matching with all confounders, 6,053 women with preeclampsia/eclampsia and 24,212 controls were included in the analysis sample. Results Over the 17-year follow-up, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for stroke in women with preeclampsia/eclampsia was 2.05 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.67–2.52, p&lt;0.001). The 17 years overall aHR of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were 1.98 and 3.45, respectively (p&lt;0.001). The stroke subtypes, hemorrhagic and ischemic, had different time trend risks, and hemorrhagic stroke risks kept higher than that of ischemic stroke. The aHR of ischemic stroke reached a peak during 1–3 years after childbirth (aHR = 3.09). The aHR of hemorrhagic stroke reached a peak during 3–5 years (aHR = 7.49). Conclusions Stroke risk persisted even after decades, for both ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes. Women with preeclampsia/eclampsia history should be aware of the long-term risk of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W4308654174,"Members of the mitis group streptococci are the most abundant inhabitants of the oral cavity and dental plaque. Influenza A virus (IAV), the causative agent of influenza, infects the upper respiratory tract, and co-infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity during influenza epidemics. S. pneumoniae is a member of mitis group streptococci and shares many features with oral mitis group streptococci. In this study, we investigated the effect of viable Streptococcus oralis, a representative member of oral mitis group, on the infectivity of H1N1 IAV. The infectivity of IAV was measured by a plaque assay using Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. When IAV was incubated in growing culture of S. oralis, the IAV titer decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner and became less than 100-fold, whereas heat-inactivated S. oralis had no effect. Other oral streptococci such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius also reduced the viral infectivity to a lesser extent compared to S. oralis and Streptococcus gordonii, another member of the oral mitis group. S. oralis produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at a concentration of 1-2 mM, and its mutant deficient in H2O2 production showed a weaker effect on the inactivation of IAV, suggesting that H2O2 contributes to viral inactivation. The contribution of H2O2 was confirmed by an inhibition assay using catalase, an H2O2-decomposing enzyme. These oral streptococci produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as acetic acid as a by-product of sugar metabolism, and we also found that the inactivation of IAV was dependent on the mildly acidic pH (around pH 5.0) of these streptococcal cultures. Although inactivation of IAV in buffers of pH 5.0 was limited, incubation in the same buffer containing 2 mM H2O2 resulted in marked inactivation of IAV, which was similar to the effect of growing S. oralis culture. Taken together, these results reveal that viable S. oralis can inactivate IAV via the production of SCFAs and H2O2. This finding also suggests that the combination of mildly acidic pH and H2O2 at low concentrations could be an effective method to inactivate IAV."
https://openalex.org/W4308654223,"The emissions trading system, a crucial and fundamental system reform in the environmental resources field of China, was established to promote the continuous and effective reduction of total emissions of major pollutants. In this context, based on the panel data of 285 Chinese cities (except Tibet) from 2004 to 2018, this paper uses the quasi-experimental method of Difference in Difference to assess the effect of the emissions trading system introduced on sulfur dioxide emissions of China and the transmission mechanism. The article generates several intriguing findings. (1) The emissions trading system has a significant suppressive effect on sulfur dioxide emissions. (2) Mechanistic tests show that the emissions trading system can effectively suppress sulfur dioxide emissions by reducing government intervention, stimulating green patent innovation, and improving resource use efficiency, in which green utility patents have a masking effect. (3) From the east, central and west divisions, the emissions trading system has a significant suppression effect on sulfur dioxide emission in the eastern and central regions, and the eastern region is better than the central region. (4) In terms of factor endowment, the emissions trading system has a significant suppression effect on sulfur dioxide emissions in both resource-based and non-resource-based cities, with non-resource-based cities outperforming resource-based cities; while within resource-based effect exists only in regenerative cities. (5) The emissions trading system has a significant suppression effect on sulfur dioxide emissions in old and non-old industrial base cities in industrial base zoning. The suppression effect in non-old industrial base cities is better than that in old industrial base cities. This paper provides empirical evidence for evaluating the emissions trading system at the provincial level in China and suggests policy recommendations for selecting government tools to effectively curb sulfur dioxide emissions. Although the emissions trading system has made an outstanding contribution to sulfur dioxide emissions reduction, there is still much space for further development of potential emission reductions."
https://openalex.org/W4308654364,"Wild Octopus tetricus frequently propel shells, silt, and algae through the water by releasing these materials from their arms while creating a forceful jet from the siphon held under the arm web. These ""throws"" occur in several contexts at a site in Jervis Bay, Australia, including in interactions with other octopuses. Material thrown in interactive contexts frequently hits other octopuses. Some throws appear to be targeted on other individuals, as suggested by several kinds of evidence: Throws in interactive contexts were more vigorous than others, and more often used silt, rather than shells or algae. High vigor throws were more often accompanied by uniform or dark body patterns than other throws. Some throws were directed differently from beneath the arms and such throws were more likely to hit other octopuses. Throwing at other individuals in the same population, as apparently seen in these octopuses, is a rare form of nonhuman projectile use, previously seen only in some social mammals."

https://openalex.org/W4308620314,"The Pacific cold tongue annual cycle in sea surface temperature is presumed to be driven by Earth’s axial tilt1–5 (tilt effect), and thus its phasing should be fixed relative to the calendar. However, its phase and amplitude change dramatically and consistently under various configurations of orbital precession in several Earth System models. Here, we show that the cold tongue possesses another annual cycle driven by the variation in Earth–Sun distance (distance effect) from orbital eccentricity. As the two cycles possess slightly different periodicities6, their interference results in a complex evolution of the net seasonality over a precession cycle. The amplitude from the distance effect increases linearly with eccentricity and is comparable to the amplitude from the tilt effect for the largest eccentricity values over the last million years (e value approximately 0.05)7. Mechanistically, the distance effect on the cold tongue arises through a seasonal longitudinal shift in the Walker circulation and subsequent annual wind forcing on the tropical Pacific dynamic ocean–atmosphere system. The finding calls for reassessment of current understanding of the Pacific cold tongue annual cycle and re-evaluation of tropical Pacific palaeoclimate records for annual cycle phase changes. The Pacific cold tongue is shown to possess two distinct annual cycles with complex interference effects, calling for a reassessment of its seasonal dynamics and re-evaluation of tropical Pacific palaeoclimate records of annual cycle phase changes."

Methods Hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent dilated ophthalmic examination and fundus photography. Conjunctival swabs were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR via a triple target assay. We assessed the relationships of retinopathy with clinical outcomes, systemic risk factors and laboratory data. Results The median age was 59.5 years and 29 (48%) were female. Retinopathy associated with COVID-19 was observed in 12 of 60 patients (20%). The median age of patients with COVID-19 retinopathy was 51.5 compared to 62.5 years in individuals without retinopathy (p = 0.01). Median BMI was 34.3 in patients with retinopathy versus 30.9 in those without retinopathy (p = 0.04). Fifteen of 60 patients (25%) tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive in their tear film without a relationship with timing of illness and hospitalization. The N2 gene was particularly sensitive with 18 of 19 eyes (94.7%) showing N2-positivity, including 2 patients with alpha variant-positivity (B.1.1.7). Conclusion Retinopathy was observed in 20% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Patients with retinopathy were more likely to be younger and have higher BMI than hospitalized patients without retinopathy. Tear film SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 25% of patients. The relationship of obesity and age with retinopathy requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4308623171,"Poorly controlled blood glucose is prevalent and contributes to the huge burden of diabetes related morbidity, and central obesity has a great role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its adverse complications, which could predict such risks, yet evidence is lacking. Hence, this paper is to evaluate the predictive performance of central obesity indices for glycemic control among adult patients with diabetes in eastern Ethiopia.A survey of 432 randomly chosen patients with diabetes was conducted using a pretested questionnaire supplemented by chart review, anthropometrics, and biomarkers by trained data collectors. The poor glycemic control was assessed using a fasting blood glucose (FBS) level of above 130 and/or an HgA1c level above 7%. Weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC) were measured under standard procedures and we calculated waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The receiver operating characteristics curve was used to assess the predictive performance of obesity indices for glycemic control using area under the curve (AUC) and corresponding validity measures.A total of 432 (92%) patients with diabetes were enrolled with a mean age of 49.6 (±12.4) years. The mean fasting blood glucose level was 189 (±72) mg dl-1 where 330 (76.4%) (95% CI: 74.4-78.4%) and 93.3% of them had poor glycemic control based on FBS and HgA1c, respectively. WC (AUC = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85-0.95), WHR (AUC = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43-0.84), and WHtR (AUC = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.83-0.94) have a higher predictive performance for poor glycemic control at cut-off points above 100 cm, 0.95, and 0.62, respectively. However, obesity indices showed a lower predictive performance for poor glycemic control based on FBS. Body mass index (BMI) had a poor predictive performance for poor glycemic control (AUC = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.13-0.40).Poor glycemic control is a public health concern and obesity indicators, typically WC, WHR, and WHtR, have a better predictive performance for poor glycemic control than BMI."
https://openalex.org/W4308623183,"Analyzing the time course of eye movements during scene viewing often indicates that people progress through two distinct modes of visual processing: an ambient mode, which is associated with overall spatial orientation in a scene, followed by a focal mode, which requires central vision of an object. However, the shifts between ambient and focal processing modes have mainly been identified relative to changes in the environment, such as relative to the onset of various visual stimuli but also following scene cuts or subjective event boundaries in dynamic stimuli. The results so far do not allow conclusions about the nature of the two processing mechanisms beyond the influence of externally triggered events. It remains unclear whether people shift back and forth from ambient to focal processing also based on internal triggers, such as switching between different tasks while no external event is given. The present study therefore investigated ambient to focal processing shifts in an active task solving paradigm. The Rubik's Cube task introduced here is a multi-step task, which can be broken down into smaller sub-tasks that are performed serially. The time course of eye movements was analyzed at multiple levels of this Rubik's Cube task, including when there were no external changes to the stimuli but when internal representations of the task were hypothesized to change (i.e., switching between different sub-tasks). Results suggest that initial ambient exploration is followed by a switch to more focal viewing across various levels of task processing with and without external changes to the stimuli. More importantly, the present findings suggest that ambient and focal eye movement characteristics might serve as a probe for the attentional state in task processing, which does not seem to be influenced by changes in task performance."
https://openalex.org/W4308623185,"Bus accidents are a serious issue, with high rates of injury and fatality in Thailand. However, no studies have been conducted on the factors affecting bus accident severity in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted by the Department of Highways, Thailand over the 2010-2019 period. A multinomial logit model was used to evaluate the factors associated with bus accident severity. This model divided accidents into three categories: non-injury, injury, and fatality. The risk factors consisted of three major categories: the bus driver, characteristics of the crash, and environmental characteristics. The results showed that characteristics of the bus driver, the crash, and the environment where the crash occurred all increased the probability of bus accidents causing injury. These three main factors included driving on sloped roads (relative risk ratio [RRR] 3.03, 95% confidence level [CI] 1.73 to 5.30), drowsy driving (RRR 2.60, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.96), and driving in the wrong direction (RRR 2.37, 95% CI 1.77 to 3.19). Moreover, the factors that increased the probability of the accidents causing fatality were drowsy driving (RRR 3.40, 95% CI 2.07 to 5.57) and drivers not obeying or following traffic rules (RRR 3.02, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.67), especially in the northern part of Thailand (RRR 3.01, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.62). The results can provide a valuable resource to help road authorities in development targeting road safety programs at sloped roads in the northern part of Thailand. Stakeholders should increase road safety efforts and implement campaigns, such as raising public awareness of the risks of not obeying or following traffic rules and drowsy driving which could possibly reduce the risk of both injury and fatality."
https://openalex.org/W4308623245,"Americans' increasing levels of ideological polarization contribute to pervasive intergroup tensions based on political partisanship. Cues to partisanship may affect even the most basic aspects of perception. First impressions of faces constitute a widely-studied basic aspect of person perception relating to intergroup tensions. To understand the relation between face impressions and political polarization, two experiments were designed to test whether disclosing political partisanship affected face impressions based on perceivers' political ideology. Disclosed partisanship more strongly affected people's face impressions than actual, undisclosed, categories (Experiment 1). In a replication and extension, disclosed shared and opposing partisanship also engendered, respectively, positive and negative changes in face impressions (Experiment 2). Partisan disclosure effects on face impressions were paralleled by the extent of people's partisan threat perceptions (Experiments 1 and 2). These findings suggest that partisan biases appear in basic aspects of person perception and may emerge concomitant with perceived partisan threat."
https://openalex.org/W4308623333,"Movement is a key factor in the survival and reproduction of most organisms with important links to bioenergetics and population dynamics. Animals use movement strategies that minimize the costs of locating resources, maximizing energy gains. Effectiveness of these strategies depends on the spatial distribution, variability and predictability of resources. The study of fine-scale movement of small cetaceans in the pelagic domain is limited, in part because of the logistical difficulties associated with tagging and tracking them. Here we describe and model the fine-scale movement patterns of two pelagic dolphin species using georeferenced movement and behavioral data obtained by tracking dolphin groups on board small vessels. Movement patterns differed by species, group sizes and seasons. Dusky dolphin groups moved shorter distances when feeding and longer distances when traveling whereas the common dolphin did the same only when they moved in large groups. In summer, both dolphins cover longer distances in a more linear path, while in winter the movement is more erratic and moving shorter distances. Both species of dolphins prey on small pelagic fishes, which are patchily distributed and show seasonal variability in school sizes and distribution. However, dusky dolphins rely on anchovy to a larger extent than common dolphins. In Nuevo Gulf, anchovy shoals are smaller and separated by shorter distances in winter and dusky dolphins´ movement pattern is consistent with this. Dusky and common dolphins are impacted by tourism and fisheries. Further modelling of movement could be inform spatial based management tools."
https://openalex.org/W4308625198,"Background Caffeine is available in an ampoule, used via parenteral and enteral routes in preterm neonates to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP) in neonates of gestational age ≥ 35–40 weeks. A longer duration of therapy has a higher risk of medication non-adherence due to higher costs and inappropriate dosage forms. Pharmaceutically compounded oral caffeine (PCC) could be an appropriate alternate dosage form. The researchers aimed to determine the impact of PCC on medication-related factors influencing medication adherence (MA) and the frequency of hospital readmission with apnea (HRA) in preterm neonates. Methods We conducted a single-center quasi-experimental study for this quality improvement project using PCC among the preterm neonates admitted in a tertiary care level-III NICU at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Pakistan, received caffeine therapy, and survived at discharge. The researchers compared pre-PCC data (April-December 2017) with post-PCC data (April-Dec 2018) each for nine months, with three months intervals (January-March 2018) of PCC formulation and implementation phase. The study was conducted according to the SQUIRE2.0 guidelines. The Data were collated on factors influencing MA, including the cost of therapy, medication refill rates, and parental complaints as primary outcome measures. The Risk factors of HRA were included as secondary outcomes. Results After PCC implementation cost of therapy was reduced significantly from Rs. 97000.0 (729.0 USD) to Rs. 24500.0 (185.0 USD) (p&lt;0.001), significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) number of patients completed remaining refills (77.6% pre-phase vs 97.5% post-phase). The number of parental complaints about cost, ampoule usage, medication drawing issue, wastage, inappropriate dosage form, and longer duration of therapy reduced significantly in post-phase. HRA reduced from 25% to 6.6% (p&lt;0.001). Post-implementation of PCC (RR 0.14; 95% CI: 0.07–0.27) was a significant independent risk factor for reducing HRA using a multivariate analysis model. Longer duration of caffeine therapy after discharge (RR 1.05; 95% CI: 1.04–1.04), those who were born in multiple births (RR 1.15; 95% CI: 1.15–1.15), and those who had higher number of siblings were other significant independent risk factors for HRA. Conclusions PCC dispensation in the appropriate dosage form at discharge effectively reduced cost, non-adherence to therapy, and risk of hospital readmissions. This neonatal clinical and compounding pharmacist-led model can be replicated in other resource-limiting setting."
https://openalex.org/W4308625511,"Credibly estimating social-ecological relationships requires data with broad coverage and fine geographic resolutions that are not typically available from standard ecological surveys. Open and unstructured data from crowdsourced platforms offer an opportunity for collecting large quantities of user-submitted ecological data. However, the representativeness of the areas sampled by these data portals is not well known. We investigate how data availability in eBird, one of the largest and most popular crowdsourced science platforms, correlates with race and income of census tracts in two cities: Boston, MA and Phoenix, AZ. We find that checklist submissions vary greatly across census tracts, with similar patterns within both metropolitan regions. In particular, census tracts with high income and high proportions of white residents are most likely to be represented in the data in both cities, which indicates selection bias in eBird coverage. Our results illustrate the non-representativeness of eBird data, and they also raise deeper questions about the validity of statistical inferences regarding disparities that can be drawn from such datasets. We discuss these challenges and illustrate how sample selection problems in unstructured or semi-structured crowdsourced data can lead to spurious conclusions regarding the relationships between race, income, and access to urban bird biodiversity. While crowdsourced data are indispensable and complementary to more traditional approaches for collecting ecological data, we conclude that unstructured or semi-structured data may not be well-suited for all lines of inquiry, particularly those requiring consistent data coverage, and should thus be handled with appropriate care."

Immunohistochemical staining for ghrelin was investigated in colonic biopsy samples of UC and control patients. UC patients were subdivided into Group A (absence of ghrelin staining) and Group B (presence of staining for ghrelin in biopsy samples). Disease activity scores, laboratory parameters and quantitative ghrelin staining were compared in both groups of UC patients, as well as with the observations in control patients.Cells in colonic mucosa stained for ghrelin were identified in twenty-three (37.7%) UC patients, while this proportion in control patients was 6/15(40%). A significant difference was found between Groups A and B for serum albumin concentration but not for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin concentration or leucocyte count. Mayo score/disease activity index (DAI) for UC were significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (p = 0.03).There were no differences in the amount of colonic ghrelin staining between healthy individuals and UC patients. Colonic ghrelin staining in UC patients seems to be associated with the increased activity of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4308648840,"Background The number of people seeking care for symptoms of exhaustion and stress is a major concern in several countries. The condition is a challenging and life-changing experience, and a deeper understanding of support to help people on sick leave due to stress-related exhaustion in their early stages is needed to facilitate recovery. Objective The aim was to explore experiences of support in people with stress-related exhaustion being on sick-leave less than six months. Method A qualitative interview study was conducted with 12 participants (7 women and 5 men; aged 25–46 years) who were on sick leave that had not exceeded six months due to stress-related exhaustion. The participants were recruited from public healthcare centres in the western part of Sweden, and the intention was to reach them early in their ongoing sick leave period. The interviews were performed face-to-face and analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. Results The findings show that people affected by stress-related exhaustion struggle to maintain their dignity and define support in terms of allies who acknowledge their personhood and provide them helpful guidance. Participants expressed their needs to be taken seriously by professionals, family, and friends willing to engage in their situation. Lack of empathy and professional knowledge in the clinical encounter induced additional stress. Conclusions This study indicates that people affected by stress-related exhaustion need allies from their surrounding networks in their struggle to maintain their dignity. Our findings highlight that it is essential to acknowledge them as persons and establish an alliance to provide appropriate support based on each person’s specific situation, needs and resources. This approach can be facilitated in a partnership, as emphasized in person-centred care (PCC). PCC emphasizes the co-creation of care in partnership between the patient (often with relatives) and health care professionals which may imply a more collaborative view of health care in which patients are engaged as active partners in planning their care."

Maternal satisfaction with delivery services affects the selection of birthplaces and helps to identify gaps between actual health care and desired health care outcomes. There is a dearth of evidence on the factors of client satisfaction towards delivery services in the Somali region.The aim of this study was to assess maternal satisfaction and associated factors towards institutional delivery service at public hospitals in the Somali region, Eastern Ethiopia, in 2018.An institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from December 1-30, 2018, on a total of 320 delivering mothers who gave birth. A systematic random sampling technique was used. A pretested structured questionnaire was used for data collection through a face-to-face interview. The data was checked for completeness and entered into EpiData. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version.20. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors. Multivariable analysis was done to compute adjusted odds ratios at 95% CI and a P-value &lt;0.05 was used to declare a statistically significant association.The overall maternal satisfaction towards delivery service was 76.60% (95%CI: 71.90, 80.90). The short duration of labor below 12 hours (AOR = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.01, 3.2), waiting time below 15 minutes (AOR = 2.78, 95%CI: 1.10, 6.99) and planned pregnancy (AOR = 3.68, 95%CI: 1.59, 8.47) were significantly associated with mother's satisfaction towards delivery services.This study revealed that more than three-quarters of mothers were satisfied with the institutional delivery service.

https://openalex.org/W4308654529,"We examine the relationship between parental disability and child outcomes in the American Community Survey. We focus on families with veteran parents, for whom parental disability is a direct result of service-related activities and thus is more plausibly exogenous to child outcomes than other forms of parental disability. Using the service connected disability rating (SCDR) as a measure of the severity of veteran disability, we document a gradient in child outcomes with respect to parental disability (even conditional on having a disabled parent). Children with more severely disabled parents are more likely to be late for grade, less likely to be in private school, and more likely to have disabilities themselves. These results lend meaningful insight to broader populations; we find similar associations between parental disability and child outcomes in non-veteran families. We provide evidence consistent with two broad mechanisms: first, parental disability reduces parental labor supply and thus household income (even net of transfers) and second, children-especially older children-allocate time away from work and schooling to provide care for disabled parents."

https://openalex.org/W4308623155,"Patients often provide untruthful information about their health to avoid embarrassment, evade treatment, or prevent financial loss. Privacy disclosures (e.g. HIPAA) intended to dissuade privacy concerns may actually increase patient lying. We used new mouse tracking-based technology to detect lies through mouse movement (distance and time to response) and patient answer adjustment in an online controlled study of 611 potential patients, randomly assigned to one of six treatments. Treatments differed in the notices patients received before health information was requested, including notices about privacy, benefits of truthful disclosure, and risks of inaccurate disclosure. Increased time or distance of device mouse movement and greater adjustment of answers indicate less truthfulness. Mouse tracking revealed a significant overall effect (p&lt;0.001) by treatment on the time to reach their final choice. The control took the least time indicating greater truthfulness and the privacy + risk group took the longest indicating least truthfulness. Privacy, risk, and benefit disclosure statements led to greater lying. These differences were moderated by gender. Mouse tracking results largely confirmed the answer adjustment lie detection method with an overall treatment effect (p &lt; .0001) and gender differences (p &lt; .0001) on truthfulness. Privacy notices led to decreased patient honesty. Privacy notices should perhaps be administered well before personal health disclosure is requested to minimize patient untruthfulness. Mouse tracking and answer adjustment appear to be health care lie-detection methods to enhance optimal diagnosis and treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4308625200,"Viral diseases are a major problem in shrimp aquaculture facilities as these diseases reduce growth rates, which inevitably lead to production and profit losses. Hepatopancreatic parvoviruses (HPV) are common diseases in shrimp that appear to be associated with high or low levels of replication in specific genetic lineages. Selective breeding may result in resistance to HPV and improved body traits such as body weight, meat yield and shrimp colour, facilitating shrimp farming. HPV virus titre is commonly determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is a time-consuming method requiring laboratory equipment unsuitable for field implementation. The aim of this study was to develop a simple, robust, rapid and reliable method to detect HPV in low-resource environments.We developed a rapid shrimp HPV test that uses (1) a simple three-step sample preparation protocol, followed by (2) isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and lateral flow strip detection (LFD). Analytical sensitivity testing was performed in a background banana shrimp sample matrix, and retrospective testing of Fenneropenaeus merguiensis hepatopancreas tissues (n = 33) with known qPCR viral titres was used to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.The rapid shrimp HPV test could detect as little as 35 genome-equivalent copies per reaction in homogenized F. merguiensis banana shrimp. Retrospective testing of stored tissues (n = 33) indicated 100% diagnostic sensitivity (95% confidence interval, CI: 86-100%) and 100% specificity (95% CI: 66-100%) for detection of HPV.The rapid shrimp HPV test could be completed in only 40 minutes, and required only homogenization pestles, some pipettors, and a small heating block for single temperature incubation at 39°C. Critically, our procedure eliminated the time-consuming purification of nucleic acids from samples and when combined with RPA-LFD offers a user-friendly HPV detection format that can potentially be performed on-site. Our approach represents a major step forward in the development of a simple and sensitive end-point method for quick determination of unfavourable HPV virus numbers in shrimp, and has great potential to advance on-site management of shrimps in aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W4308625237,"Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer the mental states of others, is integral to facilitating healthy social interactions. People can reason about the mental states of others even with limited or (sometimes) inconsistent information. However, little is known about how people make inferences about the mental states of others under uncertainty, and what features of information are important in aiding mental state reasoning. In the current study, we conducted three unique experiments that alter participant's uncertainty when engaging in ToM tests. In Experiment 1, we simultaneously manipulated both the amount and consistency of information available in social stimuli presented to 59 participants. In Experiments 2 and 3, we aimed to decipher which feature of social stimuli is more conducive to mental state reasoning. Experiment 2 manipulated only the amount of information available to 47 participants, while Experiment 3 manipulated only the consistency of information available to 46 participants. Using both frequentist and Bayesian statistics, results confirmed that manipulating the amount and consistency of information alters ToM performance. Exploratory analysis comparing the effects of the amount and consistency of information suggests that the effects of the consistency of information seem to be stronger than those of the amount of information. Taken together, all three experiments suggest that while both the amount and consistency of information are important features of social stimuli-the consistency of information available is more salient when inferring mental states of others. These findings are discussed in relation to information theory and have important implications for creating enriched social stimuli, which may enhance mental state reasoning in individuals with social deficits."
https://openalex.org/W4308625505,"We proposed a simple hyperbolic positioning method that does not require solving simultaneous quadratic equations. Moreover, we introduced the mathematical concept of a ""pencil"" into analytical calculations in the hyperbolic positioning method for a better understanding. In many recent studies using positioning biotelemetry, the specific procedure for intersection calculation of hyperbolas has rarely been described. This might be one of two major obstacles, with the other being clock synchronisation among receivers, for positioning biotelemetry users, including potential users. We focus only on the intersection calculation in this paper. Therefore, we propose a novel method and introduce the mathematical concept into analytical calculations. The computing performances of the novel method, an analytical method applying the concept of a pencil, and an approximating method using the Newton-Raphson method were compared regarding positioning correctness, accuracy, and calculation speed. In the novel method, hyperbolas were represented using the parameter θ, which was treated as a discrete variant. The finer the tick-width of the parameter θ, the more accurate was its positioning, but it took slightly longer to calculate. By setting the tick-width to 0.01°, a simulated trajectory was correctly and accurately localised, as in the analytical method which always correctly returned the accurate solution. The approximating method has a major limitation concerning correctness. It returns a single solution regardless of two intersections of hyperbolas; however, the positioning is accurate when the hyperbolas intersect at a single point. This study approached one major difficulty in positioning biotelemetry and will help biotelemetry users overcome this drawback with a simple and intuitive understanding of hyperbolic positioning."
https://openalex.org/W4308648835,"Current studies on Anopheles anticholinesterase insecticides are focusing on identifying agents with high selectivity towards Anopheles over mammalian targets. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from electric eel is often used as the bioequivalent enzyme to study ligands designed for activity and inhibition in human. In this study, previously identified derivatives of a potent AChE, donepezil, that have exhibited low activity on electric eel AChE were assessed for potential AChE-based larvicidal effects on four African malaria vectors; An. funestus, An. arabiensis, An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. This led to the identification of four larvicidal agents with a lead molecule, 1-benzyl-N-(thiazol-2-yl) piperidine-4-carboxamide 2 showing selectivity for An. arabiensis as a larvicidal AChE agent. Differential activities of this molecule on An. arabiensis and electric eel AChE targets were studied through molecular modelling. Homology modelling was used to generate a three-dimensional structure of the An. arabiensis AChE for this binding assay. The conformation of this molecule and corresponding interactions with the AChE catalytic site was markedly different between the two targets. Assessment of the differences between the AChE binding sites from electric eel, human and Anopheles revealed that the electric eel and human AChE proteins were very similar. In contrast, Anopheles AChE had a smaller cysteine residue in place of bulky phenylalanine group at the entrance to the catalytic site, and a smaller aspartic acid residue at the base of the active site gorge, in place of the bulky tyrosine residues. Results from this study suggest that this difference affects the ligand orientation and corresponding interactions at the catalytic site. The lead molecule 2 also formed more favourable interactions with An. arabiensis AChE model than other Anopheles AChE targets, possibly explaining the observed selectivity among other assessed Anopheles species. This study suggests that 1-benzyl-N-(thiazol-2-yl) piperidine-4-carboxamide 2 may be a lead compound for designing novel insecticides against Anopheles vectors with reduced toxic potential on humans."

Evidence-based quit smoking advice received from health care professionals (HCPs) can increase smoking cessation rates. However, HCPs lack culturally appropriate smoking cessation training, which is a major barrier to provision of smoking cessation care for this population.iSISTAQUIT is a multicentre, single arm study aiming to implement and evaluate the evidence-based, culturally competent iSISTAQUIT smoking cessation training among health practitioners who provide support and assistance to pregnant, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Australia. This project will implement the iSISTAQUIT intervention in Aboriginal Medical Services and Mainstream Health Services. The proposed sample size is 10 of each of these services (total N = 20), however if the demand is higher, we will aim to accommodate up to 30 services for the training. Participating sites and their HCPs will have the option to choose one of the two iSISTAQUIT packages available: a) Evaluation- research package b) Training package (with or without continued professional development points). Training will be provided via an online eLearning platform that includes videos, text, interactive elements and a treatment manual. A social media campaign will be conducted from December 2021 to September 2022 to raise brand and issue awareness about smoking cessation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in pregnancy. This national campaign will consist of systematic advertising and promotion of iSISTAQUIT and video messages through various social media platforms.We will use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) to plan, evaluate and report the intervention impact of iSISTAQUIT. Effectiveness of social media campaign will be assessed via social media metrics, cross-sectional surveys, and interviews.This innovative research, using a multi-component intervention, aims to practically apply and integrate a highly translatable smoking cessation intervention in real-world primary care settings in Aboriginal Medical Services and Mainstream services. The research benefits Aboriginal women, babies and their family and community members through improved support for smoking cessation during pregnancy. The intervention is based on accepted Australian and international smoking cessation guidelines, developed and delivered in a culturally appropriate approach for Aboriginal communities."
https://openalex.org/W4308654208,"This paper studies the effect of income inequality and voters' support for public spending on the choice of size of the welfare state. Based on new empirical findings showing that preferences for taxation depend on the nature of the policies financed with tax revenues (Barnes 2015, Ballard-Rosa 2016, Roosma 2016, and Berens 2019) I build a Downsian two-party political competition framework in which voters differ in both income (rich or poor) and ideology (liberal or conservative). Government provides two types of public services: one that increase the size of the welfare state and other that does not. Liberal (conservative) voters only care about the public service that increase (do not increase) the size of the welfare state. I find that the decisive voter and the size of the welfare state depends on both the level of income inequality and voters' support for public spending. In particular, and different from the traditional models on redistributive politics (Romer 1975, Roberts 1977, and Meltzer 1981), I obtain that an increase in pre tax income inequality may reduce the size of the welfare state chosen by majority voting."
https://openalex.org/W4308654222,"Cholestatic jaundice is one of the most common neonatal conditions. BA, a correctable cholangiopathy, presents with cholestatic jaundice within the first weeks of life. The inflammation of bile ducts leads to progressive fibrosclerosis involving biliary trees, followed by cirrhosis and liver failure. With the use of modern molecular studies, this research aimed to define a novel pathogenesis by exploring variations. We performed genetic discovery by using supervised and unsupervised approaches. Ultimately, a combination of genetic variations and survival data was analyzed to strengthen the novel concept in this study. In this study, coding regions were explored to identify rare deleterious variants within genes from the first analysis together with gene sets reported in PFIC, and diseases with hyperbilirubinemia. Our unsupervised prioritization was primarily designed to identify novel causal genes from nonsynonymous variants derived by three biostatistical algorithms: enrichment analysis, burden test, and trio study. Survival analysis was integratively evaluated with a combination of identified causal genes. The individuals with identified variants from the supervised approach were frequently related to the severity of cirrhosis and poor postoperative outcome. In the unsupervised approach, nonsynonymous variants were enriched. Cilium and muscle related pathways had a significant correlation. CCDC8 was statistically significant gene in which six cases carried mutations identified through burden analysis. Individuals who carried variants in corresponding genes and significant pathways had significantly lower native-liver survival than individuals in whom none of these variants were identified (log-rank p value 0.016). This study explored genetic variations by multiple strategies. Different pathways of cholestatic diseases have been found to be associated with BA. Therefore, BA may be characterized as a shared sequela of many cholestatic disorders. Susceptibility in those pathways suggested an association with BA and strengthened this proposed novel hypothesis. The results emphasized the consequences of many disruptive pathophysiologies."
https://openalex.org/W4308654225,"Litter pollution is a global environmental problem that occurs in virtually all ecosystems. Scientific research on anthropogenic litter and its environmental impacts focusses predominantly on plastics and the marine environment. Little empirical knowledge exists about the distribution and ecological impacts of litter in terrestrial environments, where most litter is produced. To start closing that knowledge gap, we investigated the distribution of litter in a cultural landscape in central Norway and in relation to land cover types. We registered and collected litter in 110 survey plots that were randomly stratified across various land cover types. Our results show that land cover type modulates the occurrence, abundance, fragments size, and that litter is most present and abundant in or near land cover types associated with high human activities. Plastic was by far the most common litter material type, although the litter community (in terms of materials type) was not independent from land cover type. This knowledge can help to inform and optimize litter management and clean-up activities in terrestrial landscapes. How and to what extent the spatial structure of the litter community mediates ecological effects across various land cover types remains unknown to a large extent and warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W4308654569,"Dehumanization is frequently cited as a precursor to mass violence, but quantitative support for this notion is scarce. The present work provides such support by examining the dehumanization of Jews in Nazi propaganda. Our linguistic analysis suggests that Jews were progressively denied the capacity for fundamentally human mental experiences leading up to the Holocaust. Given that the recognition of another’s mental experience promotes moral concern, these results are consistent with the theory that dehumanization facilitates violence by dis engaging moral concern. However, after the onset of the Holocaust, our results suggest that Jews were attributed a greater capacity for agentic mental states. We speculate this may reflect a process of demonization in which Nazi propagandists portrayed the Jews as highly capable of planning and intentionality while nonetheless possessing a subhuman moral character. These suggestive results paint a nuanced portrait of the temporal dynamics of dehumanization during the Holocaust and provide impetus for further empirical scrutiny of dehumanization in ecologically valid contexts."
