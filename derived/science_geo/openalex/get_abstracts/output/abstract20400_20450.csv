https://openalex.org/W2019951936,"The direct effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the contractility of mammalian heart were studied. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-2 inhibited contractility of isolated hamster papillary muscles in a concentration-dependent, reversible manner. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) blocked these negative inotropic effects. L-Arginine reversed the inhibition by L-NMMA. Removal of the endocardial endothelium did not alter these responses. These findings demonstrate that the direct negative inotropic effect of cytokines is mediated through a myocardial nitric oxide synthase. The regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and myocardial nitric oxide synthase may provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2072252693,"A third subunit, the gamma chain, of the human interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) was identified, and a complementary DNA clone encoding this member of the cytokine receptor family was isolated. The gamma chain is necessary for the formation of the high- and intermediate-affinity receptors, which consists of alpha beta gamma heterotrimers and beta gamma heterodimers, respectively. The IL-2R on murine fibroblastoid cells can be internalized after binding IL-2 only if the gamma chain is present; alpha and beta are insufficient for internalization. Thus, the gamma chain is an indispensable component of the functional IL-2R."
https://openalex.org/W1528581371,"We recently reported that the glucose transporter isoform, GLUT5, is expressed on the brush border membrane of human small intestinal enterocytes (Davidson, N. O., Hausman, A. M. L., Ifkovits, C. A., Buse, J. B., Gould, G. W., Burant, C. F., and Bell, G. I. (1992) Am. J. Physiol. 262, C795-C800). To define its role in sugar transport, human GLUT5 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and its substrate specificity and kinetic properties determined. GLUT5 exhibits selectivity for fructose transport, as determined by inhibition studies, with a Km of 6 mM. In addition, fructose transport by GLUT5 is not inhibited by cytochalasin B, a competitive inhibitor of facilitative glucose transporters. RNA and protein blotting studies showed the presence of high levels of GLUT5 mRNA and protein in human testis and spermatozoa, and immunocytochemical studies localize GLUT5 to the plasma membrane of mature spermatids and spermatozoa. The biochemical properties and tissue distribution of GLUT5 are consistent with a physiological role for this protein as a fructose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1973238216,"The βA4 protein, the major component of the amyloid deposition characterizing Alzheimer's disease, derives from the amyloid protein precursor (APP), an integral membrane protein with soluble derivatives. The function of APP is unknown. Both soluble and membrane-associated human brain APP (10−10 M) significantly increased (P < 0.025) neurite length and branching in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, but did not affect the number of neurites per cell. At higher concentrations, APP was cytotoxic, with a half-maximal concentration of 5 × 10−9 M. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is known to affect APP expression in vivo and in vitro. Antibodies to APP specifically diminished the effects of NGF on neurite length and branching. Thus APP may act to mediate neurite outgrowth promotion by NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2044440492,"The transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta 1 through -beta 5) are a family of homodimeric cytokines that regulate proliferation and function in many cell types. Family members have 66 to 80% sequence identity and nine strictly conserved cysteines. A crystal structure of a member of this family, TGF-beta 2, has been determined at 2.1 angstrom (A) resolution and refined to an R factor of 0.172. The monomer lacks a well-defined hydrophobic core and displays an unusual elongated nonglobular fold with dimensions of approximately 60 A by 20 A by 15 A. Eight cysteines form four intrachain disulfide bonds, which are clustered in a core region forming a network complementary to the network of hydrogen bonds. The dimer is stabilized by the ninth cysteine, which forms an interchain disulfide bond, and by two identical hydrophobic interfaces. Sequence profile analysis of other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, including the activins, inhibins, and several developmental factors, imply that they also adopt the TGF-beta fold."
https://openalex.org/W1590595627,"Structural requirements for the activation of transducin by rhodopsin have been studied by site-specific mutagenesis of bovine rhodopsin. A variety of single amino acid replacements and amino acid insertions and deletions of varying sizes were carried out in the two cytoplasmic loops CD (amino acids 134-151) and EF (amino acids 231-252). Except for deletion mutant delta 137-150, all the mutants bound 11-cis-retinal and displayed normal spectral characteristics. Deletion mutant delta 236-239 in loop EF caused a 50% reduction of transducin activation, whereas deletion mutant delta 244-249 and the larger deletions in loop EF abolished transducin activation. An 8-amino acid deletion in the cytoplasmic loop CD as well as a replacement of 13 amino acids with an unrelated sequence showed no transducin activation. Several single amino acid substitutions also caused significant reduction in transducin activation. The conserved charged pair Glu-134/Arg-135 in the cytoplasmic loop CD was required for transducin activation; its reversal or neutralization abolished transducin activation. Three amino acid replacements in loop EF (S240A, T243V, and K248L) resulted in significant reduction in transducin activation. We conclude that 1) both the cytoplasmic loops CD and EF are required for transducin activation, and 2) effective functional interaction between rhodopsin and transducin involves relatively large peptide sequences in the cytoplasmic loops."
https://openalex.org/W2023013885,"The induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells requires a rise in postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). To determine the time for which Ca2+ must remain elevated to induce LTP, the photolabile Ca2+ buffer diazo-4 was used to limit the duration of the rise in postsynaptic [Ca2+]i following a tetanus. The affinity of diazo-4 for Ca2+ increases approximately 1600-fold upon flash photolysis, permitting almost instantaneous buffering of [Ca2+]i without disturbing resting [Ca2+]i prior to the flash. Photolysis of diazo-4 1 s following the start of the tetanus blocked LTP, while delaying photolysis for more than 2 s had no discernible effect on LTP. Photolyzing diazo-4 at intermediate delays (1.5-2 s) or reducing photolysis of diazo-4 often resulted in short-term potentiation (STP). These results indicate that a tetanus-induced rise in postsynaptic [Ca2+]i lasting at most 2-2.5 s is sufficient to generate LTP. Smaller increases or shorter duration rises in [Ca2+]i may result in STP."
https://openalex.org/W1579134710,"We report here that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming of rabbit alveolar macrophages leads to amplified synthesis of prostanoids, at least in part, by induction of a novel prostaglandin H synthase (PGH synthase). Rabbit alveolar macrophages were cultured with or without added LPS derived from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 for 4 h and then stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OPZ). LPS priming of alveolar macrophages resulted in enhanced release of thromboxane (TX) upon stimulation with OPZ, when compared to stimulated non-LPS controls. Addition of exogenous arachidonic acid to LPS-primed alveolar macrophages also resulted in increased production of TX. The LPS-induced increase in TX formation, in response to OPZ or arachidonic acid, was abolished by the addition of actinomycin D or cycloheximide during the priming period. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis indicated that levels of prostaglandins D2, E2, and F2 alpha, along with TX, were augmented in stimulated LPS-primed alveolar macrophages, implicating PGH synthase in the priming process. PGH synthase enzymatic activity, as determined by addition of arachidonic acid to macrophage sonicates, was markedly enhanced in LPS-primed alveolar macrophages. This correlated with increased PGH synthase levels detected by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins and by Western blot analysis. Finally, Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe to the recently described mitogen-inducible mouse PGH synthase revealed strong induction of approximately 4.3-kilobase mRNA in LPS-primed alveolar macrophages. Taken together, these results reveal that induction of a novel PGH synthase, probably the rabbit homologue of PGH synthase-2, plays a role in the enhanced synthesis of prostanoids by LPS-primed alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2056236921,"The development of the rat striatum was investigated using a combination of two histochemically distinguishable retrovirus vectors. Using this method, it was possible to identify clonal boundaries within the embryonic striatum and thus determine patterns of proliferation, migration, and some lineal relationships. Several novel aspects of striatal histogenesis were discovered. Striatal progenitor cells do not exhibit a stem cell pattern of division between embryonic day 15 (E15) and E19; a progenitor-progeny relationship appears to exist for ventricular zone and subventricular zone (SVZ) cells; striatal progenitors produce a variety of clone types; some SVZ cells migrate radially, and some migrate tangentially within the SVZ; and radial glia and presumptive neurons can occur in the same clone."
https://openalex.org/W1545350340,"Cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is one of five separable factors known to be required for 3' cleavage and polyadenylation of mRNA precursors in vitro. Previous studies have shown that the cleavage and poly(A) addition reactions can be uncoupled in vitro and have suggested that CPSF may be the only factor essential for both of these subreactions. Here we report the purification of CPSF to near homogeneity from calf thymus and show that the purified factor contains three polypeptides of 165, 105, and 70 kDa. These polypeptides cosediment precisely with CPSF activity, which has a sedimentation coefficient of 11.5 S. Consistent with previous reports from our laboratory, purified CPSF does not contain a detectable RNA component, indicating that it is a multisubunit protein and not a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Extensively purified bovine CPSF can function with human poly(A) polymerase to bring about AAUAAA-dependent poly(A) addition or with human cleavage factors to catalyze accurate 3' cleavage of a pre-mRNA substrate. UV cross-linking and gel retention analyses demonstrate that highly purified CPSF interacts with one of these cleavage factors, the multisubunit cleavage-stimulation factor, to facilitate stable binding of both to an AAUAAA-containing pre-mRNA. Likewise, evidence is presented indicating that poly(A) polymerase and CPSF can interact directly."
https://openalex.org/W1542522931,"The antiparallel side-to-side association of spectrin alpha and beta monomers is a two-step process which occurs in seconds even at 0 degrees C and at low concentrations. Assembly involves initial contact of complementary nucleation sites on each subunit, which are located near the actin binding end of the long, flexible heterodimer rod. The minimum nucleation sites are comprised of approximately four contiguous 106-residue homologous segments or repeats. Three repeats in the nucleation site contain an 8-residue insertion and have the highest homology to the four spectrin-like repeats in alpha-actinin. The adjacent actin binding domain on the beta subunit and the adjacent EF hand motifs on the alpha subunit are not required for heterodimer assembly. The nucleation sites probably have a specific lock and key structure which defines the unique side-to-side pairing of the many homologous segments in both subunits. Assembly of spectrin heterodimers is probably most analogous to a zipper. After initial nucleation site binding, the remainder of the subunits quickly associate along their full lengths to reconstitute a normal dimer by supercoiling around each other to form a rope-like, flexible rod. Assembly is terminated if either polypeptide is interrupted by a protease cleavage. Heterozygotic mutations involving either nucleation site are predicted to affect allele incorporation into the mature membrane skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1513888586,"To define cis-acting genetic elements responsible for cell-specific transcriptional regulation of the CC10 gene, DNA sequences spanning nucleotides -2338 to +49 of the rat CC10 gene were linked to a reporter gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). In transient expression assays, CC10 sequences were capable of restricting CAT expression to a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line similar to pulmonary Clara cells. Transgenic mice harboring the hybrid RtCC10-CAT construct expressed high levels of CAT activity specifically within protein extracts of lung and trachea. Transcripts for the CAT reporter gene colocalized with those for the endogenous murine CC10 gene within the airways of transgenic mice. Functional analysis of deletion mutants identified stimulatory, inhibitory, and cell type-specific transcriptional regulatory elements. The results of gel retention and DNaseI protection assays suggest that a transcriptional stimulatory region located between -320 and -175, and a cell type-specific regulatory element located between -175 and +49, result from a series of protein-DNA interactions occurring at -220 to -205 and -128 to -86, respectively. Lung epithelial specific transcriptional regulatory elements described herein will be useful for expression of chimeric genes within epithelial cells lining the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles of mice."
https://openalex.org/W1565585976,"Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and human liver RNase were found to be indistinguishable from each other but distinct from the pancreatic ribonucleases in their nucleolytic activity on polynucleotides or small defined substrates. Antibodies to EDN and liver RNase showed identical cross-reactivities in assays of nuclease inhibition and in a radioimmunoassay. In each instance, EDN and liver RNase were easily distinguished from bovine or human pancreatic RNase. When injected intrathecally into rabbits, 5-10 micrograms of EDN or liver RNase each was neurotoxic as judged by induction of the Gordon phenomenon. Human pancreatic RNase was less neurotoxic, and up to 20-fold higher levels of bovine pancreatic RNase showed no effect. Treatment of EDN, liver RNase, and eosinophil cationic protein with iodoacetic acid at pH 5.5 resulted in inactivation of their RNase activity and also destroyed their neurotoxicity. EDN conformation was not greatly affected by iodoacetate treatment since interaction of the modified protein with antibodies was only slightly altered. We conclude that RNase activity is necessary but not sufficient to induce neurotoxic action."
https://openalex.org/W1967623043,"The molecular basis for recognition of nonnative proteins by the molecular chaperone SecB was investigated with an in vitro assay based on the protection of SecB from proteolysis when a ligand is bound. The SecB tetramer has multiple binding sites for positively charged peptides. When the peptide binding sites are occupied, the complex undergoes a conformational change to expose hydrophobic sites that bind the fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate. A model is proposed for interaction of nonnative polypeptides with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites on SecB."
https://openalex.org/W1496868775,"Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type I (CN-I) is a potentially lethal disorder characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia resulting from a recessively inherited deficiency of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase (UGT) activity toward bilirubin (B-UGT). Two forms of B-UGT exist in human liver. mRNAs for these two forms and that for another isoform with activity toward simple phenols (P-UGT) have unique 5' regions, but their 3' regions are identical. The three mRNA species are derived from a single locus; the unique 5' regions are encoded by single unique exons and the identical 3' regions consist of four consecutive exons that are shared by all three isoforms. In this paper, we determined genetic lesions in two CN-I patients with deficiency of hepatic B-UGT and P-UGT activities. In one patient, there was a C----T substitution in exon 4 (common region) predicting the substitution of a serine residue with a phenylalanine residue; this mutation was present in the identical region of B-UGT and P-UGT mRNAs. In the other patient, a C----T substitution in exon 2 (common region) of the B-UGT/P-UGT locus resulted in a premature stop codon. This exon (132 nt) was absent in heptic B-UGT and P-UGT mRNAs of this patient due to exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing. Sequence abnormality of three distinct mRNA species explains the abnormality of multiple UGT isoforms in these patients. Presence of identical abnormalities in the common regions of the three mRNAs is consistent with the finding that the common 3' regions of the two B-UGT mRNAs and the P-UGT mRNA are encoded by four shared exons."
https://openalex.org/W1899789090,"The fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis metabolized linoleic acid extensively to (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleic acid, (8R)-hydroxylinoleic acid, and threo-(7S,8S)-dihydroxylinoleic acid. When G. graminis was incubated with linoleic acid under an atmosphere of oxygen-18, the isotope was incorporated into (8R)-hydroxylinoleic acid and 7,8-dihydroxylinoleic acid. The two hydroxyls of the latter contained either two oxygen-18 or two oxygen-16 atoms, whereas a molecular species that contained both oxygen isotopes was formed in negligible amounts. Glutathione peroxidase inhibited the biosynthesis of 7,8-dihydroxylinoleic acid. These findings demonstrated that the diol was formed from (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleic acid by intramolecular hydroxylation at carbon 7, catalyzed by a hydroperoxide isomerase. The (8R)-dioxygenase appeared to metabolize substrates with a saturated carboxylic side chain and a 9Z-double bond. G. graminis also formed omega 2- and omega 3-hydroxy metabolites of the fatty acids. In addition, linoleic acid was converted to small amounts of nearly (65% R) racemic 10-hydroxy-8,12-octadecadienoic acid by incorporation of atmospheric oxygen. An unstable metabolite, 11-hydroxylinoleic acid, could also be isolated as well as (13R,13S)-hydroxy-(9E,9Z), (11E)-octadecadienoic acids and (9R,9S)-hydroxy-(10E), (12E,12Z)-octadecadienoic acids. In summary, G. graminis contains a prominent linoleic acid (8R)-dioxygenase, which differs from the lipoxygenase family of dioxygenases by catalyzing the formation of a hydroperoxide without affecting the double bonds of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1505835018,"A putative reservoir of functional plasma membrane proteins, the secretory vesicle identified by latent alkaline phosphatase and tetranectin, has previously been demonstrated based on indirect evidence (Borregaard, N., Miller, L. J., and Springer, T. A. (1987) Science 237, 1204-1206; Borregaard, N., Christensen, L., Bjerrum, O. W., Birgens, H. S., and Clemmesen, I. (1990) J. Clin. Invest. 85, 408-416). Difficulties in separating plasma membranes from this entity by density gradient centrifugation has prohibited discriminative dynamic and quantitative studies of secretory vesicles and plasma membranes. By combining density centrifugation with free flow electrophoresis we overcame this obstacle. Freshly prepared unperturbed human neutrophils were subjected to nitrogen cavitation followed by density centrifugation on Percoll gradients. Light membrane fractions containing plasma membranes and secretory vesicles were applied to high voltage free flow electrophoresis on an Elphor VaP 22. Plasma membrane vesicles, identified by HLA class I antigen mixed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bjerrum, O. W., and Borregaard, N. (1990) Scand. J. Immunol. 31, 305-313) and 125I applied to cells before cavitation, were clearly separated from secretory vesicles. Electron microscopy revealed a morphology typical of plasma membranes in the former fraction and a population of vesicles with markedly different appearance in the latter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles demonstrated distinct differences in protein patterns between the two fractions. Superoxide generating capacity induced by sodium dodecyl sulfate and cytosol, an entity traditionally ascribed to the plasma membrane, was largely confined to fractions containing secretory vesicles. Thus, the majority of membrane-bound NADPH oxidase components of light membranes of human neutrophils colocalize with secretory vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1819267033,"The genetic control of susceptibility to many common diseases, including cancer, is multigenic both in humans and in animals. This genetic complexity has presented a major obstacle in mapping the relevant genes. As a consequence, most geneticists and molecular biologists presently focus on ""single gene"" diseases. To make the multigenic diseases accessible to genetic and molecular analysis, we developed a novel genetic tool, the recombinant congenic strains (RCS) in the mouse (4). The RC strains are produced by inbreeding of mice of the second backcross generation between two inbred strains, one of which serves as the ""donor"" and the other as the ""background"" strain. A series of RCS consists of approximately 20 strains, each carrying a different set of genes: approximately 12.5% genes from the common donor inbred strain, the remaining 87.5% from the common background inbred strain. As the set of donor strain genes in each RC strain is different, the nonlinked genes of the donor strain involved in the control of a multigenic trait, e.g., cancer susceptibility, become distributed into different RC strains where they can be analyzed one by one. Hence, the RCS system transforms a multigenic trait into a series of single gene traits, where each gene contributing to the multigenic control can be mapped and studied separately. Recently we demonstrated that the RCS system is indeed capable of resolving multigenic traits, which are hardly analyzable otherwise, by mapping four new colon tumor susceptibility loci (8; P. C. Groot, C. J. A. Moen, W. Dietrich, L. F. M. van Zutphen, E. S. Lander, and P. Demant, unpublished results). For successful application of the RCS system, extensive genetic characterization of the individual recombinant congenic strains is essential. In this paper we present detailed information about the genetic composition of three series of RC strains on the basis of typing of 120-180 markers distributed along all autosomes. The data indicate that the relative representation of the donor strain genes in the RC strains does not deviate from the theoretical expectation, and that the RC strains achieved a very high degree of genetic homogeneity and for all practical purposes can be considered inbred strains. The density and distribution of markers reported here permits an effective mapping of unknown genes of donor strain origin at almost all autosomal locations. Much of this information has been obtained using the new class of genetic markers, the simple sequence repeat polymorphisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2172117830,"To define conserved domains within the light (L) chains of clostridial neurotoxins, we determined the sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type B (BoNT/B) and aligned it with those of tetanus toxin (TeTx) and BoNT/A, BoNT/C1, BoNT/D, and BoNT/E. The L chains of BoNT/B and TeTx share 51.6% identical amino acid residues whereas the degree of identity to other clostridial neurotoxins does not exceed 36.5%. Each of the L chains contains a conserved motif, HExxHxxH, characteristic for metalloproteases. We then generated specific 5'- and 3'-deletion mutants of the L chain genes of TeTx and BoNT/A and tested the biological properties of the gene products by microinjection of the corresponding mRNAs into identified presynaptic cholinergic neurons of the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. Toxicity was determined by measurement of neurotransmitter release, as detected by depression of postsynaptic responses to presynaptic stimuli (Mochida, S., Poulain, B., Eisel, U., Binz, T., Kurazono, H., Niemann, H., and Tauc, L. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 7844-7848). Our studies allow the following conclusions. 1) Residues Cys439 of TeTx and Cys430 of BoNT/A, both of which participate in the interchain disulfide bond, play no role in the toxification reaction. 2) Derivatives of TeTx that lacked either 8 amino- or 65 carboxyl-terminal residues are still toxic, whereas those lacking 10 amino- or 68 carboxyl-terminal residues are nontoxic. 3) For BoNT/A, toxicity could be demonstrated only in the presence of added nontoxic heavy (H) chain. A deletion of 8 amino-terminal or 32 carboxyl-terminal residues from the L chain had no effect on toxicity, whereas a removal of 10 amino-terminal or 57 carboxyl-terminal amino acids abolished toxicity. 4) The synergistic effect mediated by the H chain is linked to the carboxyl-terminal portion of the H chain, as demonstrated by injection of HC-specific mRNA into neurons containing the L chain. This finding suggests that the HC domain of the H chain becomes exposed to the cytosol during or after the putative translocation step of the L chain."
https://openalex.org/W1600945450,"The conformation of the fully disulfide-reduced state of human serum albumin was investigated by tryptophan fluorescence spectrum, CD analyses, and size-exclusion chromatography. Both the reduction of the native disulfide-bonded form under nondenaturing conditions and the refolding of the urea-denatured disulfide-reduced form under reduced conditions yielded almost exactly the same disulfide-reduced state with partially folded unique conformation that was clearly distinguished from either the native or fully denatured state. In addition, the interconversion between the urea-denatured reduced form and the partially folded reduced form was reversible with each other; by reoxidation, the partially folded reduced form was converted to the disulfide-bonded form. The conformation of disulfide-reduced serum albumin was highly variable depending on pH and ionic strength conditions. Thus, we concluded that the disulfide-reduced state with partially folded variable conformation is involved in the reversible interconversion between the denatured reduced form and the native disulfide-bonded form of human serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1594935738,"Consensus sequences at the splice donor, splice acceptor, and lariat branch point regions are necessary but insufficient determinants of splice-site selection in nuclear precursor mRNAs. Sequences outside of these regions can have a significant effect on the utilization of splice sites. Although the mode of action of such sequences is undefined in most cases, higher order RNA structures have been suggested as a potential contributor to splice-site selection. During a detailed analysis of the splicing patterns of the human growth hormone transcript, we located 2 bases in the vicinity of the exon 3 major splice-acceptor site (B) which facilitate the utilization of a competing downstream acceptor (B'). The effects of a series of site-specific mutations on the splicing pattern demonstrate that these 2 bases function by stabilizing a specific stem-loop structure in the native transcript. This defined secondary structure selectively encompasses the upstream B splice-acceptor site together with its lariat branch point region. Increasing the predicted stability of this stem by point mutations results in a corresponding shift in splicing towards the alternative B' splice-acceptor site. These results indicate that a specific secondary structure within the native human growth hormone transcript controls the relative utilization of two competing splice-acceptor sites with the consequent generation of two functionally distinct hormone isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1544627945,"smg GDS and rho GDI are stimulatory and inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange proteins, respectively, for a group of ras p21-related small GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). rho p21 is a common substrate small G protein for both GDP/GTP exchange proteins. We examined here the functional interactions of these GDP/GTP exchange proteins with rho p21 as a substrate. smg GDS and rho GDI interacted with the GDP-bound form of rho p21 and thereby stimulated and inhibited, respectively, the dissociation of GDP. The inhibitory effect of rho GDI was much stronger than the stimulatory effect of smg GDS. The GDP-bound form of rho p21 formed a complex with rho GDI but not with smg GDS in their simultaneous presence. Since the content of smg GDS was generally less than that of rho GDI in cells, these results suggest that there is some mechanism to release the inhibitory action of rho GDI and to make rho p21 sensitive to the smg GDS action during the conversion of rhoA p21 from the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form in intact cells. On the other hand, rho p21 was previously shown to be ADP-ribosylated by bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases, named C3 and EDIN, at Asn41 in the putative effector region of rho p21. This ADP-ribosylation was inhibited by rho GDI much more efficiently than by smg GDS. These results suggest that rho GDI may mask the putative effector region of rho p21 and thereby inhibit its interaction with the target protein even in the presence of smg GDS. Thus, both smg GDS and rho GDI are important to regulate the rho p21 activity and action in cooperation with each other."
https://openalex.org/W1559905828,"The unicellular rhodophyte, Porphyridium cruentum, and the filamentous cyanobacterium, Calothrix sp. PCC 7601, contain phycobiliproteins that have covalently bound phycobilin chromophores. Overnight incubation of solvent-extracted cells at 40 degrees C with methanol liberates free phycobilins that are derived from the protein-bound bilins by methanolytic cleavage of the thioether linkages between bilin and apoprotein. Two of the free bilins were identified as 3(E)-phycocyanobilin and 3(E)-phycoerythrombilin by comparative spectrophotometry and high pressure liquid chromatography. Methanolysis also yields a third bilin free acid whose absorption and 1H NMR spectra support the assignment of the 3(E)-phytochromobilin structure. This novel bilin is the major pigment isolated from cells that are pre-extracted with acetone-containing solvents. Since phytochrome- or phytochromobilin-containing proteins are not present in either organism, the 3(E)-phytochromobilin must arise by oxidation of phycobilin chromophores. This pigment is not obtained by similar treatment of a cyanobacterium and a rhodophyte that lack phycoerythrin. Therefore, 3(E)-phytochromobilin appears to be derived from phycoerythrobilin-containing proteins. Comparative CD spectroscopy of 3(E)-phytochrombilin and 3(E)-phycocyanobilin suggests that the two bilins share the R stereochemistry at the 2-position in the reduced pyrrole ring. Incubation of 2(R),3(E)-phytochromobilin with recombinant oat apophytochrome yields a covalent bilin adduct that is photoactive and spectrally indistinguishable from native oat phytochrome isolated from etiolated seedlings. These results establish that the phycobiliprotein-derived 2(R),3(E)-phytochromobilin is a biologically active phytochrome chromophore precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1550100123,"Ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, directs the ATP-dependent formation of a thiol ester linkage between itself and ubiquitin. The energy in this bond is ultimately used to attach ubiquitin to various intracellular proteins. We previously reported the isolation of multiple E1s from wheat and the characterization of a cDNA encoding this protein (UBA1). We now report the derived amino acid sequence of two additional members of this gene family (UBA2 and UBA3). Whereas the amino acid sequence of UBA2 is nearly identical to UBA1, the sequence of UBA3 is significantly different. Nevertheless, the protein encoded by UBA3 catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin in vitro. Comparison of derived amino acid sequences of genes encoding E1 from plant, yeast, and animal tissues revealed 5 conserved cysteine residues, with one potentially involved in thiol ester bond formation. To identify this essential residue, codons corresponding to each of the 5 cysteines in UBA1 were individually altered using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenized enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for their ability to activate ubiquitin. Only substitution of the cysteine at position 626 abolishes E1 activity, suggesting that this residue forms the thiol ester linkage with ubiquitin."
https://openalex.org/W2124765872,"Rat hepatoma (FAO) cells were stably transfected with the gene encoding either rat proinsulin II (using the DOL retroviral vector) or human proinsulin (using the RSV retroviral vector). Using the DOL vector, production of insulin immunoreactive material was stimulated up to 30-fold by dexamethasone (5 x 10(-7) M). For both proinsulins, fractional release of immunoreactive material relative to cellular content was high, in keeping with the absence of any storage compartment for secretory proteins in these cells. Pulse-chase experiments showed kinetics of release of newly synthesized products in keeping with release via the constitutive pathway. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed immunoreactivity in the medium distributed between three peaks. For rat proinsulin II, the first coeluted with intact proinsulin; the second coeluted with des-64,65 split proinsulin (the product of endoproteolytic attack between the insulin A-chain and C-peptide followed by trimming of C-terminal basic residues by carboxypeptidase); the third (and minor peak) coeluted with native (fully processed) insulin. For human proinsulin, by contrast, the second peak coeluted with des-31,32 split proinsulin (split and trimmed at the B-chain/C-peptide junction). Analysis of cellular extracts showed intact proinsulin as the major product. The generation of the putative conversion intermediates and insulin was not due to proteolysis of proinsulin after its release but rather to an intracellular event. The data suggest that proinsulin, normally processed in secretory granules and released via the regulated pathway, may also be processed, albeit less efficiently, by the constitutive pathway conversion machinery. The comparison of the sites preferentially cleaved in rat II or human proinsulin suggests cleavage by endoprotease(s) with a preference for R/KXR/KR as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1527792826,"We showed previously that upon insulin stimulation of an insulin receptor overexpressing cell line, most of the p21ras was rapidly converted into the GTP bound state (Burgering, B. M. T., Medema, R. H., Maassen, J. A., Van de Wetering, M. L., Van der Eb, A. J., McCormick, F., and Bos, J. L. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1103-1109). To determine whether this process also occurs in cells expressing physiologically relevant numbers of insulin receptors, insulin stimulated Ras.GTP formation was quantitated in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-derived cell lines expressing varying numbers of insulin receptors. In the parental CHO9 cells, expressing only 5.10(3) insulin receptors, insulin stimulation for 3 min increased Ras.GTP levels with 10%. Upon increasing the number of insulin receptors in these cells, Ras.GTP levels increased almost proportionally until a plateau value of 60% is reached at high receptor numbers. These data show that receptor overexpression is not a prerequisite for insulin-stimulated Ras.GTP formation. The yield of Ras.GTP generated is 0.2-1.0 mol/mol autophosphorylated insulin receptor in CHO9- and NIH3T3-derived cell lines, respectively. These values argue against signal-amplifying processes between the insulin receptor and p21ras. To determine whether receptor autophosphorylation is required for Ras.GTP formation, NIH3T3 cells overexpressing insulin receptors were stimulated with a monoclonal antibody which activates the receptor and subsequent glucose transport without inducing detectable autophosphorylation. Also, CHO cells expressing the mutant Ser1200 receptor, which has markedly impaired tyrosyl autophosphorylation but is capable of mediating insulin-stimulated metabolic effects in CHO cells, were used. In both cases, no Ras.GTP formation was observed. Furthermore, Rat-1-derived cell lines expressing mutant p21ras, which is permanently in the active GTP-bound form, still responded to insulin by increasing the glucose uptake. These results support our hypothesis that Ras.GTP formation is activated by the tyrosyl-phosphorylated insulin receptor and suggest that an active Ras.GTP complex does not mediate metabolic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1532894629,"We have examined the metabolism of three radiolabeled 1,2-diacylglycerols (DGs) in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Since the lipids used are not appreciably taken up by the cells, we used a phosphatidylserine (PS)-based liposome fusion system to rapidly associate the lipid species with the plasma membrane. When 1,2-[1-14C]dioleoyl-sn-3-glycerol ([14C]DOG) is delivered in this way, it is rapidly converted predominantly to phosphatidylcholine (PC) and triacylglycerol (TG) and to a lesser extent, to monoacylglycerol (MG) and fatty acids (FA), as well as phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). We present evidence that [14C] DOG is largely utilized as an intact molecule rather than being broken down to FA and then incorporated to cell lipids. Examination of the metabolism of 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]myristoyl-sn-3-glycerol ([14C]SMG) and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-3-glycerol ([14C]SAG) reveal important differences. Both produce substantial labeling of PC but [14C]SMG gives rise to the highest proportion of TG and the lowest of PA and PI, whereas [14C]SAG yields the opposite pattern. When phosphatidic acid labeled on its glycerol backbone (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-[U-14C] glycero-3-phosphate) was supplied to the cells via the liposomes, rapid appearance of labeled DG was found which then decreased with concomitant labeling of cellular PC and TG. Only small amounts of the glycerol backbone were recovered in PI. Our experiments identify three types of processes involved in the metabolism of plasma membrane DGs: (i) transferase-catalyzed conversions to PC and TG, (ii) lipolytic breakdown to MG and FA, and (iii) phosphorylation to PA and then conversion to PI. The relative proportions of each DG species converted to these different products are strongly dependent on the fatty acyl composition of the particular DG molecular species, even though formation of PC is the major event in all cases. Since DGs are important second messengers, our study supports the view that conversion to PC and TG can play a key role in DG signal attenuation."
https://openalex.org/W1599847784,"Abstract Human interleukin-8 (IL-8) was evaluated for its capability to induce the synthesis and release of platelet-activating factor (PAF) from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). IL-8 promotes in a dose-dependent fashion (1-100 ng/ml) a rapid synthesis of PAF, which is only partially released. The synthesis of PAF is preceded by the activation of acetyl-CoA: 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetyl-transferase, suggesting that IL-8 activates the remodeling pathway of PAF synthesis. By thin layer chromatography and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, we demonstrated that PAF synthesized by human PMN stimulated with IL-8 is heterogeneous: the 2-acetylated phospholipids having the biological and physicochemical characteristics of PAF include the 1-O-alkyl form, which is produced in large extent (51%), and the 1-acyl form (20%). The analysis of the individual molecular species of radyl chain indicated nine peaks, 16:0 and 18:0 being the predominant forms. These results identify PAF as a direct product of IL-8 stimulation in PMN."
https://openalex.org/W1544111147,"Rat liver mitochondria possess a specific choline transporter in the inner membrane. The transporter shows saturable kinetics at high membrane potential with a Km of 220 microM and a Vmax of 0.4 nmol/mg of protein/min at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. At physiological concentrations of choline, the rate of choline uptake by the transporter shows a linear dependence on membrane potential; uptake is distinct from the nonspecific cation diffusion process. Hemicholinium-3, hemicholinium-15, quinine, and quinidine, all analogues of choline, are high affinity competitive inhibitors of choline transport with Ki values of 17, 55, 15, and 127 microM, respectively. The choline transporter is distinct from other known mitochondrial transporters. Rat heart mitochondria do not appear to possess a choline transporter. Evidence suggests that the transporter is an electrophoretic uniporter. Analogue studies have shown that the hydroxyl and the quaternary ammonium groups of choline are necessary for binding to the transporter. A comparison of molecular models of choline and the high affinity inhibitors has provided evidence for the preferred conformation of choline for binding to the transporter. The presence of a choline transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane provides a potential site for control of choline oxidation and hence supply of endogenous betaine."
https://openalex.org/W2156563300,"The interaction between sulfonylureas and membrane proteins from a hamster insulin-secreting tumor (HIT) cell line has been examined. Four HIT cell membrane proteins were covalently linked to an 125I-labeled analog by photolabeling. Three photolabeled polypeptides of M(r) 65,000, 55,000, and 30,000 were identified as low affinity glyburide receptors. These proteins appear to be of similar abundance, when quantitated by photolabeling, with half-maximal displacements (Ki values) by glyburide, glipizide, and tolbutamide in the low micromolar range. The analog is more tightly bound to a M(r) 140,000 protein with dissociation constants, determined by filtration binding assays and by photolabeling, of 7 and 9.0 nM, respectively. The labeled analog was displaced from the M(r) 140,000 protein by glyburide, glipizide and tolbutamide with Ki values of 3.3 nM, 103 nM, and 25 microM, respectively, as estimated by photolabeling. Optimal conditions established for visualizing the M(r) 140,000 band on autoradiograms prepared after UV cross-linking and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis include irradiating the radioligand-receptor complex at 1.5 J/cm2 at 312 nm, followed by heating samples in pH 9.0 sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel sample buffer. With receptor sites partially occupied (5 nM radioligand), approximately 0.75% of the protein is photocoupled to the radioligand and visualized by autoradiography. Our results confirm that the M(r) 140,000 polypeptide contains the beta-cell high affinity binding site and show that the second generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs have a selective increase in affinity for this receptor."

Immunohistochemistry using MAb B2 revealed that the B2 molecule was expessed in both the inner and outer plexiform layers within the neural retina. During development of the neural retina, the B2 molecule first appeared at stages in the newly formed plexiform layers. When embryonic eyes were cultured in the presence of anti-B2 antiserum (Fab fragments), the formation of the retinal plexiform layers was impeded. These data suggest that the cell surface molecule B2 plays a role in the development of retinal plexiform layers."
https://openalex.org/W1596620874,"ATP (CTP):tRNA-specific tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is an enzyme required for the synthesis of functional tRNAs in eukaryotic cells. Neither the tRNA genes in the nucleus nor in organelles encode the CCA end, so it must be added post-transcriptionally. The gene that codes for the enzyme that adds the CCA end to nuclear coded tRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated (Aebi, M., Kirchner, G., Chen, J.-Y., Vijayraghavan, U., Jacobson, A., Martin, N. C., and Abelson, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16216-16220). We now demonstrate that there is a mitochondrial tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity in yeast and that it is a matrix enzyme. A comparison of purified mitochondrial enzyme with its cytoplasmic counterpart revealed no differences. These results suggest that proteins responsible for this step in the maturation of tRNAs in the nucleus and mitochondria might be identical and coded by the same nuclear gene. Accumulation of shortened mitochondrial as well as cytoplasmic tRNAs in a strain with a temperature-sensitive tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is consistent with this hypothesis. Alteration of the wild type gene such that amino-terminal truncated proteins are produced leads to a defect in mitochondrial function and a decrease in mitochondrial nucleotidyltransferase activity. This provides a direct demonstration that one gene provides this enzyme activity for the biosynthesis of tRNAs in both the nuclear/cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1502368348,"The emergence of azidothymidine (AZT)-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) variants in clinical samples was studied by a direct genomic sequencing method. Sequential lymphocyte samples from four patients, who had been treated with AZT for up to 27 months, were shown to gradually accumulate multiple nucleotide changes, some of which are known to be associated with AZT resistance. Several samples were shown to contain mixtures of wild-type and mutated genomes, indicating gradual rather than sudden changes in the HIV-1 quasispecies. These results demonstrate for the first time that automated solid-phase DNA sequencing is a rapid and useful tool for investigation of antiviral drug resistance and suggest that DNA sequencing may be important in routine clinical diagnostics in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1577201834,"Hexanoate and octanoate inhibit the triiodothyronine (T3)-induced increases in the activities of malic enzyme and fatty acid synthase in chick embryo hepatocytes in culture. Butanoate was less effective as an inhibitor, and palmitate, stearate, and oleate had no effect or small stimulatory effects. Hexanoate and octanoate inhibited the lipogenic enzyme activities at a transcriptional step, and did so within 30 min of addition. Incubation for 2 h in the absence of fatty acid reversed the inhibition of transcription caused by hexanoate. The inhibitory effect of hexanoate was selective because DNA content and transcription of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin genes were not inhibited. Hexanoate-mediated inhibition of transcription rates of the lipogenic genes was not correlated with an inhibition of binding of T3 to its nuclear receptor. 2-Bromooctanoate and carnitine stimulated the T3-induced accumulation of the mRNAs for malic enzyme and fatty acid synthase. The presence of hexanoate stimulated by 2- to 3-fold the increase caused by carnitine, suggesting that hexanoate and carnitine may regulate lipogenic gene expression by a common pathway. Hexanedioate, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, branched chain fatty acids, and branched chain keto acids had little or no effect on abundance of the lipogenic mRNAs. We suggest that the active inhibitor is a metabolite derived from hexanoate or octanoate, possibly an intermediate derived from an acyl-CoA derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1488254260,"The prothrombinase complex, which catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, consists of activated Factor X, Factor Va, a membrane surface and Ca2+. To examine the structures that support Factor Va binding to Factor X, we used in vitro mutagenesis to construct a chimeric molecule that includes regions of Factor IX and Factor X. This chimera (IXGla,E1XE2,SP) was prepared from cDNA encoding the second epidermal growth factor (EGF) and serine protease domains of Factor X linked downstream from the cDNA encoding the signal peptide, propeptide, Gla domain, and first EGF domain of Factor IX. The cDNAs encoding the Factor IX/X chimera and wild-type Factor X were each expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and the secreted proteins purified by affinity chromatography using polyclonal anti-Factor X antibodies. The chimera migrated as a single major band corresponding to a molecular weight of 68,000. By Western blotting, the chimeric protein stained with both polyclonal anti-Factor X and anti-Factor IX antibodies. gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid analysis demonstrated near complete carboxylation of both the wild-type Factor X and the Factor IX/X chimera. Compared with Factor X, the rate of zymogen activation of the Factor IX/X chimera was about 50% that of Factor X when activated by Factor IXa, Factor VIIIa, phospholipid, and Ca2+. The enzyme form of the Factor IX/X chimera, activated Factor IX/X, generated using the coagulant protein of Russell's viper venom, expressed full amidolytic activity compared with Factor Xa. The activated Factor IX/X chimera had about 14% of the activity of Factor Xa when employed in a prothrombinase assay; this activity reached 100% with increasing concentrations of Factor Va. A binding assay was employed to test the ability of the active site-inactivated Factor IX/Xa chimera to inhibit the binding of Factor Xa to the Factor Va-phospholipid complex, thus inhibiting the activation of prothrombin to thrombin. In this assay the active site-inactivated form of the chimera competed with Factor Xa completely but with decreased affinity for the Factor Va-phospholipid complex. These data indicate that the second EGF domain and the serine protease domain of Factor Xa are sufficient to interact with Factor Va. The Factor IX/X chimera is a good substrate for the tenase complex; the defective enzymatic activity of the activated Factor IX/X chimera can be accounted for by its decreased affinity for Factor Va relative to Factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W1518000831,"Abstract The hydrolysis of (SM) is a key reaction in the sphingomyelin cycle, which plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (Okazaki, T., Bell, R. M., and Hannun, Y. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). SM is produced from endoplasmic reticulum-derived ceramide and is delivered to organelle membranes in a regulated manner, presumably through the same endomembrane trafficking system used for sorting and delivery of proteins. Since brefeldin A (BFA) interferes with this endomembrane trafficking system and thus alters normal membrane and organelle distribution, we investigated the effect of BFA on SM levels in HL-60 leukemia cells. BFA caused a dose-dependent decrease of 20-25% in cellular SM levels, with effects observed at concentrations of BFA as low as 0.10 microgram/ml. BFA effects on SM levels were noted as early as 5 min and were maximal by 20 min, with no further SM hydrolysis observed up to 60 min following treatment with BFA, suggesting the presence of a fixed SM-sensitive pool. BFA did not cause SM hydrolysis at 16 degrees C, a temperature that inhibits the effects of BFA on endomembrane mixing. The very early effects and temperature dependence of BFA-induced SM hydrolysis suggest that the mechanism of hydrolysis may be closely related to endomembrane mixing. These studies are beginning to define important interrelationships between membrane trafficking and topology, SM metabolism, and cell regulation."

The specificity of labeling was demonstrated by saturation effects and protection by the natural compound at physiologically relevant concentrations. Saturation of labeling was observed at 50 microM. Protection experiments indicated an 80% protection of labeling by 100 microM NAD+ when protein was photolyzed in the presence of 10 microM probe. Trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion of the photolabeled protein, along with boronate affinity chromatography and immobilized metal affinity chromatography, was used to specifically isolate the peptide region photolabeled with the probe.

https://openalex.org/W1858232702,"Development of a host immune response against gene products expressed by genetically modified cells could be a serious limitation for gene therapy. During examination of whether site-specific differences in antigen presentation could regulate the host immune response, we observed an absence of antibodies against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) when HBsAg producing transgenic hepatocytes were transplanted into the spleen. Intrasplenic transplantation resulted in translocation of a large number of cells into the portal vascular bed and liver sinusoids. In these recipients, HBsAg secreted by the transplanted hepatocytes circulated indefinitely in the blood. In contrast, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal transplantation of the transgenic hepatocytes induced an anti-HBs response, followed by clearance of serum HBsAg. Rechallenge with HBsAg in a highly immunogenic form failed to break the tolerance in intrasplenic hepatocyte recipients even though these animals responded to another antigen (keyhole limpet hemocyanin). Immunization with HBsAg in intraperitoneal recipients of HBsAg producing hepatocytes further elevated anti-HBs titers. Our results indicate that hepatocyte transplantation into the portal vascular bed via injection into the spleen can confer immune tolerance to secreted heterologous antigens. This finding should have important implications for human gene therapy as well as for analyzing the mechanisms of immune tolerance.— Vemuru, R. P., Davidson, A., Aragona, E., Chowdhury, J.

https://openalex.org/W1489548149,"The role of serine as a precursor and metabolic regulator for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis in the hamster heart was investigated. Hearts were perfused with 50 microM [1-3H]ethanolamine in the presence or absence of serine for up to 60 min. Ethanolamine uptake was attenuated by 0.05-10 mM serine in a noncompetitive manner, and the incorporation of labeled ethanolamine into phosphatidylethanolamine was also inhibited by serine. Analysis of the ethanolamine-containing metabolites in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway revealed that the conversion of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine was reduced. The reduction was a result of an inhibition of ethanolamine kinase activity by an elevated pool of intracellular serine. Perfusion of the heart with 1 mM serine caused a 5-fold increase in intracellular serine pool. In order to examine the action of serine on other phosphatidylethanolamine metabolic pathways, hearts were perfused with [1-3H]glycerol in the presence and absence of serine. Serine did not cause any enhancement of phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis. The base-exchange reaction for phosphatidylserine formation or the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine was not affected by serine perfusion. We conclude that circulating serine plays an important role in the modulation of phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in the hamster heart but does not affect the contribution of the decarboxylase pathway for phosphatidylethanolamine formation."

All these histone H2B variants have N-terminal extensions of between 18 and 20 amino acids, although only those from sea urchin sperm have S(T)PXX motifs present. Whereas chicken histone octamers protected 167 base pairs (bp) (representing two full turns) of DNA against micrococcal nuclease digestion (Lindsey, G. G., Orgeig, S., Thompson, P., Davies, N., and Maeder, D. L. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 218, 805-813), all the hybrid histone octamers protected an additional 17-bp DNA against nuclease digestion. This protection was more marked in the case of hybrid octamers containing sea urchin sperm histone H2B variants and similar to that described previously (Lindsey, G. G., Orgeig, S., Thompson, P., Davies, N., and Maeder, D. L. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 218, 805-813) for hybrid histone octamers containing wheat histone H2A variants all of which also have S(T)PXX motifs present. Continued micrococcal nuclease digestion reduced the length of DNA associated with the core particle via 172-, 162-, and 152-bp intermediates until the 146-bp core particle was obtained. These DNA lengths were approximately 5 bp or half a helical turn longer than those reported previously for stripped chicken chromatin and for core particles containing histone octamers reconstituted using normal length histone H2B variants. This protection pattern was also found in stripped sea urchin sperm chromatin, demonstrating that the assembly/digestion methodology reflects the in vivo situation. The interaction between the N-terminal histone H2B extension and DNA of the linker region was confirmed by demonstrating that stripped sea urchin sperm chromatin precipitated between 120 and 500 mM NaCl in a manner analogous to unstripped chromatin whereas stripped chicken chromatin did not. Tryptic digestion to remove all the histone tails abolished this precipitation as well as the protection of DNA outside of the 167-bp core particle against nuclease digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1992101608,"Primary motoneurons in embryonic zebrafish innervate cell-specific muscles. During pathfinding, motoneuronal growth cones encounter three distinct regions: a common pathway, a choice point, and separate cell-specific pathways. To learn whether the order in which these regions are encountered influences pathway choice, we transplanted individual motoneurons to the choice point region. These cells selected their appropriate cell-specific pathways. Thus, the sequence in which pathway regions are encountered may not be important for accurate path-finding, and the cell-specific pathways may be delineated by distinct cues that individual growth cones recognize. Moreover, these cues are unlikely to be general ones, since primary sensory neurons transplanted to the same location do not extend growth cones along the motoneuronal pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1508742736,"The distribution of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans in clonal rat parathyroid cells is regulated by the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is a principal factor for parathyroid cell function (Takeuchi, Y., Sakaguchi, K., Yanagishita, M., Aurbach, G. D., and Hascall, V. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13661-13668). Increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ in the physiological range redistributes HS proteoglycans from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment. We have now examined effects of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration on the metabolism of the HS proteoglycans in detail using [35S]sulfate metabolic labeling-chase experiments. Two distinct metabolic pathways were demonstrated: (i) the intracellular generation of HS chains from HS proteoglycans in prelysosomal compartments followed by their release into the medium (pathway 1), and (ii) intracellular generation of HS oligosaccharides from HS chains in prelysosomal compartments, which are eventually degraded into free sulfate in lysosomes (pathway 2). The HS oligosaccharides were exclusively present within the cells, whereas HS chains were found primarily in the medium. The cells do not internalize either HS proteoglycans or HS chains from the medium. These observations indicate that these two degradation pathways are independent. In addition to these pathways, approximately 15% of the HS proteoglycans were released into the medium as a proteoglycan form. Treatment of cells with chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent, did not affect generation of HS chains but inhibited conversion of HS chains to HS oligosaccharides or to free sulfate and resulted in the release of HS chains from the cells. The drug did not affect metabolic pathway 1. The extracellular Ca2+ concentration did not alter these intracellular degradation pathways for HS proteoglycans in the parathyroid cells. Thus, extracellular Ca2+ appears to regulate only the distribution of HS proteoglycans between the cell surface and intracellular compartments, and the process of cycling between these compartments when extracellular Ca2+ is low."
https://openalex.org/W1547086986,"We examined recycling of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and transferrin receptor (Tf-R) in a rat parathyroid cell line. While extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) regulates the recycling of HS proteoglycans in parathyroid cells, such that HS proteoglycans only recycle when [Ca2+]e is lowered below physiological levels, recycling of Tf-R occurs equally well both in 0.05 mM (low) and 2 mM (high) [Ca2+]e. Inhibiting endocytosis chemically with phenylarsine oxide or at low temperature (4 degrees C) did not abolish the effects of changing [Ca2+]e on HS proteoglycans in the recycling compartment even though transport of HS proteoglycans from the Golgi complex to the cell surface was inhibited in low [Ca2+]e. Microtubules are not involved in the recycling of HS proteoglycans or of Tf-R since nocodazole did not affect these processes. Inhibiting the increase of intracellular Ca2+ by an intracellular Ca2+ chelator sustained recycling of HS proteoglycans even in the presence of high [Ca2+]e. These observations show that the exocytosis pathway of HS proteoglycans in the recycling compartment is specifically regulated by [Ca2+]e, whereas that for constitutive secretion is not. Therefore, the recycling of HS proteoglycans may be directly related to some functions of parathyroid cells regulated by [Ca2+]e. Although the mechanism by which [Ca2+]e regulates the exocytosis and recycling of HS proteoglycans is uncertain, it is suggested that an increase of intracellular Ca2+ is necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, for inhibiting their exocytosis."

However, the novel gene product elicited in its recipients an intense antibody response that would have curtailed the effectiveness of such therapy. The possibility of inducing tolerance to foreign gene product was explored by implanting allogeneic fibroblasts transfected with the human growth hormone gene into rat thymus, a site recently shown to be immunologically privileged and able to induce donor-specific tolerance to transplanted tissues. In the circulation of the implanted rats, human growth hormone was detected at 4-15 ng/ml serum within the first day and subsided to 0.6-9 ng/ml within the first wk in all animals implanted either thymically or intraperitoneally. Within 2-3 wk, high titers of anti-human growth hormone were detected in all animals regardless of the site of implantation. The failure of the thymus to offer immune protection for the foreign antigen was further confirmed when the animals were subsequently challenged with purified human growth hormone. An immediate twofold increase in titer within the first week of challenge was detected in animals previously implanted thymically. In contrast, animals implanted intraperitoneally but treated with short-term daily injection of cyclosporine A (28-41 days) did not mount any significant antibody response to human growth hormone throughout the experiment or even when challenged subsequently at weeks 8-10 with purified growth hormone. In conclusion, implantation of genetically modified fibroblasts in the thymus does not lead to tolerization toward soluble novel gene product secreted by these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1862220864,"To further pinpoint the location of the genes for ataxia-telangiectasia on the long arm of chromosome 11, we performed linkage analysis and analysis of recombinants of genetic haplotypes on 14 Turkish families with ataxia-telangiectasia, 12 of which were consanguineous. These studies used more than 25 polymorphic genetic markers spanning a region of the long arm of chromosome 11 that is larger than 50 cM. Seven markers gave significant LOD scores to AT: CJ5, DRD2, CJ208, S144, CD3E, PBGD, and S147, as did haplotypes created with pairs of markers DRD2/CJ5 and S144/CJ208, giving recombination fractions (theta) of 0.00, 0.00, 0.05, 0.08, 0.03, 0.09, 0.07, 0.00, and 0.06, respectively. Monte Carlo analysis of these 14 Turkish families indicated the best location for a single AT gene to be within a 6 cM sex-averaged (3 cM male-specific) interval defined by STMY and CJ77; this was three times more likely than the next most likely location (peak III) at the DRD2 locus. The analysis also revealed a peak (peak II) between S147 and S133, which may represent the complementation group D gene. Recombinant analysis of haplotypes also localized an AT locus to the STMY-CJ77 interval. Taken together, these results suggest that at least two distinct AT loci exist (ATA and ATD) at 11q22-23, with perhaps a third locus, ATC, located very near to the ATA gene. This genetic heterogeneity further complicates plans to isolate the major ATA and ATC genes and to begin identifying AT carriers in the general population."
