We found that the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 binds the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and the related liver endothelial cell lectin L-SIGN through high-mannose N-glycans. Competing ligands such as mannan and an antibody directed against the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) abrogated binding. While no E2 interaction with distant monomeric CRDs on biosensor chips could be detected, binding is observed if CRDs are closely seeded (Kd = 48 nm) and if the CRD is part of the oligomeric-soluble extracellular domain of DC-SIGN (Kd = 30 nm). The highest affinity is seen for plasma membrane-expressed DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (Kd = 3 and 6 nm, respectively). These results indicate that several high-mannose N-glycans in a structurally defined cluster on E2 bind to several subunits of the oligomeric lectin CRD. High affinity interaction of viral glycoproteins with oligomeric lectins might represent a strategy by which HCV targets to and concentrates in the liver and infects dendritic cells.

Rehermann B. Feinstone S.M. Knipe D.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1127-1162Google Scholar). Contamination with infected blood by injecting drug users is the primary risk factor for acquiring HCV infection. The majority of infected patients are unable to clear the virus, and many develop chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Alter H.J. Seeff L.B. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 17-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replication of the HCV genome could be demonstrated in vivo and in vitro in liver hepatocytes (3Agnello V. Abel G. Knight G.B. Muchmore E.

HCV is a small, enveloped, plus-strand RNA virus belonging to the family flaviviridae and genus hepacivirus. The HCV RNA genome is 9600 nucleotides in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved into up to 10 polypeptides including three structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), located at the N terminus, and five nonstructural proteins (1Major M.E.

Shortly after translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), oligosaccharide transferase catalyzes addition of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 complexes at up to 6 (E1) and 11 (E2) N-glycosylation sites (for review see Ref. 9Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose residues are removed by glucosidases I and II, and correctly folded proteins are released from ER chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (10Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 11Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Merola M. Brazzoli M. Cocchiarella F.

Virol. 1998; 72: 3851-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane domains of E1 and E2 are responsible for both heterodimerization (14Op De Beeck A. Montserret R. Duvet S. Cocquerel L.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to other flaviviruses it is assumed that HCV capsids bud from the cytoplasm into the ER and that enveloped particles follow the secretion pathway through the Golgi. However, attempts to produce secreted HCV particles in vitro have not been successful so far (18Wellnitz S. Klumpp B. Barth H. Ito S. Depla E. Dubuisson J. Blum H.E. Baumert T.F. J.

Trassard S. Goudeau A. Roingeard P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4073-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and it is not known if E1 and E2 on mature infectious virions possess a high-mannose, complex, or mixed glycosylation. Several receptors have been proposed that could play a role in HCV entry into hepatocytes. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor has been shown to mediate HCV internalization via binding to virus-associated LDL particles (21Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M. Knight G.B. Zhang Q.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12766-12771Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 22Monazahian M. Bohme I. Bonk S. Koch A. Scholz C. Grethe S. Thomssen R. J. Med. Virol. 1999; 57: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A second putative HCV receptor, the tetraspanin CD81, has been identified as a high affinity binding receptor (1.8 nm) for soluble recombinant E2 from HCV genotype 1a (23Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar, 24Petracca R. Falugi F. Galli G. Norais N. Rosa D. Campagnoli S. Burgio V. Di Stasio E. Giardina B. Houghton M. Abrignani S. Grandi G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4824-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CD81 and LDL receptor are expressed in most cell types and thus likely do not account for the hepatic tropism of the virus. Furthermore E2 binds to the hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2, which does not express CD81 (25Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). More recently two novel E2 binding receptors have been identified on HepG2 cells, the scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) (25Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) and the galactose binding C-type lectin asialoglycoprotein receptor (26Saunier B. Triyatni M. Ulianich L. Maruvada P. Yen P. Kohn L.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The lack of an efficient cell culture model has precluded functional confirmation of these receptor candidates at the level of virus entry. It has recently been shown that C-type mannose binding lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (DC-SIGNR) can be used by viral and bacterial pathogens including HIV (27Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S.

Both lectins can act either in cis, by concentrating virus on target cells, or in trans, by transmission of bound virus to a target cell expressing appropriate entry receptors. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are homotetrameric type II membrane proteins, which can bind mannose residues of viral glycoproteins through a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (33Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 34Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN is an adhesion receptor for ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 on T cells (35Geijtenbeek T.B.

Coleman N. J. Pathol. 2001; 195: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The physiological role of L-SIGN is not known yet. High-mannose N-glycans have been shown to be important for attachment of HIV to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (34Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 39Lin G. Simmons G. Pohlmann S. Baribaud F. Ni H. Leslie G.J. Haggarty B.S. Bates P. Weissman D. Hoxie J.A. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and oligomerization of the extracellular domain was shown to be implicated in high affinity binding of glycopeptides (33Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In this report we show that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are two novel HCV envelope binding receptors. High affinity interaction of E2 with both lectins depends on the presence of high-mannose N-glycans on the viral glycoprotein and oligomerization of the C-type lectin CRD. HCV interaction with L-SIGN might represent a strategy by which the virus targets to and concentrates in the liver. Indeed its localization on the endothelium lining hepatic sinusoids (40Pohlmann S.

Reagents and Antibodies—Human antibodies were produced as previously described (42Hadlock K.G. Lanford R.E. Perkins S. Rowe J. Yang Q. Levy S. Pileri P. Abrignani S. Foung S.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10407-10416Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and mouse antibodies were a gift from J. Dubuisson. Human antibodies CBH2, CBH4B, CBH4G, CBH5, and CBH7 and mouse antibody H33 are directed against conformation-dependent epitopes, and H52 and CBH17 against linear epitopes. As control, human and mouse isotype control antibodies R04 and IgG2a were used. Phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-DCSIGN FAB161B and mouse anti-LSIGN FAB162P were purchased from R&D Systems. 1B10 is a DC-SIGN mouse conformation antibody directed against the DC-SIGN CRD and was described previously (29Halary F. Amara A. Lortat-Jacob H. Messerle M. Delaunay T. Houles C. Fieschi F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Moreau J.F. Dechanet-Merville J.

HIV gp140 was produced in Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) vector-infected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells as described previously (43Staropoli I. Chanel C. Girard M. Altmeyer R. J. Biol.

Doms, (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). HCV envelope-encoding plasmid pCAV711V was a gift of T. Miyamura, (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) (44Takikawa S. Ishii K. Aizaki H. Suzuki T. Asakura H. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and C-type Lectin Expression—HelaP4DC were generated by transduction with a DC-SIGN expressing lentiviral vector as previously described (45Sol-Foulon N. Moris A. Nobile C. Boccaccio C. Engering A. Abastado J.P. Heard J.M. van Kooyk Y. Schwartz O. Immunity. 2002; 16: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Hek293T (2 × 107 cells) cells were transfected with 40 μg of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN expression plasmids using standard phosphate calcium transfection method as described previously (46Percherancier Y. Planchenault T. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). HeLaP4DC and Hek293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. BHK cells were cultured in BHK-21 Glasgow's modified Eagle's medium with 5% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mm Hepes, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. All products used for cell cultures were from Invitrogen. Construction of Soluble E2 (sE2) Expression Plasmid—Plasmid pCAV711V was used as template to generate recombinant SFV coding for the soluble transmembrane (TM)-deleted form of E2. The sequence encoding for the ectodomain of HCV envelope protein (E2, amino acids (aa) 384–710) was amplified by PCR (Pwo DNA Polymerase, Roche Applied Science) using the sense primer 5′-ATATTGCGCGCATGTTCATGCCTTCTTCTTTT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTTATATTATGCATTCACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCGCCGACGACCGCCGACCCTATACC-3′. The antisense primer used for E2 codes for the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) peptide sequence. The amplified sequence was digested by BssHII and NsiI and introduced into respective sites of the pSFV2 vector (47Berglund P. Sjoberg M. Garoff H. Atkins G.J. Sheahan B.J. Liljeström P.

The recombinant plasmid pSFVsE2 was sequenced through the E2 coding region. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant SFVsE2 was produced by electroporation of in vitro synthesized vector RNA into BHK cells. Soluble proteins were produced by infection of BHK cells by SFVsE2 (multiplicity of infection 50) as previously described (43Staropoli I. Chanel C. Girard M. Altmeyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35137-35145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At 6 h postinfection, medium was replaced by 0% FCS Glasgow's modified Eagle's medium for standard protein purification or for the production of radiolabeled sE2 by 0% FCS methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (ICN Biomedicals) prior to addition of 200 μCi·ml-1 [35S]cysteine and methionine (Pro-Mix 35S, Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of sE2 was continued up to 24 h postinfection in the presence (sE2man) or absence (sE2cpx) of α-manosidase I and II inhibitors 1-deoxymannojirimycin hydrochloride (DMJ, 1 mm, Calbiochem) and swainsonine (5 mm, Sigma). Supernatants were clarified and concentrated in a 10-kDa concentration column (Biomax, Millipore) prior to purification on anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 beads and elution by soluble FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK, 150 ng·μl-1) according to instructions of the supplier (Sigma). For surface plasmon resonance experimentations, a supplementary dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (Biomérieux) was realized overnight at 4 °C using a Slide-A-Lyzer Cassette (Pierce) to eliminate free peptides and purification buffer. The cDNA coding for the CRD (corresponding to amino acids 254–404) and for the extracellular domain (ECD) of DC-SIGN (corresponding to amino acids 66–404) of DC-SIGN were obtained by PCR, cloned into pET15b (Novagen) and verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were subsequently used to transform Escherichia coli C41(DE3), and proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies preparation and refolding of the proteins have been done by dilution and dialysis as already described (33Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Purification of refolded DC-SIGN CRD and DC-SIGN ECD were achieved by affinity chromatography in two steps (Ni2+ column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm CaCl2 and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole followed by a mannose-agarose column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and eluted with the same buffer lacking CaCl2 but supplemented in 10 mm EDTA as described (29Halary F. Amara A. Lortat-Jacob H. Messerle M. Delaunay T. Houles C. Fieschi F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Moreau J.F. Dechanet-Merville J. Immunity. 2002; 17: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)). Pooled fractions were then concentrated and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm CaCl2. Deglycosylation and Protein Analysis—Crude protein extracts were denatured in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min, and followed by incubation overnight at 37 °C in G7 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, Biolabs), Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, Biolabs) containing endoglycosidase H (2 milliunits, Roche Applied Science), or peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (1000 units, Biolabs). To obtain native deglycosylated sE2, the denaturing step was omitted from this procedure. Mock-treated sE2 was prepared without PNGase F as control in binding experiments. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Nupage Novex Bis-Tris Gels, Invitrogen). Gels were either fixed, dried and exposed to Biomax MR1 film (Kodak), or stained with Novex Colloidal Blue Staining Kit (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. Immunodetection of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and sE2 Proteins—DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were detected by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) using, respectively, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-DC-SIGN (FAB161B) and anti-L-SIGN (FAB162P) antibodies. Cells were washed in FCS-free DMEM medium and resuspended in FACS analysis buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% γglobulin, 0.1% sodium azide (all from Sigma)) followed by incubation with primary antibodies at a 1/50-dilution for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.2%) prior to FACS analysis (BD Biosciences and data processing with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For Western blotting, proteins were harvested (48-h cells post-transfection for Hek293T-L-SIGN) in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates or sE2 solution was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). Incubation with primary antibodies 1B10 (anti-DC-SIGN; 2 μg·ml-1), FAB162P (anti-L-SIGN; 1 μg·ml-1), MAbM2 (anti-FLAG; 4 μg·ml-1) was followed by incubation with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody NA931V (Amersham Biosciences) (1/1000). Bound antibody was detected by exposure to enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Supersignal, Pierce) and analyzed by a video acquisition system (Intelligent Dark Box II; Fuji) and Image Gauge software (Fuji). For immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled sE2, crude protein extract was incubated with 60 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% suspension in A buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (Fluka)) and mouse or human monoclonal isotopic antibodies (15 μg·ml-1) for 30 min at 4 °C. Different primary antibodies (15 μg·ml-1) were added to supernatant and placed overnight under agitation at 4 °C. After a 5-s spin at 13,000 rpm, the pellets were washed three times with A buffer and then B buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and C buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Beads were then resuspended in Laemmli buffer and heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Biomax MR1 film (Kodak). Surface Plasmon Resonance-based DC-SIGN CRD and ECD Binding Assay—Flow cells of a Biacore B1 sensor chip were activated with a mixture of 0.2 mN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as described (29Halary F. Amara A. Lortat-Jacob H. Messerle M. Delaunay T. Houles C. Fieschi F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Moreau J.F. Dechanet-Merville J. Immunity. 2002; 17: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Flow cell one was then blocked with 50 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, and served as a control surface. The other ones were treated with the CRD (5–50 μg·ml-1) or the ECD (2.5 μg·ml-1) of DC-SIGN, both in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4. Different amounts of immobilized protein were obtained by varying the injected volume (see “Results”). Remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. For binding assays, either sE2man or sE2cpx were diluted in running buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) and injected (at 15 μl·min-1) over the DC-SIGN-activated sensorchip for 15 min, after which the formed complexes were washed with running buffer. Surfaces were regenerated by a 5-min pulse of 100 mm EDTA. In some cases, surface was made with sE2man. For that purpose, sE2man, 5 μg·ml-1 in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4, was injected over an EDC/NHS-activated B1 sensorchip. Binding assay was performed with the conditions described above, DC-SIGN being injected over the sE2man surface. sE2 Binding on Plasma Membrane-expressed DC-SIGN and L-SIGN—Assays were performed on 3 × 105 DC-SIGN or L-SIGN expressing cells in 200 μl of FACS buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2 and 35S-labeled sE2 protein at various concentrations. sE2 was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and unbound radioactivity was removed by three washes with FACS buffer. Cell pellets were resuspended in FACS buffer prior to addition of optiphase supermix solution (Wallac), and bound activity was counted in a 1450 Microbeta Trilux γ counter (Wallac). For inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with inhibitors in FACS buffer for 15 min at 4 °C before addition of labeled envelope protein preparations containing inhibitor. Inhibitors were used at 20 μg·ml-1 final concentration (mannan (Sigma), EGTA (Sigma), 1B10, isotype control IgG, HIV gp140). The native deglycosylated sE2 protein was compared with a mock-treated sE2 protein (incubated in buffer without PNGase F). Saturation binding was assayed by the addition of increasing amounts of labeled sE2 protein. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad), and the specific binding curves were fit by nonlinear regression after subtracting nonspecific binding, i.e. sE2man binding to HeLa cells. Expression and Purification of High-mannose and Complex E2 Glycoforms—The HCV envelope glycoproteins are retained in the ER in a high-mannose glycoform by the action of their TM domain. When produced as soluble proteins, deleted of the TM domain, the proteins acquire complex glycosylation in the Golgi. Whether E2 on HCV virions acquires complex glycosylation is not known at present. To study interaction of HCV E2 with cell surface receptors, we expressed the extracellular domain of E2 (sE2), corresponding to aa 384–710 of isolate NIHJ1 fused to a 9-aa FLAG peptide at the C terminus (Fig. 1). We used the defective SFV vector as it allows high level expression of functional virus glycoproteins (43Staropoli I. Chanel C. Girard M. Altmeyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35137-35145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 50Chanel C. Staropoli I. Baleux F. Amara A. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Altmeyer R. AIDS. 2002; 16: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To mimic the glycosylation pattern observed on ER-retained wild-type E2, we treated SFV-infected BHK cells with α-mannosidase inhibitors DMJ and Swainsonine. The resulting protein, sE2man (58 kDa) acquires only high-mannose N-glycans as evidenced by sensitivity to endoglycosidase H (EndoH) digestion, resulting in a 39-kDa protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, sE2cpx synthesized in untreated cells acquired complex glycosylation (65 kDa) and was mainly EndoH-resistant (Fig. 2A). A small shift in molecular weight was observed for EndoH-treated sE2cpx suggesting that a small fraction of glycosylation sites remained in their high-mannose EndoH-sensitive form. However both sE2man and sE2cpx were sensitive to PNGase F digestion, which cleaves both complex and high-mannose N-glycans at the AsnGlcNac bond, resulting in a deglycosylated 37-kDa protein. To evaluate the role of high-mannose N-glycans in attachment to cell surface molecules, we deglycosylated sE2man by PNGase F treatment under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2A, PNGase F native). sE2 synthesized in hepatocytic cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 had a complex EndoH-resistant glycosylation phenotype similar to sE2 produced in BHK cells (data not shown).Fig. 2s"

Because of the similarity in their cytoplasmic domains, IL-1/Toll receptors share signaling components that associate with the IL-1 receptor, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), MyD88, and TRAF6. However, we find that, in response to dsRNA, TLR3 can mediate the activation of both NFκB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in IL-1-unresponsive mutant cell lines, including IRAK-deficient I1A and I3A cells, which are defective in a component that is downstream of IL-1R but upstream of IRAK. These results clearly indicate that TLR3 does not simply share the signaling components employed by the IL-1 receptor. Through biochemical analyses we have identified an IRAK-independent TLR3-mediated pathway. Upon binding of dsRNA to TLR3, TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 are recruited to the receptor to form a complex, which then translocates to the cytosol where TAK1 is phosphorylated and activated. The dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is also detected in this signal-induced TAK1 complex. Kinase inactive mutants of TAK1 (TAK1DN) and PKR (PKRDN) inhibit poly(dI·dC)-induced TLR3-mediated NFκB activation, suggesting that both of these kinases play important roles in this pathway.

The defining feature of members of the superfamily is a TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domain on the cytoplasmic side of the receptors (1Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J.

Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), IRAK4 is probably the kinase that functions upstream of and phosphorylates IRAK (22Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G.

IRAK-TRAF6 then leaves the receptor complex to interact with TAK1, a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase family, and the two proteins that bind to it, TAB1 and TAB2, on the membrane (25Jiang Z.

TAK1 and TAB2 are phosphorylated on the membrane followed by the formation and translocation of TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol (25Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), where TAK1 is activated (25Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although genetic studies show that IRAK is required for the IL-1-induced activation of TAK1 (28Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), in vitro biochemical analyses reveal that TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination may also play an important role in TAK1 activation (29Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The activation of TAK1 eventually leads to the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) by an unknown mechanism. Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB proteins, which are degraded, releasing NFκB to activate transcription in the nucleus (30Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B.

Activated TAK1 has also been implicated in the IL-1-induced activation of MKK6 and JNK (26Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), leading to the phosphorylation and activation of activating transcription factor (ATF) and activating protein 1 (AP1), which thereby also activates gene transcription. Because the receptors in the IL-1/Toll receptor superfamily are similar in their cytoplasmic domains, they share some signaling components that function with the IL-1 receptor, including MyD88, IRAK4, IRAK, and TRAF6, leading to the activation of NFκB (22Suzuki N.

Although studies with MyD88-null mice have demonstrated that MyD88 functions as a general adaptor for the IL-1/Toll receptor superfamily (13Takeuchi O. Kaufmann A. Grote K. Kawai T. Hoshino K.

MyD88 adaptor-like protein (Mal/TIRAP), which was implicated in the activation of the MyD88-independent signaling pathway (38Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A.

PKR-deficient mice exhibit reduced responses to different TLR ligands and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS, suggesting that PKR is an intermediary in TLR signaling (42Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the IL-1/Toll receptors probably mediate much more complex signaling pathways than simply sharing the same signaling components of the IL-1 pathway. TLR3-deficient mice show reduced responses to poly(dI·dC) and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, indicating that TLR3 mediates the induction of immune response by dsRNA. Although TLR3 induces cytokine production through a signaling pathway dependent on MyD88, poly(dI·dC) can still induce the activation of NFκB and MAP kinases in MyD88-deficient macrophages, suggesting that both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways may be involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which TLR3 transduces the signal is unclear. In this study, we took both biochemical and genetic approaches to the study of TLR3-mediated signaling. We report here that TLR3-mediated activation of NFκB and MAP kinases is through an IRAK-independent pathway employing the signaling components TLR3-TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2-PKR.

For stable transfections, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm plate and cotransfected the following day by the calcium phosphate method with 10 ॖg of each expression vector and 1 ॖg of pBabePuro. After 48 h, the cells were selected with 1 ॖg/ml puromycin until clones appeared. Cells, untreated or treated with 100 units/ml IL-1, were lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (0.57 Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm औ-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 ॖm aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 ॖg of antibody or preimmune serum (negative control) for 2 h followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 ॖl of protein A-Sepharose beads (pre-washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1:1 ratio). After incubation the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and analyzed by immunoblotting. TAK1 and TAB2 immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 ॖg of bacterially expressed MKK6 in 20 ॖl of kinase buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 ॖCi of γ32P-labeled ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) at 25 °C for 2 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The membranes were also analyzed by immunoblotting. The method as described previously (46Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol.

Cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer. Unlysed cells, cell debris, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min. Soluble (supernatant, S-100) and particulate (pellet, P-100) fractions were generated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Particulate fractions were solubilized in the Triton-containing lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For stable transfections, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm plate and cotransfected the following day by the calcium phosphate method with 10 ॖg of each expression vector and 1 ॖg of pBabePuro vector. After 48 h, the cells were selected with 1 ॖg/ml puromycin until clones appeared. For reporter assays, 2 × 105 cells were transfected by the same procedure with 1 ॖg of pE-selectin-luc, 1 ॖg of pSV2-औ-gal, and 100 ng of each expression construct. After 48 h, the cells were split onto two 35-mm plates and the next day were stimulated with poly(dI·dC) for 4 h before harvest. Luciferase and औ-galactosidase activities were determined by using the luciferase assay system and chemiluminescent reagents fromPromega (Madison, WI). An NFκB binding site (5′-GAGCAGAGGGAAATTCCGTAACTT-3′) from the IP-10 gene was used as a probe (47Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides, end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and γ32P-labeled ATP, were annealed by slow cooling. Approximately 20,000 cpm of probe were used per assay (48Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Fu X.Y. Levy D.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were used for the assay. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 20 min in a total volume of 20 ॖl containing 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 107 glycerol. We have previously taken a genetic approach to the study of IL-1-dependent signaling pathways, through random mutagenesis, generating IL-1-unresponsive cell lines lacking specific components of the pathways. Mutant cell line I1A lacks both IRAK protein and mRNA (43Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Neither NFκB nor JNK is activated in IL-1-treated I1A cells, but these responses are restored in I1A-IRAK cells, indicating that IRAK is required for both (49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Mutant I3A, also deficient in both IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK activation, is defective in a component upstream of IRAK but downstream of the IL-1 receptor (43Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). I1A and I3A mutant cells were used to examine whether these upstream signaling components of the IL-1 pathway are also required for TLR3-mediated signaling. Transfection of TLR3 into the parental 293-TK/Zeo (293-TLR3) cells rendered them sensitive to poly(dI·dC)-induced NFκB activation (49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, poly(dI·dC) also induced NFκB activation in I1A and I3A mutant cells transfected with TLR3 (I1A-TLR3 and I3A-TLR3), indicating that IRAK and the component deficient in I3A cells are not required for TLR3-mediated NFκB activation (Fig.1A). Although IRAK is necessary for IL-1-induced JNK, MAP kinases p42/44, and p38 activation (49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), poly(dI·dC) can efficiently induce the activation of these kinases in I1A-TLR3 (Fig. 1, B and C), showing that IRAK is not required for TLR3-mediated JNK, MAP kinases, p42/44, and p38 activation. Moreover, poly(dI·dC) induced IL-8 gene expression in both 293-TLR3 and I1A-TLR3 cells, indicating that TLR3-mediated gene expression is also IRAK-independent (Fig.1D). Although the above described results clearly show that IRAK is not necessary for TLR3-mediated signaling, it is important to examine whether IRAK is at all involved in the pathway. Whereas IRAK is hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated upon IL-1 stimulation (49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), IRAK is not modified upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation, indicating that IRAK does not participate in the TLR3-mediated dsRNA signaling pathway (Fig.1E). To investigate the molecular mechanism by which TLR3 mediates the activation of NFκB and MAP kinases, we first identified the signaling components that are recruited to TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Cell extracts from 293-TLR3 cells, stimulated with poly(dI·dC) or left untreated, were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Flag (M2) antibody to pull down the Flag-tagged TLR3, followed by Western analyses with antibodies against signaling components that are implicated in pathways mediated by IL-1/Toll receptors, including MyD88, Mal/TIRAP, IRAK4, IRAK, TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2. Among these components, TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 form a complex with TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation, indicating that TLR3 recruits these proteins to mediate signaling (Fig.2A and Table I). Although MyD88, IRAK4, and IRAK are recruited to IL-1R (Fig. 2B), these IL-1R-proximal components are not recruited to TLR3, suggesting that they are probably not utilized by TLR3 to mediate signaling. Because Mal/TIRAP has been shown to play a role in the TLR2- and TLR4-mediated pathway, we also examined whether this adapter molecule is recruited to TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. However, we fail to detect any interaction between TLR3 and Mal/TIRAP before or after poly(dI·dC) stimulation (Fig. 2C and Table I). Taken together, the results show that TLR3 recruits TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation but not MyD88, MAL/TIRAP, IRAK4, or IRAK, forming a unique receptor complex that differs from the other members of the IL-1/Toll receptor superfamily. This conclusion is consistent with the above described genetic experiments in IL-1-unresponsive mutants, in which IL-1R-proximal signaling components including IRAK are shown to be dispensable for TLR3-mediated signaling.Table IInteractions between different signal proteins in responding to poly(dI·dC) treatmentTLR3MyD88IRAK4IRAKTRAF6TAK1TAB2PKRTLR3NA−−−+++−TRAF6+−−−NA++NATAK1+−−−+NACon+TAB2+−−−+ConNA+293 cells expressing Flag-tagged TLR3 were treated by poly(dI·dC).

To confirm the interactions between TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 and TLR3, extracts from 293-TLR3 cells untreated or stimulated with poly(dI·dC) were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF6 followed by Western analyses with anti-Flag (M2), anti-TAK1, anti-TAB2, and anti-TRAF6. The results show that TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 indeed form a complex at TLR3 upon stimulation (Fig. 2D and Table I). TAK1, a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase family, and two proteins that bind to it, TAB1 and TAB2 (26Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 27Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), have recently been shown to play a critical role in the IL-1 pathway. TAK1 is activated upon IL-1 stimulation, which in turn leads to the activation of IKK complex and MKK6 by an unknown mechanism, resulting in NFκB and MAP kinase activation (29Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The fact that TAK1 is recruited to TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation suggests that this kinase may play an important role in TLR3-mediated pathway. To investigate the function of TAK1 in poly(dI·dC)-induced TLR3-mediated NFκB activation, we examined TAK1 kinase activity upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Whole cell extracts from 293-TLR3 cells untreated or stimulated with poly(dI·dC) were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody followed by an in vitro kinase assay using bacterially expressed MKK6 as a substrate. TAK1 is highly activated in both wild type (293-TLR3) and IRAK-deficient (I1A-TLR3) cells upon poly(dI·dC) treatment (Fig.3A), indicating that TAK1 is likely to be involved in this IRAK-independent TLR3-mediated signaling. In support of this conclusion, we found that a kinase-inactive TAK1 mutant (DN-TAK1) can effectively inhibit TLR3-mediated NFκB activation, suggesting that TAK1 is probably involved in this pathway (Fig. 3B). As expected, DN-IRAK failed to inhibit poly(dI·dC)-induced NFκB activation, serving as a negative control for DN-TAK1. Previous studies showed that TAB2, associated with TAK1-TAB1, is localized exclusively on the membrane before stimulation and translocates to the cytosol upon IL-1 stimulation (25Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To investigate the fate of TAB2 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation, membrane (P-100) and cytosolic (S-100) fractions from 293-TLR3 cells, untreated or stimulated with poly(dI·dC) for different lengths of time, were examined by the Western procedure with anti-TAB2. The data demonstrate that TAB2 translocates from the membrane to the cytosol upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation (Fig.4A). Actin was used as a cytosolic marker and a loading control. We next examined where TAK1 is activated in response to poly(dI·dC) stimulation. We examined whether TAK1 is activated upon its recruitment to TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Cell extracts from 293-TLR3 cells, stimulated with poly(dI·dC) or left untreated, were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Flag (M2) antibody to pull down the Flag-tagged TLR3 followed by an in vitro kinase assay using MKK6 as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, TAK1 is not activated when it is bound to the receptor complex. We then examined whether TAK1 is activated on the membrane or in the cytosol. Membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from 293-TLR3 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 followed by an in vitrokinase assay using MKK6 as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4B, similar to how TAK1 is activated in IL-1-mediated signaling, the kinase activity of TAK1 is not activated on the membrane but only in the cytosol upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. In contrast, TAK1 and TAB2 are also phosphorylated only in the cytosol upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation, whereas they are phosphorylated on the membrane in response to IL-1 (25Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), suggesting that a different mechanism is likely to be involved in activating TAK1 in response to poly(dI·dC) and to IL-1. To identify the signaling components associated with TAK1, extracts from 293-TLR3 cells treated with poly(dI·dC) were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 followed by Western analyses with antibodies against candidate proteins, including TRAF6, TAB1, TAB2, IRAK4, and PKR. TRAF6 and PKR form a poly(dI·dC)-induced complex with TAK1 and TAB2, suggesting the involvement of these components in TAK1 activation (Fig.4C). We also found that a kinase-inactive PKR mutant (DN-PKR) can efficiently inhibit TLR3-mediated NFκB activation, suggesting that PRK is probably involved in this pathway (Fig.4D). On the basis of the results presented above, we have provided a working model for TLR3-mediated signaling pathway (Fig.5). Upon binding of dsRNA to TLR3, TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 are recruited to the receptor to form a complex. The TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 complex then leaves the receptor and translocates to the cytosol to interact with PKR, where TAK1 is phosphorylated and activated. Activated TAK1 then leads to the phosphorylation and activation of IKK and MKK6, resulting in the activation of NFκB and MAP kinase. Although both IL-1R and TLR3 activate TAK1, the upstream signaling events that lead to their activation are quite different (Fig. 5). In this study, we have clearly shown that IRAK is not required for TLR3-mediated signaling. Instead, TLR3 recruits TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 to form a receptor complex. One important question is how TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 are recruited to TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. TRAF6 is often recruited to receptors through TRAF binding sites that reside on the receptors (50Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, such TRAF binding sites are absent in the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3. Therefore, an adapter molecule(s) is likely to be required to mediate the interaction of TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 with the TIR domain of TLR3. Although MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP are the two logical candidates, several lines of evidence suggest that they are probably not involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. First, poly(dI·dC) can still induce activation of NFκB and MAP kinases in MyD88-deficient macrophages (17Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4796) Google Scholar). Second, we failed to detect any interaction of MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP with TLR3 upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Third, although MyD88 is the adapter that recruits IRAK in the signaling pathways mediated by other IL-1/Toll receptors, both MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP fail to activate NFκB in IRAK-null cells2 (49Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that both MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP mediate downstream signaling through IRAK. Importantly, our results clearly show that IRAK is not involved in TLR3-mediated signaling, implying that MyD88 and Mal/ TIRAP may also not be required for this pathway. Finally, although TLR3 fails to induce the production of some cytokines in MyD88-deficient macrophages (17Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4796) Google Scholar), it could very well be because of the involvement of a poly(dI·dC)-induced secondary pathway. Therefore, novel adapter molecules are probably required for TLR3 to recruit TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2. Recently, Yamamoto et al. (51Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) and Oshiumiet al. (52Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) reported a novel TIR domain-containing molecule, named TRIF (or TIACM-1). The dominant negative mutant TRIF inhibited TLR3-dependent activation gene expression, and TRIF associates with TLR3, suggesting that TRIF is a likely candidate adapter to recruit TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2 to TLR3. As mentioned above, we have proved definitively that IRAK is not at all involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. Now the question is whether any of the other IRAK family members are involved in this pathway. There are three more IRAK-like molecules, including IRAK2, IRAKM, and IRAK4. The expression of IRAK2 and IRAKM is extremely low or non-existent in 293-TLR3 cells where the TLR3-mediated signaling is intact, strongly suggesting that these two IRAKs are not required for the pathway. IRAK4 has been shown to be the kinase that phosphorylates IRAK upon IL-1 treatment, whereas IRAK is not phosphorylated upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Furthermore, IRAK4 fails to activate NFκB in IRAK-null cells, confirming that IRAK4 functions through IRAK2 (23Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The fact that IRAK does not participate in TLR3-mediated signaling suggests that IRAK4 is probably not involved in this pathway either. Moreover, we could not detect any interaction of IRAK4 with TLR3 or with other signaling components upon poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that IRAK4 is probably not involved directly in TLR3-mediated signaling. Although it was shown that poly(dI·dC)-mediated cytokine production is reduced in IRAK4-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (22Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), TLR3-mediated early signaling events have not been reported in IRAK4-deficient macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The observed defect could be because of the effect of a poly(dI·dC)-induced secondary pathway. PKR has been implicated in different stress-induced signaling pathways including dsRNA signaling to NFκB activation (45Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 53Zamanian-Daryoush M. Mogensen T.H. DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), although the precise function of PKR in these signaling pathways remains controversial (53Zamanian-Daryoush M. Mogensen T.H. DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 54Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PKR has also been shown to interact with Mal/TIRAP in TLR4-mediated signaling, although it is not required for LPS-induced interferon-औ production (55Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect any interaction of PKR with TLR3 (Table I). Instead, we detected signal-dependent interaction of PKR with the TAK1 complex (TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2), providing evidence for the involvement of PKR in TLR3-mediated signaling. It is important to note that TAK1 is both phosphorylated and activated in response to poly(dI·dC) stimulation. Therefore, it is possible that PKR may contribute to the activation process of TAK1. Alternatively, PKR might function downstream of TAK1. The precise function of PKR in TLR3-mediated signaling will likely require the identification of all components of this pathway(s).

https://openalex.org/W2036939972,"String theory is the most promising approach to the long-sought unified description of the four forces of nature and the elementary particles, but direct evidence supporting it is lacking. The theory requires six extra spatial dimensions beyond the three that we observe; it is usually supposed that these extra dimensions are curled up into small spaces. This 'compactification' induces 'moduli' fields, which describe the size and shape of the compact dimensions at each point in space-time. These moduli fields generate forces with strengths comparable to gravity, which according to some recent predictions might be detected on length scales of about 100 microm. Here we report a search for gravitational-strength forces using planar oscillators separated by a gap of 108 micro m. No new forces are observed, ruling out a substantial portion of the previously allowed parameter space for the strange and gluon moduli forces, and setting a new upper limit on the range of the string dilaton and radion forces."
https://openalex.org/W2113139099,"Activation of ERK1/2 stimulates macroautophagy in the human colon cancer cell line HT-29 by favoring the phosphorylation of the Gα-interacting protein (GAIP) in an amino acid-dependent manner (Ogier-Denis, E., Pattingre, S., El Benna, J., and Codogno, P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39090–39095). Here we show that ERK1/2 activation by aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) treatment induces the phosphorylation of GAIP in an amino acid-dependent manner. Accordingly, ATA challenge increased the rate of macroautophagy, whereas epidermal growth factor did not significantly affect macroautophagy and GAIP phosphorylation status. In fact, ATA activated the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas epidermal growth factor stimulated both the ERK1/2 pathway and the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, known to decrease the rate of macroautophagy. Amino acids interfered with the ATA-induced macroautophagy by inhibiting the activation of the kinase Raf-1. The role of the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the GAIP- and amino acid-dependent control of macroautophagy was confirmed in HT-29 cells expressing the Ras(G12V,T35S) mutant. Similar to the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid, amino acids sustained the phosphorylation of Ser259, which is involved in the negative regulation of Raf-1. In conclusion, these results add a novel target to the amino acid signaling-dependent control of macroautophagy in intestinal cells. Activation of ERK1/2 stimulates macroautophagy in the human colon cancer cell line HT-29 by favoring the phosphorylation of the Gα-interacting protein (GAIP) in an amino acid-dependent manner (Ogier-Denis, E., Pattingre, S., El Benna, J., and Codogno, P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39090–39095). Here we show that ERK1/2 activation by aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) treatment induces the phosphorylation of GAIP in an amino acid-dependent manner. Accordingly, ATA challenge increased the rate of macroautophagy, whereas epidermal growth factor did not significantly affect macroautophagy and GAIP phosphorylation status. In fact, ATA activated the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas epidermal growth factor stimulated both the ERK1/2 pathway and the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, known to decrease the rate of macroautophagy. Amino acids interfered with the ATA-induced macroautophagy by inhibiting the activation of the kinase Raf-1. The role of the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the GAIP- and amino acid-dependent control of macroautophagy was confirmed in HT-29 cells expressing the Ras(G12V,T35S) mutant. Similar to the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid, amino acids sustained the phosphorylation of Ser259, which is involved in the negative regulation of Raf-1. In conclusion, these results add a novel target to the amino acid signaling-dependent control of macroautophagy in intestinal cells.

There is now mounting evidence for the importance of macroautophagy in physiological processes such as the formation of pulmonary surfactant (5Hariri M. Millane G. Guimond M.P. Guay G. Dennis J.W.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In recent years, our understanding of the molecular controls of macroautophagy has greatly increased because of the identification of a set of genes conserved from yeast to human that are involved in the signaling and formation of autophagic vacuoles (10Klionsky D.T. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 11Thumm M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). However, apg/aut genes are not the only actors playing a role in macroautophagy that demonstrate the complexity of this cell process. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzymes are involved both in the signaling and formation of autophagic vacuoles (13Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 14Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J.

Similar to other cytoplasmic membrane dynamics, macroautophagy is controlled by cytoplasmic GTPases (16Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When the cytoplasmic trimeric Gi3 protein is bound to GDP, the formation of autophagic vacuoles is stimulated in human colon cancer HT-29 cells, whereas the binding of GTP to the Gαi3 protein inhibits the formation of autophagic vacuoles (18Ogier-Denis E.

Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that GAIP,1 a protein belonging to the RGS (regulator of G-proteinsignaling) family (20De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), stimulates the macroautophagic pathway by accelerating the GTPase activity of the Gαi3protein (21Ogier-Denis E. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24599-24603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activity of GAIP for the Gαi3 protein has been shown to be dependent upon its state of phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue (Ser151) in the RGS domain of GAIP (22Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser151 has been shown in cultured HT-29 cells and in vitro to be dependent upon the activity of the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. In addition, the phosphorylation of GAIP is impaired by amino acids that are strong physiological inhibitors of macroautophagy (22Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Several different mechanisms can account for the inhibitory effect of amino acids on macroautophagy in mammalian cells (3Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 65-87Google Scholar, 23van Sluijters D.A. Dubbelhuis P.F. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Their inhibitory effect on the formation of autophagic vacuoles has been suggested to depend on their interference with the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase signaling pathway (24Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P.

In this work, we investigated whether or not amino acids are able to control the ERK1/2 signaling pathway ending with the phosphorylation of GAIP. The results reported here demonstrate that amino acids are able to control the activity of the Raf-1 kinase, which acts upstream of the MEK1/2 kinases in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (25Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 26Avruch J. Khokhlatchev A. Kyriakis J.M. Luo Z. Tzivion G. Vavvas D. Zhang X.-F. Recent Prog. Horm.

Plasmid pCMV6-HA-myrPKB was a generous gift from Thomas F. Franke (Columbia University, New York, NY). Five ॖg of cDNA constructions were transfected into exponentially growing HT-29 cells using the Superfect kit according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells were used 72 h after transfection. The final concentration of amino acids in the mixture was a multiple (4 × AA) of the preprandial rat plasma concentration in the portal vein: 60 ॖmasparagine, 100 ॖm isoleucine, 250 ॖmleucine, 300 ॖm lysine, 40 ॖm methionine, 50 ॖm phenylalanine, 100 ॖm proline, 180 ॖm threonine, 70 ॖm tryptophan, 180 ॖm valine, 400 ॖm alanine, 30 ॖm aspartate, 100 ॖm glutamate, 350 ॖm glutamine, 300 ॖm glycine, 60 ॖm cysteine, 60 ॖm histidine, 200 ॖm serine, 75 ॖm tyrosine, and 100 ॖm ornithine. Metabolic labeling of HT-29 cells with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid was carried out for 3 h in nutrient-free medium (HBSS) in the presence or absence of amino acids. When required, ATA (100 ॖm), EGF (100 ng/ml), or 4 × AA were added at the beginning of the labeling period. Cells were then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into buffer A (20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.57 Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors.32P-Labeled cell extract was lysed overnight. Anti-GAIP polyclonal antibody (1:200) was bound to protein A-Sepharose.32P-Labeled lysates were incubated with the anti-GAIP antibody·protein A-Sepharose complex for 16 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed three times with buffer A. Thereafter, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Eastman Kodak X-Omat film for 16 h at −80 °C. The same blot was used to perform immunoblot experiments with anti-GAIP antibody and developed using the ECL kit. HT-29 cells were scraped in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.57 Triton X-100, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 10 ॖg/ml pepstatin, and 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. One-hundred ॖg of proteins were submitted to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.057 Tween 20) containing 57 nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 27 bovine serum albumin. Antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution, except anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody, which was used at a 1:4000 dilution. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000). Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The assay of Raf-1 activity was done according to the supplier's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). When required, parental or transfected HT-29 cells were incubated for the indicated time (see “Results”) at 37 °C with 4 × AA, 100 ॖm ATA, 100 ng/ml EGF, and 100 nm okadaic acid in different combinations. Lysates were then submitted to immunoprecipitation with 2 ॖg of anti-Raf-1 antibody. Protein G-agarose was pelleted and incubated with 0.4 ॖg of inactivated MEK1 and 1 ॖg of inactivated ERK2. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the supernatant was incubated with myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP (5 ॖCi) for 10 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, aliquots were spotted on P-81 paper and counted. Measurement of the degradation of [14C]valine-labeled long-lived proteins and lactate dehydrogenase sequestration was monitored as reported previously (18Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. De Stefanis D. Bauvy C. Baccino F.M. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 0.2 ॖCi/mll-[14C]valine. Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in nutrient-free medium (without amino acids and in the absence of fetal calf serum) plus 0.17 bovine serum albumin and 10 mm unlabeled valine. When required, 10 mm 3-MA, a potent inhibitor of the formation of autophagic vacuoles (28Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar), or 4 × AA were added throughout the chase period. After the first hour of incubation, at which time short-lived proteins were being degraded, the medium was replaced with the appropriate fresh medium, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4-h period. Cells and radiolabeled proteins from the 4-h chase medium were precipitated in 107 (v/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated from soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and then dissolved in 250 ॖl of Soluene 350. The rate of protein degradation was calculated as acid-soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and the medium. Briefly, cells were gently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then twice with homogenization buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 mm sucrose, 100 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.017 Tween 20 (pH 7.5)). Cells were homogenized in 1 ml of cold homogenization buffer by 13 strokes in a glass/Teflon homogenizer on ice. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear material was layered on 4 ml of buffered metrizamide/sucrose (107 sucrose, 87 metrizamide, 1 mm EDTA, 100 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.017 Tween 20 (pH 7.5)) and centrifuged at 7000 ×g for 60 min. Finally, the pellet was washed once with homogenization buffer and resuspended in buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm mannitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 ॖg/ml pepstatin. The suspension was sonicated (VibraCellTM Model 72434 sonicator, power setting 3, microtip, 20 s at 207 charge) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The lactate dehydrogenase activity was assayed by measuring the oxidation of NADH with pyruvate as substrate at 340 nm. Statistical analysis of differences between groups was performed using Student's t test.p < 0.005 was considered statistically significant. We have previously shown that the phosphorylation of Ser151 in the RGS domain of GAIP is dependent upon the activity of ERK1/2 and is sensitive to amino acids (22Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the phosphorylation of GAIP, cells were treated with either EGF, a peptidic physiological activator (29Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar), or ATA, a non-peptidic activator of the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway (30Okada N. Koizumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16464-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H. Williams J. Dong F. Grimley P.M. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). According to their effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, both EGF and ATA increased the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in HT-29 cells (Fig. 1A). However, ATA and EGF had different effects on the phosphorylation of GAIP (Fig.1B). ATA induced an increase in GAIP phosphorylation that was sensitive to the presence of amino acids. In contrast, EGF did not significantly modify the phosphorylation status of GAIP compared with untreated cells. In agreement with our previous data (22Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of GAIP was greatly reduced in EGF-treated cells (Fig. 1B) and in control cells (data not shown). As we have previously shown that ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of GAIP controls macroautophagy in HT-29 cells (22Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we next investigated the effect of ATA and EGF on macroautophagy (Fig.2). For this purpose, cells were radiolabeled overnight with [14C]valine in complete medium, and protein degradation was analyzed in nutrient-deprived medium (HBSS) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ATA induced a dose-dependent increase in [14C]valine-labeled protein degradation (Fig.2A). 3-MA, a well known inhibitor of the formation of autophagic vacuoles (28Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar), inhibited the increase in proteolysis induced by ATA. The stimulatory effect of ATA on the macroautophagic pathway was confirmed by assay of the sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase into sedimentable material enriched in autophagic vacuoles (Table I). In agreement with our previous results (22Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), amino acids were as efficient as 3-MA in inhibiting autophagy in HT-29 cells. Amino acids also reversed the ATA-dependent stimulation of autophagy (Fig. 2 and TableI). However, amino acids were less potent than 3-MA in competing with ATA, suggesting that ATA can increase autophagy by mechanisms that are sensitive and insensitive to amino acids (see below).Table IEffects of ATA and amino acids on autophagic sequestration in HT-29 cellsCell populationAutophagic sequestration of LDH1-aValues are the means ± SD (n = 3).

Open table in a new tab From the results described above and those previously reported on the role of GAIP and the Gαi3 protein in the control of autophagic vacuole formation in HT-29 cells (18Ogier-Denis E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we conclude that ATA has a stimulatory effect at an early step during autophagy via activation of the Gαi3-dependent control of macroautophagy. In contrast, EGF has no significant effect on the rate of proteolysis along the macroautophagic pathway in the concentration range used (Fig.2B). This result is in agreement with the lack of an EGF-dependent effect on GAIP phosphorylation (see Fig.1B). To understand the difference in macroautophagic response after ATA or EGF challenge, we investigated their interference with signal transduction (Fig. 3). After treatment with EGF, we observed a rapid stimulation of the activation of ERK1/2, followed by an attenuation phase. EGF also elicited a rapid activation of Akt/PKB within 5 min of treatment as determined by its phosphorylation of Thr308, a known regulatory site essential for PKB activation (33Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). As PKB has been proposed to be a kinase involved in the inactivating phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser259 (34Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), we investigated the PKB-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1 in HT-29 cells after EGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, EGF treatment prolonged Raf-1 phosphorylation at Ser259. To verify that the phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser259 was dependent upon the activity of PKB, we repeated these experiments in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) (Fig. 3B). In the presence of wortmannin, we observed an inhibition of PKB phosphorylation and also an inhibition of Raf-1 phosphorylation at Ser259. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active form of PKB (myrPKB) had an inhibitory effect on the activity of Raf-1 (see Fig. 4).Figure 4Effect of amino acids and Ras mutants on the activity of Raf-1. Proliferating HT-29 cells were transfected with 5 ॖg of cDNA encoding myrPKB or different Ras mutants: Ras(S17N), Ras(G12V,E37G), Ras(G12V,T35S), and Ras(G12V,Y40C). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Raf-1 antibody in parental HT-29 cells (control cells) and in the different cell populations 72 h after transfection. Beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 0.4 ॖg of inactivated MEK1 and 1 ॖg of inactivated ERK2. The resulting supernatant was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP and the level of [32P] incorporation in myelin basic protein was determined. The values reported are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATA stimulated the activity of ERK1/2 with kinetics close to those observed after EGF challenge (Fig. 3A). However, in contrast to EGF, (i) the ATA-dependent activation of ERK1/2 lasted for a longer time (4 h versus 1 h), and (ii) ATA did not activate PKB at early time points. Stimulation of PKB was only detectable after 1 h. According to these results, we observed a time-dependent dephosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser259 and a more sustained activation of ERK1/2. The dephosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser259 is in agreement with recent data reporting that Raf-1 activation depends on the release of inhibition through Ser259 dephosphorylation (35Dhillon A.S. Meike S. Yazici Z. Eulitz M. Kolch W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To analyze more precisely the effect of EGF and ATA on the class I PI3K pathway, we investigated the activation of p70 S6 kinase, a downstream target of the class I PI3K signaling pathway. ATA did not induce phosphorylation of Thr389, a phosphorylation site essential for the activation of p70 S6 kinase (36Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, EGF treatment induced phosphorylation of Thr389, suggesting that EGF (but not ATA) is able to activate p70 S6 kinase. From these results, we conclude that ATA stimulates macroautophagy because it activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and only marginally affects the PI3K signaling pathway. In contrast, the limited effect of EGF is probably due to its capacity to stimulate two pathways known to have opposite effects on macroautophagy in intestinal cells: the PI3K pathway, which has an inhibitory effect, and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which has a stimulatory effect. In addition, the PKB-dependent inhibition of Raf-1 together with the activation of p70 S6 kinase could be responsible for the low inhibitory effect of EGF on macroautophagy observed in some experiments. The MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway starts with the membrane recruitment of the Raf-1 kinase by GTP-bound Ras (25Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 26Avruch J.

To investigate whether amino acids are able to interfere with the function of Ras, we analyzed the effect of amino acids on the kinase activity of Raf-1 in cells transfected with mutants of Ras known to stimulate different signaling pathways (Fig. 4). The first mutant we used was Ras(G12V,T35S), which specifically activates the Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway (37Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P.

In cells transfected with the cDNA encoding Ras(G12V,T35S), we observed a stimulation of the Raf-1 activity. In the presence of amino acids, the Raf-1 activity was dramatically reduced in Ras(G12V,T35S)-expressing cells. This inhibition was in the same range as that observed in HT-29 cells (see Fig. 6). In cells expressing either the dominant-negative Ras(S17N) mutant or the PI3K pathway-stimulating Ras(G12V,Y40C) mutant (38Kauffman-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), we observed a reduction in the Raf-1 activity. The inhibitory effect of Ras(G12V,Y40C) is probably due to the activation of PKB, which phosphorylated Raf"
https://openalex.org/W2027895126,"The development of cervical cancer is highly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV integration into the genome of infected cervical cells is temporally associated with the acquisition of the malignant phenotype. A relationship between the sites of HPV integration in cervical cancer and the position of the common fragile sites (CFSs) has been observed at both the cytogenetic and molecular levels. To further explore this relationship at the molecular level, we used RS–PCR to rapidly isolate cellular sequences flanking the sites of HPV16 integration in 26 primary cervical tumors. Human bacterial artificial chromosome clones were isolated based on these flanking sequences and used as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization on aphidicolin-stimulated metaphases. Our data demonstrate that 11/23 HPV16 integrations in cervical tumors occurred within CFSs (P<0.001). In addition, we show that deletions and complex rearrangements frequently occur in the cellular sequences targeted by the integrations and that integrations cluster in FRA13C (13q22), FRA3B (3p14.2), and FRA17B (17q23). Finally, our data suggest that cellular genes, such as Notch 1, are disrupted by the HPV16 integrations, which may contribute to the malignant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2059814399,"In perceiving the sound produced by the movement of a visible object, the brain coordinates the auditory and visual input1,2,3 so that no delay is noticed even though the sound arrives later (for distant source objects, such as aircraft or firework displays, this is less effective). Here we show that coordination occurs because the brain uses information about distance that is supplied by the visual system to calibrate simultaneity. Our findings indicate that auditory and visual inputs are coordinated not because the brain has a wide temporal window for auditory integration, as was previously thought, but because the brain actively changes the temporal location of the window depending on the distance of the visible sound source."
https://openalex.org/W2007655481,"Many models of slow, dense granular flows assume that the internal stresses are independent of the shearing rate. In contrast, logarithmic rate dependence is found in solid-on-solid friction, geological settings and elsewhere. Here we investigate the rate dependence of stress in a slowly sheared two-dimensional system of photoelastic disks, in which we are able to determine forces on the granular scale. We find that the mean (time-averaged) stress displays a logarithmic dependence on the shear rate for plastic (irreversible) deformations. However, there is no perceivable dependence on the driving rate for elastic (reversible) deformations, such as those that occur under moderate repetitive compression. Increasing the shearing rate leads to an increase in the strength of the force network and stress fluctuations. Qualitatively, this behaviour resembles the changes associated with an increase in density. Increases in the shearing rate also lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of stress build-up and relaxation events. If shearing is suddenly stopped, stress relaxations occur with a logarithmic functional form over long timescales. This slow collective relaxation of the stress network provides a mechanism for rate-dependent strengthening."

Therefore, it has been proposed that P-gp binds these substrates through an induced-fit mechanism where the size and shape of the substrate changes packing of the TM segments. In this study we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and oxidative cross-linking to test for rearrangement of the TM segments in the presence of different substrates. A histidine-tagged Cys-less P-gp cDNA was constructed (4Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Loo T.W.

After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh media and the cells grown for 72 h at 27 °C. Membranes were prepared as described previously (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

The histidine-tagged P-gp mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells, purified, and mixed with lipid as described previously (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

An aliquot of the P-gp:lipid mixture was assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP and 10 mm colchicine, 2 mmdemecolcine, 0.4 mm progesterone, 0.2 mmcis-(Z)-flupenthixol, 1 mm verapamil, or 20 μm vinblastine. These concentrations gave maximal stimulation of the mutant P-gp mutant P350C. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (22Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We had proposed that substrate binding occurred through a “substrate-induced fit” mechanism (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The TM segments contributing residues to the drug-binding site are predicted to be quite mobile so that drug binding causes rearrangement of the TM segments. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and oxidative cross-linking studies are ideal techniques for detecting altered packing of the TM segments in the presence of drug substrates. The TM segments in the resting state are arranged in a “funnel shape” in which the cytoplasmic ends are close together (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic side of TM6 and TM12 is relatively close together, because mutant P350C(TM6)/S993C(TM12) could be cross-linked. We showed that cross-linking of this mutant inhibited drug-stimulated ATPase activity, but activity was restored after addition of a thiol reducing agent (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be possible to detect changes in the cross-linking pattern if P350C(TM6) or S993C(TM12) is paired with another cysteine at the cytoplasmic end of other TM segments. Accordingly, 143 double cysteine mutants that were constructed previously were used in this study (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These mutants contained P350C(TM6) and another cysteine on the cytoplasmic half of TMs 7–12 (i.e. P350C + another cysteine at positions: 711–723 (TM7), 770–783 (TM8), 828–840 (TM9), 867–879 (TM10), 935–947 (TM11), and 986–994 (TM12)) or S993C(TM12) with another cysteine in the cytoplasmic half of TMs 1–6 (i.e. S993C + another cysteine at positions: 51–61 (TM1), 130–141 (TM2), 185–196 (TM3), 226–237 (TM4), 293–304 (TM5), and 343–351 (TM6)). We had shown that most of the double cysteine mutants retained at least 70% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of the Cys-less P-gp (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We then tested compounds of different shapes and sizes (colchicine, demecolcine, verapamil, vinblastine, cyclosporin A, progesterone,cis-(Z)-flupenthixol andtrans-(E)-flupenthixol) for their ability to promote cross-linking. Vinblastine and colchicine are classic transport substrates of P-gp (24Horio M. Chin K.V. Currier S.J. Goldenberg S. Williams C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Handler J. J. Biol.

Membranes were prepared and preincubated at 21 °C for 10 min with or without saturating levels of colchicine (5 mm), demecolcine (1 mm), verapamil (1 mm), vinblastine (0.1 mm), cyclosporin A (0.1 mm), cis-(Z)-flupenthixol (2 mm), trans-(E)-flupenthixol (2 mm), or progesterone (2 mm). The membranes were treated with 0.2 mm copper phenanthroline (oxidant) for 10 min at 21 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA and the samples subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Fig.1 shows that in the absence of oxidant, mature P-gp migrates with an apparent mass of 170 kDa. Cross-linked P-gp, however, migrates with a slower mobility in SDS-PAGE (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J.

An example is mutant P350C(TM6)/A869C(TM10) (Fig. 1). Three mutants (P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11), P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11) and P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12)), however, showed drug-induced cross-linking (Fig. 1). Mutant P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11) was cross-linked only in the presence of progesterone. Cross-linking of mutant P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11) was enhanced in the presence of cyclosporin A and progesterone, while mutant P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12) showed enhanced cross-linking with colchicine, demecolcine, and progesterone (Fig. 1). It was important to express the mutant P-gps in the absence of drug substrate or to thoroughly wash the membranes several times with tris-buffered saline if they were prepared from cells that had been exposed to a drug substrate. This is because residual substrate in the membrane could potentially influence the cross-linking pattern. An example was mutant P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11). When this mutant was expressed in the absence of cyclosporin A, it showed no cross-linking at 21 °C (Fig. 1), but some cross-linking was detected when membranes prepared from cyclosporin A-treated cells were treated with oxidant (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, membranes were prepared from transfected cells that were not treated with any substrate. To compare the effectiveness of the drug substrates in promoting cross-linking, time-dependent cross-linking studies were done on P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11), P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11), and P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12). Fig. 2 shows that in the absence of drug substrate, no cross-linked product was detected in any of the mutants. Progesterone, however, promoted cross-linking in all three mutants and was the only drug substrate that promoted cross-linking of mutant P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11). In mutant P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11), progesterone was more efficient in promoting cross-linking than cyclosporin A. In mutant P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12), the drug substrates colchicine, demecolcine, and progesterone were equally effective in promoting cross-linking. Cross-linking promoted by the presence of drug substrates cyclosporin A, colchicine, demecolcine, or progesterone could be explained on the basis that drug binding to the TM domain alters TM segment packing. It has been reported, however, that some drug substrates such as progesterone bind to mouse P-gp in a region of the nucleotide-binding domain that is in close proximity to the ATP site (33Dayan G. Baubichon-Cortay H. Jault J.M. Cortay J.C. Deleage G. Di Pietro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11652-11658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test whether cyclosporin A, colchicine, demecolcine, or progesterone can bind to the TM domains, we used a “drug rescue” assay involving a P-gp mutant that lacked the NBDs (TMD1+2, residues 1–379 + residues 681–1025). The rationale for the drug rescue assay is that the TMD1+2 mutant is misfolded when transiently expressed in the absence of drug substrate and is retained within the cell as a 80-kDa core-glycosylated protein (34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant TMD1+2 in the presence of drug substrate, however, induces the mutant protein to fold properly into a 100-kDa protein endoglycosidase H-resistant form that is transported to the cell surface (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It appears that the drug substrate diffuses into the cell and acts as a specific chemical chaperone to bind and stabilize the newly synthesized misfolded P-gp that is present transiently and thereby induce proper folding and trafficking of the protein (10Loo T.W.

The TMD1+2 deletion mutant was expressed in HEK 293 cells with or without demecolcine, colchicine, or progesterone. The cells were solubilized with SDS buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig.3 shows that mutant TMD1+2 is expressed as an 80-kDa protein in the absence of substrate. In the presence of demecolcine, colchicine, or progesterone, however, the presence of a 100-kDa protein is detected. Cyclosporin A also induced proper folding of mutant TMD1+2 (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, these drug substrates can interact with only the TM domains. We then tested whether the mutants could interact with colchicine, demecolcine, progesterone, cis-(Z)-flupenthixol, verapamil, and vinblastine, because only some of the drugs affected the cross-linking pattern of the mutants. It was important to determine that the drugs that had no effect on cross-linking could still bind to the mutant P-gps. There is good correlation between drug-stimulated ATPase activity and drug transport (36Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (37Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether the drug substrates colchicine, demecolcine, progesterone,cis-(Z)-flupenthixol, verapamil, or vinblastine stimulated the ATPase activities of histidine-tagged mutants P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11), P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11), and P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12). Their activities were compared with that of mutant P350C (parent). We previously showed that mutant P350C exhibited high levels of drug-stimulated ATPase activity (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that the ATPase activities of mutants P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11), P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11), and P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12) were stimulated by colchicine, demecolcine, progesterone, cis-(Z)-flupenthixol, verapamil, or vinblastine. The ATPase activities of the mutants were inhibited by cyclosporin A and trans-(Z)-flupenthixol (data not shown). This is consistent with previous observations that saturating concentrations of cyclosporin A inhibits P-gp ATPase activity, while the cis-(Z)- andtrans-(E)-isomers of flupenthixol stimulate and inhibit, respectively, the ATPase activity of P-gp (26Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Sarkadi B. Muller M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the mutant P-gps can still bind drug substrates. Cross-linking of mutant P350C(TM6)/S993(TM12) is inhibited by drug substrates (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that substrates such as progesterone are effective in promoting new cross-links with P350C (Fig. 2). In the absence of drug substrate, residue P350C in TM6 can be cross-linked to S993C in TM12. The presence of progesterone, however, promoted cross-linking of residue P350C(TM6) with two residues in TM 11 (A935C and G939C) and to residue V991C in TM12. One way to explain these results is through a model (Fig.5). Based on the “funnel-shape” model of the TM segments (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic ends of TMs 6, 11, and 12 are placed closer together than the extracellular ends (Fig.5A). In the absence of substrate, it is possible to cross-link P350C(TM6)/S993(TM12). Therefore, the presence of drug substrate (progesterone) likely causes a slight rotation/rearrangement of TM12 relative to TM6 such that residue V991C comes closer to P350C. Colchicine and demecolcine likely induced similar conformational changes, since both drug substrates also promoted cross-linking of mutant P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12). Since TM12 is directly connected to TM11, any (rotational or lateral) movement in TM12 would likely involve similar movement in TM11. When the residues in TM11 are modeled as an α-helical wheel, residues A935 and G939C are found on the same face of the TM segment (Fig. 5B). In the presence of progesterone both residues must come close to P350C(TM6) to be cross-linked (Fig.1). Cyclosporin A also promoted cross-linking between TM6 and TM11, but only between P350C and G939C. It is possible that cyclosporin A altered the tilt or distance between TM6 and TM11 such that only A939C but not A935C were close enough to P350C to be cross-linked. The ability of a substrate to change the cross-linking pattern suggests that the TM segments can change their shape to accommodate structurally different compounds. Slight rotational and/or lateral movement in any TM segment could result in numerous permutations of residues contributing to the drug-binding site. A substrate with one structure would cause specific shifts in the different TM segments responsible for its binding (induced-fit). Therefore, it follows that common residues could be involved in the binding of different substrates. This would account for the ability of P-gp to bind structurally diverse compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2087423222,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, has been shown to induce profound changes both peripherally and centrally. It has recently been reported that intraperitoneal injection of LPS inhibited long term potentiation (LTP) in perforant path-granule cell synapses and that this effect was coupled with an increase in the concentration of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The LPS-induced effects were abrogated by inhibition of caspase-1, suggesting that IL-1β may mediate the effects of LPS. Here we report that the inhibition of LTP induced by LPS and IL-1β was coupled with stimulation of the stress-activated protein kinase p38 in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and that this effect was abrogated by the p38 inhibitor SB203580, while the effect of LPS was markedly attenuated in C57BL/6 IL-1RI-/- mice. The data also indicate that activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), may play a role, since the inhibitory effect of LPS and IL-1β on LTP was attenuated by the NFκB inhibitor, SN50; consistently, LPS and IL-1β led to activation of NFκB in entorhinal cortex. We suggest that one consequence of these LPS and IL-1β-induced changes is a compromise in glutamate release in dentate gyrus, which was coupled with the inhibition of LTP. The evidence is consistent with the idea that the LPS-induced impairment in LTP is mediated by IL-1β and is a consequence of activation of p38.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); IL-1β concentration in hippocampus was increased in each of these experimental conditions, and a negative correlation between the ability of rats to sustain LTP and IL-1β concentration in hippocampus has been described previously (8Lynch M.A. Prog.

The finding that the effect of LPS on LTP is mimicked by IL-1β, together with the finding that the effect of LPS on LTP was abrogated by inhibiting IL-1β converting enzyme (caspase-1; Ref. 7Vereker E.

Among the downstream effects of IL-1β is activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), or stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38; this effect has been reported in several tissues, for example, IL-1β increases activity of p38 in Chinese hamster CCl39 (10Guay J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) cells, while IL-1β-induced activation of JNK has been reported in human glomerular mesangial (12Uciechowski P.

In the hippocampus, activation of JNK and p38 is coupled with elevated IL-1β concentrations in aged rats (13O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and in rats treated intracerebroventricularly with IL-1β (6Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the LTP-associated increase in KCl-stimulated glutamate release is attenuated in both experimental conditions (6Vereker E. O'Donnell E. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that IL-1β inhibits transmitter release, for example release of acetylcholine (14Rada P. Mark G.P. Vitek M.P. Manago R.M. Blume A.J. Beer B. Hoebel B.G. Brain Res. 1991; 550: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and glutamate (15Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in hippocampal synaptosomes. This inhibitory effect of IL-1β on glutamate release may contribute to its effect on LTP, because, in dentate gyrus at least, maintenance of LTP seems to be partially dependent on an increase in glutamate release (16Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9607) Google Scholar, 17Canevari L. Richter-Levin G. Bliss T.V.P. Brain Res. 1994; 667: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19McGahon B. Clements M.P. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed it might be predicted that glutamate release is modulated by activity of p38, since the IL-1β-induced attenuation of LTP in dentate gyrus in vitro is overcome by the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (20Coogan A.N. O'Neill L.A.J. O'Connor J.J. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), is stimulated by p38 activation (e.g. (21Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar)), while the stimulatory effect of IL-1β on NFκB has been recognized for many years (see Ref. 22Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 649-668Google Scholar). The findings that NFκB is expressed in the brain (23Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Mech. Dev. 1993; 43: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and that its activation is probably related to synaptic function (24Meberg P.J. Kinney W.R. Valcourt E.G. Routtenberg A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggest that this may be part of the cascade of events triggered by IL-1β, and subsequently p38 phosphorylation, in hippocampus. NFκB is a three-subunit complex, consisting of an inhibitory subunit, IκB, a 50-kDa subunit (p50), and a 65-kDa subunit (p65), which exists in the cytoplasm. Upon activation, which involves phosphorylation of IκB, dissociation occurs and the dimer (p50/p65) translocates to the nucleus to stimulate gene transcription (see Ref. 25Mattson M.P. Culmsee C. Yu Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). NFκB activation in brain is triggered by a variety of stimuli, including oxidative stress, increased intracellular calcium concentration, glutamate, growth factors, and cytokines including IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (see Refs. 22Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 649-668Google Scholar, 26O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C.

The evidence that its activation is increased in circumstances in which degenerative changes occur has been interpreted preted by some as evidence of a pro-apoptotic role for NFκB (28Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P. Science. 1996; 274: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 29Clemens J.A. Stephenson D.T. Dixon E.P. Smalstig E.B. Mincy R.E. Rash K.S. Little S.P. Mol.

However powerful evidence from in vitro studies, and in vivo studies using knock-out mice, supports an anti-apoptotic role for NFκB (33Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J.

This study was designed to investigate the consequences of the LPS-induced increase in IL-1β concentration in rat brain, focusing in particular on the possibility that activation of p38 and NFκB may be involved in the inhibition of LTP induced by LPS. We report that p38 activation in hippocampus was indeed one consequence of peripheral administration of LPS, that its activation was accompanied by increased activation of NFκB, and that inhibition of these changes by SB203580 and SN50 at least partially suppressed the inhibitory effects of LPS and IL-1β on LTP. Animals—Groups of male Wistar rats (300–350 g) were housed in groups of 2–4 under a 12-h light schedule. Wild type and IL-1RI knock-out (IL-1R1-/-) mice were housed in groups of 6 under a 12-h light schedule. Breeding pairs of IL-1R1-/- mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, and C57 mice were obtained from Harlan. Ambient temperature was controlled between 22 and 23 °C. Food and water were freely available. Wild type and IL-1R1-/- mice were randomly divided into two subgroups that received an intraperitoneal injection of saline (200 μl; 0.9%) or of Escherichia coli LPS (200 μl; 5 mg/ml). Mice were monitored for 3 h following injection after which they were killed by decapitation. Hippocampus was removed, dissected on ice, and cross-chopped into slices (350 × 350 μm) using a McIlwain tissue chopper. The time taken to prepare slices from the time of death was 2.5–3.5 min. All samples were frozen separately in 1 ml of Krebs solution (composition of Krebs solution in mm: NaCl, 136; KCl, 2.54; KH2PO4, 1.18; MgSO4·7H2O, 1.18; NaHCO3, 16; glucose, 10; CaCl2, 1.13) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide according to the method of Haan and Bowen (39Haan E.A. Bowen D.M. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For analysis, thawed slices of tissue were rinsed three times in fresh ice-cold Krebs solution and homogenized in either ice-cold sucrose (0.32 m) for preparation of P2 (18McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or in Krebs solution. Staining for p-p38 and for p-IκB—Slices, prepared from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, were equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs solution for 30 min at 30 °C and incubated in Krebs solution containing protease X (1 mg/ml), protease XIV (1 mg/ml), and DNase (1600 Kunitz) for 30 min at 30 °C. Washed slices were resuspended in 1 ml of pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing DNase (1600 Kunitz), triturated with a glass Pasteur pipette and passed through a nylon mesh filter to remove tissue clumps. Aliquots (30 μl) were spun onto glass slides (600 rpm for 1 min), dipped in 100% methanol, and stored at room temperature. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, permeabilized with Triton-X100 (0.1% (v/v) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, refixed in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated in H2O2 (0.6% in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidases. Cells were washed in PBS, blocked in normal horse serum (1:20 (v/v) in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated in phosphospecific anti-p38 antibody (1:100 in PBS; Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, incubated in biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature, and reacted with a vectastain avidin biotin system for 15 min at room temperature to amplify the signal. Cells were incubated in diaminobenzidine chromogen solution containing H2O2 (0.1%) for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed in distilled H2O; in some experiments cells were counterstained in methyl green. Cells were dehydrated through alcohol to xylene and mounted in DPX. Cells were counted, and p-p38 +ve and p-IκB +ve cells were expressed as a percentage of the total. Because the physicochemical stresses involved in preparation of cytospun cells might lead to false positive results, we also prepared cryostat sections from saline and LPS-treated rats for assessment of p-p38 and p-IκB. In these experiments, 3 h after LPS injection (100 μg/kg, intraperitoneal) rats were killed, brains were removed whole, coated with OCT compound (Sakura Tissue-Tek), immersed in isopentane at -30 °C, and stored at -80 °C. Twenty-μm cryostat sections were prepared, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried for 30 min, and stored at -20 °C until used for immunohistochemical analysis. For analysis of p-p38 and p-IκB, frozen cryostat sections were thawed at room temperature, washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton in PBS, washed again, and refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before non-reactive sites were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS. Sections were treated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 °C with p-p38 (1:50 in 2.5% NGS) or p-IκB (1:100 in 2.5% NGS) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Sections were washed in PBS, incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature in fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM (1:200 in 2.5% NGS; BioSource), washed, and mounted with an aqueous mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and sealed. Slides were viewed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm, and photomicrographs were taken at ×40 magnification. Induction of LTP in Perforant Path-Granule Cell Synapses in Vivo— LTP was induced as described previously (18McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rats were injected intraperitoneally with urethane (1.5 g/kg), placed in a head holder in a stereotaxic frame, and injected intraperitoneally with saline or LPS (500 μg/kg); subgroups of LPS-treated rats were pretreated intracerebroventricularly, 5–10 min earlier, with saline (5 μl), SB203580 (50 μm; 5 μl), or SN50 (5 μl; 5 mg/ml). In a second series of experiments, rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with either IL-1β (5 μl; 3.5 ng/ml; human recombinant; 5 × 10-7 units/mg; The Biologic Response Modifiers Program, NCI, National Institutes of Health), IL-1β plus SB203580 (50 μm;5 μl), IL-1β plus SN50 (5 μl; 5 mg/ml), or saline (5 μl). In a third series of experiments rats were treated intracerebroventricularly with saline, IL-1β, or IL-1β plus phenylarsine oxide (PAO; 5 μl; 100 μm). Animals were monitored for 3 h following LPS treatment and were then placed in the stereotaxic frame. In the case of IL-1β-treated rats, recording commenced 30 min following injection. In all cases, a window of skull was removed to allow placement of recording and stimulating electrodes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (2.5 mm lateral and 3.9 mm posterior to bregma) and perforant path (angular bundle, 4.4 mm lateral to lambda), respectively. The depth of the electrodes was adjusted to obtain maximal responses in the cell body region. Stable base-line recordings were made for about 15 min, and sampling of the electrophysiological data then commenced. Test shocks at the rate of 1/30 s were delivered for 10 min prior to, and 40 min following, tetanic stimulation (three trains of stimuli; 250 Hz for 200 ms; intertrain interval, 30 s). At the end of the electrophysiological recording period, rats were killed by decapitation, the hippocampus was removed, and the tetanized and untetanized dentate gyri, as well as the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortices, were dissected on ice, cross-chopped into slices, and frozen according to the method of Haan and Bowen (39Haan E.A. Bowen D.M. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of Caspase-1 Activity—Cleavage of the caspase-1 substrate (YVAD peptide, Alexis Corp.) to its fluorescent product was used as a measure of caspase-1 activity (7Vereker E. Campbell V. Roche E. McEntee E. Lynch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26252-26528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Slices of tissue were washed, homogenized in lysis buffer (400 μl; 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4), subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples of supernatant (90 μl) were added to YVAD peptide (500 μm; 10 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Incubation buffer (900 μl; 100 mm HEPES containing 10 mm DTT, pH 7.4) was added, and fluorescence was assessed (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). Analysis of IL-1β Concentration—IL-1β concentration in homogenate prepared from hippocampus was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (13O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (DuoSet; Genzyme Diagnostics). Antibody-coated (2.0 μg/ml final concentration, diluted in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5; monoclonal hamster anti-mouse IL-1β antibody) 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 250 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, pH 7.3, 0.1 m with 4% bovine serum albumin), and incubated with IL-1β standards (100 μl; 0–1000 pg/ml) or samples for1hat 37 °C. Samples were incubated with secondary antibody (100 μl; final concentration 0.8 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin; biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β antibody) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated in detection agent (100 μl; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; 1:1000 dilution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (100 μl; Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature, and absorbance was read at 450 nm within 30 min. Analysis of p38 Phosphorylation—Samples of homogenate prepared from dentate gyrus of rats, hippocampus of mice, or entorhinal cortex of rats and mice were diluted to equalize for protein concentration (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and p38 phosphorylation was assessed as described previously (13O'Donnell E. Vereker E. Lynch M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots (10 μl, 1 mg/ml) were added to 10 μl of sample buffer (0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% w/v bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto 10% SDS gels. Proteins were separated by application of 30 mA constant current for 25–30 min and transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min). In the case of tissue prepared from rats, nitrocellulose strips were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated p38 (Santa Cruz; 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dried milk) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (Sigma) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences), exposed to film overnight, and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. In the case of tissue prepared from mice, nitrocellulose strips were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated p38 (Santa Cruz; 1:200 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% nonfat dried milk) for 3 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce), exposed to film for 1 min, and processed using a Fuji x-ray processor. Quantitation of protein bands was achieved by densitometric analysis using two software packages, Grab It (Grab It Annotating Grabber 2.04.7, Synotics; UVP Ltd.) and Gelworks (Gelworks ID, Version 2.51; UVP Ltd.) for photography and densitometry, respectively. Gelworks provides a single value (in arbitrary units) representing the density of each blot, and the values presented here are means of data generated from six separate experiments. Analysis of Glutamate Release—Glutamate release was assessed in the impure preparation, P2, obtained from dentate gyrus; either freshly prepared tissue was used, or, alternatively, P2 was prepared from frozen slices of dentate gyri that were obtained from rats in which electrophysiological recordings were made (see below). Glutamate release was also assessed in P2 prepared from hippocampus of C57BL/6 IL-1R1-/- and wild type mice. In both cases, P2 preparations were resuspended in oxygenated Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2 (18McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In a separate series of experiments, in an effort to assess the contribution, if any, of the glutamate-Na+ exchanger, P2 preparations were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the non-transportable inhibitor dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid (dl-TBOA; 100 μm). In all cases, glutamate release was assessed as described previously (41McGahon B.M. Murray C.A. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42McGahon B.M. Martin D.S.D. Horrobin D.F. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptosomal tissue was aliquotted onto Millipore filters (0.45 μm), rinsed under vacuum, and the filtrate was discarded. Synaptosomes were then incubated in 250 μl of oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 °C for 3 min, in the presence or absence of 40 mm KCl, and filtrate was collected and stored for analysis as described (43Ordronneau P. Abdullah L. Petruse P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 142: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In some experiments, synaptosomes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in Krebs solution containing IL-1β (1 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (50 μm). Triplicate samples (50 μl) or glutamate standards (50 μl; 25 nm to 1 μm prepared in 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 8.0) were added to glutaraldehyde-coated 96-well plates, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and washed with 100 mm NaH2PO4 buffer. Ethanolamine (250 μl; 0.1 m in 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer) was used to bind unreacted aldehydes, and donkey serum (200 μl; 3% in PBS-T) was added to block nonspecific binding. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of antiglutamate antibody (raised in rabbit; 100 μl; 1:5000 in PBS-T; Sigma), washed, and reacted with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody; 100 μl; 1:10,000 in PBS-T; Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min at room temperature. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate was added as chromogen and incubation continued for exactly 60 min at room temperature, at which time the reaction was stopped by H2SO4 (4 m; 30 μl). Optical densities were determined at 450 nm using a multi-well plate reader, and values were calculated with reference to the standard curve, corrected for protein (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and expressed as μmol of glutamate/mg of protein. Activation of NFκB—Nuclear extracts were prepared from dissociated cells (above). The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (1 ml; composition in mm: HEPES, 10; MgCl2, 1.5; KCl, 10; PMSF, 0.5; DTT, 0.5; pH 7.9) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of hypotonic buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (0.1%), incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. To prepare the nuclear extract, the pellet was resuspended in buffer (15 μl; composition in mm: HEPES, 20; NaCl, 420; MgCl2, 1.5; EDTA, 0.2; PMSF, 0.5; glycerol, 25% (v/v); pH 7.9), placed on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Buffer (40 μl; composition in mm: HEPES, 10; KCl, 50; EDTA, 0.2; PMSF, 0.5; DTT, 0.5; glycerol, 20% (v/v); pH 7.9) was added to the resulting supernatant and equalized for protein concentrations. A 22-base pair oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus sequence (Promega) was labeled with [32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Nuclear extracts were incubated with labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm) in buffer (composition in mm: Tris-HCl, 10; NaCl, 100; EDTA, 1; DTT, 5; glycerol, 4% (v/v); nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml (w/v); pH 7.5) containing poly(dI.dC; 2 μg, Pharmacia Biotech) as a nonspecific competitor for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% native polyacrylamide gels, which were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film for 5–7 days. Statistical Analysis—A one-way analysis of variance was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between conditions. When this analysis indicated significance (at the 0.05 level), post hoc Student's Newmann-Keuls test analysis was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other.

Neurotrophic factors such as the nerve-derived growth factor (NGF) support neuronal survival during development and promote regeneration after neuronal injury through the activation of intracellular signals whose molecular effectors and downstream targets are still largely unknown. Here we present evidence that early oxidative signals initiated by NGF in PC12 cells, an NGF-responsive cell line, play a critical role in preventing apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. This redox-signaling cascade involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the small GTPase Rac-1, and the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), a molecule essential to promote NGF-dependent survival. We found that ROS are necessary for NGF-dependent phosphorylation of CREB, an event directly correlated with CREB activity, whereas hydrogen peroxide induces a robust CREB phosphorylation. Cells exposed to NGF show a late decrease in the intracellular content of ROS when compared with untreated cells and increased expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase, a general inhibitor of cell death. Accordingly, serum deprivation-induced apoptosis was selectively inhibited by low concentrations of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant Mito Q (mitoquinol/mitoquinone). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the oxidant-dependent activation of CREB is a component of NGF survival signaling in PC12 cells and outline an intriguing circuitry by which a cytosolic redox cascade promotes cell survival at least in part by increasing mitochondrial resistance to oxidative stress.

Unstable and highly nucleophilic ROS attack nearly all the cellular molecules, thereby exerting important toxic effects when generated in excess with respect to the cellular antioxidant defenses and repairing systems. Accordingly, oxygen species have been implicated in a large number of pathological mechanisms such as senescence, ischemic cell death, and neoplastic transformation (1Kehrer J Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells are particularly sensitive to oxidative insults, and ROS are involved in many neurodegenerative processes, including those associated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, acute brain ischemia, and excitotoxicity (Ref. 2Jackson G.R. Werrbach-Perez K. Pan Z. Sampath D. Perez-Polo J.R. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and references therein and Refs 3Dugan L.L. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.

Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). In these pathological conditions, cellular stress triggers mitochondrial oxidative damage, which eventually results in apoptosis and/or necrosis (5Merad-Boudia M. Nicole A. Santiard-Baron D. Saille C. Ceballos-Picot I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, the analysis of mice lacking the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) (SOD2) (6Melov S. Schneider J.A. Day B.J. Hinerfeld D. Coskun P. Mirra S.S. Crapo J.D. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) has demonstrated lesions reminiscent of human neurodegenerative diseases. In apparent contradiction with the role of ROS in human and experimental pathology, a large body of evidence indicates that oxygen species, when produced in low amounts and in a controlled fashion, are not toxic and can function as physiological components of the signaling generated by cytokine and growth factors (7Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 8Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.-R. Kwon J. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans2000/53/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar). ROS, and hydrogen peroxide in particular, act as critical signaling molecules in cellular signaling generated by a wide array of stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 (9Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin (Ref. 7Finkel T. Curr. Opin.

Although the molecular mechanisms of oxygen radical-mediated signaling is still largely unclear, much evidence suggests that ROS strongly regulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation by directly inhibiting protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (13Hecht D.

Irani K. Goldsmith-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem.

In neurons oxidant species such as NO (17Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 705-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) and ROS regulate signaling events, including PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway, and activation of the nuclear factor κB (18Maher P.

Med. 2000; 28: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), suggesting a dual role as endogenous toxins and signaling molecules. Target-derived neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor act as major regulators of neuronal cell differentiation and survival in the developing nervous system and exert a protective effect after acute neuronal injury (20Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 21Lindvall O. Kokaia Z. Bengzon J. Elmer E. Kokaia M. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 490-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Neurotrophins exert their effects through a complex network of intracellular signals involving the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the small GTPases of the Rho family (Rho, Rac, and CDC42) (20Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 22Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Many NGF-dependent survival signals converge on the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), a key molecule responsible for the expression of antiapoptotic genes in sympathetic neurons and cerebellar granule cells (23Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 24Finkbeiner S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Only few target genes for neurotrophin signaling have been identified so far; because neurotrophins increase cell resistance to oxidative stress (25Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and application of NGF to sympathetic neurons reduce the generation of oxygen radicals in mitochondria upon serum withdrawal (26Dugan L.L. Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that these trophic factors modulate cellular antioxidant defense. Transcriptional regulation of the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger Mn-SOD represents a general protective event in response to cellular stress and to pro-apoptotic stimuli (27Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V Cell. 1998; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 28Kim H.P. Roe J.H. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1999; 82: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a cAMP-responsive element is present within the Mn-SOD promoter, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-mediated gene expression in lung carcinoma cell line (28Kim H.P. Roe J.H. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37455-37460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) is dependent upon CREB activation. Here we show that induction of Mn-SOD in serum-deprived PC12 cells is NGF- and CREB-dependent and may therefore represent a general modality of neurotrophin signaling. Importantly, the molecular pathway linking NGF to Mn-SOD expression reveals an important role for ROS in triggering CREB activation and gene expression, thereby outlining a redox circuitry in which cytosolic oxidants are used as messenger intermediates to increase mitochondrial protection from oxidative stress.

PC12 cells and E1A/Ras MEFs were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Average transfection efficiency was 15–207, based on cell positivity for GFP. Cells were left to recover for 24–48 h after transfection before functional or biochemical assays. 293T and Phoenix cells were transfected by calcium-DNA co-precipitation according to the standard procedure (507 efficiency). For retroviral infection, PC12 cells were grown for 48 h in the supernatant of Phoenix cells previously transfected with retroviral (pLPC, pLPC-RacN17, pLPC-Mn-SOD/AS) constructs. Transduced cells were enriched by 48-h selection in puromycin (2.5 ॖg/ml). For in vitro transformation, SOD +/+ and SOD2 −/− MEFs were infected with the pLPC-E1A/H-Ras construct, which harbors no selectable marker, and left in culture for 2 weeks. Transformed foci were then isolated and further expended. For detection of reactive oxygen species, cells were maintained for 16 h in low (0.57) serum. After medium replacement with Hanks' balanced salt solution or serum-free RPMI, NGF was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 60 or 120 min. During the last 30 min of incubation, DCF-DA (1 ॖg/ml) or DHE (10 ॖm) was added to cells. After quick detachment from the plate, cells were immediately subjected to flow cytometry (FL-1 for DCF-DA and FL-2 for DHE) using a COULTER-EPICS flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser lamp (emission 488 nm). The mean cell fluorescence values were expressed as raw data or as fluorescence variations (stimulated − unstimulated). In some experiments, cell were plated in serum-free medium with or without NGF, and the fluorescent probes were added directly to the medium 24 h later for 30 min. Cells were then processed as described above. Cells were seeded in serum-free medium with or without NGF and/or antioxidants. In experiments with Mito Q, cell were pretreated with the drug for 8 h in complete medium before serum withdrawal. 48 h later, cell viability was determined by flow cytometry. Live and dead cells were distinguished by flow cytometry according to two criteria, (a) forward/side scatter profile and (b) exclusion of propidium iodide. The majority of cells positive for propidium iodide (dead cells) fell in a distinct region on the forward/side scatter histogram (R2), which could also be easily identified in the forward/side scatter plot in the absence of the fluorescent marker. This latter population was found to be slightly more abundant than the population of propidium iodide-positive cells, likely due to the presence of early apoptotic cells non permeable to propidium iodide. Cell debris was gated out in all the measurements. The percentage of surviving cells was determined according to the forward/scatter profile, with the following formula: [7 cells in the “live” region R1/(7 cells in “dead” region R2 + 7 cells in the “live” region R1)] × 100. In some experiments GFP was expressed in cells together with a gene of interest to allow the identification of transfected cells by flow cytometry. Because GFP can leak out of apoptotic cells, the absolute number of live, GFP-positive cells was then determined using fluorescent microspheres (Flow-Count fluorospheres, Coulter) as an internal standard, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PC12 cells were stimulated in 0 or 0.57 fetal bovine serum with NGF and in 07 FCS with hydrogen peroxide for the indicated times after 16 h of incubation in low (0.57) serum. Antioxidants, when necessary, were added either 16 h (N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) or 5 h (Mito Q) before stimulation. For Western blot analysis cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 17 Triton X-100 and 0.17 SDS; lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein for each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer, immunoblotting, and ECL detection. Band quantitation was performed using the Quantity. One software (Bio-Rad). For total RNA extraction, cells were lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen) and further processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For “in gel” determination of SOD activities, cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and processed as described (46Mills E.M. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V. Katagiri Y. Jiang H. Lavigne M.C. Leto T.L. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22165-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 15–20 ॖg of total RNA were subjected to Northern blot analysis. The rat Mn-SOD cDNA and the rat actin cDNA were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and random-prime-labeled using the Redi-Prime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization for Mn-SOD (65 °C overnight) filters were stripped and reprobed for actin to verify that comparable amounts of RNA had been loaded in all lanes. PC12 cells are dependent on calf serum for survivalin vitro and rapidly undergo apoptosis when placed in serum-free medium (25Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The addition of NGF to the culture medium largely prevents death induced by serum starvation, with 707 of the cells remaining viable after 48 h of fetal bovine serum withdrawal (Fig. 1, Aand B). NGF activates a multiplicity of signaling cascades in PC12 cells, mainly through the interaction with the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA and the low affinity receptor p75 (20Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). As previously shown, NGF addition to serum-deprived PC12 cells dramatically induces the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Fig. 1C), an event mirroring the increase in enzymatic catalytic activity. Although phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases likely reflects the activation of the Ras/Raf pathway by NGF, Akt is a direct target for the lipid products of the PI 3-kinase, a major mediator of survival signaling by NGF (31Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a membrane-targeted, constitutively active mutant of human Akt nearly completely abolishes cell death induced by serum deprivation (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, a negligible or at best marginal effect was upon transfection of an active form of Raf (CAAX-Raf, data not shown), further suggesting that NGF-mediated cell survival in serum-deprived condition is mainly mediated by the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway (24Finkbeiner S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria trigger apoptotic cell death in response to many stimuli (32Jacobson M.D Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Moreover, ROS are involved in regulation of gene expression, proliferation, and cell differentiation induced by cytokine and growth factor receptors (7Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). NGF treatment of PC12 cells maintained in the absence of serum is initially (15 min to 2 h) accompanied by increased intracellular content of ROS (Fig. 2, A andB), as evaluated by the oxidation of two different redox-sensitive fluorescent probes, DCF-DA (Fig. 2, A andB, a) and DHE (Fig. 2B, b). Because DCF-DA is mainly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, whereas DHE detects superoxide (33Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), it is likely that both reactive species are rapidly produced in response to NGF. During the first 2 h of NGF treatment, the increase of intracellular ROS is concentration-dependent, significant at 10 ng/ml and more pronounced at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of PC12 cells with the glutathione precursor and radical scavenger NAC drastically reduced early NGF-dependent oxidative events (Fig. 2A, b), and a similar decrease was also observed in cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of GTPase Rac-1 (N17Rac1) (Fig. 2A, c). Interestingly, the early increase of ROS after NGF treatment is followed by a decrease of intracellular oxidants (both peroxides and superoxide) with respect to untreated cells at 24 h after NGF application (Fig. 2B, a and b). The late antioxidant effect of NGF coincides with the onset of morphological signs of death in untreated serum-starved cells. This observation suggests that elevated levels of oxidants detected 24 h after serum deprivation in PC12 cells are causally linked to cell death and are counteracted by application of NGF. Upon treatment with NGF, PC12 cells respond with a robust activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway, which couples receptor engagement to cell survival through the activation of Akt/protein kinase B (34Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 36Mai L. Jope R.S. Li X. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A critical downstream event in the survival signaling initiated by NGF is represented by the phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor necessary and sufficient for neurotrophin-dependent survival (23Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 35Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Accordingly, CREB may be a direct target of Akt (24Finkbeiner S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 37Pugazhenthi S. Nesterova A. Sable C. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Heasley L.E. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10761-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). To determine whether the early burst of ROS plays a role in NGF-dependent signaling to Akt and CREB, PC12 cells were treated with glutathione precursor and the ROS scavenger NAC to prevent intracellular oxidations, and cell signaling ability was assessed. Removal of ROS resulted in a dramatic decrease of Akt phosphorylation and activity, as evaluated by Ser-256 phosphorylation of the Akt substrate FKHR (38Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Concomitantly, pretreatment of PC12 cells with antioxidant NAC resulted in a decrease of CREB phosphorylation on its critical residue, Ser-133, as revealed by immunoblotting using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). Moreover, inhibition of Rac activity, an event necessary for NGF-dependent redox signaling (Fig.2A, c), resulted in inhibition of CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Because CREB phosphorylation is critical for transcriptional activation (39Du K. Asahara H. Jhala U.S. Wagner B.L. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4320-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), our data suggest that CREB activity in response to NGF could also be impaired. To further test the possibility that redox signals regulates CREB in PC12 cells, we assessed whether exogenous hydrogen peroxide is sufficient to induce CREB activation. Cells exposed to 1 mmH2O2 show increased activation of CREB and Akt, to an extent comparable with NGF (Fig. 3C). Hydrogen peroxide-dependent Akt and CREB phosphorylation is inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3D), suggesting that oxidants activate multiple survival pathways upstream of PI 3-kinase. CREB-dependent transcriptional activation of antiapoptotic genes contributes to the survival effect induced by NGF. Late reduction of intracellular ROS in NGF-treated PC12 cells (Fig.2B, a and b) suggests that neurotrophins might regulate antioxidant enzyme expression. Interestingly, the mitochondrial protein Bcl2, which may have some antioxidant functions, is among the few NGF-dependent antiapoptotic proteins hitherto identified and is modulated in a CREB-dependent fashion. The mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme and putative survival factor Mn-SOD is induced in many cell types by cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1) (27Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) through signaling cascades that often involve ROS and redox-sensitive transcriptional regulators (36Mai L. Jope R.S. Li X. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 52Demple B. Amabile-Cuevas C.F. Cell. 1991; 67: 837-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of the human Mn-SOD gene promoter region has revealed the presence of a perfect CRE, a binding site for CREB, which accounts for gene response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in a human lung carcinoma cell line (28Kim H.P.

Cell-cell adhesion is pivotal for the maintenance of structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues. Within the epithelial sheet, polarized cells are held together by intercellular junctions such as the tight junctions and the adherens junctions (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar, 2Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The adherens type junctions are principally responsible for homotypic cell-cell adhesion and are composed of a transmembrane protein, E-cadherin, that is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via a family of cytoplasmic proteins, the catenins. The disassembly of the adherens junctions has been shown to promote a loss of cell polarity and the acquisition of a more fibroblast-like or mesenchymal phenotype (3Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 511-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt J.W. Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such a transition, referred to as an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, is a hallmark feature of processes such as tumor cell invasion and wound healing (4Schmidt J.W. Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Weidner K.M. Hulsken J. Birchmeier C. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A similar change in morphology also occurs during some normal developmental processes, for example, the formation of the neural crest (7Thiery J.P. Duband J.L. Delouvee A. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 324-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions are characterized by cell scattering, a process involving the dissolution of cell junctions followed by cell-cell dissociation and acquisition of a migratory phenotype. There are several mechanisms for regulation of adherens junction stability. v-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin-catenin complex correlates with decreased cell-cell adhesion, although it has yet to be proven that phosphorylation is directly responsible for these observed effects (4Schmidt J.W. Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition to stabilizing existing adherens junctions, the actin cytoskeleton can drive the formation of new cadherin-based cell-cell contacts by promoting the appositioning of adjacent cell membranes (10Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Thus, actin polymerization represents another means by which adherens junction stability may be regulated. The Rho-family GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 have also been implicated in regulation of cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion (11Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Like all GTPases of the Ras superfamily, these proteins cycle between their active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms. Activated Rac1 promotes actin accumulation and cadherin-based adhesion at cell contact sites (12Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 13Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Rho and Cdc42 have been shown to have similar roles as Rac, although their effects have been less consistent (12Braga V.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 15Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Earlier work from our laboratory has shown that the ARF61 GTPase, via its effect on membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton, promotes the disassembly of adherens junctions and membrane ruffling, respectively, and thereby facilitates the acquisition of a motile phenotype (16Palacios F. Price L. Schweitzer J. Collard J.G. D'Souza-Schorey C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4973-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We have shown that ARF6 is activated in response to treatment of cells with HGF/scatter factor, whereas dominant-negative ARF6 expression abolishes Src-induced cell scattering. These findings implicate an important role for ARF6 during cell scattering. More recently, we have also shown that activation of ARF6 is coupled to the down-regulation of Rac1 activity during adherens junction disassembly (17Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, ARF6-GTP serves to facilitate adherens junction disassembly and epithelial scattering in part by decreasing the cellular pool of Rac1-GTP. On the other hand, the activation of Rac1 has also been linked to promoting cell migration. For example, gain of a motile phenotype in response to treatment of cells with hepatocyte growth factor or by wounding results in the activation of Rac1 (6Fenteany G. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of ARNO, an ARF6-GEF, has been shown to facilitate cell motility in part by activating Rac1 (20Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Taken together, activation of Rac1 in epithelia is associated with opposite outcomes: one, the promotion of cell-cell junctions and enhancement of the epithelial phenotype, and two, the formation of lamellipodia during epithelial cell migration. It is apparent, therefore, that an intricate and spatial coordination of the activity levels of the Rac1 and ARF6 GTPases must occur during epithelial cell scattering. In this study, we have examined the activation profiles of endogenous Rac1 and ARF6 during the sequential stages of HGF- and Src-induced epithelial cell scattering. We have found that during cell scattering, an initial decrease in the levels of active Rac1 is necessary to induce cell-cell dissociation. This transient down-regulation of Rac1 is ARF6-dependent. Subsequently, a steady increase in Rac1 and ARF6 activation and cell migration is observed. We present a model that brings together disparate observations and delineates the progression of ARF6 and Rac1 activities during epithelial cell scattering. The MDCKpp60v-Srccell line was kindly provided by W. Birchmeier. Cells were grown at 41 °C on glass coverslips or tissue culture plastic as described previously (21Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and allowed to form small colonies of ∼40–60 cells/colony. To induce cell scattering, MDCKpp60v-Src cells were incubated at the permissive temperature of 35 °C for time periods as indicated. MDCK type I cells (Clontech, a gift of A. Zahraoui) were grown as described previously (16Palacios F. Price L. Schweitzer J. Collard J.G. D'Souza-Schorey C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4973-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Transfection of cells with cDNA plasmids were carried out using the LipofectAMINE transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. HA (hemagglutinin)-tagged Rac1 and FLAG-tagged nm23-H1(ΔKpn) expression plasmids have been described previously (17Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat.

All phase images were obtained using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert TV-135 microscope equipped with a cool CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Time-lapse imaging was a carried out for a maximum of 4 h in a temperature-controlled environment (∼35 °C) with 57 CO2 maintained in an insulated plexiglass chamber encasing the microscope. Cells were returned to the cell culture incubator, and after an additional 4 and 12 h, cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy. Image acquisition and processing were carried out with MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). For immunofluorescence microscopy, MDCK cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for immunofluorescence as described (16Palacios F. Price L. Schweitzer J. Collard J.G. D'Souza-Schorey C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4973-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibodies were fromCovance, anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal was from Stratagene, and rhodamine phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. Anti-E-cadherin mouse monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from William Gallin. Stained cells were analyzed using a Bio-Rad confocal scanning laser system. Cells were grown in 6-well dishes in islands (∼407 confluency). After inducing cell scattering, cells were quickly rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 25 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.57 Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice with gentle rocking. Cells were then scrapped and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. To determine the levels of Rac1 GTP, 400 ॖl of the cell lysates were incubated with PAK(CRIB)-GST beads as described (23Benard V. Bokoch G.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the levels of active Rac1, Rac1-GTP, were detected by Western blotting using specific Rac1 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). In parallel, the level of ARF6-GTP in 400 ॖl of cell lysates was measured using the ARF6-GTP pull-down assay recently described (24Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27210-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additionally, 20 ॖl of cell lysates were examined for the distribution of total Rac1 and ARF6 by Western blot analysis. v-Src activation is a potent inducer of epithelial cell scattering. Thus, to monitor the different phases of epithelial cell scattering, we made use of an MDCK cell line stably transfected with a temperature-sensitive v-Src mutant (MDCKpp60v-Src) (21Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). At the non-permissive temperature of 41 °C, the cells assemble into compact and polarized colonies, as shown in Fig. 1. When switched to the permissive temperature of 35 °C, the cell colonies undergo scattering within hours. For our investigations, cells were seeded at low confluency and allowed to develop into small colonies (∼40–60 cells/colony) prior to incubation at 35 °C for increasing time periods. Cell scattering was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. After 30 min of Src activation, colony compaction was reduced, and cells within the colony were observed to “loosen” cell-cell contacts. By 1 h, the cells were clearly less adherent, and the colonies exhibited intercellular spaces. Such changes have been reported in past studies and are thought to be caused by an initial collapse in cell-cell adhesion (26Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). After 4 h of Src activation, cells appeared more flat and spread, and a centrifugal detachment of cells was observed. Most of the cells at the edges of the disrupted colony formed extensive lamellipodia. After 8 h of Src activation, cells within a colony were completely dispersed, and finally, at 16 h of Src activation, cells were migratory and showed a more fibroblast-like phenotype. We proceeded to monitor the activation profiles of ARF6 and Rac1 during cell scattering. The levels of active, GTP-bound Rac1 were measured using the PAK-GST pull-down assay. We observed that in polarized cell colonies, the levels of Rac1-GTP were high. These results are in agreement with previous studies showing that confluent monolayers of epithelial cells have high levels of active Rac1 (13Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 14Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Upon initial activation of Src, the levels of active Rac1 decreased as the cells started to scatter. After 1 h of Src activation, the levels of Rac1-GTP were decreased by ∼507. However, during subsequent stages of cell scattering, Rac1-GTP levels steadily increased. The total levels of Rac1 were not significantly altered during cell scattering. From the above observations, we conclude that there is a transient decrease followed by a subsequent rise in Rac1 activation during Src-induced epithelial cell scattering. We next examined the levels of GTP-bound ARF6 during Src-induced cell scattering. To measure the levels of ARF6-GTP, we utilized an ARF6-GTP pull-down assay recently developed in our laboratory (24Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27210-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, in confluent epithelia, ARF6-GTP levels were minimal. However, upon Src activation, there was an exponential increase in ARF6-GTP. In studies describing a role for the ARF6-GEF, ARNO, in MDCK cells, it was shown that overproduction of ARNO did not perturb cell-cell adhesion within the colony but rather promoted lamellipodia extensions in migrating epithelial cells via the activation of Rac1 (19Gimond C. van Der Flier A. van Delft S. Brakebusch C. Kuikman I. Collard J.G. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that ARNO functions to activate ARF6 during the latter stages of cell scattering. In fact, the apical distribution of ARNO in polarized epithelia may serve to sequester the protein, which later becomes accessible for ARF6 activation as the cells become non-polarized. Activation of ARF6 in non-polarized cells could serve to translocate at least a subpopulation of cytoplasmic Rac1 to the cell surface as has been described previously (22Boshans R.L. Szanto S. van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27Radhakrishna H. Al-Awar O. Khachikian Z. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 855-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To complement the above investigations, we used a second experimental system in which the parental clone of MDCK cells described earlier was treated with HGF. Observation of cells under a phase-contrast microscope revealed that cells exhibited similar morphological alterations during cell scattering except that the kinetics appeared to be delayed. For instance, the initial stages of cell-cell dissociation and formation of intercellular spaces were more evident at 4 h after HGF treatment (data not shown). The GTPase activation profiles during HGF-induced cell scattering were examined. As shown in Fig. 2,C and D, the unique profiles for ARF6 and Rac1 activation detected earlier for Src-induced scattering were also observed upon treatment of cells with HGF. Moreover, the transient decrease in Rac1 activation coincided with an increase in cellular levels of ARF6-GTP and dissolution of cell-cell contacts. The decrease in Rac1-GTP levels was significantly inhibited when MDCKpp60v-Src cells were transfected with the dominant-negative ARF6(T27N) mutant (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the decrease in Rac1-GTP levels is dependent on ARF6. Our previous work has shown that expression of a constitutively activated ARF6 mutant in epithelial cells induces a breakdown of cell-cell contacts. These effects of ARF6 are mediated by recruitment of nm23-H1, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, that facilitates junction disassembly in part by sequestering the Rac1 nucleotide exchange factor, Tiam 1, leading to decreased levels of Rac1-GTP (17Palacios F. Schweitzer J.K. Boshans R.L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Disassembly of cell-cell contacts and down-regulation of Rac1-GTP is blocked by expression of an nm23-H1 mutant, nm23-H1(ΔKpn), which prevents oligomerization and hence the function of wild type nm23-H1 (28Otsuki Y. Tanaka M. Yoshii S. Kawazoe N. Nakaya K. Sugimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decrease in Rac1-GTP might be due to the ARF6-regulated recruitment of nm23-H1, we examined the effect of expressing nm23-H1(ΔKpn) on cell scattering and Rac1 activation. Transfection of cells with plasmid encoding nm23-H1(ΔKpn) inhibited scattering of MDCKpp60v-Src cells at permissive temperatures (Fig. 3). As observed in Fig. 3B, the expression of nm23-H1(ΔKpn) elicited only a partial “rescue” of Rac1-GTP levels during the scattering response. This could be because not all the cells express nm23-H1. Alternatively, it is possible that there are additional mechanisms that lead to a decrease in activated Rac1 levels during the onset of cell scattering. Taken together, the above studies demonstrate that Rac1 activity is modulated during cell scattering and in part is regulated by ARF6 activation. The unique activation profile of Rac1 appears to be reflected in the morphological changes and polymerized actin redistribution that occurs during cell scattering. At sites of cell-cell contacts, increased accumulation of actin and Rac1-GTP facilitates cell-cell junction formation (29Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Rac1-GTP also promotes the formation of actin-rich lamellipodia at the leading edge of migrating cells (6Fenteany G. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gimond C. van Der Flier A. van Delft S. Brakebusch C. Kuikman I. Collard J.G. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Indeed, staining of MDCKpp60v-Srccells with rhodamine-phalloidin during scattering shows increased labeling for polymerized actin at the cell junctions at very early time points (Fig. 4). However, actin staining between cells decreases by 1 h. Other studies have also shown that during the initial stages of the breakdown of cell-cell contacts, the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted at the adherens junctions (10Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Within 4 h after Src activation, actin filaments have been markedly remodeled, and cells exhibit actin-rich lamellipodia at leading edge (Fig. 4). This is likely mediated by the increase in Rac1-GTP and ARF6-GTP levels during the later stages of cell scattering. To compliment our observations of the biphasic activation profile of Rac1, we have examined the distribution of wild type Rac1 in MDCKpp60v-Src cells during cell scattering. We find that a significant pool of Rac1-GTP shifts from cell junctions to the perinuclear cytoplasm in MDCKpp60v-Src cells at ∼1 h after Src induction at permissive temperatures. At later time points, when cell-cell contacts are practically non-existent, the majority of the Rac1 is found at lamellipodia of migrating cells (Fig.5). Consistent with these observations, studies by Nakagawa et al. (30Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that upon Ca+2 chelation, the dissolution of cell junctions is accompanied by the redistribution of Rac1 to the cytoplasm. Thus, the spatial distribution of Rac1 in the cell may be important for temporal control of Rac1 activation during epithelial to mesenchymal transitions.Figure 6Schematic representation of the progression of Rac1 and ARF6 activities during sequential stages of cell scattering. In confluent epithelia, Rac1-GTP levels are high, whereas ARF6-GTP levels are minimal. As cells are triggered to scatter, ARF6-GTP levels increase, and this is accompanied by a transient decrease in Rac1-GTP. Subsequently, ARF6-GTP and Rac1-GTP levels increase exponentially as cells acquire a migratory phenotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) What is the significance of the changes in the activities of ARF6 and Rac1 during cell scattering? Significant progress has been made toward elucidating the role of the actin cytoskeleton either to facilitate cell-cell adhesion or to promote surface protrusions and ruffles required for cell migration. The dynamic process of cell scattering necessitates dynamic remodeling, from intercellular adhesion to the migratory phenotype. The activation of the ARF6 and Rac1 GTPases are likely critical determinants that facilitate this transition. In organized polarized epithelial sheets, ARF6-GTP levels are minimal, whereas Rac-GTP is high and E-cadherin cycling and turnover is minimal. This is consistent with our earlier observations that a dominant-negative ARF6-GDP mutant is localized almost exclusively to cell-cell junctions in polarized epithelia, and its expression enhances the epithelial phenotype (16Palacios F. Price L. Schweitzer J. Collard J.G. D'Souza-Schorey C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4973-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Addition of migratory stimulus induces the activation of ARF6. Further acquisition of the migratory phenotype is facilitated by subsequent increases in ARF6 and Rac1 activities (Fig. 5). From the above investigations, we also infer that the cellular phenotype can markedly affect the activation profile of individual GTPases. In individual or small clusters of loosely adherent epithelial cells that do not exhibit colony compaction, basal levels of Rac-GTP are lower than those observed in larger and polarized epithelial colonies that exhibit significantly higher cell-cell contacts. 2F. Palacios and C. D'Souza-Schorey, unpublished observations. Moreover, loosely adherent cells will likely exhibit a steady increase in Rac1 activation as opposed to a transient down-regulation of Rac1 that is observed in larger colonies. These findings also support previous reports that cadherin engagement or cell-cell adhesion can modulate the activation profiles of the Rho family GTPases (14Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2094270826,"Aging is generally accompanied by reduced tolerance to oxidative stress and altered responsiveness to proliferative signals. We have shown that hepatocytes derived from aged rats (24–26 months) exhibit greater sensitivity to H2O2 treatment and reduced proliferation following epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment than cells of young adult rats (5–6 months). Here we examined the effects of aging and calorie restriction (CR) on expression of the oxidative stress-inducible and pro-apoptotic gene gadd153(chop) in these hepatocytes, and we investigated its influence on sensitivity to oxidants. We show that aging was associated with elevated expression of gadd153, both basally and in response to H2O2 treatment. CR, which attenuates age-associated declines in stress tolerance, prevented the age-related increase in gadd153 expression. EGF treatment also resulted in gadd153 induction in old cells. This effect was absent in young cells and in old cells of CR rats.gadd153 induction by EGF was reactive oxygen species-dependent and correlated with heightened sensitivity to subsequent H2O2 treatment, suggesting that elevated Gadd153 contributes to the greater sensitivity of EGF-pretreated old cells to oxidative stress. Additional support for this hypothesis was provided by experiments with Rat1 fibroblasts in which conditional expression of Gadd153 conferred increased sensitivity to H2O2. We propose a model whereby the diminished ability of old hepatocytes to overcome an EGF-triggered reactive oxygen species load leads to induction of the proapoptotic gene gadd153, which, in turn, sensitizes the cells to oxidant injury.

However, high or sustained levels of ROS can result in the oxidation of biomolecules, resulting in cell damage leading to growth arrest, senescence, or death (9Finkel T. Holbrook N.J.

Oxidative damage contributes to a wide variety of age-related diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, and several lines of evidence implicate oxidative stress as an important factor in normal mammalian aging (11Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3156) Google Scholar, 12Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6606) Google Scholar, 13Sohal R.S. Free Radic.

First, oxidative damage accumulates with age in rodents; and calorie restriction (CR), the only non-genetic intervention capable of extending life span in mammals, reduces such accumulation (15Ames B.N.

Second, in mammals as well as lower organisms, gene mutations or manipulations that modify oxidative stress tolerance correspondingly influence longevity (18Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S.

Among these is the mutation of the signaling molecule Shc66, which enhances oxidative stress tolerance and increases life span in mice (25Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Finally, chronological aging in rats is accompanied by reduced tolerance to oxidative injury, reflecting a decreased ability to activate certain pro-survival signaling pathways in response to the insult (26Holbrook N.J. Ikeyama S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Hall D.M. Oberley T.D. Moseley P.M. Buettner G.R. Oberley L.W. Weindruch R. Kregel K.C.

That altered proliferative ability is linked to a reduction in oxidative stress tolerance is suggested by the significant overlap between signaling pathways involved in regulating proliferation and those involved in supporting cell survival in response to oxidative stress (10Martindale J.L.

Indeed, there is strong evidence indicating that oxidants usurp growth factor signaling pathways, such as those mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, to activate downstream signaling pathways important to both responses (5Guyton K.Z.

Rat hepatocytes exhibit reductions in both proliferative capacity and oxidative stress tolerance as a function of aging and provide a useful model to understand associated mechanisms. We have demonstrated that hepatocytes derived from aged rats (hereafter referred to as “old” or “aged” hepatocytes) show a reduced ability to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase in response to both EGF and a wide range of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations (35Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Martindale J.L. Wang X.T. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Exp. Gerontol.,. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of either EGF treatment or low (mitogenic) concentrations of H2O2, this is associated with reduced DNA synthesis. In the case of high (toxic) concentrations of the oxidant, it is associated with lower survival. Hepatocytes from rats maintained on CR display less of a decline in extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation with aging and, accordingly, greater oxidative stress tolerance than those derived from their ad libitum (AL) fed counterparts (28Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies aimed at identifying potential genes responsible for the reduced survival of old cells following oxidative stress, we observed that the expression of gadd153 appeared higher in old hepatocytes relative to young cells. Gadd153 belongs to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors (36Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 37Carlson S.G.

Expressed at low levels in proliferating cells, it undergoes marked induction in response to stresses that result in growth arrest or cell death, including oxidant injury, certain DNA-damaging agents, nutrient depletion/amino acid starvation, and stress to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar, 41McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), but its role in regulating cell death under other stress conditions is less well established. In this paper, we explore the role of Gadd153 in mediating responses to EGF and H2O2 in young versus aged hepatocytes. We demonstrate that basal expression of gadd153increases with aging, as does its magnitude of induction in response to H2O2 treatment. In addition, we show thatgadd153 is preferentially induced in old cells in response to EGF treatment through a ROS-dependent mechanism, and we provide evidence that this sensitizes the old cells to a subsequent oxidant injury. CR, which increases proliferative capacity and enhances survival of old cells following oxidative stress, attenuatesgadd153 expression basally and in response to stress. Our findings suggest that dysregulated gadd153 expression contributes to the reduced stress tolerance of aged hepatocytes and point to Gadd153 expression as an important factor in liver aging. Male Fischer 344 rats 4–26 months old (NIA Contract Colonies at Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle in a controlled environment with water supplied at all times. AL fed rats were offered unlimited quantities of regular NIH-31 pelleted diet, whereas calorie-restricted (CR) rats received a vendor-provided pellet-enriched NIH-31 diet equal to 607 of the average daily caloric intake of the AL fed rats (GRC ACUC protocol NJH-058-Ra/Mi). Hepatocytes were isolated from young (4–6-month-old) and old (24–26-month-old) rats by the method of Seglen (43Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). Rat1 cells were obtained from Dr. C. C. Ling (44Chen C. Nussenzweig A. Guo M. Kim D. Li G.C. Ling C.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1659-1665PubMed Google Scholar). Gadd153i cells were derived from Rat1 fibroblasts and express ectopicgadd153 under the control of an isopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter, as described previously (41McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Rat1 and Rat1-Myc-Gadd153 (A94) cells lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A94 and Gadd153i cells were maintained as described above in medium containing 300 ॖg of hygromycin B (Sigma) per ml. H2O2was from Sigma; EGF was from Invitrogen; and AG1478, compound 56, ebselen, and N-acetylcysteine were from Calbiochem. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue dye. Northern blot analysis was carried out using total RNA as described previously (35Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Martindale J.L. Wang X.T. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Exp. Gerontol.,. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out using radiolabeled cDNA probes specific for rat gadd153,gadd45, and grp78. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide complementary to 18 S rRNA was used to verify RNA integrity and loading differences (35Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Martindale J.L. Wang X.T. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Exp. Gerontol.,. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Real-time PCR determinations were performed using the iCycler iQTM Real Time Detection System (Bio-Rad) using a SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Assays were carried out in triplicate, and PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers for amplification of histone H1 sequence were AGATCGCGAGTCAGGTTCTG and GTGGAGTTCTCGGTCATGGT; primers for amplification of the GADD153 sequence were CCTGAAAGCAGAAACCGGTC and CCTCATACCAGGCTTCCAGC. Reactions were performed as follows: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 7 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Standard curve and slope values were derived from 10-fold cDNA dilutions (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10000). Input amounts of RNA (IA) were calculated using Equation 1 provided by ABI Prism 7700,IA=10(Ct­b)/mEquation 1 where Ct = value from RT-PCR data file;b = y intercept of standard curve line;m = slope of standard curve line (from equationy = mx + b for standard curve line). Histone H1 was used as reference gene, because its expression was not changed with age. Whole-cell lysates (50–150 ॖg, prepared as reported previously (35Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Martindale J.L. Wang X.T. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Exp. Gerontol.,. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)) were size-fractionated by electrophoresis through Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For protein detection, a polyclonal anti-Gadd153 antibody was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After secondary antibody incubation, signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Thegadd153-LUC construct containing the −778 to +21 promoter region of the hamster gadd153 gene was obtained from Dr. S. Howell (45Gately D.P. Sharma A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected for 12 h using 100 ॖl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with 1.6 ॖg of DNA per dish. After transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h before treatment with 100 ng/ml of EGF for 12 h. Cells were then incubated in fresh serum-free medium for 6 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for assessment of luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Relative light units were normalized to protein concentrations that were determined in parallel. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance. Differences between individual age or treatment groups were evaluated using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Preliminary experiments using Northern analysis suggested that gadd153 mRNA expression might be elevated with aging. However, basal expression ofgadd153 is very low and often undetectable by Northern analysis, precluding accurate quantitative measurement with this method. Therefore, real time RT-PCR was used to examine expression of the gene in young versus old cells obtained from rats either AL fed or maintained on a CR diet. As shown in Fig. 1A, gadd153mRNA expression was higher in old hepatocytes from AL rats relative to young cells from AL rats. However, old CR hepatocytes showed significantly lower gadd153 expression relative to their AL counterparts. Elevations in Gadd153 protein expression with aging were also observed in whole liver tissue as shown in Fig. 1B, but as shown for mRNA expression in hepatocytes, CR reduced them. As oxidative damage increases gadd153 expression in many cell types, we next examined gadd153 mRNA levels in young and old cells following their exposure to 300 or 600 ॖm H2O2. We have shown previously (28Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that H2O2 induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in both young and old hepatocytes, but with old cells exhibiting greater sensitivity. Consistent with the old cells being more sensitive to H2O2, these cells showed higher induction of gadd153 mRNA relative to young cells (Fig. 2). We next investigated gadd153 expression following treatment with EGF. As shown in Fig. 3A, the absence of gadd153 mRNA induction by EGF in young cells is consistent with the general view that gadd153, as implied by its name, is regulated by conditions of growth arrest and is not responsive to proliferative signals. Much to our surprise, however, we observed significant induction of gadd153 mRNA by EGF in old cells (Fig. 3A). The abundance of mRNAs encodinggadd45 and grp78, two other stress-related genes whose expression often coincides with that of gadd153 during conditions of stress, was not affected by EGF treatment (Fig.3A). Increased gadd153 mRNA expression was associated with increased Gadd153 protein (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the EGF-induced Gadd153 expression was greatly attenuated in cells of old CR rats relative to cells of old AL rats. To determine whether EGF induced gadd153 expression through increases in transcription, cells were transiently transfected with a construct carrying the gadd153 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 3C, no significant activation of the promoter occurred in young cells. By contrast, a marked increase in gadd153 promoter activity was seen following EGF treatment of old hepatocytes (Fig. 3C). EGF stimulation leads to the transient generation of ROS downstream of EGF receptor activation (1Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of ROS in mediating Gadd153 induction by EGF, cells were treated with EGF in the presence of either N-acetylcysteine, a glutathione precursor, or ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic, both of which reduce the ROS load (46Parnham M.J. Kindt S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3247-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 47Wang J.F. Komarov P. Sies H. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both antioxidants prevented Gadd153 induction in old cells in response to EGF (Fig.4A), and they inhibited Gadd153 induction in old and young cells in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4C). Gadd153 induction in response to both H2O2 and EGF was likewise dependent on EGF receptor activation as co-treatment of cells with either AG1478 or compound 56, inhibitors of EGF receptor phosphorylation, markedly reduced Gadd153 induction (Fig. 4,A and C). Induction of Gadd153 is frequently correlated with stresses that result in cell death. Evidence that Gadd153 expression in fact correlated with relative survival in H2O2-treated cells is shown in Fig.4D. This observation suggested that EGF treatment may indeed constitute a stress for these cells. However, examination of EGF-treated old cells revealed no evidence of apoptosis (Fig.4B). In previous studies using several different cell lines, we found that elevated Gadd153 expression alone did not lead to cell death but did enhance cell sensitivity to ER stress (41McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether up-regulation of Gadd153 in old hepatocytes in response to EGF treatment would increase their sensitivity to an oxidative insult. To this end, cells were treated with either EGF, H2O2, or both, and Gadd153 expression and cell survival were assessed 8 or 24 h later, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5A, EGF and H2O2 treatments resulted in similar levels of Gadd153 induction in old cells, although only H2O2 resulted in apoptosis. Importantly, however, simultaneous exposure of old cells to EGF and H2O2 potentiated Gadd153 expression, and this was associated with greater apoptosis than that seen with H2O2 alone. No such potentiation of Gadd153 expression was seen with combined treatment of young cells, nor was the sensitivity to H2O2 altered by combined exposure with EGF (Fig. 5A). The above studies suggest that EGF-stimulated increases in Gadd153 expression lead to heightened sensitivity of old hepatocytes to oxidant exposure. If so, then ectopic expression of high levels of Gadd153 should likewise increase cell sensitivity to oxidants. Unfortunately, such experiments cannot be performed in primary hepatocytes, as we are unable to achieve a high enough efficiency of transfection. However, support for this notion was obtained with Myc-transformed Rat1 fibroblasts (Rat1-Myc) in which Gadd153 expression is constitutively elevated (A94 cells). Parental Rat1-Myc and A94 cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 and 24 h later evaluated for cell viability. Constitutive expression of Gadd153 led to a marked increase in cell death compared with that seen in Rat1-Myc cells (Fig. 5B). Similar findings were obtained using another model in which ectopic (FLAG-tagged) Gadd153 expression was driven via an IPTG-inducible promoter in untransformed Rat1 cells (Fig. 5C). In the absence of IPTG, Gadd153 protein is undetectable in these cells. IPTG treatment (resulting in the accumulation of Gadd153) alone did not significantly induce cell death. However, it markedly enhanced the sensitivity of cells to H2O2. These findings support the view that elevated Gadd153 expression in aged hepatocytes contributes to their enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. We have reported previously (28Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that aging in rats is associated with reduced tolerance of hepatocytes to oxidative injury, an effect that can be attenuated by maintaining the animals on CR. Having preliminarily identified the stress-inducible genegadd153 as up-regulated in the aged hepatocytes, we sought here to investigate further the relationship between gadd153expression and oxidative stress tolerance in this model. The major findings presented are as follows: 1) gadd153 expression is elevated both basally and in response to oxidative injury as a function of aging, but CR reduces these elevated levels; 2) aberrant induction of gadd153 occurs in response to EGF stimulation selectively in old hepatocytes; and 3) elevated Gadd153 sensitizes cells to oxidative insults. Coupled with our previous observations, these new findings argue strongly that elevated Gadd153 is an important factor in liver aging and specifically that it contributes to the enhanced susceptibility of aged cells to oxidative insults. A previous study (48Lee C.K. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), employing microarray screening to identify genes altered by aging in mouse brain, reported that gadd153expression was increased 1.8-fold with aging in the neocortex but not the cerebellum. In that study, CR did not alter the effect of aging ongadd153 expression. By using a similar approach to examine age-related changes in gene expression in mouse heart, it was recently reported that gadd153 expression is not affected by aging but is reduced >3-fold by CR (49Lee C.K. Allison D.B. Brand J. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14988-14993Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Such disparate findings point to important organ/cell type-specific differences in the aging process of mammals. However, it is worth noting that in neither of the two previous studies were the findings for gadd153 obtained with the arrays verified by other methods. Here we have demonstrated the up-regulation of gadd153 with aging in rat hepatocytes and its attenuation by CR by using several different approaches including real time RT-PCR and Northern and Western blot analyses. The fact that CR alters gadd153 expression in old cells, but not young cells, supports the notion that, in liver, CR does not directly influence gadd153 expression but rather acts to prevent age-related alterations leading to elevated expression of the gene. The mechanisms contributing to age-related alterations ingadd153 expression remain to be determined. As an oxidative stress-inducible gene, basal increases in gadd153 expression are consistent with the idea that aging is associated with elevated levels of ROS and chronic oxidative stress (4Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 50Anantharaju A. Feller A. Chedid A. Gerontology. 2002; 48: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that changes in gadd153 contribute to elevations in ROS, as we have shown that ectopic expression of Gadd153 in rat fibroblasts leads to increased levels of ROS (41McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Elevations in basal ROS levels with aging could be an important factor contributing to EGF-induced gadd153 expression as well. Whereas transient generation of ROS is an important and necessary consequence of growth factor stimulation for proliferation, if imposed on cells already containing elevations in ROS, it could shift the cell into a pro-oxidant state, resulting in oxidative stress. The ability of CR (which is known to reduce the levels of oxidative damage with aging) to prevent EGF-induced gadd153 expression is consistent with this hypothesis. Whereas a role for gadd153 in mediating apoptosis in response to ER stress is well established (40Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar, 42Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), its contribution to cell death in other stress paradigms is less clear. Such an effect cannot be taken for granted, as we found that elevatedgadd153 expression did not affect the cellular response to ionizing radiation in Myc-transformed rat fibroblasts (41McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Our findings here using two different model systems of gadd153overexpression, as well as experiments in rat hepatocytes, support its pro-apoptotic function during conditions of oxidative stress and point to elevated gadd153 expression as an important factor in the increased susceptibility of aged hepatocytes to oxidant injury. Strategies aimed at reducing gadd153 expression in aged cells and tissues could have anti-aging benefits."

Such selectivity is achieved by sequence information within the cargo protein that recruits coat protein complexes to drive the formation of transport vesicles. A number of sequence motifs have been identified in the cytoplasmic domains of ion channels that regulate early trafficking events between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Here, we demonstrate that the following trafficking step from the Golgi compartment to the plasma membrane can also be selective. The N-terminal domain of the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 contains specific sequence information that is necessary for its efficient export from the Golgi complex. Lack of this information results in accumulation of the protein within the Golgi and a significant decrease in cell surface expression. As similar results were obtained for the N terminus of another Kir channel subfamily member, Kir4.1, which could functionally substitute for the Kir2.1 N terminus, we propose a more general role of the identified N-terminal domains for post-Golgi trafficking of Kir channels.

These parameters can obviously be regulated on the transcriptional and translational level. In addition, growing experimental evidence indicates that ion channel proteins can contain intrinsic sequence motifs that control surface expression by regulating distinct intracellular trafficking steps (1Griffith L.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R226-R228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Nelson W.J. Yeaman C.

After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 they are forwarded to the Golgi complex from which they are finally transported to the plasma membrane. Having reached the cell surface, they might be endocytosed and either recycled back to the plasma membrane or diverted to degradation. Protein trafficking between the various intracellular compartments is accomplished by transport vesicles, which form at sites to where certain coat proteins have been recruited, a process that seems rather selective (4Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Aridor M. Balch W.E.

Three main types of protein coats have been identified; clathrin coats vesicles that mediate protein transport within the endocytic membrane system (8Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 9Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), whereas the coat protein complexes COPI and COPII are involved in vesicle formation for anterograde and retrograde protein transport of the early secretory pathway between the ER and the Golgi complex (10Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Klumperman J. Curr. Opin.

Besides these classic coat protein complexes, other types of selective vesicular carriers can be formed, for instance by the clathrin-independent adaptins AP-3 and AP-4 or the retromer complex (13Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Pfeffer S.R. Curr.

Selective recruitment of coat proteins is based on sequence information within the cytoplasmic domains of the respective cargo proteins. Thus, the C-terminal amino acid sequence YXXΦ (with Xbeing any amino acid and Φ being a bulky, hydrophobic residue) or di-leucine motifs favor clathrin-mediated endocytosis of membrane proteins (9Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), C-terminal di-lysine motifs have been shown to bind COPI (15Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and a growing number of N- and C-terminal diacidic motifs render selective ER export, most likely by binding to COPII coat complexes (16Ma D.

However, it is still a matter of debate whether sequence information also facilitates protein transport between the Golgi compartment and the cell surface or whether this step of the secretory pathway is constitutive (20Nickel W. Wieland F.T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Nishimura N. Plutner H. Hahn K. Balch W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6755-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we show that surface expression of the mammalian inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 is regulated by its cytoplasmic domains at distinct steps of intracellular protein transport. Whereas its C terminus bears a previously identified ER export motif (16Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Stockklausner C. Ludwig J. Ruppersberg J.P. Klöcker N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), sequence information contained in its N terminus is necessary for post-Golgi trafficking to the plasma membrane. This N-terminal sequence information and its function in Golgi export are conserved in Kir4.1, suggesting that it is of general relevance for Kir channel trafficking. N-terminal fusion constructs of Kir channel subunits with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were designed by inserting the respective cDNA in-frame into the EGFP-C1 eukaryotic expression plasmid (Clontech) using theEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Channel mutants were constructed by PCR with oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations. A chimera of the Kir4.1 N terminus and Kir2.1 was constructed by fusing amino acids 1–59 of Kir4.1 to Kir2.1 at amino acid position 77 using its unique SalI restriction site. An interior deletion of amino acids 57–69 in Kir2.1 was made following a site-directed mutagenesis protocol as described (22Hagemeier C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was introduced into the extracellular domain of Kir2.1 at amino acid position 116. All PCR-derived constructs were verified by sequencing. Opossum kidney (OK) cells (American Type Culture Collection) and tsA201 cells (kindly provided by P. Dallos, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum and 17 penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 57 CO2. At ∼ 807 confluence, the cells were transfected with the respective cDNAs using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) following the supplier's directions. The Golgi complex was identified by expressing a fusion construct consisting of the 81 N-terminal amino acids of the Golgi resident enzyme 1,4-galactosyltransferase (the cDNA was kindly provided by M. Fukuda, The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and red fluorescent protein DsRed-2 (Clontech). In addition, cells were incubated with 10 ॖg/ml brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma), which reversibly fuses the Golgi compartment with the endoplasmic reticulum. For immunocytochemical detection of the HA epitope, transfected cells were fixed in 47 paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C and pretreated with 107 normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS with 0.057 Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature to block unspecific antibody binding. Then they were incubated with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200 in 27 NGS/PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized by a goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to Cy-3 (1:1000 in 107 NGS/PBS-T). To detect selectively the population of HA-tagged channels expressed on the cell surface, antibody staining was performed in vivo without the use of detergents. Antibody incubation was carried out before fixation in serum-free medium for 15 min at 37 °C for the primary and secondary antiserum, respectively. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in TEEN-T (50 mm Tris pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Triton X-100, and Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min on ice. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE on a 107 polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:5000; Clontech). Following incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antiserum (1:2500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), labeled proteins were detected using ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid rafts were isolated as described (23Delling M. Wischmeyer E. Dityatev A. Sytnyk V. Veh R.W. Karschin A. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7154-7164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in TEEN (pH 7.6), and cell debris was pelleted by low-speed centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. A small fraction of the supernatant was used to check for equal expression levels of the respective proteins by immunoblot analysis. Crude membranes were collected by high-speed centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. They were resuspended in 200 ॖl of TEEN (pH 11) containing 17 Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were adjusted to 407 sucrose/TEEN overlaid with 1.5 ml of 367 sucrose/TEEN and 2 ml of 107 sucrose/TEEN. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, six 750-ॖl fractions were collected from the top, diluted with 3.5 ml of TEEN (pH 11), and centrifuged again at 100,000 ×g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Triton X-100-insoluble proteins in the pelleted fractions were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and separated by reducing SDS-PAGE as above. Successful isolation of lipid rafts was verified by coexpression of the cell adhesion molecule NCAM 140 (24Niethammer P. Delling M. Sytnyk V. Dityatec A. Fukami K. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which neither interacted with Kir2.1 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments or affected its subcellular distribution (data not shown). The cDNA coding for rNCAM 140 and a polyclonal anti-NCAM antiserum were kindly provided by M. Schachner. Two different experimental approaches were used to quantify plasma membrane expression of Kir2.1 and the truncation constructs. First, 120 (n) cells of two independent transfections for each experimental group were judged by two investigators without knowledge of the experimental history using the following criteria: ++, strong plasma membrane fluorescence; +, weak plasma membrane fluorescence; and −, no plasma membrane fluorescence. In a second approach, all deletion constructs were expressed with extracellular HA epitopes, and surface expression was quantified by fluorescence intensity measurements of anti-HA immunocytochemistry without the use of detergents. For each construct (two independent transfections), pixel intensity values corrected for background were integrated over 10 areas of 0.2116 mm2 each (Scion Image 4.02). Translation efficiencies of the constructs were similar as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3). Cells were imaged with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Zeiss) using the following excitation wavelengths and filter settings: EGFP, excitation 488-nm argon laser/emission BP5 05–530 nm; Cy-3, excitation 543-nm helium laser/emission LP 560 nm. As shown in Fig.1A, the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains of the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 regulate surface expression of the channel protein at distinct steps of the intracellular trafficking pathway. Upon heterologous expression in OK cells, GFP-fused wild type Kir2.1 (GFPKir2.1) was predominantly expressed in the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane (17Stockklausner C. Ludwig J. Ruppersberg J.P. Klöcker N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Disruption of the previously identified ER export motif in the C-terminal domain of Kir2.1 (GFPKir2.1-E377/379A) resulted in accumulation of the channel protein in the ER and significantly reduced both Golgi and plasma membrane expression. A similar loss of surface expression was found in a Kir2.1 mutant lacking the N-terminal domain (GFPKir2.1Δ1–76) as confirmed by extracellular epitope tagging (Fig. 1B). In this case, however, the channel protein accumulated in a juxtanuclear compartment that we identified as the Golgi complex by the following. (i) Incubation of transfected cells with the fungal Golgi toxin BFA led to a reversible redistribution of GFPKir2.1Δ1–76 to the ER; and (ii) we found colocalization of GFPKir2.1Δ1–76 with the red fluorescent protein DsRed fused to the targeting sequence of the Golgi-resident enzyme galactosyltransferase I (25Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) (Fig.1C). The same observations were made upon heterologous expression of the respective constructs in tsA201 cells, another epithelial cell line (data not shown). An effect of the N-terminal GFP fusion on the sorting behavior of the mutant channel was excluded because Kir2.1Δ1–76 tagged with an extracellular HA epitope and detected by immunocytochemistry showed an identical subcellular localization as GFPKir2.1Δ1–76 (data not shown). As the N terminus of Kv potassium channels is thought to be involved in subunit assembly (26Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 27Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we tested whether deletion of the 76 N-terminal amino acids in Kir2.1 would affect its intracellular trafficking simply by disturbing channel assembly. Upon coexpression of HA-tagged Kir2.1 (Kir2.1-HA) and GFPKir2.1Δ1–76, both channel subunits did not only colocalize, but Kir2.1-HA was even able to rescue GFPKir2.1Δ1–76 into the plasma membrane, thereby excluding a necessary role of the Kir2.1 N terminus in channel multimerization (Fig. 1D). This observation is supported by the earlier findings of Tinker et al., who assigned the second transmembrane segment and a proximal C-terminal region to be the assembly domains of Kir channels, with N-terminal deletions of up to 80 amino acids not affecting coimmunoprecipitation with homomeric wild type subunits (29Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Taken together, whereas the C terminus of Kir2.1 contains sequence information regulating early protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi complex (16Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 17Stockklausner C. Ludwig J. Ruppersberg J.P. Klöcker N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), its N terminus seems to be necessary for later trafficking steps,i.e. the export from the Golgi complex (Fig.1E). We then investigated whether the need of a N-terminal domain for post-Golgi trafficking was a broader principle among other Kir family members. GFP-fused Kir4.1 channel subunits (GFPKir4.1), which lack the ER export motif found in Kir2.0 channels, showed a homogenous distribution within the ER upon heterologous expression (Fig. 2). Insertion of the Kir2.0 ER export sequence (-FCYENEV-) into the Kir4.1 C terminus (GFPKir4.1-export) redistributed the channel protein both into the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, deletion of the N terminus ofGFPKir4.1-export abolished plasma membrane fluorescence but left the protein accumulation in the Golgi unaffected, similar to what had been observed for GFPKir2.1-Δ1–76. Moreover, the Kir4.1 N terminus was able to substitute for the Kir2.1 N terminus and rescued surface expression ofGFPKir2.1Δ1–76 (Fig. 2). To address the question whether specific sequence information within the N termini of the two Kir channel subunits directed their post-Golgi trafficking, we designed various deletion mutants and chimeric constructs and quantified their plasma membrane expression. As can be derived from Fig. 3, two stretches of amino acids were identified in the N termini of Kir2.1 and Kir4.1, respectively, that were necessary for reliable surface expression of the channel proteins. The deletion of up to 43 N-terminal amino acids did not affect the predominant localization of GFPKir2.1 to the plasma membrane. However, the deletion of 46 or more N-terminal amino acids completely changed its subcellular distribution, resulting in a significant loss of membrane expression and increased accumulation of protein in the Golgi compartment. As an interior deletion of only 13 amino acids also showed reduced surface expression (GFPKir2.1-Δ57–69), we conclude that it is not the length of the N terminus but the specific sequence information that is necessary for proper post-Golgi targeting of Kir2.1. A similar effect was observed for the Kir4.1 N terminus, which rescuedGFPKir2.1-Δ1−76 into the plasma membrane. Here, membrane fluorescence remained unaffected up to a deletion of 20 N-terminal amino acids but was lost if 40 residues were deleted. Alignment of the identified N-terminal domains reveals a strikingly high number of basic, positively charged residues such as arginine and lysine (Fig.4A). Some of these positive charges are highly conserved throughout the Kir channel subfamilies. When we neutralized these residues by mutation to alanine (GFPKir2.1-R44A,R46A,R67A-K49A,K50A-H53A), the mutant channel accumulated within the Golgi complex and could not be detected immunocytochemically on the cell surface anymore, which demonstrates a critical role of these residues in post-Golgi trafficking (Fig. 4B). This was somewhat surprising, because basic, positively charged residues have hitherto been implied in retrograde rather than anterograde sorting signals. Motifs such as NH2-XXRR-, -RXRR-, -KKXX-COOH, and -KDEL-COOH function typically as ER retention/retrieval signals, whereas the known anterograde sorting signals that favor ER export share the common feature of one or more diacidic, negatively charged motifs (-DXE-) often neighbored by hydrophobic residues (1Griffith L.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R226-R228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). To further narrow down the trafficking motif, we neutralized single positive charges in the Kir2.1 N terminus. Whereas single mutations of Arg-44 and Arg-46 to alanine did not significantly affect surface trafficking, the double mutant R44A,R46A accumulated in the Golgi complex, and its surface expression was significantly reduced (Fig.4C). Though these observations underline a pivotal role for Arg-44 and Arg-46 in post-Golgi trafficking of Kir2.1, a contribution of other residues downstream of Arg-46 cannot be excluded, particularly as the interior deletion construct GFPKir2.1-Δ57–69, which lacks only one positively charged residue (Arg-67), also showed a loss of surface expression (Fig. 3). Alternatively, impaired surface trafficking of GFPKir2.1-Δ57–69 could result from a conformational change in the N-terminal domain that disturbs the accessibility of upstream-located positive charges. Vesicle formation for surface membrane transport does not only involve the recruitment of coat proteins by the respective cargo proteins but also the direct interaction of the coat complexes with membrane phospholipids (33Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, the clathrin coat accessory proteins AP180 and epsin have been shown to specifically interact with the negatively charged head groups of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (34Ford M.G.J. Pearse B.M.F. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 35Ford M.G.J. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J.K. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides are not evenly distributed throughout cellular membranes but are enriched in lipid raft-like domains, which could hence represent preferential sites for transport vesicle formation (33Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar,36Cullen P.J. Cozier G.E. Banting G. Mellor H. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the cluster of positive charges identified in the N-terminal domain of Kir2.1 could facilitate Golgi export by conferring lipid raft localization of the channel via electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged head groups of phospholipids. Density centrifugation revealed that wild typeGFPKir2.1 is partially associated with lipid rafts (Fig.4D), similar to what had been shown previously for a tandem Kir3.1/3.2 channel (23Delling M. Wischmeyer E. Dityatev A. Sytnyk V. Veh R.W. Karschin A. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7154-7164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neutralizing the respective charges in the Kir2.1 N terminus, which had led to the loss of surface expression, did not disrupt lipid raft association (Fig.4D). These data exclude a crucial role of these residues in targeting the channel protein into lipid domains. We assume that the identified sequence will instead serve as a recognition motif for a protein coat complex mediating vesicle transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. In summary, we demonstrate that Golgi export of the mammalian Kir channel subunit Kir2.1 depends on sequence information within its cytoplasmic N terminus without playing a role in channel multimerization. We propose that the anterograde transport of ion channel proteins can be selective not only at the level of ER export but also at a later stage of the secretory pathway, i.e.from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. Selectivity will most likely be achieved by coat or mediating adaptor proteins that recognize sequence information of the cargo protein and then initiate vesicle formation. The diversity among the signals identified to date might enable the cell to differentially control surface expression of different channel proteins at different stages of intracellular transport.

Hertig A.T. Rock J. Fertil. Steril. 1950; 1: 3-25Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Following embryo implantation, decidualization persists and extends throughout the endometrium, leading to the formation of the pregnancy decidua. This morphological change is accompanied by the biochemical expression of a number of bioactive substances (2Gurpide E. Tabanelli S. Tang B. Genazzani A.R. Petraglia F. Human Endometrial Stromal Cells. Parthenon Press, Carnforth, Lancs, UK1992: 717-724Google Scholar) that in turn act as local regulators of both decidual and placental functions (3Tabibzadeh S.

Thus, decidualization is critical for embryo implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. In the presence of estrogen and progestin, endometrial stromal cells (ESCs)1 isolated from human cycling endometrium can exhibit morphological and functional changesin vitro that mimic in vivo decidual transformation (5Huang J.R.

With development of this in vitromodel, many studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms underlying decidualization. Increasing bodies of evidence indicate that a number of growth factors, cytokines, proteinases for extracellular matrices, and peptide hormones are produced by decidualized ESCs (2Gurpide E. Tabanelli S. Tang B. Genazzani A.R. Petraglia F. Human Endometrial Stromal Cells. Parthenon Press, Carnforth, Lancs, UK1992: 717-724Google Scholar, 3Tabibzadeh S. Endocr.

Recent microarray technologies have explosively accelerated identification of dynamically regulated genes in the process of decidualization (15Popovici R.M. Kao L.C. Giudice L.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3510-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Brar A.K. Handwerger S. Kessler C.A. Aronow B.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 7: 135-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular events involved in the regulation of transcription and expression of those decidualization-associated genes. A key event in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression is the post-translational modification of nucleosomal histones, which converts regions of chromosomes into transcriptionally active or inactive chromatin. The protein building blocks of the nucleosome are the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The amino-terminal tails of these histones house the sites for acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ADP-ribosylation. Among these well-known covalent modifications of histones, the most well studied is the acetylation of ε-amino groups on conserved lysine residues in the amino-terminal tail domains of the histones (17Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). There are two classes of enzymes involved in determining the state of acetylation of histones: histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that have been identified in the past several years (17Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), coinciding with the discovery of specific HDAC inhibitors such as trapoxin and trichostatin A (TSA) (18Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). These inhibitors increase acetylated histones in many cell types, thereby inducing expression of specific pre-programmed genes, which, in turn, lead to cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death (19Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Along with the availability of these materials, recent dramatic advances highlight the involvement of HATs in transcriptional activation and HDACs in transcriptional repression (17Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). However, there has been no report on histone acetylation in decidualization except a single study (20Serra M.J. Ledford B.E. Baggett B. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 20: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) demonstrating in 1979 that histones H2B and H4 become acetylated immediately upon in vivo decidualization in rat. In this study, we have investigated the effect of TSA on ESCs in terms of ovarian steroid-induced differentiation induction to address how histone acetylation is involved in this process. We here show that TSA advances ovarian steroid-induced decidualization of ESCs isolated from human cycling endometrium. Histones H3 and H4 became acetylated upon decidualization, and the acetylated H4 was associated with the ovarian steroid-induced promoter activation of IGFBP-1, a typical decidualization marker gene, both of which were augmented by co-treatment with TSA. These results provide evidence suggesting that histone acetylation is deeply involved in the process of decidualization of human ESCs. TSA was obtained from Wako Bio-chemicals (Osaka, Japan) and dissolved in ethanol. An antibody against histone H3 acetylated at both lysine residue 9 (Lys-9) and Lys-14 and anti-acetylated histone H4 antibodies specifically reacting with acetylated Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, or Lys-16 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies recognizing histone H2A acetylated at Lys-5 or H2B acetylated at Lys-5, Lys-12, Lys-15, and Lys-20 were obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). All the oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen (Tokyo, Japan). Endometrial specimens were obtained from consenting patients undergoing endometrial biopsies or total abdominal hysterectomy for benign gynecological disease. The use of these human specimens was approved by the Keio University Ethics Committee. ESCs were isolated from human cycling endometria as previously described (21Maruyama T. Sachi Y. Furuke K. Kitaoka Y. Kanzaki H. Yoshimura Y. Yodoi J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, tissue samples were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and minced into small pieces of less than 1 mm3. The tissues were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.27 (w/v) collagenase (Wako), 0.057 DNase I (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), 17 antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen), and 107 fetal bovine serum (FBS). After enzymatic digestion, cell clumps were dispersed by pipetting. Most of the ESCs that were present as single cells or small aggregates were strained through a 70-ॖm cell strainer (Falcon 2350, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which allowed the ESCs to pass through while intact glands were retained. The filtrates were washed twice and inoculated into 6-cm dishes or each well of six-well plates. Glands were recovered from the cell strainer by backwashing with DMEM without FBS. To disperse glands into a single-cell suspension, the gland-containing fraction was first resuspended in DMEM without fetal calf serum and spun at 800 × g for 10 min, and the resultant pellet was suspended in 3 ml of 0.257 trypsin/EDTA solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Glands were disrupted by thoroughly pipetting. The trypsin was inactivated with 3 ml of DMEM/107 FBS. The EGCs were pelleted again, resuspended in DMEM/107 FBS/17 antibiotic-antimycotic mixture, and seeded into a 6-cm dish coated with collagen type I. The isolated ESCs and EGCs were pre-cultured for about 2 days to be grown to subconfluency in DMEM supplemented with 107 FBS and 17 antibiotic-antimycotic mixture. The cells were then cultured in the absence or the presence of 10 nm 17औ-estradiol (E2) plus 1 ॖm P4 or in combination with TSA for different periods according to the experimental protocol. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with 0.3 ॖg of total cellular RNA using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers used to amplify human IGFBP-1, prolactin (PRL), औ-actin, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were as follows: IGFBP-1, 5′-AACCTCTGCACGCCCTCACC-3′ (P1) and 5′-AGGGATCCTCTTCCCATTCCAAGGGTAGA-3′ (P2); PRL, 5′-GCCCCCTTGCCCATCTGTCC-3′ (P4) and 5′-AGAAGCCGTTTGGTTTGCTCC-3′ (P5); औ-actin, 5′-CCCAGGCACCAGGGCGTGATC-3′ and 5′-TCAAACATGATCTGGGTCAT-3′; and MMP-2, 5′-TGGGAGCATGGCGATGGATA-3′ and 5′-ACAGTGGACATGGCGGTCTCA-3′, respectively. Preliminary experiments determined the optimum PCR cycle number within the linear range of amplification for each gene being measured. After PCR amplification, 15-ॖl aliquots were electrophoresed in 37 agarose gels, followed by photographic recording of the gels stained with ethidium bromide. Gel photos were scanned, and densitometric analyses of PCR products were performed using the image analysis program NIH Image, version 1.62 (Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health). To quantitate the mRNA level of IGFBP-1 in ESCs untreated or treated with various reagents, we adopted competitive PCR methods (22Jin C.F. Mata M. Fink D.J. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using a competitive external standard that consisted of a shortened IGFBP-1 DNA fragment as illustrated in Fig. 2A. To prepare this competitive template, a 39-bp primer (5′-AACCTCTGCACGCCCTCACCCACGGAGATAACTGAGGAG-3′; P3, Fig.2A) was designed to include 19 bp of the binding sequence (underlined, matching the white region in Fig.2A) appended to the 5′-end of a sequence corresponding to bases 275–294 of IGFBP-1 cDNA (the black region). Thus, using P3 as the 5′-primer and P2 as the 3′-primer, 343 bp of the IGFBP-1 sequence was amplified. With the appended 20 bp of primer P3, this resulted in a 363-bp amplicon that included the P1 and P2 binding sequences at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively (Fig.2A). Similarly, to construct a competitive template for PRL cDNA, 40-bp primer (5′-GCCCCCTTGCCCATCTGTCCCGGTATACCCATGGCCGGGG-3′; P6) was designed to contain 20 bp of the binding sequence appended to the 5′-end of a sequence corresponding to bases 79–98 of PRL cDNA. With this primer as the forward primer and P5 as the reverse primer, 253 bp of the PRL sequence was amplified. With the appended 20 bp of primer P6, this resulted in a 273-bp amplicon that included the P4 and P5 binding sequences at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RT-PCR was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For each sample, serial dilutions of competitive template generated as described above were added to 300 ng of total RNA on which reverse transcription was performed. After the reaction for 30 min at 50 °C, the samples were heated for 15 min at 90 °C as the initial PCR activation step. PCR amplifications were then performed with a set of primer pairs, P1 and P2, under the following conditions: 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 56 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C for 23 cycles, followed by 7 min at 72 °C as the last primer extension step, generating a 446-bp product from the target cDNA and a 363-bp product from the competitor cDNA (Fig. 2A). With a set of primer pairs, P4 and P5, PCR amplifications were performed under the following conditions: 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 56 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C for 26 cycles, followed by 10 min at 72 °C as the last primer extension step, generating a 385-bp product from the target cDNA and a 273-bp product from the competitor cDNA. PCR products separated on 37 agarose gel were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed under UV illumination. The intensity of the bands on the image from FAS-III MINI (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan) was measured with the public domain NIH Image program, version 1.62. To confirm the detection range of competitive RT-PCR, the relationship between the amount of cDNA generated and the initial concentrations of total RNA used were determined. For analyzing the results, the log of the ratio of amplified target to competitor products was graphed as a function of the known amount of competitor added to the PCR reaction (Fig. 2C). CA-Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates) was used for the regression analysis and calculation of x intercepts. When the log ratio equals zero, the concentrations of the target (originally from the RT reaction) and the competitor are equal (Fig. 2C). The amount of cDNA synthesized from 300 ng of the initial RNA sample was calculated from the graph (Fig. 2C). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. Ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed and transferred to Maximum Strength Nytran® nylon (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) by using the TurboBlotter® system (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (23Maruyama T. Kitaoka Y. Sachi Y. Nakanoin K. Hirota K. Shiozawa T. Yoshimura Y. Fujii S. Yodoi J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The filter was hybridized with the human IGFBP-1 probe labeled by a Gene Images random prime-labeling module and detected by a Gene Images CDP-star detection module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 30–60 min. Histones of HeLa cells and cultured ESCs were extracted according to the procedure of Yoshidaet al. (24Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ESCs (2 × 106) in a 60-mm culture dish were treated without or with E2 plus P4 in combination with TSA for 8 h, harvested using a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation at 700 ×g for 10 min, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The washed cells were suspended in 200 ॖl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sodium bisulfite, 17 Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 8.67 sucrose, pH 6.5). After pestle homogenization, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed three times with the cold lysis buffer, and once with 10 mmTris-HCl, 13 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, successively. The pellet was suspended in 100 ॖl of ice-cold H2O using a Vortex mixer, and concentrated H2SO4 was added to the suspension to give a concentration of 0.4 n. After incubation at 4 °C for at least 1 h, the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm using a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was taken and mixed with 1 ml of acetone. After overnight incubation at −20 °C, the coagulated material was collected by microcentrifugation and air-dried. This acid-soluble histone fraction was dissolved in 30 ॖl of H2O. Protein was quantitated using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Acetylation of cellular histones from HeLa cells and ESCs treated without or with E2 plus P4 in combination with TSA was analyzed by slab gel electrophoresis using AUT gel as described elsewhere (24Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted cellular histones were incubated with the same volume of loading buffer (7.4 m urea, 1.4 mNH3, 10 mm dithiothreitol) for 5 min and were then added with a one-eighth volume of 17 pyronine G in glacial acetic acid. The mixture was applied onto of the upper gel (1 macetic acid, 6.3 m urea, 4.47 acrylamide) and electrophoresed in 0.2 m glycine, 1 m acetic acid. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), dried, and photographed. Acid-extracted histones from HeLa cells treated with TSA, or ESCs treated without or with E2 plus P4 in combination with TSA, were resolved by 157 SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with acetylated histone type-specific antibodies as indicated. Proteins were visualized using a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. ChIP assays were performed according to the protocol for the acetyl-histone H4 ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). ESCs were treated without or with 500 ng/ml TSA or in combination with E2 plus P4for 60 min in 10-cm dishes. Following treatment, cells were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde into the medium at a final concentration of 17 and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and resuspended in 200 ॖl of ChIP lysis buffer (17 SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors). The lysates were divided into two tubes and sonicated utilizing an ultrasonic processor at amplitude setting 30 with five 10-s bursts followed by five 6-s bursts at amplitude setting 40. The sonicated lysates were then diluted to 800 ॖl with ChIP dilution buffer (0.017 SDS, 1.17 Triton X-100, 1.2 mmEDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl). One ml of each sample was precleared by incubating with 40 ॖl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Three microliters of anti-acetyl histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was added, and immunoprecipitation was done overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were collected with 30 ॖl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose and washed once for 5 min on a rotating platform with 1 ml each of the following buffers in sequence: low salt wash buffer (0.17 SDS, 17 Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.17 SDS, 17 Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (250 mm LiCl, 17 Nonidet P-40, 17 sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and twice with TE (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were eluted, and cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h and subjected to proteinase K treatment. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and was subjected as a template for PCR amplification to detect the presence of promoter regions immunoprecipitated with anti-acetyl histone H4 antibody. The following primers were used for PCR analysis of immunoprecipitated promoter regions I and II as illustrated in Fig.5A: region I, Fw (886) (5′-GGAAGGCCATGGAGGGAGTG-3′) and Rv (619) (5′-TCTCCTCTCTGGAGGGGCAG-3′); region II, Fw (263) (5′-CGTCATCCCCCTCCCAGCTGAG-3′) and Rv (33Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) (5′-GCACAGGCCGCGCCACTTGCACC-3′). PCR amplifications were carried out under the following conditions: 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 50 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C for 30 cycles, preceded by 3 min at 95 °C and followed by 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products separated on 37 agarose gel were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed under UV illumination. The intensity of the bands on the image from FAS-III MINI was measured with the public domain NIH Image program, version 1.62. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post hoc Dunn's test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. To explore the role of histone acetylation in decidualization, we examined the effect of TSA, a selective and potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, on mRNA expression of IGFBP-1, a typical biochemical marker of decidualization, in ESCs cultured in the absence or presence of E2 plus P4. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that IGFBP-1 mRNA was up-regulated by E2 plus P4 in 48 h (Fig.1A). Co-addition with TSA provoked a further enhanced induction whose magnitude was comparable to that obtained from decidualized ESCs treated with E2 plus P4 for 14 days (Fig. 1A). TSA alone was capable of inducing IGFBP-1 mRNA at a relatively high concentration (500 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the levels of औ-actin mRNA expression were almost constant throughout the treatment (Fig.1A). Consistent with the RT-PCR data, Northern blot analysis showed that TSA augmented E2 plus P4-induced IGFBP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). PRL, another typical decidualization marker, was up-regulated by E2 plus P4 in 48 h, which was further augmented by co-addition of TSA (Fig. 1C). In contrast, neither TSA alone nor in combination with E2 plus P4 affected the expression of matrix metalloproteinase II mRNA (Fig. 1D), which has been reported to be regulated by cytokines but not by ovarian steroid hormones per se(25Lockwood C.J. Krikun G. Hausknecht V.A. Papp C. Schatz F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4607-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to up-regulation of decidualization markers, TSA alone or in combination with E2 plus P4 induced morphological changes that resembled the decidual transformation of ESCs (Fig. 1E). We then investigated more quantitatively using competitive RT-PCR whether TSA enhances E2 plus P4-induced IGFBP-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner and examined whether the effect of TSA is additive or synergistic. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, competitor DNA was generated by PCR using a chimeric primer P3 and the downstream primer P2. Both the competitor and the target sequence of IGFBP-1 cDNA derived from ESCs were competitively co-amplified by PCR using primers P1 and P2. The amplified product of competitor is 83 bp shorter than the target sequence. Fig. 2B demonstrates the representative RT-PCR data where serial dilutions of the competitor are added to the fixed amount of sample cDNA from ESCs treated without or with either E2 plus P4, TSA, or both, co-amplified, and then examined by electrophoresis. In the competitive RT-PCR analysis of mRNA for IGFBP-1, the equivalent points, i.e. the log ratio equals zero, in which similar intensities of the bands of cDNA and competitor are detected (Fig.2, B and C), were observed between 8 and 32 pg of competitor when cells were treated with TSA in combination with E2 plus P4 (Fig. 2C). The competitive RT-PCR analysis using four different samples revealed that TSA synergistically enhanced E2 plus P4-induced IGFBP-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Fig. 3A shows the representative RT-PCR data on PRL where serial dilutions of the competitor, which is 112 bp shorter than the target sequence, are added to the fixed amount of sample cDNA, co-amplified, and then examined by electrophoresis. The competitive RT-PCR analysis using three different samples revealed that TSA synergistically enhanced E2 plus P4-induced PRL mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether these molecular events provoked by TSA are specific for ESCs, we examined the effect of TSA on morphological and biochemical changes in EGCs isolated from endometrial specimens simultaneously used for isolation of ESCs. RT-PCR analysis revealed that TSA did not affect mRNA expression of both IGFBP-1 (Fig. 4A) and PRL (data not shown) in EGCs. Likewise, TSA alone, ovarian steroid hormones, or co-treatment did not provoke any dramatically morphological changes (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the effect of TSA is selective for ESCs. To ascertain whether TSA treatment leads to acetylation of core histones in ESCs, acid-extractable proteins were analyzed on AUT gel (Fig.5A). As noted before (26West M.H. Bonner W.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), histone H4 exhibited the best resolution among other histones. Before TSA treatment, H4 derived from HeLa cells were primarily in the unacetylated or mono-acetylated form (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Eight hours of TSA treatment at 100 ng/ml led to dramatic increase in di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated forms (lane 2). Likewise, H4 derived from ESCs treated with control vehicles for 8 h consists largely of unacetylated or mono-acetylated forms (lane 3), whereas di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated forms appeared upon 8-h stimulation with 500 ng/ml TSA (lane 4). Also, treatment with E2 plus P4 showed some increase in di- and tetra-acetylated forms (lane 5), both whose increment and changes in the acetylation profiles were further enhanced by co-addition of TSA (lane 6).

https://openalex.org/W1983775269,"Deciding whether a missense allelic variant affects protein function is important in many contexts. We previously demonstrated that a detailed analysis of p53 intragenic conservation correlates with somatic mutation hotspots. Here we refine these evolutionary studies and expand them to the p16/Ink4a gene. We calculated that in order for ‘absolute conservation’ of a codon across multiple species to achieve P<0.05, the evolutionary substitution database must contain at least 3(M) variants, where M equals the number of codons in the gene. Codons in p53 were divided into high (73% of codons), intermediate (29% of codons), and low (0 codons) likelihood of being mutation hotspots. From a database of 263 somatic missense p16 mutations, we identified only four codons that are mutational hotspots at P<0.05 (8 mutations). However, data on function, structure, and disease association support the conclusion that 11 other codons with ≥5 somatic mutations also likely indicate functionally critical residues, even though P0.05. We calculated p16 evolution using amino acid substitution matrices and nucleotide substitution distances. We looked for evolutionary parameters at each codon that would predict whether missense mutations were disease associated or disrupted function. The current p16 evolutionary substitution database is too small to determine whether observations of ‘absolute conservation’ are statistically significant. Increasing the number of sequences from three to seven significantly improved the predictive value of evolutionary computations. The sensitivity and specificity for conservation scores in predicting disease association of p16 codons is 70–80%. Despite the small p16 sequence database, our calculations of high conservation correctly predicted loss of cell cycle arrest function in 75% of tested codons, and low conservation correctly predicted wild-type function in 80–90% of codons. These data validate our hypothesis that detailed evolutionary analyses help predict the consequences of missense amino-acid variants."
https://openalex.org/W1992476560,"Since it is reported that adrenomedullin (AM) upregulated by hypoxia inhibits hypoxic cell death, we examined the effects of AM antagonist (AM C-terminal fragment; AM(22-52)) on the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. We, for the first time, demonstrated that AM antagonist significantly reduced the in vivo growth of the pancreatic cancer cell line. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the mean diameter of blood vessels was significantly smaller in the tumor tissues treated with AM antagonist than in those treated with AM N-terminal fragment (AM(1-25)), and that the PCNA-labeling index was lower in the former than in the latter. Then we demonstrated that AM antagonist showed no effect on the in vitro growth of the pancreatic cancer cell line. These results showed that AM played an important role in the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo, suggesting that AM antagonist might be a useful tool for treating pancreatic cancers."

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). This process begins with the attachment of a multiubiquitin chain to a target protein and involves several enzymatic activities. A ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)1 activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction by forming a thioester bond with the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. The ubiquitin is then transferred to a specific sulfhydryl group on a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). A ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) transfers the activated ubiquitin from E2 to a lysine residue of a bound substrate, forming an isopeptide bond. Substrate specificity is determined mainly by E3s which bind both the protein substrate and the cognate E2. Once the multiubiquitin chain is assembled on a protein substrate by the cooperation of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, the target protein is recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

In mammalian cells, a wide variety of E3s are found. The cullin family proteins play an important role in a group of multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligases by associating with an Rbx1 (also known as ROC1 and Hrt1) family member of RING finger proteins to form the integral core (4Ohta T.

As a component of the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, the VHL protein targets the α subunits of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF1 and HIF2 for ubiquitination (20Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M.

In the case of SOCS-1, Vav and JAK2 are known to be specific substrates of the E3 complex (22De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol.

Studies on cullin/Rbx1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases raise the possibility that other cullin family members could function as a component of ubiquitin ligases with distinct substrate specificities by forming multiprotein complexes with yet unidentified adaptors and/or substrate recognition subunits. In an effort to address this possibility, we have been purifying cullin-containing complexes from HeLa cells and identifying specifically associated proteins. In this report, we present purification of CUL4B-containing complexes and demonstrate that TIP120A specifically interacts with cullin family proteins and that it negatively regulates the activity of an SCF ubiquitin ligase by interfering with the binding of Skp1 to CUL1. The cDNAs encoding human TIP120A (GenBankTM accession number BE019018), CUL2 (GenBankTMAA206544), CUL4A (GenBankTMBC008308), and Rbx1 (GenBankTMH71993) were from Incyte Genomics Inc. CUL3 (GenBankTM accession number KIAA0617) and CUL4B (GenBankTM accession number KIAA0695) cDNA clones were a kind gift from Kazusa DNA Research Institute. Human CUL1, Skp1, and Skp2 cDNAs (kind gifts from Y. Xiong and H. Zhang) were described previously (24Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 25Michel J.J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar). To construct plasmids for the expression of N-terminally FLAG- or HA-tagged proteins, cDNAs were amplified by PCR with appropriate primers and ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). HeLa Tet-Off (Clontech) derived cells stably expressing EBNA-1 were transfected with an episomal expression vector pYR-FLAG-hCUL4A or pYR-FLAG-hTIP120A that contained the gene of interest under the tetracycline-regulated promoter, oriP for episome replication, and the selection marker for hygromycin B. The cells were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml G418 (Sigma), 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Clontech), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mml-glutamine, and with 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). To induce the expression of FLAG-tagged proteins, cells were grown without tetracycline for 2 days. Nuclear extracts and cytosolic S100 extracts were prepared as described previously (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were dialyzed against buffer BC (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) containing 150 mm KCl (BC150) and rotated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3–6 h. After extensive washes with BC150, proteins were eluted with 0.3 mg of FLAG peptide per ml in BC150. Immunopurified protein complexes were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex). After staining gels with Sypro Ruby (Bio-Rad) and subsequently with colloidal Coomassie Blue, protein bands were excised and digested with trypsin as described previously (27Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). In-gel tryptic digests of proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) and by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on API QSTAR Pulsar Q-TOF (Applied Biosystems). The mass spectral data were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant and expressed sequence tag data bases. Transfection was carried out by the CaPO4-DNA precipitation method using Hepes or BES buffer. After 36 h, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were adjusted to 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody resin (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were recovered by low speed centrifugation, and the resin was washed extensively with the binding buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2% SDS. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and visualized by Western blotting with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blotting, we used antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), HA (Babco), TIP120A (BD Biosciences), CUL1 (Lab Vision), Rbx1 (Lab Vision), Skp1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and Skp2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). His6-tagged yeast Uba1, human Ubc3, and UbcH5A (Ref. 28Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ub containing a His6 tag and a protein kinase C recognition site (a kind gift from Z.-Q. Pan) was purified as described previously (29Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Rat TIP120A containing N-terminal FLAG and His6 tags was expressed in Sf21 cells and purified as described previously (30Kayukawa K. Kitajima Y. Tamura T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Generation of recombinant baculoviruses encoding human CUL1 with a His6 tag, human β-TrCP with a FLAG tag, and human Skp1 with a His6 tag (a generous gift from M. Pagano) were described previously (31Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Human Rbx1 linked with an N-terminal FLAG tag was subcloned into a baculovirus expression vector, pFastBac (Invitrogen), and expressed in Sf21 cells. Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in TNM-FH (Sigma) with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Sf21 cells were co-infected with the recombinant baculoviruses indicated in Fig. 5. Sixty hours after infection, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. FLAG-β-TrCP/His-Skp1 complex was purified by applying the supernatant onto an M2-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After extensive washing of the column with the lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with the lysis buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). His-CUL1/FLAG-Rbx1 was purified using Co2+-agarose beads (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SCFβ-TrCP was reconstituted with recombinant His-CUL1/FLAG-Rbx1 and FLAG-β-TrCP/His-Skp1 and its activity of IκBα ubiquitination assayed using the procedure previously described (29Tan P. Fuchs S.Y.

The Ub ligation reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mmATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.8 μg of Ub, 50 ng of E1, 200 ng of E2, 500 ng of His-CUL1/FLAG-Rbx1, 300 ng of FLAG-β-TrCP/His-Skp1, and 1.2 μg of phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα1–54. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, terminated by adding 30 μl of 2× Laemmli loading buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to visualize the ubiquitinated IκBα. For substrate preparation, 18 μg of purified GST-IκBα1–54 was phosphorylated with HA-tagged, constitutively active IKKβS177E/S181E kinase purified from 293 cells following transfection. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 μm ATP, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, and 0.6 mm DTT. To facilitate the purification of CUL4B-containing complex, we first established a HeLa-derived cell line that conditionally expressed FLAG-tagged CUL4B using an episomal expression vector. The tetracycline-regulated expression of FLAG-CUL4B in stable transfectants was tested by immunoblotting of cell extracts with anti-FLAG antibody. FLAG-CUL4B was induced upon removal of tetracycline, while it was not detected in cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig.1 A). FLAG-CUL4B and its associated proteins were purified from extracts of induced and uninduced cells by a single-step immunoaffinity purification procedure, which had proved to be a gentle and efficient method (33Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several cellular proteins specifically co-purified with FLAG-CUL4B under the experimental conditions employed, as judged by SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis of purified proteins from induced and uninduced cells (Fig. 1 B). Bands corresponding to specifically interacting proteins were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The p14 band was identified as Rbx1 (data not shown), which forms a stable complex with all cullin family members (4Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Another protein p50 turned out to be a novel protein of unknown function. However, since reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments did not confirm the specificity of the interaction between p50 and CUL4B, p50 was not further studied. As shown in Fig.2, mass spectrometric analyses of tryptic peptides derived from p120 revealed it as human TIP120A, which was shown to be a transcription factor that enhanced transcription by RNA polymerases I, II, and III (34Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kayukawa K. Coin F. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Yamamoto K. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7951-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fact that TIP120A was found in CUL4B-containing complex raised the possibility that in addition to the reported function of TIP120A in transcription, it might be involved in regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase and/or ubiquitin- dependent proteolysis.Figure 2Identification of TIP120A as a CUL4B-interacting protein. A, an MS/MS spectrum of a peptide derived from p120. MS/MS analyses were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, sequences determined by MS/MS analyses of tryptic peptides obtained from p120. All peptides were identical to sequences in human TIP120A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the specificity of CUL4B-TIP120A interaction, we tested other cullin family members for their binding to TIP120A. HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs of FLAG-tagged CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, or CUL4B, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was carried out on the cell lysates. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates with anti-TIP120A antibodies indicated that TIP120A associated with all cullins tested (Fig.3 A). Immunoprecipitates of an unrelated protein FLAG-Chk2kd did not contain TIP120A (lane 1), indicating that the interaction between TIP120A and cullins was specific. To confirm the association of TIP120A with cullins, FLAG-TIP120A was immunopurified using anti-FLAG antibodies from cells that conditionally expressed the protein. SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis of purified proteins revealed several protein bands with their molecular masses of 80–90 kDa that were present only in the preparation derived from induced cells (Fig. 3 B). Mass spectrometric analyses identified these proteins as CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, and CUL4B (data not shown), confirming that TIP120A specifically interacted with cullins. A protein band with the molecular mass of 14 kDa was identified as Rbx1, suggesting that TIP120A formed a trimeric complex with a cullin and Rbx1. Since TIP120A interacted with most, if not all, cullins, it might function as a global regulator of cullin-containing ubiquitin ligases. Since CUL1 was the best studied member of the cullin family, we chose CUL1 to further characterize its interaction with TIP120A. To examine whether the interaction of TIP120A with CUL1 affects the SCF complex formation of CUL1, HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs of epitope-tagged TIP120A, CUL1, Rbx1, Skp1, and an F-box protein Skp2 or β-TrCP. HA-CUL1 and FLAG-TIP120A were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively, and co-purified proteins were probed by immunoblotting with suitable antibodies (Fig. 4 A). FLAG-tagged TIP120A, Rbx1, Skp1, and β-TrCP were specifically detected in HA-CUL1 immunoprecipitates (lanes 1 and2). In contrast, FLAG-TIP120A immunoprecipitates contained HA-CUL1 and HA-Rbx1, but not Skp1 and Skp2 (lanes 3 and4), indicating that FLAG-TIP120A did not form a complex with Skp1 and Skp2. To confirm that F-box proteins Skp2 and β-TrCP do not interact with TIP120A, immunoprecipitation of HA-Skp2 or HA-β-TrCP was performed and associated proteins analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.4 B). CUL1 and Skp1 were present in HA-Skp2 and HA-β-TrCP immunoprecipitates, but TIP120A was not pulled down in the precipitates (lanes 5 and 6). Since CUL1 directly associates with Skp1 (9Skowyra D.

Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) and TIP120A (data not shown), interactions among CUL1, Skp1, and TIP120A were examined by coupled immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 4 C). Whereas CUL1 was immunoprecipitated with both TIP120A and Skp1, the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-TIP120A contained only CUL1, but not Skp1, and those of FLAG-Skp1 contained only CUL1, but not TIP120A (lanes 4–6). Collectively, these data demonstrated that in cells existed at least two distinct CUL1-containing complexes either with TIP120A or with Skp1 and that the binding of TIP120A and Skp1 to CUL1 was mutually exclusive. To further test whether TIP120A and Skp1 compete for the binding to CUL1, HeLa cells were transfected with expression constructs of FLAG-CUL1, HA-TIP120A, HA-Skp1, and HA-Skp2. FLAG-CUL1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and HA-tagged TIP120A, Skp1, and Skp2 were probed by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-TIP120A antibodies (Fig. 4 D). Overexpression of TIP120A reduced co-precipitation of Skp1 to 4–18% in triplicate experiments and Skp2 to 30–40% (lanes 5 and 6). In a similar competition experiment with TIP120A and β-TrCP, TIP120A inhibited the association of β-TrCP with CUL1 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 12–14). These data showed that TIP120A interfered with binding of Skp1 and F-box proteins Skp2 and β-TrCP. It was noted that inhibition of Skp1 binding to CUL1 by TIP120A was greater than that of Skp2 or β-TrCP binding. Recent structural studies on SCFSkp2 showed that the F-box motif of Skp2 directly interacts with CUL1 as well as Skp1 (36Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). This Skp2-CUL1 interaction might not be affected by TIP120A binding and might contribute to less inhibition of Skp2 binding by TIP120A. Further investigation is required to clarify this point. To determine the functional consequence of association of TIP120A with CUL1, we examined the effect of TIP120A on the substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase activity of SCFβ-TrCP using IκBα as a substrate. To devise anin vitro reconstituted system for the ubiquitination of IκBα, we produced all components used in the ubiquitination reaction as recombinant proteins by Escherichia coli or the baculovirus system. Fig. 5 Ashows dye staining patterns of the purified subunits of SCFβ-TrCP after separation by SDS-PAGE. GST-IκBα1–54 was phosphorylated with IKKβS177E/S181E in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated in the Ub ligation reaction with recombinant CUL1/Rbx1 and β-TrCP/Skp1 (Fig. 5 B). A high molecular weight 32P-labeled protein ladder was formed, indicating that phosphorylated GST-IκBα1–54was polyubiquitinated. The ubiquitination of GST-IκBα1–54 was dependent not only on E1 and E2 (data not shown) but on CUL1/Rbx1 and β-TrCP/Skp1 (lanes 1–4), showing that intact SCFβ-TrCP complex was required for IκBα ubiquitination. Addition of increasing amounts of recombinant TIP120A greatly reduced the ubiquitination of IκBα by CUL1 complex in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–7). To test whether the reduction of IκBα ubiquitination by TIP120A is correlated with the decrease of Skp1 binding to CUL1, the CUL1/Rbx1 complex in the ubiquitination reactions was immunoprecipitated with anti-Rbx1 antibodies and bound TIP120A and Skp1 monitored by Western blotting. As the association of TIP120A with CUL1 increased, the binding of Skp1 to CUL1 decreased (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). These results indicated that TIP120A inhibited ubiquitin ligase activity of CUL1 by interfering with the binding of Skp1 and β-TrCP to CUL1. TIP120A was initially identified as a TBP-interacting protein usingin vitro affinity purification procedures (34Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown to function as a transcriptional activator (35Makino Y. Yogosawa S. Kayukawa K. Coin F. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Yamamoto K. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7951-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate a novel function of TIP120A, namely, negative regulation of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases by inhibiting Skp1 binding to CUL1. Since Skp1 is an adapter subunit of SCF complexes that links the F-box protein to CUL1 (9Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 25Michel J.J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lyapina S.A.

A. 1998; 95: 7451-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), inhibition of Skp1 binding by TIP120A results in inhibition of association of F-box proteins and reduction of functional SCF complexes. It has been reported that TIP120A expression was up-regulated during the differentiation process of certain cells. For instance, retinoic acid treatment of P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, which induces differentiation and withdrawal from the cell cycle, elevated expression of TIP120A (38Yogosawa S. Kayukawa K. Kawata T. Makino Y. Inoue S. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that overexpression of TIP120A in P19 cells arrested cell growth (38Yogosawa S. Kayukawa K. Kawata T. Makino Y. Inoue S. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since SCF E3 ligases play a key role in progression of cell division cycle, it is tempting to speculate that induction of TIP120A down-regulates SCF E3 ligases which may, in turn, help cells exit from cell cycle. The function of TIP120A is not likely to be restricted to negative regulation of SCF complexes. Recent evidence suggests that SCF ubiquitin ligases may directly deliver substrate proteins to the proteasome for degradation (39Farra R. Ferrando A. Jasik J. Kleinow T. Okresz L. Tiburcio A. Salchert K. del Pozo C. Schell J. Koncz C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2742-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 40Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown that Skp1 interacts with an Snf1-related protein kinase (SnRK) and α4 subunit of the 20 S proteasome in Arabidopsis (39Farra R. Ferrando A. Jasik J. Kleinow T. Okresz L. Tiburcio A. Salchert K. del Pozo C. Schell J. Koncz C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2742-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that SnRK and/or α4 subunit may function as a docking site for the SCF complexes on the proteasome. Thus, competitive binding of TIP120A to CUL1 against Skp1 may help release of SCF ligases from a proteasomal docking site and unloading of the substrate. Our finding that TIP120A interacts not only with CUL1 but with other cullins suggests that TIP120A has a general role common to most, if not all, cullin-containing E3 ligases. Further structural and functional dissection of TIP120A-cullin complexes is expected to further clarify the role of TIP120A in regulation of ubiquitination and proteolysis. We are grateful to Drs. M. Pagano, J. W. Conaway, Z.-Q. Pan, Y. Xiong, and H. Zhang for generous gifts of reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2057424746,"The timing of cellular exit from the cell cycle during differentiation is specific for each cell type or lineage. Granulosa cells in the ovary establish quiescence within several hours after the ovulation-inducing luteinizing hormone surge, whereas they undergo differentiation into corpora lutea. The expression of Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1 is up-regulated during this process, suggesting that these cell cycle inhibitors are involved in restricting proliferative capacity of differentiating granulosa cells. Here we demonstrate that the lack of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 synergistically renders granulosa cells extended an proliferative life span. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that corpora lutea of p27Kip1, p21Cip1double-null mice showed large numbers of cells with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and high proliferative cell nuclear antigen expression, which were more remarkable than those in p27Kip1single-deficient mice showing modest hyperproliferation. In contrast, differentiating granulosa cells in p21Cip1-deficient mice ceased proliferation similarly to those in wild-type mice. Interestingly, granulosa cells isolated from p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null mice exhibited markedly prolonged proliferative life span in culture, unlike cells with other genotypes. Cultured p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells maintained expression of steroidogenic enzymes and gonadotropin receptors through 8–10 passages and could undergo further differentiation in responses to cAMP accumulation. Thus, the cooperation of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 is critical for withdrawal of granulosa cells from the cell cycle, in concert with luteal differentiation and possibly culture-induced senescence. The timing of cellular exit from the cell cycle during differentiation is specific for each cell type or lineage. Granulosa cells in the ovary establish quiescence within several hours after the ovulation-inducing luteinizing hormone surge, whereas they undergo differentiation into corpora lutea. The expression of Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1 is up-regulated during this process, suggesting that these cell cycle inhibitors are involved in restricting proliferative capacity of differentiating granulosa cells. Here we demonstrate that the lack of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 synergistically renders granulosa cells extended an proliferative life span. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that corpora lutea of p27Kip1, p21Cip1double-null mice showed large numbers of cells with bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and high proliferative cell nuclear antigen expression, which were more remarkable than those in p27Kip1single-deficient mice showing modest hyperproliferation. In contrast, differentiating granulosa cells in p21Cip1-deficient mice ceased proliferation similarly to those in wild-type mice. Interestingly, granulosa cells isolated from p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null mice exhibited markedly prolonged proliferative life span in culture, unlike cells with other genotypes. Cultured p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells maintained expression of steroidogenic enzymes and gonadotropin receptors through 8–10 passages and could undergo further differentiation in responses to cAMP accumulation.

For withdrawal from the cell cycle, proper inactivation of the G1 Cdks is required, which largely depends on physical association with the Cdk inhibitor proteins. The Cdk inhibitor family consists of the Ink4-type Cdk4/Cdk6 inhibitors such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p18Ink4c, and p19Ink4d and the Kip/Cip-type Cdk2 inhibitors such as p21Cip1/Waf1/Sdi1/Cap20, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 (8Kiyokawa H.

Thus, the G1-Cdk regulatory system plays critical roles in the homeostasis of granulosa/luteal cells. During luteal differentiation, the expression of both p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 is up-regulated (14Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M. Khanam D. Hayday A.C. Frohman L.A. Koff A. Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Unlike p27Kip1-null mice, p21Cip1(Cdkn1a)-null mice show normal fertility (19Brugarolas J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). To further investigate the significance of G1-Cdk down-regulation during luteal differentiation, we generated p21Cip1, p27Kip1 double-null mice by cross-breeding. Here we demonstrate that differentiating granulosa cells in p21Cip1, p27Kip1 double-null mice undergo more prolonged proliferation relative to those in p27Kip1-single null mice. Moreover, granulosa cells isolated from p21Cip1, p27Kip1 double-null mice are capable of dividing through a number of passages in culture, exhibiting markedly prolonged proliferative life spans. These data suggest that p21Cip1 and p27Kip1synergistically cooperate for the exit of differentiating granulosa cells from the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONCessation of proliferation is normally coordinated with progression of differentiation essentially in all cell types. Multiple Cdk inhibitors are involved in the down-regulation of Cdk activities during differentiation (8Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 105-120PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vidal A. Koff A. Gene. 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Here we show that p27Kip1and p21Cip1 play cooperative roles in quiescence of differentiating granulosa/luteal cells. p27Kip1 single deficiency prolongs proliferation during luteal differentiation, and p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double deficiency further enhances the proliferative capacity. In contrast, loss of p21Cip1 alone shows little effects on proliferation of luteinizing cells. These observations suggest that p27Kip1is a major rate-limiting factor for the exit of differentiating granulosa cells from the cell cycle. In contrast, the cooperative role for p21Cip1 in the timely establishment of quiescence is dispensable by itself. In normal rodent ovaries, an increase in p21Cip1 expression is observed within 6 h after luteinization-inducing LH surge, preceding a marked increase in p27Kip1 expression after 12 h (14Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The up-regulation in P450scc expression, an indicator of differentiation, occurs within 4–6 h after the LH receptor signal, regardless of the status of the p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 genes (data not shown). Although previous studies suggest a reciprocal correlation between differentiation and proliferation in various cell types, including granulosa cells (24Orly J. Sato G. Erickson G.F. Cell. 1980; 20: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), our studies indicate that luteal differentiation and cell cycle exit are regulated by distinct mechanisms and can be uncoupled. As another example of such uncoupling between cell cycle progression and differentiation, cyclin D2-null mice exhibit defective proliferation with intact luteinization (13Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 14Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Both p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 bind to cyclin D-Cdk4 (or Cdk6) and cyclin E (or A)-Cdk2 complexes (9Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, the association of the Kip/Cip proteins with cyclin D-Cdk is not inhibitory to the kinase activity, whereas their association with cyclin E (or A)-Cdk2 always inhibits the catalytic subunit. Indeed, p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 promote the assembly of d-type cyclins and Cdk4 (28LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Consistently, MEFs lacking p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 exhibit markedly decreased levels of cyclin D-Cdk complexes and aberrantly high activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 (29Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In MEFs lacking Cdk4, the ternary p27Kip1-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes are increased, leading to a higher inhibitory threshold to the Cdk2 activation and delayed G0-S transition (30Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, cyclin D-Cdk complexes titrate p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, regulating the availability of the inhibitors to inactivate Cdk2. We observed that the ovaries of superovulated p27Kip1, p21Cip1double-null mice have aberrantly high Cdk2 activity, 2D. Moons and H. Kiyokawa, unpublished observations. suggesting that continuous proliferation of luteinized granulosa cells depends on elevated Cdk2 activity. In addition, cyclin D2-dependent kinase, which is required for proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells (13Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 14Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), could also play a role in the prolonged proliferative life span. The large dose of 8-bromo-cAMP, which promotes further differentiation of cultured p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells, also inhibits cell cycle progression (data not shown), with concomitant suppression of cyclin D2 expression (Fig. 6B). Although the assembly of cyclin D and Cdk4 is diminished in MEFs lacking p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, the activities of cyclind-dependent kinases are detectable, and the cells are sensitive to p16INK4a-induced G1arrest (31Bagui T.K. Jackson R.J. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8748-8757Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Sugimoto M. Martin N. Wilks D.P. Tamai K. Huot T.J. Pantoja C. Okumura K. Serrano M. Hara E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8067-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations imply that in the absence of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, cyclin D-Cdk complexes are still required for proliferation.Most Cdk inhibitors are ubiquitously expressed, and cooperation between multiple Cdk inhibitors seems to be critical for development and function of various tissues. We have recently demonstrated that increased p21Cip1 expression plays a role in maintaining quiescence of hepatocytes in adult p27Kip1-deficient mice (33Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cooperation between p27Kip1 and p57Kip2in development of the lens and placenta has been demonstrated in mice deficient for these two Cdk inhibitors (34Zhang P. Wong C. DePinho R.A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). p21Cip1 and p57Kip2 cooperate in differentiation of skeletal muscle and alveoli in the lung (35Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The two Ink4-type inhibitors, p18Ink4c and p19Ink4d, cooperate for spermatogenesis (36Zindy F. den Besten W. Chen B. Rehg J.E. Latres E. Barbacid M. Pollard J.W. Sherr C.J. Cohen P.E. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3244-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly during development, could depend on various combinations of Cdk inhibitors in cell type-specific manners.The present study is unique in demonstrating that the absence of multiple Cdk inhibitors prolongs the proliferative life span of primary rodent cells ex vivo. p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells could continue proliferation up to 10 passages, whereas wild-type and p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 single-null granulosa cells cease proliferation almost immediately when placed in culture. Consistently, a previous study showed that primary rat granulosa cells can divide no more than once in culture (24Orly J. Sato G. Erickson G.F. Cell. 1980; 20: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been thought that the culture environment rapidly leads primary granulosa cells to spontaneous differentiation. Deficiency for p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 overcomes the cell cycle inhibitory effect of culture, but these cells are neither immortal nor transformed. p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells continue to express granulosa cell-specific genes such as P450scc, 3औ-HSD, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, and LH receptor, through 8–10 passages. Relatively high expression of P450scc and low expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor suggest that these proliferating cells are differentiated (luteinized) to some extent, presumably in response to the culture environment. However, treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP induces prolactin receptors and P450arom and further increases P450scc and LH receptors. Progesterone secretion into the culture medium is also increased by cAMP treatment (data not shown). These data indicate that p27Kip1, p21Cip1-deficient granulosa cells are capable of further differentiation even after several passages in culture. The large dose of 8-bromo-cAMP also inhibits proliferation of p27Kip1, p21Cip1-deficient granulosa cells with a reduction in cyclin D2 expression. Thus, the absence of the two Cdk inhibitors does not create complete resistance to differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest, despite its proliferation-enhancing effect.Continuous passages of primary fibroblasts or epithelial cells in culture induce replicative senescence with the characteristic flat enlarged morphology (37Campisi J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Senescence involves the Arf-p53-p21Cip1 and p16Ink4-retinoblastoma protein tumor-suppressive pathways (26Sherr C.J. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 38Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

MEFs lacking p27Kip1 also exhibit a normal senescence response. 3H. Kiyokawa, unpublished observations. Wild-type granulosa cells develop a senescence phenotype within several days in culture, sometimes displaying a bi-nucleated morphology similar to senescent fibroblasts (Fig. 5C) (24Orly J. Sato G. Erickson G.F. Cell. 1980; 20: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The markedly prolonged proliferative life span of p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells implies that these two inhibitors may cooperate not only in differentiation-associated withdrawal from the cell cycle but also in inducing senescence to maintain irreversible quiescence. However, it should be noted that p27Kip1, p21Cip1-null granulosa cells are not completely devoid of senescence. Continuous culture beyond passage 10 results in dominance of the senescent morphology, and most cells undergo apoptosis thereafter. This crisis-like cell death may be associated with enhanced apoptosis of corpora lutea in p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null mice (Fig. 4), although the mechanism of apoptosis is unclear.In summary, the absence of the two Cdk inhibitors p27Kip1and p21Cip1 creates a unique cellular condition that extends the proliferative life span of granulosa cells without losing the potential of differentiation. This experimental model provides a useful tool for the study of cell cycle control during differentiation and senescence. For tissue homeostasis, differentiation is usually coordinated with exit from the cell cycle. Proliferation stimulatory and inhibitory signals regulate the G1 phase of the cell cycle, governing the transition between proliferation and quiescence (1Pardee A.B.

In G1regulation, cyclin d- and cyclin E-dependent kinases play interacting roles. d-type cyclins, D1, D2 and D3, activate Cdk4 or Cdk6, whereas cyclin E activates Cdk2. Cyclin D-Cdk phosphorylates some sites of retinoblastoma protein followed by cyclin E-Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of other specific sites (5Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei S.A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). To further investigate the significance of G1-Cdk down-regulation during luteal differentiation, we generated p21Cip1, p27Kip1 double-null mice by cross-breeding. Here we demonstrate that differentiating granulosa cells in p21Cip1, p27Kip1 double-null mice undergo more prolonged proliferation relative to those in p27Kip1-single null mice. Moreover, granulosa cells isolated from p21Cip1, p27Kip1 double-null mice are capable of dividing through a number of passages in culture, exhibiting markedly prolonged proliferative life spans. These data suggest that p21Cip1 and p27Kip1synergistically cooperate for the exit of differentiating granulosa cells from the cell cycle. DISCUSSIONCessation of proliferation is normally coordinated with progression of differentiation essentially in all cell types. Multiple Cdk inhibitors are involved in the down-regulation of Cdk activities during differentiation (8Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 105-120PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vidal A. Koff A. Gene. 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Here we show that p27Kip1and p21Cip1 play cooperative roles in quiescence of differentiating granulosa/luteal cells. p27Kip1 single deficiency prolongs proliferation during luteal differentiation, and p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double deficiency further enhances the proliferative capacity. In contrast, loss of p21Cip1 alone shows little effects on proliferation of luteinizing cells. These observations suggest that p27Kip1is a major rate-limiting factor for the exit of differentiating granulosa cells from the cell cycle. In contrast, the cooperative role for p21Cip1 in the timely establishment of quiescence is dispensable by itself. In normal rodent ovaries, an increase in p21Cip1 expression is observed within 6 h after luteinization-inducing LH surge, preceding a marked increase in p27Kip1 expression after 12 h (14Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The up-regulation in P450scc expression, an indicator of differentiation, occurs within 4–6 h after the LH receptor signal, regardless of the status of the p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 genes (data not shown). Although previous studies suggest a reciprocal correlation between differentiation and proliferation in various cell types, including granulosa cells (24Orly J. Sato G. Erickson G.F. Cell. 1980; 20: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), our studies indicate that luteal differentiation and cell cycle exit are regulated by distinct mechanisms and can be uncoupled. As another example of such uncoupling between cell cycle progression and differentiation, cyclin D2-null mice exhibit defective proliferation with intact luteinization (13Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Both p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 bind to cyclin D-Cdk4 (or Cdk6) and cyclin E (or A)-Cdk2 complexes (9Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, the association of the Kip/Cip proteins with cyclin D-Cdk is not inhibitory to the kinase activity, whereas their association with cyclin E (or A)-Cdk2 always inhibits the catalytic subunit. Indeed, p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 promote the assembly of d-type cyclins and Cdk4 (28LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Consistently, MEFs lacking p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 exhibit markedly decreased levels of cyclin D-Cdk complexes and aberrantly high activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 (29Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In MEFs lacking Cdk4, the ternary p27Kip1-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes are increased, leading to a higher inhibitory threshold to the Cdk2 activation and delayed G0-S transition (30Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, cyclin D-Cdk complexes titrate p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, regulating the availability of the inhibitors to inactivate Cdk2. We observed that the ovaries of superovulated p27Kip1, p21Cip1double-null mice have aberrantly high Cdk2 activity, 2D. Moons and H. Kiyokawa, unpublished observations. suggesting that continuous proliferation of luteinized granulosa cells depends on elevated Cdk2 activity. In addition, cyclin D2-dependent kinase, which is required for proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells (13Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 14Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), could also play a role in the prolonged proliferative life span. The large dose of 8-bromo-cAMP, which promotes further differentiation of cultured p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells, also inhibits cell cycle progression (data not shown), with concomitant suppression of cyclin D2 expression (Fig. 6B). Although the assembly of cyclin D and Cdk4 is diminished in MEFs lacking p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, the activities of cyclind-dependent kinases are detectable, and the cells are sensitive to p16INK4a-induced G1arrest (31Bagui T.K.

Serrano M. Hara E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8067-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations imply that in the absence of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, cyclin D-Cdk complexes are still required for proliferation.Most Cdk inhibitors are ubiquitously expressed, and cooperation between multiple Cdk inhibitors seems to be critical for development and function of various tissues. We have recently demonstrated that increased p21Cip1 expression plays a role in maintaining quiescence of hepatocytes in adult p27Kip1-deficient mice (33Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cooperation between p27Kip1 and p57Kip2in development of the lens and placenta has been demonstrated in mice deficient for these two Cdk inhibitors (34Zhang P. Wong C. DePinho R.A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). p21Cip1 and p57Kip2 cooperate in differentiation of skeletal muscle and alveoli in the lung (35Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The two Ink4-type inhibitors, p18Ink4c and p19Ink4d, cooperate for spermatogenesis (36Zindy F. den Besten W. Chen B. Rehg J.E. Latres E. Barbacid M. Pollard J.W. Sherr C.J. Cohen P.E. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3244-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly during development, could depend on various combinations of Cdk inhibitors in cell type-specific manners.The present study is unique in demonstrating that the absence of multiple Cdk inhibitors prolongs the proliferative life span of primary rodent cells ex vivo. p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells could continue proliferation up to 10 passages, whereas wild-type and p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 single-null granulosa cells cease proliferation almost immediately when placed in culture. Consistently, a previous study showed that primary rat granulosa cells can divide no more than once in culture (24Orly J. Sato G. Erickson G.F. Cell. 1980; 20: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been thought that the culture environment rapidly leads primary granulosa cells to spontaneous differentiation. Deficiency for p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 overcomes the cell cycle inhibitory effect of culture, but these cells are neither immortal nor transformed. p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells continue to express granulosa cell-specific genes such as P450scc, 3औ-HSD, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, and LH receptor, through 8–10 passages. Relatively high expression of P450scc and low expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor suggest that these proliferating cells are differentiated (luteinized) to some extent, presumably in response to the culture environment. However, treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP induces prolactin receptors and P450arom and further increases P450scc and LH receptors. Progesterone secretion into the culture medium is also increased by cAMP treatment (data not shown). These data indicate that p27Kip1, p21Cip1-deficient granulosa cells are capable of further differentiation even after several passages in culture. The large dose of 8-bromo-cAMP also inhibits proliferation of p27Kip1, p21Cip1-deficient granulosa cells with a reduction in cyclin D2 expression. Thus, the absence of the two Cdk inhibitors does not create complete resistance to differentiation-associated cell cycle arrest, despite its proliferation-enhancing effect.Continuous passages of primary fibroblasts or epithelial cells in culture induce replicative senescence with the characteristic flat enlarged morphology (37Campisi J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Senescence involves the Arf-p53-p21Cip1 and p16Ink4-retinoblastoma protein tumor-suppressive pathways (26Sherr C.J.

MEFs lacking p27Kip1 also exhibit a normal senescence response. 3H. Kiyokawa, unpublished observations. Wild-type granulosa cells develop a senescence phenotype within several days in culture, sometimes displaying a bi-nucleated morphology similar to senescent fibroblasts (Fig. 5C) (24Orly J. Sato G. Erickson G.F. Cell. 1980; 20: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The markedly prolonged proliferative life span of p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null granulosa cells implies that these two inhibitors may cooperate not only in differentiation-associated withdrawal from the cell cycle but also in inducing senescence to maintain irreversible quiescence. However, it should be noted that p27Kip1, p21Cip1-null granulosa cells are not completely devoid of senescence. Continuous culture beyond passage 10 results in dominance of the senescent morphology, and most cells undergo apoptosis thereafter. This crisis-like cell death may be associated with enhanced apoptosis of corpora lutea in p27Kip1, p21Cip1 double-null mice (Fig. 4), although the mechanism of apoptosis is unclear.In summary, the absence of the two Cdk inhibitors p27Kip1and p21Cip1 creates a unique cellular condition that extends the proliferative life span of granulosa cells without losing the potential of differentiation. This experimental model provides a useful tool for the study of cell cycle control during differentiation and senescence.

The search revealed numerous orthologous and homologous L-type lectin-like proteins in animals, protozoans, and yeast, as well as the sequence of a novel family member related to VIP36, named VIPL for VIP36-like. Sequence analysis suggests that VIPL is a ubiquitously expressed protein and appeared earlier in evolution than VIP36. The cDNA of VIPL was cloned and expressed in cell culture. VIPL is a high-mannose type I membrane glycoprotein with similar domain organization as VIP36. Unlike VIP36 and ERGIC-53 that are predominantly associated with postendoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and cycle in the early secretory pathway, VIPL is a non-cycling resident protein of the ER. Mutagenesis experiments indicate that ER retention of VIPL involves a RKR di-arginine signal. Overexpression of VIPL redistributed ERGIC-53 to the ER without affecting the cycling of the KDEL-receptor and the overall morphology of the early secretory pathway. The results suggest that VIPL may function as a regulator of ERGIC-53. Consensus profiles were established to screen data bases for novel animal L-type lectins.

Evidence is mounting that intracellular lectins play an important role in these processes (1Hauri H. Appenzeller C. Kuhn F. Nufer O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A majority of secretory proteins acquiresN-glycans during translocation into the ER,1 and these modifications are most often required for the folding of the proteins. The folding process is assisted by the membrane lectin calnexin and the related soluble lectin calreticulin. These two lectins recognize monoglucosylated trimming intermediates and, in a remarkable cycle of de- and reglucosylation, guarantee that only correctly folded glycoproteins leave the ER (2Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 3Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev.

If folding is unsuccessful, newly synthesized glycoproteins are degraded by the proteasome after retrotranslocation to the cytosol. Degradation appears to involve calnexin and an ER α-mannosidase-like protein, termed EDEM in mammalian cells, that enhances degradation of misfolded glycoproteins carrying Man8(GlcNAc)2glycans (5Nakatsukasa K.

Correctly folded glycoproteins leave the ER in COPII-coated vesicles (8Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and are transported to the Golgi via the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC, Ref. 9Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exit signals that direct proteins out of the ER are poorly understood with few exceptions (10Nufer O.

The mannose lectin ERGIC-53 (p58 in rat) mediates efficient ER-exit of some secretory glycoproteins by serving as a transport receptor (9Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). VIP36 is associated with ERGIC and Golgi (22Fullekrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2813-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to some extent with the plasma membrane (23Yamashita K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Biochim. Biophys.

Atsumi S. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16332-16339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 and VIP36 are type I membrane proteins. In their luminal segment they carry a single domain of about 200 amino acids that exhibits sequence similarity to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of soluble lectins of leguminous plants (21Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This domain is known as L-type CRD (27Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 71R-79RCrossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The L-type lectin-like domain of animal lectins is designated LTLD in the present study. The family of plant L-type lectins includes numerous members whereas only three L-type lectins are known in animals: ERGIC-53, VIP36, and a recently discovered ERGIC-53-like protein termed ERGL (28Yerushalmi N. Keppler-Hafkemeyer A. Vasmatzis G. Liu X.F. Olsson P. Bera T.K. Duray P. Lee B. Pastan I. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike ERGIC-53 and VIP36 that are ubiquitously expressed proteins, the ERGLgene is expressed in a limited number of tissues only, with highest mRNA levels in normal and neoplastic prostate cells. The ERGL protein remains to be characterized. We wondered if there are additional, yet unidentified members of the animal L-type lectin family. To identify such proteins we established profiles characteristic for animal L-type lectins. By scanning data bases with these profiles we identified orthologous and homologous L-type lectin-like proteins in animals, protozoans, and yeast. A novel member of this family displays molecular similarities with VIP36 and was therefore dubbed VIPL (for VIP36-like). The corresponding protein was cloned and expressed in cell culture. VIPL was found to localize to the ER and to affect the recycling of ERGIC-53.

Söling, University of Göttingen, and F. Gorelick, Yale University, respectively. Secondary goat-anti-rabbit and goat-anti-mouse antibodies (either against whole IgG (H+L) or IgG-subtypes) conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 568 were from Molecular Probes (The Netherlands). Secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit and goat-anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. Brefeldin A (BFA) was from Epicentre Technologies, and cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen and Sigma. Standard molecular biology protocols were adapted from Refs. 32Ausubel F.M.

ERGIC-53 constructs containing a Myc-tag and an artificial N-glycosylation site, termed GM, have been described (34Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). VIPL cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR. Total RNA of subconfluent HepG2 cells was isolated using peqGOLD RNApure reagent (peqLab, Biotech GmbH, Germany) with a protocol modified from Ref. 36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar. Reverse transcription was done with 2 μg of total RNA using Omniscript RT enzyme (Qiagen, Switzerland) and oligo d (T)14V primer. Subsequent PCR was performed with VIPL-specific primer pairs and Tgo DNA proof-reading polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Switzerland). The 5′-end VIPL primer contained an additional BamHI site and maintains the Kozak transcription initiation sequence preceding the start AUG codon of VIPL. The 3′-end primer had a XbaI site after the stop codon. The resulting cDNA was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) via BamHI and XbaI sites. A HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced downstream of the signal sequence cleavage site between amino acids 44 and 45 of full-length VIPL. This construct was generated by PCR-based splicing (37Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Selected amino acids were substituted by oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis or sequence-overlap-extension PCR (38Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar), and mutant fragments were recloned via BamHI/XbaI orSacII/XbaI sites into VIPL constructs. For creating chimeric GM constructs with the cytoplasmic tail of VIPL (GM-ViTa), a BglII restriction site was introduced adjacent to the transmembrane domain of GM by silent mutagenesis changing the codon of the arginine 499 in the tail to AGA. This site allows insertion of fragments via BglII and XbaI into GM constructs. A cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic tail of VIPL was prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides as described (10Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Degen M. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P. Tani K. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 619-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the GM construct via BglII andXbaI sites. Additional mutations were introduced by PCR and recloned as AccI/XbaI fragments into GM-ViTa construct. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using standard methods and an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser (PE Applied Biosystems, Switzerland). COS-1 cells were cultured and transfected (DEAE-dextran method) as described (35Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (kindly provided by T. Meier, Myocontract, Switzerland) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml fungizone. HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current protocols in molecular biology. Wiley, New York1997Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cultured as described (20Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected by use of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Switzerland). For immunofluorescence experiments cells were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated 8-well multichamber glass slides (Lab Tek, Nalgene-Nunc Intl.). All cultures were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in humidified air, and transfection of cells was carried out 1 day after plating. 42 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, starved in labeling medium (MEM without methionine, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum) and pulsed with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (EasyTag™ EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were immediately processed or chased with complete Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10 mml-methionine. For immunoprecipitation the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8) supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin). In some experiments 20 mm iodoacetamide or N-methylmaleimide was included in the lysis buffer. Cells were lysed by passing them five times through a 25-gauge needle. After 1 h on ice, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was added to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) to which antibodies had been prebound. After incubation for at least 1 h on a rotary shaker in the cold, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, once with 100 mmsodium phosphate (pH 8) and once with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8). For digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H) the immunoprecipitates were boiled for 3 min in 50 mm TrisCl, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.8). An equal volume of 0.15 msodium citrate (pH 5.3) supplemented with protease inhibitors was added, and digestion with 10 milliunits of endo H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was carried out at 37 °C overnight. For digestion with endoglycosidase F (PNGase F), the immunoisolates were boiled for 3 min in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.2). An equal volume of the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 instead of SDS was added and the sample was incubated with 400 milliunits of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Switzerland) at 37 °C overnight. Membrane association of proteins was tested by the sodium carbonate procedure (39Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). After metabolic labeling, the cells were collected in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, 300 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NEM, pH 7.4), resuspended in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5), passed 10 times through a G25 needle, and kept on ice for 30 min. The sample was then layered onto a small cushion of homogenization buffer, and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h and resuspended in lysis buffer (see immunoprecipitation). The pH of the supernatant was neutralized by adding one-fifth volume of 0.5 m potassium phosphate (pH 8), and Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration. All samples were kept on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation. 42 h after transfection with VIPL-HA cDNA, HepG2 cells were incubated for 3 h with 5 μg/ml BFA or with solvent only before subcellular fractionation using Nycodenz gradients (35Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The distribution of organelle markers and VIPL-HA was determined by Western blotting. Samples were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity was visualized by fluorography using sodium salicylate and BioMax MR-1 films (Rochester). Fluorograms were quantified with a ChemImagerTM and AlphaEaseTM software (Alpha Inotech Corporation). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose B85 (45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell, Germany) at 100 V for 1 h in the cold using transfer buffer containing 15.6 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol (pH 8.4). The nitrocellulose was rinsed with 50% methanol and stained by Amido Black (Serva, Germany). All subsequent incubations were in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (Serva, Germany): Blocking for 1 h, incubation with the first antibody for 60 min, rinsing three times 10 min, incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, and rinsing 10 min. After three final 10-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the nitrocellulose was processed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ChemiGlow ECL reagent, AlphaInotech Corp.) and exposed to BioMax MR-1 films or directly analyzed in a ChemImagerTM. The procedure has been described (10Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Degen M. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P. Tani K. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 619-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specimens were examined with a Polyvar microscope or a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. The GCG programs (Madison, WI) were used for sequence analysis (40Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar). Other software used is available at ExPASy server (www.expasy.org/) (41Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). SwissProt (release 40.7) and TrEMBL/release 19.1) data bases were searched. MEME/MotifSearch (42Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. J. Comput. Biol. 1998; 5: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was performed with full-length sequences of human ERGIC-53, ERGL, and VIP36 with default settings. The algorithm automatically generated a profile, based on settings with 6 motifs of 8 amino acids in length each with one or zero occurrence in each sequence. A ProfileSearch (43Gribskov M. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4355-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) against SwissProt and TrEMBL data bases was done with a profile generated of the alignment of ERGIC-53 (amino acids 44–292), VIP36 (amino acids 50–286), and ERGL (amino acids 31–271). For secondary structure predictions we used the GCG program PeptideStructure and PredictProtein (44Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potential sites for domains and motifs were identified by MOTIF search in the Prosite library (45Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) and by PSORT (psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp). Coiled coil regions were identified with CoilScan (46Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and signal sequences with SPScan and signalP (47Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of putative transmembrane domains the programs HMMTOP (48Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), and TMpred were applied in combination with structure predictions. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the GrowTree software of the GCG package, and distance correction was calculated according to Jukes-Cantor. Profiles for the identification of lectins have been established in several data bases (27Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 71R-79RCrossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For plant L-type lectins such profiles include PS00307 and PS00308 in PROSITE (45Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) and PF00138 and PF00139 in Pfam (49Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). We noticed, however, that these profiles do not identify animal L-type lectins accurately in the existing data bases. Therefore, we developed new consensus profiles specific for animal L-type lectins. In a first approach we used software MEME/MotifSearch of GCG (42Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. J. Comput. Biol. 1998; 5: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to establish a consensus motif pattern from non-aligned full-length sequences of the known human L-type lectins ERGIC-53, ERGL, and VIP36. The algorithm generated a consensus motif pattern of 6 linear sequence motifs of 8 amino acids each with single occurrence in a defined order. All sequences were restricted to the LTLD. One motif encompassed part of loop A of the CRD of l-type lectins (50Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that includes a conserved aspartate required for sugar and metal binding (Fig.1 B). Two motifs covered the two cysteines known to form an intracellular disulfide bond in native ERGIC-53 (Ref. 51Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and our own observations). The cysteines are conserved in the LTLD of all three human lectins and in most of their orthologs assembled in Fig. 1. The other four motifs encompassed conserved regions of β-sheets 6 and 15 of ERGIC-53/p58 as well as the 310 helix turn that separates the β-sheets 1a and 1b of ERGIC-53/p58 (51Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A second consensus profile for proteins with a putative LTLD was generated by a ProfileSearch method included in the GCG package (43Gribskov M. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4355-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). This approach is based on a sequence matrix profile that was generated on the optimal alignment of the LTLDs of human ERGIC-53, ERGL, and VIP36. The similarity of LTLDs was found to be 58% for ERGIC-53 and ERGL, 46% for ERGIC-53 and VIP36, and 45% for VIP36 and ERGL. The algorithm of the profile scan calculates the score (quality) of the optimal alignment between the consensus profile and each sequence in the scanned data bases. The scored proteins of both scanning methods were then analyzed by alignment and comparison to animal L-type lectins, and the presence of residues functionally important for metal/sugar binding was investigated. Moreover, structural features of the LTLD were examined by hydrophilicity plots and secondary structure predictions. Finally we analyzed the identified proteins for possible protein motifs and domains. Both profile scans recovered all the known orthologs of ERGIC-53, ERGL, and of VIP36 from the data bases (Table I and Fig. 1 A). The scores were higher for ERGIC-53 orthologs since profile characteristics were contributed mostly by ERGIC-53 and ERGL and to a lesser extent by VIP36. Two entries (SpTrEMBL accession numbers Q9H0V9 and Q9BQ14) also appeared with high scores. They stand for the same sequence that encodes a novel VIP36-like protein, we termed VIPL (VIP36-like, see below).Table IOrthologs and homologs of animal L-type lectinsGroupOrganismACC1-aAnnotated SwissProt or NCBI protein entries.

Radioresistant tumor cells express very high levels of this antigen. We have studied the effect of CD53 antigen ligation on the survival response of tumor cells to serum deprivation, a well-known stimulator of cell death that may mimic the tumor environment; for this aim IR938F and Jurkat cells, a B- and T-cell lymphoma, were used. Ligation of CD53 triggers a survival response and reduces the number of cells that enter apoptosis. In CD53- stimulated cells there is a significant reduction in caspase activation, measured by caspase processing of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, as well as a reduction in the fragmentation of DNA. CD53- stimulated cells also have an increase in the level of bcl-X(L) and a reduction of bax protein, two components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, changing their ratio by 24-fold in the direction of survival. This survival signal appears to be mediated by activation of the AKT, as detected by its phosphorylation in Ser473 upon CD53 ligation. The CD53 antigen interactions might contribute to cell survival in poorly vascularized regions of the tumor mass."

Failure to faithfully duplicate and segregate chromosomes can have dire consequences, such as the onset of cancer, in multicellular organisms. One of the essential regulatory components of chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is a large multisubunit enzyme termed the anaphase-promoting complex (APC),1 or cyclosome (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar and 2Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The APC is an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for initiating the metaphase to anaphase transition once chromosomes are attached and aligned at the metaphase plate and promoting mitotic exit once chromosome segregation is complete. The APC targets numerous substrate proteins involved in mitosis, meiosis, and other cellular processes for degradation by the proteasome by catalyzing their polyubiquitination (1Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and is regulated by checkpoint signaling pathways that monitor DNA and chromosome integrity (3Musacchio A.

Homologs of most of the subunits have been found in other model systems as well, including Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, andDrosophila melanogaster (reviewed in Ref. 2Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Ten of the 11 known APC subunits of budding yeast have human homologs, with yeast Apc9 being the only exception. The extensive homology between APCs of organisms as diverse as humans and yeasts points to an ancient evolutionary origin and reflects the importance of the APC in controlling some of the most fundamental cell cycle events in eukaryotes. The presence of so many subunits makes the APC an unusual E3 enzyme in terms of its size and complexity. The actual catalytic reaction involving transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to a substrate protein is intrinsic to a single small RING finger subunit, Apc11 (11Gmachl M. Gieffers C.

Another subunit, Apc2, containing a highly conserved cullin domain present in other E3 ubiquitin ligases interacts with Apc11 (13Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and is also believed to be important for catalyzing ubiquitin transfer (14Tang Z. Li B. Bharadwaj R. Zhu H. Ozkan E. Hakala K. Deisenhofer J. Yu H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3839-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The specific functions of the remaining subunits are almost entirely unknown. Candidate roles for these components include substrate recruitment and specificity, cellular localization, or interaction with and response to regulatory proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinases and spindle assembly checkpoint proteins (2Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Some subunits may function in a purely structural manner by forming a scaffold that allows proper complex assembly. In our efforts to purify the APC from budding yeast extracts, we consistently observed two previously unidentified proteins co-purifying under high salt conditions with the core complex. Here, we provide evidence that these two proteins, Mnd2 and Swm1, are, in fact, constitutive and functional components of the core APC, bringing the total number of identified subunits in budding yeast to 13. We believe that Swm1 is identical to Apc13, a small protein observed previously in APC preparations that was never identified (7Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Andrews P.D. Ciosk R. Galova M. Stark M.J.R. Mann M. Nasmyth K. Science. 1998; 279: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We discuss the significance of these identifications, the previously described meiotic defects associated with MND2 and SWM1 mutations (15Ufano S. San-Segundo P. del Rey F. Vázguez de Aldana C.R.

Yeast strains expressing Cdc27, Swm1, and Mnd2 (Table I) containing carboxyl-terminal 3× FLAG epitopes were constructed by integration of PCR products amplified from the template p3FLAG-KanMX (gift from Dr. Toshio Tsukiyama; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) at the desired location as described (17Gelbart M.E. Rechsteiner T. Richmond T.J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Integrants were selected on YPD agar containing 500 ॖg/ml G418, and correct integration of the cassette was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Deletion of the BAR1 gene from W1588-4c was achieved by integration of a URA3 cassette amplified by PCR from pRS406 at the BAR1 locus. Replacement of BAR1 with URA3 was confirmed by PCR. Diploid strain YKA180 was created by transformation of YKA151 with YCp50::HO expressing the wild-type HO endonuclease, selecting for transformants on medium lacking uracil and then counterselecting for loss of YCp50::HO on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. The diploid strain was confirmed by its ability to sporulate. Strains from which the APC9,APC10, SWM1, or MND2 genes had been deleted (Table I) as well as their parent strain, BY4741, were from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project, available through ResGen. The presence of the correct deletion was confirmed in each of these strains by PCR using primers flanking the appropriate open reading frame.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSourceW1588-4c1-aW1588-4c is a derivative of W303 in which the weakrad5 mutation has been repaired (25)MATa ade2–1 can1–100 His3–11,15 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ura3–1R.

Open table in a new tab Cell cycle arrests were performed in midlog phase cultures of strain YKA155 as follows. For G1 arrest, α-factor peptide (University of North Carolina peptide synthesis facility) was added from a 5 mg/ml stock in ethanol to a final concentration of 50 ॖg/liter. For S arrest, hydroxyurea (Sigma) powder was added directly to cultures at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. For M arrest, nocodazole (Sigma) was added from a 1.5 mg/ml stock in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 15 ॖg/ml. Cell cycle arrests were monitored by phase-contrast microscopy until >907 of the cells had achieved the desired morphology (unbudded for G1 and large budded for S and M). Samples were removed from the cultures and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) to confirm arrest at the desired stage. Diploid cells were induced to enter a synchronous meiosis exactly as described previously (18Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested midway through meiosis based on the meiotic progression of yeast strain W303 described recently (19Primig M. Williams R.M. Winzeler E.A. Tevadze G.G. Conway A.R. Hwang S.Y. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Induction of sporulation was confirmed by monitoring spore formation by microscopy. Expression plasmid pIVEX-2.3d and all Rapid Translation System (RTS) reagents were from Roche Applied Science. To construct pIVEX-FLAG, oligonucleotides 5′-CATGGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGGGCGGAGGAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTCCTCCGCCCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGA TGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTC-3′ were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, by heating to 95 °C and slowly cooling to 30 °C. The annealed product was ligated into theNcoI and NotI restriction enzyme sites of pIVEX-2.3d. Yeast open reading frames for the 11 previously identified APC subunits as well as SWM1 and MND2 were amplified by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and yeast genomic DNA from strain YPH499 (Stratagene) as the template. Oligonucleotide primers contained restriction enzyme sites to facilitate ligation into either pIVEX-FLAG or pIVEX-2.3d. The resulting pIVEX-FLAG and pIVEX-2.3d constructs allow expression of APC subunits containing an N-terminal 3× FLAG epitope or a C-terminal His6 sequence, respectively, using RTS in vitrotranscription and translation reactions. The 5′ and 3′ junctions of all clones and the identities of the cloned open reading frames were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Approximately 1011 cells from late log phase cultures were washed with H2O and resuspended in 200 ml of cold (4 °C) APC buffer (25 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 107 glycerol, 0.17 Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm औ-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate) containing freshly added complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Cells were disrupted six times for 1.5 min with 0.5-mm glass beads in a bead beater (Biospec Products), allowing 5 min between pulses for cooling. Extract (∼200 ml) was precleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 35,000 × g and cleared a second time for 1 h at 92,000 × g. The soluble extract (5–15 mg/ml protein) was incubated with 100 ॖl of pre-equilibrated EZview anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coupled agarose resin (Sigma) for 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times for 10 min with 25 ml of APC buffer, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and washed an additional three times with 1 ml of APC buffer. APC was eluted by two sequential 30-min incubations at 30 °C with 200 ॖl of APC buffer containing 500 ॖg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). Elutions were pooled, and APC was precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone. For the peptide block control, an extract from YKA151 was split into two equal volumes. From one half, APC was purified as described above. From the other half, APC was purified using an identical volume of anti-FLAG affinity resin that had been blocked by incubation with 1 ml of 500 ॖg/ml 3× FLAG peptide in APC buffer for 1 h before the addition to the extract. Otherwise, the two preparations were performed identically. Proteins eluted from the anti-FLAG affinity resin were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–127 gradient NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). Individual gel bands were carefully excised with a razor and subjected to trypsin proteolysis using a ProGest automated digester (Genomic Solutions). Extracted tryptic peptides were analyzed on a Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Data were internally calibrated with trypsin autoproteolysis peaks and submitted to the MASCOT database search engine (Matrix Science) for protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. All identifications in this study represent statistically significant matches from the database of S. cerevisiae proteins. When a statistically significant match was not obtained by peptide mass fingerprinting, individual peptides from the spectrum were subjected to nanoelectrospray tandem MS on a QStar mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) to confirm the identity of the protein. RTS in vitrotranscription and translation reactions were performed according to the supplied instructions. Two APC subunits, one containing the 3× FLAG epitope and the other containing a His6 tag were coexpressed for 5 h at 30 °C in 50-ॖl reactions containing ∼0.3 ॖg of each expression plasmid. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation, and 40 ॖl of the soluble material was diluted to 500 ॖl with RTS buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium acetate, 107 glycerol, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The sample was cleared a second time by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 ॖl of pre-equilibrated anti-FLAG affinity resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of RTS buffer, and specifically bound protein was eluted with 40 ॖl of 500 ॖg/ml 3× FLAG peptide in RTS buffer overnight at 4 °C. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the presence of the His6-tagged protein was evaluated by Western blot with anti-His6 polyclonal antibody (Covance). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to ensure that the immunoaffinity purifications were successful. Expression of both proteins in the reactions was also confirmed by Western blot using 5 ॖl of the original reaction. To measure relative growth rates of strains harboring deletions of APC9,APC10, SWM1, or MND2 as well as the isogenic wild-type strain, three individual colonies of each strain were grown overnight in 5 ml of YPD at 30 °C. Cultures were diluted 20-fold in YPD and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3 h. For growth curves at 37 °C, cultures were transferred to 37 °C and incubated for 1 h before beginning measurements. Cultures were diluted to identical starting densities of 3 × 105 cells/ml for 30 °C experiments or 5 × 105 cells/ml for 37 °C experiments, and at the indicated time points OD660measurements were taken. OD660 values were converted to cell density for graphical display of growth curves. Samples from each culture were removed at OD660 ∼0.5 and prepared for analysis by flow cytometry. For flow cytometry, cells from 0.5 ml of culture were washed with 1 ml of H2O and fixed overnight in 1 ml of 707 ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated for 2–3 h at 50 °C with 2 ॖg/ml RNase A and 1 mg/ml proteinase K in 50 mm Tris-HCl. After washing with 1 ml of FC buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 78 mm MgCl2), cells were resuspended in 500 ॖl of FC buffer containing 5 ॖmSytox Green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). DNA content was measured on a FACScan instrument. Percentages of G1, S, and G2/M cells were calculated using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc.). We constructed a yeast strain, YKA151, which produces the Cdc27 protein with a carboxyl-terminal 3× FLAG epitope tag from its natural chromosomal locus for immunoaffinity purification of the anaphase-promoting complex. In our preparations of APC from YKA151, we identified all 11 known APC subunits by peptide mass fingerprinting or tandem MS as well as two other bands that had not been previously described as APC subunits (Fig.1A, second lane). We also observed these two proteins associated with APC in preparations from a yeast strain containing a 6-Myc epitope tag on the Cdc16 APC subunit (data not shown). It should be noted that the conditions used for the affinity purification of APC include a high salt concentration (425 mm Na+) at all steps, demonstrating the high salt stability of the APC. To determine whether these proteins were specifically associated with our purified APC as opposed to nonspecifically associated with the anti-FLAG affinity resin, we performed a control purification in which the anti-FLAG affinity beads were preblocked with the antigenic 3× FLAG peptide (Fig. 1A, first lane). Both proteins were effectively competed away by the blocking peptide, suggesting that their presence was due to direct interaction with the APC. The two proteins, Mnd2 and Swm1, have both been implicated in meiosis, but at different stages (15Ufano S. San-Segundo P. del Rey F. Vázguez de Aldana C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2118-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Rabitsch K.P. Tóth A. Gálova M. Schleiffer A. Schaffner G. Aigner E. Rupp C. Penkner A.M. Moreno-Borchart A.C. Primig M. Easton Esposito R. Klein F. Knop M. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Little else is known about them. To provide more convincing evidence that Mnd2 and Swm1 are true subunits of the APC, we constructed yeast strains producing 3× FLAG-tagged versions of Mnd2 and Swm1 (YKA152 and YKA153, respectively). We subjected whole cell extracts from these strains to the same stringent immunoaffinity purification protocol used with YKA151. Proteins in these preparations were identified from Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels by peptide mass fingerprinting. In both cases, we identified 9 of the 11 known APC subunits co-purifying with the epitope-tagged protein (Fig. 1B). Apc11 and Cdc26 were not identified; however, these two small subunits generally required tandem MS for identification due to the low number of tryptic peptides generated. Regardless, these results conclusively demonstrate that Mnd2 and Swm1 are stably associated with the core APC in haploid yeast cells. Although its activity fluctuates, the APC is a stable complex that is present throughout the cell cycle (8Peters J.-M. King R.W. Höög C. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Grossberger R. Gieffers C. Zachariae W. Podtelejnikov A. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Mann M. Peters J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14500-14507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mnd2 and Swm1 are also associated with the APC during different cell cycle stages, APC was immunoaffinity-purified from cell cultures arrested in G1 phase with α-mating factor, in S phase with hydroxyurea, and in M phase with nocodazole (Fig.2, A–C). Mnd2 and Swm1 were identified by mass spectrometry and were present in approximately equal abundance at all three cell cycle stages with respect to the abundance of the other APC subunits, judging from the intensity of Coomassie-stained gel bands. These results suggest that, like the other 11 components, Mnd2 and Swm1 are constitutively associated with the APC and can therefore be considered core subunits. Given the fact that lack of MND2 and SWM1 has previously been associated with severe meiotic defects (15Ufano S. San-Segundo P. del Rey F. Vázguez de Aldana C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2118-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Rabitsch K.P. Tóth A. Gálova M. Schleiffer A. Schaffner G. Aigner E. Rupp C. Penkner A.M. Moreno-Borchart A.C. Primig M. Easton Esposito R. Klein F. Knop M. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we created a diploid strain expressing CDC27 with three copies of the FLAG epitope to determine whether Mnd2 and Swm1 are components of the APC during meiosis. The diploid cells were induced to sporulate in a synchronous manner according to a previously described method (18Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and cells were harvested midway through meiosis (19Primig M. Williams R.M. Winzeler E.A. Tevadze G.G. Conway A.R. Hwang S.Y. Davis R.W. Esposito R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). APC was purified from the meiotic cells using our standard purification procedure (Fig. 2D), and the subunits were identified by mass spectrometry. Both Mnd2 and Swm1 were present along with the other known APC subunits. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Mnd2 or Swm1 dissociates transiently from the APC at a specific stage of meiosis to carry out an APC-independent function, our results support the conclusion that they remain associated with the APC during the sporulation program. We established an interaction assay based on coexpression of two APC subunits, each with a different affinity tag, in an E. coli-derived in vitro transcription and translation system (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this assay, one APC subunit is expressed as a fusion with the 3× FLAG epitope, and the second subunit is expressed as a fusion with a His6 tag. Following the reaction, the subunit containing the FLAG epitope is purified using anti-FLAG antibody-coupled beads, and the presence or absence of the second subunit is monitored by Western blot with anti-His6 antibody. A positive signal in the anti-His6 Western blot is indicative of a physical interaction between the two subunits that results in their copurification. We screened Mnd2 and Swm1 for interactions with as many of the other APC subunits as possible, including homodimeric interactions and interactions with each other. First, we tested Mnd2-His6 by coexpression with a series of FLAG-tagged APC subunits. In this assay, Mnd2-His6 interacted with Apc1-FLAG, Apc5-FLAG, and Cdc23-FLAG (Fig. 3A). The data also suggested a weak interaction with Apc2-FLAG. However, the signal was substantially weaker than the other three interactions, and in light of the fact that Apc2-FLAG expression was greater than most of the other subunits (Fig. 3A and data not shown), we cannot definitively conclude that this result represents a bona fide interaction. Since we were unable to make a construct capable of expressing Swm1-His6 in the RTS system, we screened Swm1-FLAG against a collection of His6-tagged APC subunits to identify its interaction partners. In this experiment, Swm1-FLAG interacted with Apc10-His6, Cdc23-His6, and Apc5-His6 (Fig. 3B). Control reactions to evaluate the specificity of these apparent interactions (Fig.3C) revealed that the Apc10-His6 signal in the elution was not dependent on coexpression of Swm1-FLAG and probably reflected nonspecific association with the antibody resin. On the other hand, the Cdc23-His6 and Apc5-His6 signals were dependent on coexpression of Swm1-FLAG, and we can conclude that Swm1 physically interacts with Cdc23 and Apc5. We were unable to evaluate potential interactions with Apc11, because Apc11 expressed in this system consistently gave artifactual results (not shown). Also, we were unable to evaluate the potential interactions Mnd2-Cdc27, Swm1-Swm1, or Swm1-Apc1 because we could not generate clones that would express Cdc27-FLAG, Swm1-His6, or Apc1-His6 in the RTS system. Nonetheless, we were able to identify at least a portion of the subunit contacts that are probably responsible for the stable association of Swm1 and Mnd2 with the APC in vivo. Defects in APC function generally result in cell cycle arrest in metaphase or a delay in progression of the cell cycle through mitosis. We compared the growth rates of swm1Δ and mnd2Δ haploid strains to strains containing deletions of two other nonessential APC genes,apc9Δ and apc10Δ, as well as the isogenic wild-type strain. At 30 °C, apc9Δ, mnd2Δ, and swm1Δ all exhibited modest but statistically significant slow growth phenotypes, whereas the growth defect ofapc10Δ was much more acute (Fig.4A). At 37 °C, the slow growth phenotypes of apc9Δ, and mnd2Δ were slightly more severe compared with the parental strain. However, the severity of the swm1Δ growth defect was greatly increased at 37 °C, nearly to the level of apc10Δ (Fig.4B). In an effort to pinpoint the cause of the slow growth phenotype ofswm1Δ and mnd2Δ, cells from each of the five strains were taken during the growth curve experiment at 37 °C, and their DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. Theapc9Δ strain exhibited a slight but noticeable and statistically significant accumulation of G2/M cells compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 4C and TableII), consistent with the delayed anaphase entry reported previously for ap"

Here we report that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 12p was detected in approximately 50% of human lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas, and Kras2 mutations were detected at codon 12 in approximately 40% of adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas. Interestingly, all of the lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas containing a Kras2 mutation exhibited allelic loss of the wild-type Kras2 allele when a correlation between LOH of the region on chromosome 12p and Kras2 mutation was made. These results from human lung cancer tissues provide a strong evidence in support of our previous observation in mouse models that the wild-type Kras2 is a tumor suppressor of lung cancer."

Receptor activation induces cells to progress from quiescence (G0) into G1 phase. Constant receptor stimulation is required until the restriction point is reached in mid-to-late G1. Once the restriction point is passed, cell cycle progression is regulated autonomously by the cell cycle machinery (1Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The primary components of this cell cycle machinery are a family of serine/threonine kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinases are regulated by association with regulatory cyclin subunits and by phosphorylation (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Passage through the eukaryotic cell cycle requires successive activation of different complexes between cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase complexes. Progression from G2 to M phase is controlled by cyclin B-Cdc2. The MAPK1 cascade, controlled by the small GTPase Ras, is critical for progression from G1 to S phase (3Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Growth factor receptors recruit Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors to the plasma membrane to activate Ras, which then recruits and activates Raf kinases. In turn, activated Raf phosphorylates and activates the dual-specificity MAPK kinases (MEK1 and MEK2) that phosphorylate and activate the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERK phosphorylates a wide range of effector proteins, including transcription factors that increase expression of proteins required for cell cycle progression into S phase (3Lavoie J.N.

The MAPK pathway has a clearly defined role in G1 phase progression, but may also have a role in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In cycling Xenopus egg extracts, addition of activated MEK during interphase blocks cyclin B-Cdc2 activation by maintaining Wee1 (4Bitangcol J.C. Chau A.S. Stadnick E. Lohka M.J. Dicken B.

ERK activity is dispensable for normal mitotic progression inXenopus, although ERK activity is required for the proper functioning of the mitotic spindle (6Minshull J. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Murray A.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 475-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The role of the MAPK pathway in mammalian mitosis is less clear. The biochemical activities of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 have been shown to decrease as cells enter mitosis (7Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Ueki K. Izumi T. Chatani Y. Kohno M. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y.

Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Components of the MAPK pathway have been shown to associate with the mitotic apparatus of mammalian cells. Activated MEK and ERK localize to the mitotic spindle from prophase to anaphase and to the midbody during cytokinesis (11Shapiro P.S. Vaisberg E. Hunt A.J. Tolwinski N.S. Whalen A.M. McIntosh J.R. Ahn N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Activated ERK also colocalizes with the kinetochore motor protein CENP-E, raising the possibility that CENP-E is a downstream effector for ERK during mitosis (12Zecevic M. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Renzi L. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Gorbsky G.J. Weber M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Blocking MEK activity in cycling somatic cells does not significantly affect mitotic entry, but it does slow progression through mitosis, probably by slowing the CENP-E-dependent chromosome movement coordinated by the mitotic spindle (13Roberts E.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7226-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A number of groups have investigated the regulation of Raf-1 in mitosis using ectopic expression of Raf-1 and nocodazole treatment to produce a mitotic checkpoint-arrested cell population. However, nocodazole treatment itself causes a rapid activation of Raf-1 independent of mitosis (10Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), probably due to disruption of the microtubule network (14Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Mimnaugh E.G. Trepel J. Neckers L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4623-4626PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, little is actually known about the activity of the endogenous Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in normal G2/M progression. In this study, we examined the expression and activation of all components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway during G2/M progression. To avoid the use of microtubule-disrupting drugs like nocodazole that directly influence Raf activity independent of the cell cycle, HeLa cells were synchronized at G1/S and allowed to progress through mitosis in the absence of drugs. Endogenous proteins of the MAPK cascade were then analyzed biochemically. This approach excludes potentially confounding results arising from nocodazole treatment and ectopic protein expression. We show that membrane-bound MEK1 is strongly activated as cells transit into mitosis, but that this activation is uncoupled from ERK, which is inactive in mitosis. The uncoupling of MEK activation from ERK is mediated by direct modifications to MEK1 by the mitotic cell cycle machinery and requires active cyclin B-Cdc2.

GFP- and HA-tagged MEK1ΔN51 was produced by PCR of the open reading frame of wild-type MEK1 or MEK1(S218D/S222D) from residue 51 to the termination codon, such that it was cloned in-frame into the pEGFP vector (Clontech). HeLa and 293H (Invitrogen) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 bovine donor serum (Serum Supreme, BioWhittaker, Inc.). Assays for Mycoplasma were carried out monthly to ensure that the cultured cells were free of contamination. HeLa cells were synchronized using a double thymidine block release protocol as described (17Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J.

Mitotic shake-off was used to obtain a highly enriched mitotic cell population from double thymidine-synchronized cells passing through mitosis. 293H cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer.

PBS was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 ॖm NaVO4) and homogenized by passage through a 23-gauge needle. The post-nuclear supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g; the supernatants (S100) were removed; and the sedimented fractions (P100) were rinsed and sonicated for 5 min in 100 ॖl of ice-cold buffer A. Protein content was measured by the Bradford reaction. P100 and S100 aliquots were snap-frozen and stored at −70 °C. Protein expression levels were determined by quantitative immunoblotting. 20 ॖg of P100 and an equivalent volume of S100 were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semidry transfer. Proteins were detected using the appropriate primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and relative luminescence was quantified by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). Levels of Ras-GTP were assayed using bacterially expressed GST-Raf-RBD(K85A) to bind Ras-GTP, which was detected by immunoblotting with Ras isoform-specific antibodies (18Clyde-Smith J. Silins G.

Membrane-bound MEK1 was solubilized for two-dimensional analysis by addition of 100 ॖl of 0.57 SDS in PBS to a 17 Nonidet P-40 membrane pellet (from a 10-cm dish of mitotic HeLa cells) and incubation at 37 °C for 10 min with vigorous shaking and then addition of 150 ॖl of 57 Nonidet P-40 and sonication for 10 min at 4 °C in a sonicating water bath. The solubilized protein was acetone-precipitated and resuspended in 250 ॖl of rehydration buffer (5 m urea, 2 mthiourea, 27 CHAPS, 27 SB310, 4 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), and bromphenol blue to color) with freshly added dithiothreitol and pH 3–10 carrier ampholytes (two-dimensional) to final concentrations of 50 mm and 17, respectively. The first dimension was resolved on a pH 3–10 linear ImmobilineTM DryStrip (Amersham Biosciences) for 100 kV-h after 18 h of rehydration. The second dimension was resolved on 127 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western transfer and immunoblotting were performed as described above. Raf kinase assays were performed essentially as described (19Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, equivalent P100 aliquots (20 ॖg of total protein) were incubated in kinase buffer (buffer A containing 0.5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2) at 30 °C for 30 min with recombinant MEK and ERK (tube A; to measure total Raf, MEK, ERK, and nonspecific kinase activities), ERK alone (tube B; to measure MEK, ERK, and nonspecific kinase activities), or buffer alone (tube C; to measure ERK and nonspecific kinase activities). Primary reactions were diluted in buffer A, and an aliquot was incubated in a second reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic protein. The radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein was quantified by phosphorimaging. Total P100 Raf kinase activity was the difference in the activities in tubes A and B, as P100-associated Raf-1 and B-Raf are insoluble in 17 Nonidet P-40 (19Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Total P100 MEK activity was the difference in activities in tubes B and C. MEK-specific activity was estimated by dividing the total P100 MEK kinase activity by the amount of P100 phospho-MEK present (determined by quantitative Western analysis as described above). To measure cytosolic Raf activity, volumes of the S100 fraction proportional to the P100 aliquots assayed above were diluted into 1 ml (final volume) of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 100 ॖmNaVO4, 17 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 5 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 5 ॖg/ml pepstatin A). Samples were rotated for 3 h at 4 °C either with 2 ॖg of anti-Raf-1 antibody plus 10 ॖl of protein G beads or with 2 ॖg of anti-B-Raf antibody plus 10 ॖl of protein A beads. The beads were washed three times with buffer B and three times with buffer A and then resuspended in kinase buffer for assaying. Kinase assays were performed on the washed beads using the coupled MEK/ERK assay as described above. To ensure comparable results, P100 and S100 fractions were assayed at the same time using the same reaction buffers and then quantified simultaneously by phosphorimaging. As the P100 and S100 fractions analyzed were equivalent, total measurable Raf kinase activity was determined by adding total P100, S100 Raf-1, and S100 B-Raf kinase activities together. This value is referred to as total Raf kinase activity. Cyclin B1 kinase assays were performed as described (17Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Coverslips were washed with PBS, and then the cells fixed with 37 paraformaldehyde or ice-cold methanol and stored at −20 °C until required. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then blocked in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.17 Tween 20 and 37 bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer), washed five times for 5 min, stained with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:300 dilution in blocking buffer containing 10 ॖg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for DNA counterstaining) for 30 min, washed five times with PBS, and mounted on slides. Photomicroscopy was performed as described previously (17Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the expression and activity of the components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway during cell cycle progression, we synchronized HeLa cell cultures with a double thymidine block. Using this protocol, >807 of the cells progressed synchronously through the S, G2, and M phases and into the subsequent G1 phase. By 6 h after release from the thymidine block, >857 of the cells progressed to G2 phase and, after 9 h, entered mitosis (Fig.1A). Entry and exit from mitosis were determined by measuring cyclin B1-Cdc2 kinase activity. Cyclin B1-Cdc2 activity increased at 8 h after release from the thymidine block, peaked at 9–10 h, and returned to basal levels by 12 h (Fig. 1B). These synchronized cells were used for a detailed biochemical analysis of the expression levels and activities of the endogenous components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway throughout the cell cycle. In HeLa cells, K-Ras and N-Ras were strongly expressed at constant levels throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1G). H-Ras was also expressed, but at very low levels (data not shown). Ras-GTP loading was measured in a sensitive GST-Raf-RBD binding assay that permits GTP loading of each Ras isoform to be assessed simultaneously (18Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). N-Ras displayed two peaks of GTP loading. The first, smaller peak occurred 12 h after release from the thymidine block and correlated with exit from mitosis. The major peak of N-Ras-GTP loading occurred in late G1phase (18 h), consistent with a role in G1/S transition (Fig. 1, C and G). In contrast, K-Ras-GTP levels remained uniformly low throughout the cell cycle, and H-Ras-GTP loading was undetectable (data not shown). Membrane-associated and cytosolic pools of Raf, MEK, and ERK have different specific activities (19Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and possibly access to different substrates. We therefore measured the activities of Raf, MEK, and ERK in membrane (P100) and cytosolic (S100) fractions. The activities of B-Raf and Raf-1 were measured in a coupled MEK/ERK kinase assay (19Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Total P100-associated Raf kinase activity and S100-associated B-Raf and Raf-1 kinase activities were assayed. The P100 Raf kinase activity profile had two peaks (Fig. 1, D and H). The first peak occurred 8–9 h after release from the thymidine block in late G2/early mitosis. Interestingly, this early peak of Raf kinase activity did not correlate with the small peak of Ras-GTP loading that occurred in late mitosis (Fig. 1, C andD). The second peak of P100 Raf kinase activity occurred in G1 phase (14–18 h) and correlated with the major peak of N-Ras-GTP loading (Fig. 1, C and D). Cytosolic B-Raf activity essentially mirrored P100-associated Raf activity, whereas cytosolic Raf-1 was not activated during mitosis, but was activated in G1 (Fig. 1H). The levels of P100 Raf-1 and B-Raf proteins were constant throughout S and G2(up to 8 h), fell during mitosis (at 9–12 h), and then increased again during G1 (at 15–18 h). The levels of cytosolic Raf-1 and B-Raf were constant (Fig. 1H). MEK activation was assayed with phospho-specific antisera that recognize activated MEK1 and MEK2 (pMEK). Two peaks of pMEK were observed. The first peak occurred in late G2/early mitosis and was entirely confined to the P100 membrane fraction (Fig. 1,E and I). The second, smaller peak occurred in G1 phase (14–18 h), but was entirely confined to the S100 fraction. Both peaks of MEK activation corresponded with peaks of Raf activity (Fig. 1, D and E). The levels of membrane-associated MEK1 and, to a lesser extent, MEK2 decreased during mitosis (10–12 h), but cytosolic MEK levels remained constant (Fig.1I). The activation of ERK was assayed in the same fractions using activation- and phospho-specific antisera (pERK). The level of pERK dramatically decreased in both P100 and S100 fractions during mitosis, but rapidly recovered during G1 progression (Fig. 1, F and J). The levels of ERK1 and ERK2 did not change throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1J). Immunofluorescent staining for pMEK revealed strong staining of mitotic cells (Fig. 2). This mitotic pMEK staining pattern was observed in both asynchronously growing and synchronized cultures, thus was not an artifact of the synchrony protocol. The staining was dispersed throughout the cells, although weak accumulation at the spindle poles was observed in some cells (data not shown), as reported previously (11Shapiro P.S. Vaisberg E. Hunt A.J. Tolwinski N.S. Whalen A.M. McIntosh J.R. Ahn N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Interphase cells had low levels of phospho-MEK staining. Therefore, these results support the results from pMEK immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, E andI). The very high level of membrane-bound pMEK in mitotic cells surprisingly correlated with a loss of active ERK, whereas by contrast, ERK was strongly activated in G1 in response to the more modest peak of MEK activity (Fig. 1, E andF). This observation strongly suggested that the coupling between MEK and ERK activation was lost in mitosis. To establish whether this loss of coupling was a direct consequence of entry into mitosis, synchronized HeLa cells were arrested in late G2phase by treatment with Compound 5, an inhibitor of the Cdc2 activator Cdc25 (20Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar), or with roscovitine, a direct inhibitor of Cdc2 (21Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions of these G2-arrested cells were compared with untreated mitotic shake-off HeLa populations by immunoblotting for pMEK and pERK using ERK2 as a protein input control. Both Cdc2 inhibitor-treated samples had reduced pMEK levels relative to normal mitotic cells, but pERK levels in the drug-treated cells were substantially higher than those in normal mitotic cells, which had barely detectable levels of pERK (Fig.3A). This result suggests that a mitotic factor either blocks access of activated MEK to ERK or directly modifies activated MEK so that it is unable to activate ERK. To differentiate between these possibilities, the activity of membrane-associated MEK was assayed in an in vitro coupled ERK1 kinase assay. Membrane-associated pMEK from roscovitine-treated G2-arrested cells had a 10-fold higher specific activity than pMEK from control mitotic cell populations (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that activated MEK is directly modified as cells enter mitosis to inhibit its ability to activate ERK. Earlier studies that examined MEK activity in mitosis (10Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) did not detect the dramatic MEK activation shown in Fig.1I, but these studies analyzed only detergent lysates of mitotic cells. We therefore tested the detergent solubility of P100-associated pMEK. P100 fractions prepared from mitotic HeLa cells were solubilized in 17 Nonidet P-40, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were immunoblotted for pMEK, MEK1, and MEK2. pMEK was insoluble in 17 Nonidet P-40, whereas MEK1 was highly soluble, and MEK2 had low solubility (Fig.4A). To determine which MEK isoform was activated during mitosis, the Nonidet P-40-insoluble P100 fraction of mitotic HeLa cells was electrophoresed on high resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then immunoblotted for pMEK with antibodies raised against the N and C termini of MEK1 (anti-MEK1N and anti-MEK1C antibodies) and MEK2 (anti-MEK2N and anti-MEK2C antibodies). The phosphorylated form of MEK migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼37 kDa. Anti-MEK1C antibody detected three bands, a 44-kDa band corresponding to unmodified MEK1 and cytosolic pMEK and two more rapidly migrating bands, the most abundant of which comigrated with the 37-kDa band detected by anti-pMEK antibody (Fig. 4B). Anti-MEK1N, anti-MEK2N, and anti-MEK2C antibodies did not detect a 37-kDa band. To confirm that the 37-kDa band detected by anti-pMEK antibody was indeed MEK1, the mitotic P100 fraction was resolved by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted for pMEK and for MEK1 and MEK2 with an antibody that detects both MEK isoforms (anti-MEK1/2 antibody). pMEK exactly comigrated with the minor species detected by anti-MEK1/2 antibody, confirming the identity of the species as a truncated form of pMEK1 (Fig. 4C). To determine the timing of MEK1 cleavage, the Nonidet P-40-insoluble P100 fraction from the experiment shown in Fig. 1I was run on high resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with anti-MEK1C antibody. Full-length 44-kDa MEK1 was the major species in S and G2, but 37-kDa MEK1 increased in late G2 to become the major form in mitosis (Fig.5A). As cells exited mitosis and entered G1, the shorter form was lost, and the full-length 44-kDa form of MEK1 reappeared. This suggested that MEK1 was cleaved during mitosis and that the cleaved protein was stable only during mitosis. To confirm that MEK1 cleavage was a mitosis-specific event, synchronized HeLa cells were allowed to progress into mitosis or were arrested in G2 by addition of the Cdc2 inhibitor roscovitine. P100 fractions from these cells were then immunoblotted with anti-pMEK, anti-MEK1C, and anti-MEK1N antibodies. Blocking cyclin B-Cdc2 activity and entry into mitosis reduced MEK activation and MEK1 cleavage (Fig. 5B), confirming that MEK1 cleavage is a mitosis-specific event that is dependent on cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase activity. The detection of mitotic pMEK1 with only anti-MEK1C and anti-MEK1/2 antibodies suggested that the faster migrating species was the result of proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal region of MEK1. The apparent size difference between full-length 44-kDa MEK1 and mitotic pMEK1 was 5–7 kDa, indicating that the cleavage occurred in the region of residues 40–60. This was investigated using a MEK1 internal deletion mutant with residues 32–51 removed (MEK1Δ32–51). HeLa cells were transfected with HA-tagged versions of wild-type MEK1 and MEK1Δ32–51 and either untreated or arrested in mitosis with nocodazole, which produced essentially identical accumulation of the faster migrating pMEK species observed in normal mitotic samples. S100 and P100 fractions were prepared and immunoblotted for the HA-tagged proteins. The level of HA-tagged wild-type MEK1 in the P100 fraction from mitotic cells was reduced compared with the untreated asynchronously growing culture (Fig.6A). This paralleled the reduction in MEK1 detected with anti-MEK1N antibody in normal mitotic P100 fractions (Fig. 5B). There was little change in the level of HA-tagged MEK1Δ32–51 in the P100 fractions from asynchronous and nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells (Fig.6A). The levels of these proteins were constant in the S100 fractions from asynchronous and mitotic cells. The insensitivity of the MEK1Δ32–51 constructs to N-terminal cleavage suggested either that the deleted residues 32–51 contain the proteolytic cleavage site or that the tertiary structure of the deleted protein masks the cleavage site. To discriminate between these possibilities, the N-terminal 51 residues of MEK1 were replaced with either an HA tag (HA-MEK1ΔN51) or GFP (GFP-MEK1ΔN51). Immunoblotting of the P100 fraction prepared from mitotic cells expressing GFP-MEK1ΔN51 revealed the presence of the full-length chimera, detected by both anti-MEK1C and anti-GFP antibodies, and an abundant 37-kDa MEK1 protein, detected only by anti-MEK1C antibody and corresponding to MEK1ΔN51 cle"

The bicyclic endoperoxide prostaglandin G2(PGG2)1 is formed from the oxidation of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX enzymes).

Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In theory, four types of bicyclic endoperoxides can be generated, depending upon the initial radical abstraction of the possible bisallylic hydrogens at C-7, C-10, or C-13 of the arachidonate (SchemeFS1). Isoprostanes are formed from the reduction of intermediate bicyclic endoperoxides enzymatically or by chemical means. A total of 64 stereoisomers of isoprostanes can be generated from the oxidation of arachidonate. The measurement of these isoprostanes has been employed as a reliable index for oxidative stress (10Morrow J.D. Roberts Jr., L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 300: 3-12Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 11Roberts Jr., L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol.

The enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase enzymes generates optical pure bicyclic endoperoxides, whereas the uncontrolled free radical oxidation process leading to the isoprostanes produces racemic mixtures. Furthermore, a variety of other highly oxidized products, such as monocyclic peroxides, serial cyclic peroxides, and a novel compound having a bicyclic endoperoxide moiety and a cyclic peroxide structure are detected from the non-enzymatic reactions (9Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,13Yin H.

Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The oxidation products of pure hydroperoxides of cholesteryl arachidonate have also been characterized by MS techniques. For example, the 11-HpETE hydroperoxide leads specifically to Type IV isoprostanes, and the stereochemistry of the type IV bicyclic endoperoxides generated from the cholesteryl ester 11-HpETE (Ch-11-HpETE) was extensively studied (9Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Eight possible diastereoisomers were detected by the use of a GC-MS technique by comparison of products with known synthetic standards. Ch-15-HpETE also gives rise to Type IV isoprostanes, and a free radical mechanism based on औ-fragmentation of the 15-peroxyl radical was proposed to explain the experimental facts (SchemeFS2a) (14Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; : 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The key step in these transformations lies in the औ-fragmentation of the 15-peroxyl radical to generate a pentadienyl radical followed by an O2re-addition at C-11 to give rise to the 11-peroxyl radical, which then undergoes subsequent cyclization to generate the bicyclic endoperoxides. A mechanism for prostaglandin biosynthesis starting from a 15-HpETE peroxyl radical was proposed by Corey and Wang (16Corey E.J. Wang Z. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 539-544Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) based on the formation of a “dioxetane” intermediate. In this mechanism, the 15-peroxyl radical undergoes 4-exo cyclization to give a dioxetane intermediate as shown in Scheme FS2b. This mechanism has been proposed by Rokach et al. (2Rokach J.

Sci. 1996; 21: 439-503Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as an alternative to explain the formation of regioisomeric bicyclic endoperoxides from an arachidonyl-containing lipid. The conversion of qinghao (artemisinic) acid, an antimalarial compound extracted from a Chinese plant, to dehydroqinghaosu (artemisitene) was initially proposed to occur via the 4-exo cyclization of an allylic peroxyl radical to form a dioxetane intermediate (22Avery M.A. Chong W.K.M. Detre G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 1799-1802Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Haynes R.K. Vonwiller S.C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; 6: 449-451Crossref Google Scholar, 24Haynes R.K.

Later studies suggested that this transformation was better explained by oxidation of an intermediate enol under the reaction of copper (II) trifluoromethanesulfonate (25Vonwiller S.C. Warner J.A. Mann S.T. Haynes R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11098-11105Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The formation of 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) from hydroperoxides of linoleic acid was first proposed to occur via a dioxetane intermediate (26Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Schauer R.J. Vigo-Pelfrey C.

But little experimental evidence has been presented that either supports or denies the dioxetane mechanism of HNE formation (32Timmins G.S. Santos R.E. Whitewood A.C. Catalani L.H. Mascio P.D.

If optically pure starting material, Ch-15-HpETE, is subjected to autoxidation, औ-fragmentation of the intermediate 15-peroxyl radical and re-addition of oxygen gives a racemic C-11 peroxyl radical that will lead to a mixture of isoprostane diastereomers, all of which will be racemic. If the dioxetane mechanism operates, a mixture of optically pure isoprostane diastereomers is anticipated. Our results favor the औ-fragmentation mechanism shown in Scheme FS2a.

Benzene was distilled from sodium and stored over 4-A molecular sieves.

PGF2α and PGF2α-d4 standards were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Reactions involving hydroperoxides were visualized by TLC using a stain of 1.5 g ofN,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, 25 ml H2O/125 ml MeOH, and 1 ml acetic acid. Hydroperoxides yield an immediate pink color, whereas protected hydroperoxides exhibit a pink color after mild charring. General TLC staining was accomplished by iodine or the use of a phosphomolybdic acid stain prepared as a 207 (w/v) solution in EtOH. In general, hydroperoxides were stored as dilute solutions with one mole percent butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in either hexanes or benzene at −78 °C and were never exposed to temperatures >40 °C. Flash column chromatography was performed using 35–70 ॖm of silica gel. Thin layer chromatography was performed using a 0.2-mm thick layer of silica gel-coated aluminum (60 F254, EM Industries), and TLC plates were analyzed using UV light (254 nm) with a Mineralight UVSL-25 hand lamp. Preparative TLC was performed on silica gel 60ALK6D plates (Whatman). Analytical HPLC was carried out using a Waters Model 600E pump with a Waters 996 Photodiode array detector. Millenium32 chromatography software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was used to control the 996 detector and collect and process data. Cyclic peroxide analysis by analytical HPLC utilized a single Beckman Ultrasphere 5-ॖm (4.6 mm × 25 cm) silica column. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used for analytical normal phase HPLC. Preparative HPLC was performed using a Dynamax-60 Å 8 ॖm (83–121-C) silica column (21.4 mm × 25 cm) with a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Narrowbore HPLC for MS analysis used a single Beckman Ultrasphere 5-ॖm (2.0 mm × 25 cm) silica column for analysis of cyclic peroxides and two Beckman Ultrasphere 5 ॖm (2.0 mm × 25 cm) silica columns for acyclic hydroperoxide analysis. Coordination ion spray mass spectrometry (CIS-MS) was accomplished using a Finnigan TSQ-7000 (San Jose, CA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive ion mode equipped with a standard API-1 electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The source was outfitted with a 100-ॖm deactivated fused silica capillary. Data acquisition and evaluation were conducted on ICIS EXECUTIVE INST, version 8.3.2, and TSQ 7000 software INST, version 8.3. Data collected for selected reaction monitoring (SRM) experiments was also processed using Xcalibur, version 1 (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Nitrogen gas served both as sheath gas and auxiliary gas; argon served as the collision gas. The electrospray needle was maintained at 4.6 kV, and the heated capillary temperature was 200 °C. The tube lens potential and capillary voltage were optimized to maximize ion current for electrospray, with the optimal determined to be 80V and 20V, respectively, for cholesteryl ester analysis. Positive ions were detected scanning from 100–1000 atomic mass units with a scan duration of 1 s. Profile data was recorded for 1 min and averaged for analysis. For collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments, the collision gas pressure was set from 2.30 to 2.56 millitorr. To obtain fragmentation information of each compound, the dependence of offset voltage and relative ion current was studied. The collision energy offset was varied from 10 to 40 eV depending on the compound being analyzed. Samples were introduced either by direct liquid infusion or by HPLC. For direct liquid injection, stock solutions of the lipids (100 ng/ॖl in 17 IPA in hexane) were prepared and mixed 1:1 with silver tetrafluoroborate (51.4 ng/ॖl in IPA). Samples were introduced to the ESI source by syringe pump at a rate of 10 ॖl/min. For HPLC sample introduction a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC system was used. The auxiliary gas flow rate to the ESI interface was increased to between 5 and 10 units to assist in desolvation of the samples. For cholesteryl arachidonate hydroperoxide analysis, normal phase HPLC sample introduction was carried out using two tandem Beckman Ultrasphere narrowbore 5-ॖm silica columns (2.0 mm × 25 cm) operated in isocratic mode with 0.357 isopropanol in hexanes. For analysis of cyclic peroxide mixtures, sample introduction was carried out using a single Beckman Ultrasphere narrowbore 5-ॖm silica column (2.0 mm × 25 cm) operated in isocratic mode with 1.07 isopropanol in hexanes. The flow rate for both modes of chromatography was 150 ॖl/min. Column effluent was passed through an Applied Biosystems 785A Programmable Absorbance UV detector with detection at 234 nm. An Upchurch high pressure mixing tee was connected next in series for the post column addition of the silver salts. The silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF4) solution (0.25 mm in isopropanol) was added via a Harvard Apparatus (Cambridge, MA) syringe pump at a flow rate of 75 ॖl/min. A long section of PEEK tubing (1.04 m, 0.25-mm internal diameter) allowed time for the complexation of the silver to the lipid while delivering effluent to the mass spectrometer. A Rheodyne 7725 injector was fitted with a 100-ॖl PEEK loop for 20–50-ॖl sample injections. LC-APCI ECNI-MS was performed on the same instrument TSQ-7000 using an APCI ion source. The mass spectrometers operating conditions were as follows: vaporizer temperature, 475 °C; heated capillary, 300 °C; and the corona discharge needle was set at 16 ॖA (36Singh G. Gutierrez A. Xu K. Blair I.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The pressure of sheath gas and auxiliary gas was optimized for maximal response. For full scan and SRM analyses, unit resolution was maintained for both parent and daughter ions. GC-NICI MS was performed using a Hewlett-Packard HP5989A GC-MS instrument interfaced with an IBM Pentium II computer system. GC was performed using a 30 m, 0.25-mm diameter, 0.25-ॖm-film thickness, DB-WAX column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) or 15 m, 0.25-mm diameter, 0.25-ॖm film thickness, DB 1701 fused silica capillary column (Fison, Folsom, CA). The column temperature was programmed from 190 to 260 °C at 10 °C/min. Methane was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Ion source temperature was 250 °C, electron energy was 70 eV, and filament current was 0.25 mA. Lipid autoxidations were performed at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C, and temperature was controlled using an I2R Thermo-watch ML6–1000SS. Ch-15(S)-HpETE made by a chemo-enzymatic method was converted to more highly oxidized peroxides according to the literature (14Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The product oxidation mixture was obtained by incubation of Ch-15-HpETE under free radical conditions using DTBN as an initiator. A typical oxidation experiment was carried out as follows. Approximately 10 mg of Ch-15-HpETE was mixed with 107 (molar) of DTBN in 1 ml of anhydrous benzene. The mixture was stirred at 37 °C under an air atmosphere for 24 h. The oxidized mixture was diluted in benzene and stored at −78 °C with butylated hydroxytoluene. An aliquot of the mixture was analyzed by normal phase HPLC using 1.07 IPA in hexanes. To 100 ॖl of the oxidation mixture was added 10 ng of PGF2α-d4 as internal standard. An excess amount of PPh3 or SnCl2 was added to the mixture. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in 200 ॖl of ethanol, and to the solution was added 200 ॖl of 8 m aqueous KOH solution. After stirring at 40 °C for an hour, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 3 by adding dilute HCl. The aqueous solution was extracted by ethyl acetate three times. The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in 20 ॖl of CH3CN. To the resulting solution was added 20 ॖl of 107 (v/v) pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and 10 ॖl of 107 (v/v)N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile, and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min. The reagent was dried under nitrogen, and the residue was subjected to TLC separation using the solvent ethyl acetate/methanol (98:2; v/v). Approximately 5 ॖg of the pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) ester of PGF2α was applied on a separate lane and visualized by spraying with a 107 solution of phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol followed by heating. Compounds migrating in the region of the PFB ester of PGF2α (Rf = 0.4) and the adjacent area 2 cm above and below were scraped and extracted from the silica gel by ethyl acetate. The PFB esters were also separated by normal phase HPLC using dual silica columns. The solvent used for this purpose is 127 IPA in hexanes. The chiral LC-APCI-MS experiments were conducted using a Chiralpak AD column (25 × 0.46 cm, Chiral Technologies, Exton, PA) and 87 IPA in hexanes. After evaporation of the ethyl acetate, 20 ॖl of BSTFA and 10 ॖl of dimethylformamide were added to the residue, and the mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 20 min. The reagents were dried under nitrogen, and the derivatives were dissolved in 10 ॖl of dry undecane for analysis of GC-MS. The optically pure Ch-15(S)-HpETE was synthesized by a chemo-enzymatic route as described previously (14Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The optical purity (enantiomeric excess) value of the hydroperoxide was determined by chiral HPLC method developed by Brash and co-workers (37Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, Ch-15(S)-HpETE used in these studies was reduced by PPh3 to the corresponding alcohol (Ch-15(S)-HETE), which was converted to the methyl ester by reaction with NaOMe. HPLC analysis of methyl-15(S)-HETE prepared in this way by the use of a Chiralpak AD column showed that the Ch-15(S)-HpETE had 98.97 enantiomeric excess (Fig.1). Ch-15(S)-HpETE was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under oxygen using DTBN as a radical initiator. The product mixture resulting from this incubation was analyzed by LC-MS using the silver ion coordination MS technique (Ag+ CIS-MS) technique described previously (14Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to bicyclic endoperoxides, monocyclic and serial cyclic peroxides were also observed in this mixture. SRM results of such an analysis are illustrated in Fig.2. The SRM experiments were carried out by selection of a specific parent ion, fragmentation of that ion, and detection of fragments characteristic of a particular structure.Panel a of Fig. 2 shows the UV absorption of the oxidation mixture at 234 nm, a wavelength characteristic of the conjugated diene chromophore. Panel b shows the SRM chromatogram for Ch-15-HPETE, the starting material, whereas detection of Ch-11-t,t-HpETE is shown in panel c. 2The fragments detected are the result of Hock fragmentation as described in Ref. 13Yin H. Analysis of Autoxidation Products of Cholesterol Esters by Mass Spectrometry.Ph.D. thesis. Vanderbilt University, 2002Google Scholar; the assignment of structure to Ch-11-t, t-HPETE is tentative. Formation of Ch-11-t,t-HpETE is consistent with औ-fragmentation of the 15-peroxyl radical and re-addition of oxygen at C-11 as shown in Scheme FS2. An SRM chromatogram of bicyclic endoperoxides is shown in panel d, whereas monocyclic and serial cyclic peroxides are shown in panels eand f, respectively. 3The fragments detected are the result of Hock fragmentation as described in Ref. 13Yin H. Analysis of Autoxidation Products of Cholesterol Esters by Mass Spectrometry.Ph.D. thesis. Vanderbilt University, 2002Google Scholar. An aliquot of the crude reaction mixture from above was derivatized by reduction of PPh3 or SnCl2, followed by basic hydrolysis and conversion to the PFB ester. After conversion of any free OH groups to TMS derivatives, the mixture was analyzed by GC-ECNICI-MS using a DB-WAX GC column (38Thomas M.J. Chen Q. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Rudel L.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This analysis, illustrated in Fig. 3, revealed that all eight possible isoprostane diastereoisomers were present in the reaction mixture. The significant peaks shown in Fig. 3 were assigned by spiking the mixture with independently synthesized standards. The diastereoisomers with cis dioxolane side chains were formed preferentially over those with trans side chains (9Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ratio of PGF2α (peak 6) and 12-epi PGF2α(peak 8) is 1:3, which is consistent with the previous observations (16Corey E.J. Wang Z. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 539-544Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The crude reaction mixture derived from Ch-15(S)-HpETE was reduced by SnCl2, the extracted organic phase was subjected to basic hydrolysis, and the product acids were converted to their PFB esters. After separation by TLC with a solvent mixture of 98:2 (ethyl acetate/methanol), isoprostane PFB esters was further separated into isomerically pure fractions by normal phase HPLC using tandem analytical silica gel columns with 127 isopropanol in hexane. SnCl2 was used to reduce the bicyclic endoperoxides because the product of PPh3 reaction, triphenyl phosphine oxide, elutes in the middle of the diastereoisomers of isoprostanes under the HPLC conditions used. A portion of each purified isoprostane PFB ester was converted to its TMS derivative for GC-ECNICI-MS analysis, which confirmed the isomeric purity and identity of each. The remainder of each PFB isoprostane fraction (not converted to the TMS) was analyzed by LC-APCI-MS using a chiral HPLC column. APCI-MS was employed to analyze the PFB esters of the isoprostanes because of its excellent sensitivity and selectivity of this method (36Singh G. Gutierrez A. Xu K. Blair I.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A summary of the analysis protocol for the Ch-15(S)-HpETE product mixture is presented in Scheme FS3. The PFB esters of PGF2α are analyzed in the negative mode on a triquadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an APCI ionization source. The Q1 scan experiment is carried out by scanning the ions in the first quadrupole. CID is run by selecting a particular parent ion (for example, m/z 353) in the first quadrupole and fragmenting it in the second by collision with argon. The resulting ions are scanned in the third quadrupole. A Q1 scan and CID spectra of the parent ion m/z 353 of the PFB ester of PGF2α are shown in Fig.4. The CID fragments are essentially the same as those obtained from PGF2α using negative ion ESI-MS, and the fragment of m/z 193 is unique for Type IV isoprostanes (39Murphy R.C. Fiedler J. Hevko J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 479-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The four major isoprostane PFB ester stereoisomers, isolated as shown in Scheme FS3, were analyzed by chiral HPLC/MS. SRM experiments were carried out by monitoring the characteristic fragmentation pathways from m/z 353 to 193, 309, and 247, respectively. Monitoring of the three fragmentation reactions gave essentially the same chromatographic results. Only the m/z 353 to 193 SRM chromatogram is shown in Fig.5. The SRM chromatograms in Fig. 5, a (8,15-di-epi PGF2α) and b (12-epi PGF2α), showed that both of these isoprostanes are formed as a racemic mixture. The absolute configuration of the enantiomers was assigned by comparison with independently synthesized standards, as shown in Fig.5. The enantiomers of 8-epi PGF2α and 12,15-di-epi PGF2α, all of which are available by chemical synthesis, do not separate on a Chiralpak AD, OD, or OJ column. The results presented here provide evidence that suggests that the dioxetane mechanism for isoprostane formation does not operate. This mechanism, which is based upon a proposal for prostaglandin biosynthesis and is shown in Scheme FS2b, has been suggested as one of two possible mechanisms for isoprostane formation. In the dioxetane mechanism, the stereogenic center at C-15 of the substrate is carried through the sequence unchanged and, consequently, the isoprostane formed should be optically pure given an optically pure starting material. The औ-fragmentation mechanism shown in Scheme FS2a requires, in contrast to the dioxetane mechanism, that a racemic mixture of isoprostanes is produced from the reaction of optically pure Ch-15(S)-HpETE. The stereogenic center is lost in the औ-fragmentation step of the C-15 peroxyl radical, and one anticipates equal amounts of both enantiomers upon addition of oxygen at C-11 and the formation of the new stereogenic center. The chiral LC-APCI-ECNI-MS results shown in Fig. 5 are thus entirely consistent with the औ-fragmentation mechanism. An optically pure hydroperoxide precursor gives rise to racemic isoprostane products (40O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 4We note that substantial racemization of starting hydroperoxides recovered from similar reactions was observed by O'Connor et al. (40O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), consistent with peroxyl radical-fragmentation. We note that the 4-exo peroxyl radical cyclization required in the dioxetane mechanism is energetically disfavored, and there is a decided lack of evidence in the literature to support such a reaction (26Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Schauer R.J. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Membrane Lipid Oxidation. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 239-268Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dioxetane mechanism does not account for the formation of other highly oxidized cyclic peroxides such as the monocyclic and serial cyclic peroxides shown in Fig. 2. The formation of these compounds is entirely consistent with the fragmentation reaction (Scheme FS2) (13Yin H. Analysis of Autoxidation Products of Cholesterol Esters by Mass Spectrometry.Ph.D. thesis. Vanderbilt University, 2002Google Scholar). The two mechanisms predict different regioisomeric products starting from different HpETEs as shown in SchemeFS4. Bicyclic endoperoxides from 11- or 9-HPETEs cannot be formed based on the dioxetane mechanism, whereas the औ-fragmentation mechanism predicts essentially the same isoprostane products starting from either the 15- or 11-HpETEs. This was previously confirmed in our experiments with regioisomeric HpETEs (13Yin H. Analysis of Autoxidation Products of Cholesterol Esters by Mass Spectrometry.Ph.D. thesis. Vanderbilt University, 2002Google Scholar). For example, identical isoprostane products were observed starting from either Ch-15-HpETE or Ch-11-HpETE, although the distribution of those products is somewhat dependent on the starting compound (9Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The observation that racemic isoprostanes are formed from optically active HpETE precursors is of potential biological importance because it is predicted that different isoprostane enantiomers possess different biological activities (10Morrow J.D. Roberts Jr., L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 300: 3-12Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 11Roberts Jr., L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 12Roberts Jr., L.J. Morrow J.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 808-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, these findings suggest that optically pure HpETEs generated by the lipoxygenase family of enzymes can undergo cyclization resulting in the formation of racemic isoprostane products. This is likely relevant to the formation of isoprostanes in vivo, because deletion of the 12/15-lipoxygenase gene in genetically altered mice reduces isoprostane levels significantly (41Pratico C.T. Zhao L. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Funk C.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In summary, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of bicyclic endoperoxides from 15-HpETE. In the first mechanism, औ-fragmentation of the 15-peroxyl radical generates a pentadienyl radical. O2 addition to the pentadienyl at C-11 and subsequent 5-exo cyclization gives rise to the PGG2-like products. In the second mechanism,4-exo cyclization of the 15-peroxyl radical generates a dioxetane intermediate, which proceeds on to isoprostane products. These two mechanisms have been extended to explain the formation of other regioisomeric endoperoxides from the free radical-induced oxidation of other arachidonate-containing lipids as well. The results of chiral analysis of the isoprostane products formed from an optically pure precursor, support the औ-fragmentation mechanism. This mechanism is also consistent with other observations, such as the formation of highly oxidized cyclic peroxides.

Initially, nine individual 2B1 active-site residues were changed to the corresponding 2C5 residues, and the mutants were purified from an Escherichia coli expression system and assayed for progesterone hydroxylation. At 150 ॖm progesterone, I114A, F297G, and V363L showed 5–157 of the 21-hydroxylase activity of 2C5, whereas F206V showed high activity for an unknown product and a 13-fold decrease in Km. Therefore, a quadruple mutant, I114A/F206V/F297G/V363L (Q), was constructed that showed 607 of 2C5 progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity and 577 regioselectivity. Based on their 2C5-like testosterone hydroxylation profiles, S294D and I477F alone and in combination were added to the quadruple mutant. All three mutants showed enhanced regioselectivity (707) for progesterone 21-hydroxylation, whereas only Q/I477F had a higherkcat. Finally, the remaining three single mutants, V103I, V367L, and G478V, were added to Q/I477F and Q/S294D/I477F, yielding seven additional multiple mutants. Among these, Q/V103I/S294D/I477F showed the highest kcat(3-fold higher than that of 2C5) and 807 regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation. Docking of progesterone into a three-dimensional model of this mutant indicated that 21-hydroxylation is favored. In conclusion, a systematic approach to convert P450 regioselectivity across subfamilies suggests that active-site residues are mainly responsible for regioselectivity differences between 2B1 and 2C5 and validates the reliability of 2B1 models based on the crystal structure of 2C5.

However, most P450 structures reveal that the heme group is buried deep within the protein matrix, indicating that residues outside of the active site may also be required to guide the substrate into the heme pocket by recognizing substrates at the protein surface and/or comprising part of a substrate access channel (4Haseman C.A.

The role of SRS and non-SRS residues in differential substrate specificity and stereo- and regioselectivity within P450 subfamilies has been studied thoroughly, especially in the case of P450 2A, 2B, and 2C enzymes. In most cases, the functions of the enzymes could be interconverted by making multiple reciprocal substitutions at SRS residues (7He Y.Q. Szklarz G.D. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem.

These non-SRS residues were predicted to be part of a substrate access channel near a region between the F and G helices, as seen in bacterial P450 101, or between the B-C loop and N terminus of the I helix, as seen in bacterial P450 51 (18Poulos T.L.

Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies across P450 subfamilies have been largely neglected until very recently (21Luo Z. He Y.A. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Spatzenegger M. Liu H. Wang Q. Debarber A. Koop D.R. Halpert J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Renewed interest in this area was sparked by the considerable effort in a number of laboratories to use the P450 2C5 structure to model other mammalian P450 enzymes and to predict their substrate specificities and stereo- and regioselectivity (2Domanski T.L. Halpert J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Afzelius L. Zamora I. Ridderström M. Andersson T.B. Karlén A. Masimirembwa C.M. Mol.

An implicit assumption in all such models based on a single template is that the backbones of the enzymes are essentially invariant and that active-site differences alone are responsible for specificity differences. In this study, we sought to confer the progesterone hydroxylation specificity of 2C5 on 2B1. 2B1 is a highKm progesterone 16α-hydroxylase, whereas 2C5 is a low Km progesterone 21-hydroxylase (26Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 2B1 was used as a model enzyme because of extensive previous site-directed mutagenesis studies that have verified experimentally all 13 active-site residues inferred from the 2C5 structure (2Domanski T.L.

Through a systematic approach of site-directed mutagenesis, a 2B1 enzyme (V103I/I114A/F206V/S294D/F297G/V363L/I477F) was constructed that showed a 3-fold higher kcat compared with 2C5 and 807 regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation. The results suggest a dominant role of active-site side chains in determining regioselectivity differences across these two P450 subfamilies and extend previous evidence for the reliability of 2B models based on the 2C5 structure (24Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from the University of Texas Medical Branch Molecular Biology Core Laboratory. [4-14C]Progesterone and [4-14C]testosterone were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Amersham Biosciences), respectively. All other chemicals were purchased from sources previously described (33Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or from standard suppliers. Rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochromeb5 were prepared as described (34Harlow G.R. He Y.A. Halpert J.R Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The truncated version of 2B1 that served as the background for all mutations described in this study, 2B1dH, was generated using overlap extension PCR as described (33Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutants were constructed either by overlap extension PCR or by subcloning using pKK2B1dH as a template. The primers and templates used are shown in Fig. 1. Primary forward and reverse primers were as previously described (33Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To confirm the desired mutation and to verify the absence of unintended mutations, all constructs were sequenced at the University of Texas Medical Branch Protein Chemistry Laboratory. 2B1dH and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli TOPP3 (Stratagene) and purified as described (33Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In brief, bacteria were grown in Terrific Broth salts for ∼2.5 h at 37 °C before induction using isopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactopyranoside and supplementation with the heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid. After 72 h at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and protein was extracted from lysed membranes using potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Protein extract was loaded onto a Ni2+affinity column, which was washed with 20 volumes of buffer, and then eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Cytochrome P450 was quantitated using the reduced CO difference spectrum (35Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific content was determined using the Pierce BCA kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The specific content for 2B1dH was 18 nmol of P450/mg of protein, whereas the specific content for most of the mutants was between 8 and 16. However, the I114A/F206V/S294D/F297G/V363L, I114A/F206V/S294D/F297G/V363L/I477F, and V103I/I114A/F206V/S294D/F297G/V363L/I477F multiple mutants had specific contents of 4, 5, and 2 nmol, respectively. Low specific content in these mutants is accounted for by the presence of significant amounts of P420. Progesterone and testosterone hydroxylation assays were carried out essentially as described (33Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Ciaccio P.J. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 284-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using a 1:4:2 molar ratio of P450/cytochrome P450 reductase/cytochromeb5 in the absence of lipid. 16α- and 15α-hydroxyprogesterone were not resolved. However, the progesterone 16α-hydroxylase activity of 2B1 has been measured previously using two-dimensional chromatography (21Luo Z. He Y.A. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Km andkcat values were determined by regression analysis using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). A molecular model of P450 2B1 was constructed using the InsightII software package (Homology, Discover_3, Biopolymer, Builder, and Docking from Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) and P450 2C5 as the template as described previously (24Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the 2B1 mutant (V103I/I114A/F206V/S294D/F297G/V363L/I477F), the coordinates of the corresponding residues were changed in the 2B1 three-dimensional model by Biopolymer, and the resulting 2B1 mutant was minimized. The structure of progesterone was constructed using the Builder module. The parameters for heme and ferryl oxygen were those described by Paulsen and Ornstein (37Paulsen M.D. Ornstein R.L. Proteins. 1991; 11: 184-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Paulsen M.D. Ornstein R.L. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During the docking calculations, the system energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with the Discover_3 program using the consistent valence force field with a non-bond cutoff of 10 Å to a maximum gradient of 5 kcal mol−1 Å−1. Progesterone was automatically docked into the three-dimensional models of 2B1 and V103I/I114A/F206V/S294D/F297G/V363L/I477F in a reactive binding orientation with the Docking module of InsightII, leading to 16α- or 21-hydroxylation. Because the initial oxidation step involves hydrogen abstraction, the C-16 or C-21 atom was placed 3.7 Å from ferryl oxygen, with the 16α-hydrogen or one of the hydrogen atoms bonded to C-21 directed toward ferryl oxygen (C-H-ferryl oxygen angle of 180°) to promote hydrogen bond formation. During the subsequent energy minimization process, the substrate molecule, along with the side chains of protein residues within 5 Å of the substrate, was allowed to move. The non-bond interaction energies were evaluated with the Docking module of InsightII, and the lowest energy orientation obtained after molecular mechanics minimization of 2B1 and its mutant is shown in Fig.6. 2B1dH single mutants were constructed at the nine active-site positions where 2B1 and 2C5 differ and tested for oxidation of progesterone. Consistent with previous findings, 2B1dH had negligible progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity, but significant progesterone 16α-hydroxylase activity (>2 min−1) at 150 ॖm progesterone (Fig.2), which was the highest substrate concentration obtainable under our conditions. However, the 2B1dH single mutants I114A, F297G, and V363L had 5–157 of 2C5dH progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity. With regard to progesterone 16α- and 15α-hydroxylation, the I114A mutant showed enhanced activity, whereas F297G and V363L showed decreased activity (Fig. 2). Although V363L demonstrated lower activity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation compared with I114A, it showed high regioselectivity for this reaction (>707). The F206V substitution yielded relatively high activity (6 min−1) and >957 regioselectivity for an unknown product (Fig. 2). The progesterone hydroxylation profile of V103I was similar to that of 2B1dH, whereas S294D, V367L, I477F, and G478V showed negligible progesterone hydroxylase activity. As shown in TableI, the Km for progesterone of 2B1dH was determined to be 200 ॖm. Mutants I114A and F297G showed a 3-fold decrease inKm, whereas V363L showed a 2-fold decrease. Interestingly, a F206V substitution decreased the Kmby ∼13-fold. The kcat values for progesterone 21-hydroxylation by I114A, F297G, and V363L were in the range of 1–2 min−1versus 16 min−1 for 2C5dH (Table I).Table ISteady-state kinetics of 2B1dH single mutants for progesterone 16α+15α- and 21-hydroxylase and unknown activities2B1dH mutantsProgesterone 16α+15α-hydroxylaseProgesterone 21-hydroxylaseUnknownKmkcatKmkcatKmkcatॖmmin−1ॖmmin−1ॖmmin−12B1dH200 ± 508 ± 22C5dH8 ± 116 ± 2.0I114A44 ± 914 ± 167 ± 71.8 ± 0.1F206V15 ± 37 ± 1F297G59 ± 121.2 ± 0.1V363L116 ± 262.0 ± 0.2Results are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.

A number of multiple mutants were constructed by combining I114A, F297G, and V363L to test the additive effect on progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity. In addition, F206V was also added to assess whether this mutation decreases the Km. The progesterone hydroxylation profiles of the multiple mutants are presented in Fig. 3. As expected, I114A/F297G (Fig. 3, A bars) showed enhanced progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity compared with either single mutant. Addition of V363L to I114A/F297G increased the regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation, although activity was suppressed (Fig. 3,B bars versus A bars). Addition of F206V to I114A and I114A/V363L caused high activity for unknown products while suppressing progesterone 21- and 16α/15α-hydroxylase activities (Fig. 3, C and E bars). However, addition of F206V to I114/F297G did not suppress progesterone 21- and 16α/15α-hydroxylase activities (Fig. 3, D bars). Interestingly, addition of F206V to I114A/F297G/V363L enhanced activity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation and suppressed progesterone 16α- and 15α-hydroxylase activity, but still allowed significant production of unknown products (Fig. 3, F bars). Unlike 2B1dH, which produced only 16α-hydroxyprogesterone, and 2C5dH, which produced only 21-hydroxyprogesterone, the quadruple mutant I114A/F206V/F297G/V363L (Q) produced two major and two minor unknown products (Fig. 4). 21-Hydroxyprogesterone was determined to compose 577 of all the products in the quadruple mutant. I114A/F206V, I114A/F206V/F297F, and I114A/F206V/V363L had a decreased Km for progesteroneversus those mutants without Val206. TheKm for progesterone was unaltered in I114A/F297G and I114A/F297G/V363L compared with the individual single mutants (TableII), further suggesting the crucial role of F206V in enhancing the affinity for the substrate. Thekcat for the quadruple mutant was 607 of that for 2C5dH, and the Km was decreased by 3–4-fold compared with 2B1dH (Tables I and II). The 10-fold increase inkcat for progesterone 21-hydroxylation with no change in Km upon addition of F206V to I114A/F297G/V363L is striking and is different from other multiple mutants that include F206V.Figure 4Thin-layer chromatography of progesterone metabolites produced by 2B1dH, 2C5dH, and the 2B1dH quadruple mutant.

Testosterone hydroxylation profiles were determined for 2B1dH single mutants and compared with those of 2B1dH and 2C5dH. As reported above, 2B1dH produced equal amounts of 16α- and 16औ-hydroxytestosterone, whereas 2C5dH demonstrated mainly testosterone 16औ-hydroxylase activity (Fig.5). Of the nine single mutants tested, S294D, V363L, and I477F had decreased testosterone 16α-hydroxylase activity and enhanced 16औ-hydroxylase activity (similar to 2C5dH). The Km of 2C5dH for testosterone (TableIII) was similar to the reportedKm of 2B1dH (39Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the S294D and I477F single mutants demonstrated a 2-fold lower Km for testosterone. Interestingly, F206V showed decreased 16α- and 16औ-testosterone hydroxylase activities and a new testosterone 6α-hydroxylase activity. This profile of testosterone hydroxylation is similar to the progesterone hydroxylation profile in that F206V primarily showed activity for a new product (Figs. 2 and 5). On the other hand, V103I showed unaltered testosterone hydroxylation, and F297G, V367L, and G478V showed decreased testosterone 16α- and 16औ-hydroxylase activities. The similar testosterone hydroxylation profiles and affinities for substrate of 2C5dH, S294D, and I477F suggested that addition of S294D and/or I477F to the 2B1dH quadruple mutant might enhance progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity and/or regioselectivity.Table IIISteady-state kinetics and regioselectivity for testosterone 16औ-hydroxylase activity of 2B1dH, 2C5dH, and 2B1dH single mutantsEnzyme16औ-HydroxylaseKmkcatRegioselectivityॖmmin−172B1dH3-aThese data were taken from Ref. 39.29 ± 44 ± 1.050 ± 42C5dH31 ± 318 ± 0.590 ± 3S294D14 ± 36 ± 0.488 ± 4I477F17 ± 66 ± 1.078 ± 3Results are the means ± S.D. of two independent experiments.3-a These data were taken from Ref. 39Scott E.E.

Q/S294D, Q/I477F, and Q/S294D/I477F were examined for progesterone hydroxylation using 150 ॖmsubstrate (Table IV). Progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity was largely unaffected, whereas regioselectivity for Q/S294D, Q/S294D/I477F, and Q/I477F was increased to 73, 69, and 677, respectively, compared with 577 for the quadruple mutant. Steady-state kinetic parameters were also measured for these multiple mutants (Table IV). The kcat for Q/S294D and Q/S294D/I477F was similar to that for the quadruple mutant, but was increased for Q/I477F (similar to 2C5dH). However, theKm was either unaffected in the case of Q/S294D and Q/S294D/I477F or increased in the case of Q/I477F. These observations suggested that addition of S294D to the quadruple mutant increased regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation, whereas I477F enhanced the activity as well as the regioselectivity. Thekcat and regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation were much improved over those for the quadruple mutant and close to those for 2C5dH. To test further improvement of progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity and regioselectivity, the remaining three mutants (V103I, V367L, and G478V) were added to Q/I477F and Q/S294D/ I477F.Table IVProgesterone hydroxylation at 150 ॖm substrate and steady-state kinetics and regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity2B1dH mutantsProgesterone hydroxylation4-aResults are the means of two independent experiments.

Thekcat for progesterone 21-hydroxylation by Q/V103I/I477F and Q/V103I/S294D/I477F was 1.5- and 3-fold higher than that for 2C5dH, respectively. The Km for progesterone was largely unchanged from that of the mutants lacking V103I (Table Vversus Table IV). Addition of S294D to Q/I477F and Q/V103I/I477F yielded high P420, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” whereas addition of S294D/V367L to Q/V103I/I477F and Q/V103I/I477F/G478V yielded only P420 (data not shown). As expected based on the V367L and G478V single mutants, Q/V103I/V367L/I477F, Q/V103I/I477F/G478V, and Q/V103I/S294D/I477F/G478V showed much lower activity and regioselectivity for progesterone 21-hydroxylation compared with Q/V103I/I477F and Q/V103I/S294D/I477F (Table V).

To explain the changes in regioselectivity observed for progesterone in 2B1 Q/V103I/S294D/I477F, a molecular model was constructed. Fig.6 (A and B) shows progesterone docked into the active site of the wild-type 2B1 and 2B1 Q/V103I/S294D/I477F models, respectively. The substrate fit well in the wild-type 2B1 active site, with no van der Waals overlaps when docked in an orientation that leads to formation of 16α-hydroxyprogesterone (Fig. 6A). However, the substrate did not fit in a 21-OH orientation. The estimated angle (C-H-ferryl oxygen) and distance (between C-16 and ferryl oxygen) in 2B1 are 153.0° and 4.43 Å, respectively. Active-site residues Ile114, Phe206, Phe297, Val363, and Ile477 are within 5 Å of the substrate. In contrast, progesterone fit well in the 2B1 Q/V103I/S294D/I477F active site when docked in a 21-OH orientation, but not in a 16α-OH orientation (Fig.6B). The estimated angle (C-H-ferryl oxygen) and distance (between C-21 and ferryl oxygen) are 160.6° and 3.69 Å, respectively. These are close to the angle and distance required for hydrogen bond formation (180° and 3.7 Å, respectively) and are similar to those for 2C5 (Ref. 1Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar and data not shown). Active-site residues Ile103, Ala114, Val206, Asp294, Gly297, Leu363, and Phe477 are within 5 Å of the substrate, with Ala114 and Phe477 lying closest at 3 Å. Our modeling results are consistent with the biochemical data that 2B1 favors 16α-hydroxylation, whereas 2B1 Q/V103I/S294D/I477F favors the formation of 21-hydroxyprogesterone. Consistent with the experimental data, modeling of progesterone in 2B1 mutants that included V367L and/or G478V along with Q/V103I/S294D/I477F showed poor fits (data not shown). This suggests that V367L and G478V mutations, either individually or in combination with others, change the active-site structure in a way that is unfavorable for progesterone 21-hydroxylation. The recent elucidation of the x-ray crystal structure of the first mammalian P450 (rabbit 2C5) has sparked intense interest in understanding the structural basis of P450 function to facilitate drug discovery/design and engineering of novel biocatalysts (1Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). This breakthrough has led to advanced homology models of drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450, especially the enzymes from the P450 2 subfamily, relative to those constructed based on bacterial enzymes (25Lewis D.F.V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The P450 2C5 crystal structure has also provided an enhanced framework for identifying active-site residues and investigating their role in differential substrate specificities and stereo- and regioselectivity across subfamilies (2Domanski T.L. Halpert J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Spatzenegger M. Liu H. Wang Q. Debarber A. Koop D.R. Halpert J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies and more recently by analogy with 2C5, 13 2B1 active-site residues have been identified, nine of which differ from those of 2C5 (2Domanski T.L. Halpert J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present study, 2B1 residues have been replaced systematically by the corresponding active-site residues of 2C5 to confer a novel progesterone hydroxylase activity (progesterone 21-hydroxylation). The major finding is that simultaneous substitution of seven 2B1 active-site residues (positions 103, 114, 206, 294, 297, 363, and 477) with the corresponding 2C5 residues resulted in a 3-fold higherkcat for progesterone 21-hydroxylation compared with 2C5 with 807 regioselectivity. However, the Kmfor the substrate remained an order of magnitude higher than that for 2C5. Consistent with the experimental data, substrate docking in the active site of a model of the multiple mutant showed that the formation of 21-hydroxyprogesterone is favored, unlike wild-type 2B1, which favors 16α-hydroxyprogesterone. To produce a 2B1 multiple mutant with the desired phenotype, a three-tiered approach was used. First, 2B1 single mutants were made at all nine non-identical active-site positions, and three mutants that showed progesterone 21-hydroxylation (I114A, F297G, and V363L) and a fourth with a decreasedKm (F206V) were combined to yield a quadruple mutant. Second, additional substitutions (S294D and I477F) were added based on a 2C5-like testosterone hydroxylation profile. Finally, V103I, which had no effect on progesterone or testosterone hydroxylation profiles on its own, was added to Q/S294D/ I477F. New insights can be gained by comparing and contrasting the present study with our recent investigation of active-site determinants of specificity differences between P450 2B6 and 2E1 (22Spatzenegger M. Liu H. Wang Q. Debarber A. Koop D.R. Halpert J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In that case, a single point mutation at the alignment position corresponding to residue 477 in 2B enzymes conferred on 2E1 significant activity for the 2B6-selective substrate 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin and abolished activity for the 2E1-selective substratep-nitrophenol. However, none of six 2B6 single mutants gained activity for p-nitrophenol. The two major advances in this investigation were the focus on regioselectivity differences for a common substrate, progesterone, and the generation of multiple 2B mutants, many of which included substitutions that, on their own, did not enhance the activity of interest. Based on the results, it appears that, in addition to direct interactions of active-site residues with substrate, residue-residue interactions and/or an influence of active-site backbone residues on orientation of the substrate may also be important (4Haseman C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 24Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Residue-residue interactions have been implicated in determining stereo- and regioselectivity for androstenedione hydroxylation and differential inhibition by 4-phenylimidazole in 2B4 and 2B5 (7He Y.Q. Szklarz G.D. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For example, mutagenesis experiments and molecular modeling suggest that the side chains of residues 114 and 294 in 2B4 and 2B5 move in concert to influence the 4-phenylimidazole binding orientation (24Spatzenegger M. Wang Q. He Y.Q. Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present case, there were increases in progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity of 10-, 2-, and 3-fold upon addition of F206V to I114A/F297G/V363L, I477F to I114A/F206V/F297G/V363L, and V103I to Q/I477F, respectively, even though F206V, I477F, and V103I alone showed negligible progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity. These observations may reflect an additional interaction between Phe477 and/or Phe206 and progesterone that leads to tighter packing in the active site and an increased frequency of productive collisions (Fig. 6). Ile103 is also closer to progesterone in Q/V103I/S294D/I477F compared with 2B1. The almost complete conversion of stereoselectivity for testosterone 16-hydroxylation by 2B1 S294D, V363L, and I477F to that of 2C5 aided in making multiple mutants with higher progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity and regioselectivity. However, it should be recognized that the 2C5-like testosterone hydroxylation profiles of S294D, V367L, and I477F resulted from abolished testosterone 16α-hydroxylase activity and enhanced 16औ-hydroxylase activity, rather than acquisition of a novel activity as with progesterone 21-hydroxylation by I114A, F297G, and V363L. There are numerous prior examples of stereoselective loss of activity upon single amino acid substitutions in bacterial and mammalian P450 enzymes (28Halpert J.R. He Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4453-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lindberg R.L. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 41Uno T. Mitchell E. Aida K. Lambert M.H. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3193-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, F206V exhibited a novel activity with both progesterone and testosterone along with greatly suppressed original activities. Residue 206 in 2B1 has previously been shown to be critical in converting steroid 16- to 15α-hydroxylation (21Luo Z. He Y.A. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the analogous residue in 2a4 and 2a5 is a major determinant of differences in substrate specificity (40Lindberg R.L. Negishi M. Nature. 1989; 339: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The F205V substitution in 2C5 results in almost a complete loss of progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity and gain of new activity, suggesting that this residue is critical in determining P450 regioselectivity (26Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the structural basis for these observations remains unclear. In the absence of deleterious steric interactions with 2B1, the more hydrophobic progesterone should be characterized by a lowerKm compared with testosterone, as observed with 2C5. However, wild-type 2B1 exhibited a 7-fold higher Kmfor progesterone than for testosterone. This suggests that the larger 17औ-acetyl group in progesterone, as opposed to the hydroxyl group in testosterone, clashes with one or more residues in the 2B1 active site. Furthermore, a F206V substitution in 2B1, either individually or in combination with I114A, I114A/F297G, or I114A/V363L, decreased theKm for progesterone by 6–13-fold, suggesting a major role of Val206 in determining affinity. Other multiple mutants that included F206V exhibited an increasedKm, which may be due to the occurrence of additional unfavorable interactions. The Km is generally affected by parameters such as size, shape, and hydrophobicity of the substrate and of active-site residues (42Negishi M. Uno T. Darden T.A. Sueyoshi T. Pedersen L.G. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A similar Phe-to-Val substitution at residue 226 in P450 1A2 (analogous to residue 206 in 2B1) has also been shown to have a strong bearing on substrate affinity (43Parikh A. Josephy P.D. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5283-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An excellent correlation has been observed betweenKm values and side chain size at residue 209 in P450 2a5 (analogous to residue 206 in 2B1), in which theKm values decrease as the side chains become larger regardless of the hydrophobicity (44Juvonen R.O. Iwasaki M. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16431-16435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger side chain of Phe206 in 2B1 may interact sterically with the additional acetyl group in progesterone compared with testosterone (Fig. 6) (1Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The F206V substitution may provide more room for entry in a particular orientation leading to increased affinity for substrate. In summary, our results demonstrate that active-site residues are mainly responsible for determining differences in regioselectivity for progesterone hydroxylation between 2B1 and 2C5. A synergistic effect on progesterone 21-hydroxylation activity and regioselectivity by certain multiple substitutions suggests a role of residue-residue interactions in determining active-site topology and substrate orientation. This report suggests the feasibility of rational redesign of mammalian P450 specificity based on analogy with P450 2C5, as previously performed for bacterial P450 enzymes of known three-dimensional structure (45Miles C.S. Ost T.W.B. Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Chapman S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 383-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This approach provides an excellent complement to directed evolution by random mutagenesis, which tends to mainly pinpoint non-active-site residues (46Farinas E.T. Bulter T. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 47Cirino P.C. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We thank Drs.

These biological actions of IFN-γ are characterized by both the activation and the inhibition of gene transcription. Unfortunately, in contrast to gene activation, the mechanisms through which the cytokine suppresses gene transcription remain largely unclear. We show here for the first time that exposure of macrophages to IFN-γ leads to a dramatic induction in the expression of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), a potent inhibitor of gene transcription. In addition, a synergistic action of IFN-γ and calcium in the activation of ICER expression was identified. The IFN-γ-mediated activation of ICER expression was not blocked by H89, bisindoylmaleimide, SB202190, PD98059, W7, and AG490, which inhibit protein kinase A, protein kinase C, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and Janus kinase-2, respectively. In contrast, apigenin, a selective casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor, was found to inhibit response. Consistent with this finding, IFN-γ stimulated CK2 activity and the level of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein, which is known to induce ICER gene transcription, and this response was inhibited in the presence of apigenin. These studies, therefore, identify a previously uncharacterized pathway, involving the IFN-γ-mediated stimulation of CK2 activity, activation of cAMP response element-binding protein, and increased production of ICER, which may then play an important role in the inhibition of macrophage gene transcription by this cytokine.

Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins belong to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) class of transcription factors and bind to the cAMP-response elements (CREs) in the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes (1Shaywitz A.J.

Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased level of cAMP induces the trans-activation potential of these proteins by a protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of a critical serine residue (Ser-133 in CREB) (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, activation can also be triggered via phosphorylation by other kinases, including protein kinase C, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, casein kinase 2, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation, heterodimerization between the different family members has a profound effect on the regulation of cAMP-mediated gene transcription (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CREM gene encodes multiple members by alternative splicing and internal transcriptional initiation through the use of two promoters (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

These proteins act as both activators and antagonists of cAMP-mediated gene transcription, with inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) being the most potent repressor (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

ICER is produced from an internal CREM gene promoter (P2), which, in contrast to the P1 promoter that produces all CREM isoforms, contains CREs (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The ICER protein consists mainly of the bZIP domain and, therefore, represses transcription either by heterodimerization with activating forms of CREB/CREM/ATF or other bZIP-containing transcription factors, or by competition with these proteins for DNA binding (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of cAMP-induced ICER expression is typical of early response genes, with maximal expression levels being attained within 3–6 h of stimulation (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 2De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

ICER then inhibits both its own transcription and the expression of other CRE-containing promoters (1Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev.

Our laboratory is interested in understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of macrophage gene expression by cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (e.g. Refs. 12Hughes T.R.

This cytokine is a key modulator of the immune and inflammatory responses along with numerous other cellular actions during physiological and pathophysiological conditions (17Boehm U. Klamp T.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Such biological responses are characterized by the transcriptional activation and the inhibition of numerous genes (17Boehm U.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which IFN-γ induces gene transcription have been investigated over the last decade and identified a key role for the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway (18Stark G.R.

However, several recent studies, including gene expression profiling on STAT-1-deficient cells, have revealed the existence of STAT-1-independent pathways (20Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D.

In addition, although IFN-γ suppresses the expression of numerous genes, little is understood of the corresponding mechanisms, which may be the result, at least in part, of limited research on this aspect that has been carried out to date. Further studies are required, especially in the light of the potential biological importance of such regulation. For example, IFN-γ has been shown to inhibit macrophage foam cell formation, a critical early event in atherogenesis, at least in part by suppressing the expression of several genes that are involved in the uptake of lipoproteins, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL), very low density lipoprotein receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and the scavenger receptors A and CD136 (12Hughes T.R.

During the course of our studies on the regulation of macrophage gene expression by IFN-γ, we were intrigued by the presence of ICER binding sites in the promoter regions of many IFN-γ inhibited genes, 2J. R. Mead and D. P. Ramji, unpublished observations. the co-regulation of some of these genes by cAMP (e.g. LPL) (28Desanctis J.B. Varesio L. Radzioch D. Immunology. 1994; 81: 605-610PubMed Google Scholar), and a study demonstrating the ability of IFN-γ to suppress CRE- or the bZIP-containing AP1-regulated promoters (29Saavedra A.P. Cass L.A. Prendergast G.V. Meinkoth J.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 606-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and wondered whether this cytokine induces ICER expression. We present here studies that investigate the IFN-γ-ICER link in detail. We show for the first time that IFN-γ produces a dramatic increase in ICER expression in macrophages, and acts in a synergistic manner with agents that induce intracellular calcium levels. In addition, we identify the mechanisms through which IFN-γ induces ICER expression. The studies, therefore, indicate the existence of a potentially novel pathway for IFN-γ-mediated suppression of macrophage gene transcription. The mouse macrophage J774.2 cell line was from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. Recombinant human and mouse IFN-γ was from Peprotech. All the cell culture reagents were purchased from Greiner, Helena Biosciences, or Invitrogen. Antisera against CREM-1 (X-12), phospho-CREB, and CK2-α subunit along with the protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz. The purified CK2 enzyme and the TnTTM coupled in vitrotranscription/translation kit were from Promega. The pharmacological agents SB202190, PD98059, AG490, thapsigargin, A23187, forskolin, bisindoylmaleimide, and H89 were from Calbiochem whereas the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), apigenin, β-casein, and the Greiss reagent were purchased from Sigma. The J774.2 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which was supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (56 °C, 45 min), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (designated as complete medium). The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. For human monocyte-derived macrophages, blood was collected from healthy volunteers into a syringe containing an equal volume of sterile 2% (w/v) dextran in 1× PBS containing 0.8% (w/v) trisodium citrate and was allowed to stand for 30 min to permit erythrocyte sedimentation. The upper layer was collected, underlayered with LymphoprepTM (Nycomed Pharmaceuticals) (2:1 (v/v) supernatant:LymphoprepTM) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min. The resultant interface was collected and washed six to eight times with PBS, 0.4% (w/v) trisodium citrate to remove contaminating platelets. Monocytes were plated out in six-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) in complete medium, as above except containing 10% (v/v) human serum, and were allowed to adhere to the surface for 6 h in a humid incubator at 37 °C containing 5% (v/v) CO2. The cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove any other mononuclear cells, and fresh medium was added. The homogeneity of macrophages was verified by morphological analysis. Before stimulation with the mediators, the cells were washed twice with complete medium and then incubated for the requisite time in fresh complete medium. For experiments involving the use of inhibitors against key components of known signal transduction pathways, these were added to the cells 1 h before the mediator (i.e.pretreatment). The mediators or inhibitors were used at the following concentration: 8-Br-cAMP (300 μm), A23187 (5 μm), AG490 (100 μm), apigenin (0–40 μm), bisindoylmaleimide (1 μm), forskolin (20 μm), H89 (20 μm), IFN-γ (1000 units/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), PD98059 (50 μm), PMA (0.16 or 1 μm), SB202190 (10 μm), thapsigargin (0.5 μm), and W7 (25 μm). Total cellular RNA was prepared using the RNeasyTM total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Each isolated RNA sample (1 μg) was then subjected to RT-PCR essentially as described before (16Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Ranki H. Cryer A. Ramji D.P.

These conditions were in the exponential phase of amplification and, therefore, provided a direct correlation between the amount of products and RNA template abundance in the samples.

The PCR products were size-fractionated on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel, photographed using a Syngene gel documentation system (GRI), converted to an uncompressed TIFF file format, and quantified using the Quantiscan computer package (Biosoft). J774.2 macrophages were stimulated for 12 h with 8-Br-cAMP and, following isolation of RNA and cDNA synthesis as above, the ICER I/Iγ isoforms were amplified using primers containingBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to facilitate the cloning into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) in the correct orientation (5′-ACTTTAGGATCCACTGTGGTACGGCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGAATTCCCAATTCACACTCTACAGCAG-3′, with the restriction endonuclease sites shown in bold) (39Tinti C.

The amplification product (∼530 bp) was purified, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector that had been previously digested with the same enzymes. In vitro transcription and translation was carried out using the TnTTMcoupled reticulocyte lysate system using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). The recombinant protein was labeled with [35S]methionine (40 μCi) to aid detection. Nuclear and whole cell extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (12Hughes T.R.

Protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml I-S soybean trypsin inhibitor) and DTT (0.5 mm) were added to all buffers before use. Where the maintenance of proteins in the phosphorylated state was desired (e.g. immunodetection of phosphorylated protein), whole cell extracts were made in a buffer containing both phosphatase and protease inhibitors (43Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, containing 10 mm sodium fluoride and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and then scraped off in 500 μl of phosphatase-free whole cell extraction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 μm zinc chloride, 100 μmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, 2.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After vortexing for 45 s at 4 °C, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots were immediately frozen at −70 °C until use.

The blotted membranes were incubated first for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution (1× TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) to reduce any nonspecific interaction of the antiserum with the membrane. Following three washes of 5 min each with 1× TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h in 1× TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. After washes as above, the membrane was incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG or mouse anti-goat IgG) for 30 min at room temperature in 1× TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. After washing once more as above, the membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and XAR sensitive film (Eastman Kodak Co.).

In this study, we have identified a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the regulation of interleukin 1 (IL-1) expression by macrophages in response to dsRNA and viral infection. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells or mouse macrophages with dsRNA stimulates ERK phosphorylation that is first apparent following a 15-min incubation and persists for up to 60 min, the accumulation of iNOS and IL-1 mRNA following a 6-h incubation, and the expression of iNOS and IL-1 at the protein level following a 24-h incubation. Inhibitors of ERK activation prevent dsRNA-induced ERK phosphorylation and IL-1 expression by macrophages. The regulation of macrophage activation by ERK appears to be selective for IL-1, as ERK inhibition does not attenuate dsRNA-induced iNOS expression by macrophages. dsRNA stimulates both ERK activation and IL-1 expression by macrophages isolated from dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-deficient mice, indicating that PKR does not participate in this antiviral response. These findings support a novel PKR-independent role for ERK in the regulation of the antiviral response of IL-1 expression and release by macrophages.

Nitric oxide appears to play a primary role in host defense against a viral infection as the inhibitory actions of IFN-γ-activated macrophages on viral replication are mediated by nitric oxide (13Bukrinsky M.I. Nottet H.S. Schmidtmayerova H. Dubrovsky L. Flanagan C.R. Mullins M.E. Lipton S.A. Gendelman H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 14Kreil T.R. Eibl M.M.

Also, iNOS-deficient mice have higher mortality rates and reduced viral clearance as compared with wild-type mice following virus infection (17Flodstrom M. Horwitz M.S. Maday A. Balakrishna D. Rodriguez E. Sarvetnick N. Virology. 2001; 281: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Reiss C.S. Komatsu T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zaragoza C.

These findings support a role for nitric oxide, produced following iNOS expression, in the antiviral response. The molecular mechanisms by which viral infection or dsRNA stimulates iNOS and IL-1 expression by macrophages are not well-defined. We have shown that dsRNA-induced iNOS and IL-1 expression by RAW 264.7 cells is prevented by the expression of dominant negative (dn) PKR, and that this PKR dependence can be overcome by IFN-γ (4Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulate iNOS expression to similar levels in peritoneal macrophages (PEC) isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice (4Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that PKR may participate in, but is not essential for, dsRNA-induced iNOS expression. In contrast, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation appears to be required for iNOS and IL-1 expression by macrophages. Inhibition of NF-κB activation prevents iNOS and IL-1 expression stimulated by dsRNA in RAW 264.7 cells and dsRNA + IFN-γ in primary macrophages (9Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). NF-κB is comprised of heterodimer or homodimers of the p50/NF-κB1 and p65/RelA subunits and is sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in complex with inhibitor protein κB (IκB, Ref. 20Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). Pathways that stimulate the activation of NF-κB are characterized by IκB phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and degradation by the 26 S proteasome complex (21Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This allows for the release of NF-κB and its translocation to the nucleus. PKR has been implicated in the activation of NF-κB, either by directly stimulating IκB phosphorylation or by activating IκB kinase (IKK) through physical interaction (22Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J.

Recent studies have identified a PKR-independent pathway that results in the activation of NF-κB by dsRNA. Magun and co-workers (25Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown that dsRNA and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection stimulates NF-κB activation to similar levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice. In addition, dsRNA stimulates IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear localization to similar levels in macrophages and islets of Langerhans isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice (4Maggi Jr., L.B.

Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and MAPK have been implicated in the regulation of iNOS and IL-1 expression (29Pahan K.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar). The role of PKR in dsRNA-induced MAPK kinase activation is less clear. It was first shown that dsRNA stimulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 activation in MEF. In these studies, dsRNA-induced p38 activation was attenuated in PKR−/− MEF while JNK appeared to be activated by a PKR-independent mechanism (24Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). More recently, dsRNA and viral infection have been shown to stimulate p38 and JNK activation in MEF isolated from PKR−/− mice. While JNK activation appears to require a PKR-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis (25Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), p38 activation by dsRNA is not dependent on PKR or PKR-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis (25Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). While these findings indicate that MAPK are activated by dsRNA, the role of PKR and the mechanisms by which PKR may mediate MAPK activation have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, the role of the MAPK pathway, specifically ERK, in dsRNA-induced macrophage activation has been examined. We show that the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) selective inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 prevent dsRNA- and virus-induced ERK phosphorylation, IL-1 expression, IL-1औ reporter activity, and IL-1 release by macrophages. The role of ERK in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression in response to virus infection appears to be selective for the IL-1 pathway, as ERK inhibition does not affect the ability of dsRNA to stimulate iNOS expression or nitrite production by macrophages. Using peritoneal macrophages isolated from PKR+/+ and PKR−/−mice we show that the genetic absence of PKR does not modulate the ability of dsRNA to induce IL-1 expression and release or to stimulate ERK phosphorylation. These findings support a role for ERK activation in the PKR-independent regulation of the antiviral response of IL-1 expression and release by macrophages.

The B-strain of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was the generous gift of Dr. J. W. Yoon (University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). All other reagents were obtained from commercially available sources. RAW 264.7 and RINm5F cells were removed from growth flasks by treatment with 0.057 trypsin, 0.027 EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with media and plated at the indicated concentrations. The cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h under an atmosphere of 57 CO2, 957 air before the initiation of experiments. Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice by lavage as previously described (37Beckerman K.P. Rogers H.W. Corbett J.A. Schreiber R.D. McDaniel M.L. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 888-895PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, 4 × 105cells/condition were incubated in 400 ॖl of complete CMRL-1066 (CMRL-1066 containing 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1×l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin) for 2 h under an atmosphere of 57 CO2, 957 air. The cells were washed three times with 400 ॖl of complete CMRL-1066 to remove non-adherent cells before initiation of experiments. RAW 264.7 cells (4 × 105/400 ॖl of DME) were infected with the indicated amounts of EMCV virus in 100 ॖl of DME for 30 min, 300 ॖl of DME was added, and the cells were incubated for 24 additional hours. EMCV was propagated as previously described (15Hirasawa K. Jun H.S. Han H.S. Zhang M.L. Hollenberg M.D. Yoon J.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8541-8548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrite production was determined by the Greiss assay, and IL-1 release was measured using the RINm5F cell bioassay as previously described (38Hill J.R. Corbett J.A. Baldwin A.C. McDaniel M.L. Anal.

Total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to High Bond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) under semidry conditions as previously described (9Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Antigen detection was by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA was isolated from RAW 264.7 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR were performed using iNOS, IL-1α, IL-1औ, cyclophilin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probes as previously described (9Heitmeier M.R.

RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with 1 ॖg of the human IL-1औ luciferase reporter (positions −3757 to +11; XL-LUC) and 1 ॖg of the pCMV-SPORT-औ-galactosidase (Invitrogen) control plasmid using the Qiagen Superfect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After an 8-h incubation at 37 °C experiments were initiated by addition of poly(IC) or poly(IC) and U0126 as indicated in the figure legends. Twenty-four hours after stimulation, the cells were harvested and lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). औ-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (41Baldassare J.J. Bi Y. Bellone C.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5367-5373PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activities are reported relative to औ-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiencies. The K71R mutation in human ERK1 was made using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuickChange PCR-plasmid mutagenesis kit using 5′-TGGCCATCAGAAAGATCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGATCTTTCTGATGGCCA-3′ (mutated bases in bold) primers according to the manufacturer's specifications. This mutation, which was confirmed by sequence analysis, has previously been shown to inhibit ERK kinase activity (42Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with 2 ॖg of wild-type ERK1 or ERK1(K71R) using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C, poly(IC) was added, and the cells were cultured for 30 additional min. The cells were then harvested, ERK was immunoprecipitated, and the ability of immunoprecipitated ERK to phosphorylate myelin basic protein was examined as previously described (42Weber J.D. Hu W.

Autoradiograms were scanned into NIH Image version 1.59 using a COHU high performance CCD camera (Brookfield, WI) and densities determined using NIH Image version 1.59 software. Macrophage activation in response to dsRNA includes the expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide (9Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Kreil T.R. Eibl M.M. Virology. 1996; 219: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Also, dsRNA and viral infection have been shown to stimulate ERK activation in macrophages (15Hirasawa K. Jun H.S. Han H.S. Zhang M.L. Hollenberg M.D. Yoon J.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8541-8548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 27Harcourt J.L. Offermann M.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and LPS-induced iNOS expression is sensitive to ERK inhibition (43Chan E.D. Morris K.R. Belisle J.T. Hill P. Remigio L.K. Brennan P.J. Riches D.W. Inf. Immun. 2001; 69: 2001-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential role of ERK in dsRNA-induced macrophage activation was examined using selective inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) of MEK, the upstream kinase that is responsible for the activation of ERK. Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with 50 ॖg/ml poly(IC) results in the accumulation of iNOS mRNA following a 6-h incubation, the expression of iNOS at the protein level and a 5-fold increase in nitrite production following a 24-h incubation (Fig. 1,A–C). The ERK selective inhibitor U0126, at concentrations of 0.01–5 ॖm, does not attenuate iNOS mRNA accumulation, iNOS protein expression, or nitrite production by RAW 264.7 cells. Similar results for nitrite production and iNOS expression were obtained with the second MEK inhibitor, PD98059 at concentrations of 0.1–10 ॖm (data not shown). MEK inhibition slightly increases the levels of nitrite produced by RAW 264.7 cells treated with poly(IC); however, this minor increase did not achieve statistical significance. A second antiviral response activated by dsRNA in macrophages is the expression and release of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1 (4Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A 24-h incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with poly(IC) (50 ॖg/ml) results in an ∼50-fold increase in IL-1 release and the accumulation of pro-IL-1औ protein (Fig. 2, Aand B, respectively). Consistent with IL-1 release, treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with poly(IC) stimulates the accumulation of both IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis following a 6-h incubation, and IL-1औ luciferase reporter activity following a 24-h incubation (Fig. 2, C andD, respectively). The MEK selective inhibitor U0126 attenuates poly(IC)-induced IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA accumulation, IL-1औ promoter activity, pro-IL-1औ protein expression, and IL-1 release by RAW 264.7 cells, with maximal inhibition at 5 ॖm. To confirm these findings the effects of a second MEK selective inhibitor, PD98059 on IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA, and protein expression in response to poly(IC) treatment was examined. PD98059 at 10 ॖm inhibits poly(IC)-induced IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA accumulation and pro-IL-1औ protein expression (Fig.3, A and B). To confirm the selectivity of the ERK inhibitors, the effects of PD98509 and U0126 on dsRNA-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation were examined. At concentrations that prevent dsRNA-induced IL-1α and IL-1औ expression, PD98059 (10 ॖm, Fig. 3C) and U0126 (5 ॖm, data not shown) do not attenuate poly(IC)-stimulated p38 or JNK phosphorylation. These findings suggest that dsRNA selectively regulates iNOS and IL-1 expression by macrophages, in that ERK appears to participate in the transcriptional activation of IL-1 but does not regulate iNOS expression in response to dsRNA. To confirm that poly(IC) recapitulates host responses to a viral infection; the effects of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection on the expression of IL-1औ by RAW 264.7 cells were evaluated. As shown in Fig.4A, infection of RAW 264.7 cells with EMCV stimulates the accumulation of IL-1औ following a 24-h incubation. Importantly, EMCV-induced IL-1औ expression is attenuated by U0126 (5 ॖm, Fig. 4B) at a concentration that prevents poly(IC)-induced IL-1 expression by RAW 264.7 cells (Fig.2). These findings indicate that EMCV and poly(IC) elicit similar antiviral responses in RAW 264.7 cells and provide additional evidence to support a role for ERK in the regulation of IL-1औ expression by macrophages in response to a viral infection. To confirm that U0126 prevents ERK activation, the effects of this MEK kinase inhibitor on ERK phosphorylation were examined by Western blot analysis. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells for 30 min with poly(IC) (50 ॖg/ml) results in the phosphorylation of ERK, an effect that is prevented by U0126 at concentrations (5 ॖm) that inhibit dsRNA-induced IL-1 expression and release (Fig.5A). In a similar manner PD98059 (10 ॖm) prevents poly(IC)-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (data not shown). Consistent with the stimulatory actions of poly(IC) on ERK phosphorylation, dsRNA activates ERK as determined by immunocomplex kinase assays. For these experiments, RAW 264.7 cells, transiently transfected with either wild type or dnERK (ERK1(K71R)), were incubated with or without poly(IC) for 30 min, and then the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by immunoprecipitated ERK was examined. A 30-min incubation with poly(IC) stimulates an ∼4.5-fold increase in ERK activity (myelin basic protein phosphorylation) in RAW 264.7 cells expressing wild-type ERK; however, poly(IC) fails to stimulate myelin basic protein phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells expressing dnERK (Fig. 5B). In this immunocomplex kinase assay wild type and dnERK are expressed at levels 2–3-fold higher than the levels of endogenous ERK (Fig. 5B,inset). RT-PCR was used to examine the role of ERK in the regulation of IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA accumulation by macrophages in response to dsRNA and EMCV infection. A 6-h incubation with poly(IC) results in the accumulation of both IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with wild-type ERK (Fig. 5C). In contrast, IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA accumulation is attenuated in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with dnERK. In a similar fashion, EMCV-induced IL-1α and IL-1औ mRNA accumulation is attenuated in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with dnERK (Fig. 5D). The transfection efficiency in these experiments was greater then 707 (as determined by औ-galactosidase staining, and the levels of wild type and dnERK expression were comparable to those shown in Fig.5B, inset). These findings indicated that dsRNA stimulates ERK activation and provide further evidence to support a role for ERK in the regulation of dsRNA- and EMCV-induced IL-1 expression by macrophages. Consistent with the lack of a role for ERK in dsRNA-induced iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells, U0126 (5 ॖm) does not modulate poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced nitrite production (Fig. 6A) or iNOS expression (Fig. 6B) by PEC isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice. In contrast to RAW 264.7 cells, naive mouse peritoneal macrophages require two proinflammatory signals for iNOS expression and nitrite production (44Hibbs J.B.J. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Granger D.L. Draiper J.-C. Amber I.J. Lancaster J.R.J. Moncada S. Higgs E.A. Nitric oxide from L-Arginine: A Bioregulatory System. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York, NY1990: 189-223Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that neither poly(IC) nor IFN-γ alone stimulate iNOS expression or nitric oxide production by PEC (4Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,9Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also, we have shown that PKR is not required for poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse PEC (4Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While ERK does not appear to participate in the regulation of iNOS expression, it is required for poly(IC) and poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced IL-1 release by mouse macrophages. Treatment of PEC isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice for 24 h with either poly(IC) or poly(IC) + IFN-γ results in the release of IL-1 to similar levels, and this IL-1 release is prevented by U0126 (Fig.7A). U0126 also prevents poly(IC) (data not shown) and poly(IC) + IFN-γ-induced IL-1औ protein accumulation in PEC isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice (Fig. 7B). These findings, which are consistent with the inhibitory actions of U0126 on IL-1 expression and release by RAW 264.7 cells, support a PKR-independent role for ERK in dsRNA-induced IL-1 expression and release by primary mouse macrophages. To confirm that dsRNA stimulates ERK activation, and to determine if PKR is required for this activation, the effects of poly(IC) on ERK phosphorylation by PEC isolated from PKR−/− and PKR+/+ mice were examined. As shown in Fig. 7C, poly(IC) stimulates the time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK that is first apparent following a 15-min incubation and that persists for up to 60 min. PKR does not appear to participate in ERK activation, as poly(IC) stimulates ERK phosphorylation to similar levels in PEC isolated form PKR−/− and PKR+/+mice. In addition, the stimulatory actions of a 30-min incubation with poly(IC) on ERK phosphorylation are prevented by U0126 (5 ॖm, Fig. 7D). These findings indicate that the presence of PKR is not required for the activation of ERK by dsRNA in PEC. Recently, Magun and co-workers (25Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have proposed that dsRNA triggers two separate antiviral programs, cell suicide (apoptosis), and a survival pathway associated with proinflammatory cytokine production. At the core of this proposal is the ability of PKR to regulate each of these antiviral responses. The first antiviral pathway is that of apoptosis, a process of self-elimination that removes virally infected cells. This pathway of programmed cell death is activated by dsRNA, is dependent on PKR (45Barber G.N. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 46Scarim A.L. Arnush M. Blair L.A. Concepcion J. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ryerse J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and appears to be a widely used antiviral response as evidenced by the multiple strategies used by viruses to evade apoptosis (Ref. 8Gale Jr., M. Katze M., G. Pharmacol. Therap. 1998; 78: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar and references therein). The second antiviral pathway activated by dsRNA or viral infection is the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferons and interleukins. The role of PKR in the regulation of cytokine expression has not been clearly defined, in part because of results that support or refute a role for PKR in the regulation of NF-κB and MAPK activation in response to dsRNA. PKR was originally believed to be required for dsRNA-induced NF-κB activation and p38 phosphorylation based on studies in MEF isolated from PKR−/− mice (24Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,35Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). More recently, dsRNA and EMCV infection have been shown to stimulate NF-κB and p38 activation in MEF isolated from PKR−/− mice to levels similar to MEF isolated from wild-type mice (25Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKR-independent pathways also participate in the antiviral response. In this study, we present evidence to further support the presence of a PKR-independent antiviral response pathway that is activated by viral infection and dsRNA and that regulates the expression and release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. We show that dsRNA treatment or EMCV infection stimulates IL-1 expression and release in an ERK-dependent fashion. Selective inhibition of MEK, the upstream ERK kinase, prevents dsRNA and EMCV-induced IL-1 expression and release. The role of ERK in regulating the antiviral response appears to be selective for IL-1 expression as MEK inhibition does not modulate dsRNA-induced iNOS expression or nitric oxide production by macrophages. PKR does not appear to be required for this response, as dsRNA stimulates ERK activation and ERK-dependent IL-1 expression by macrophages isolated from PKR−/− mice. These findings suggest that PKR is not required for the activation of ERK or the expression and release of IL-1 by macrophages in response to dsRNA or viral infection. However, this conclusion must be tempered by the possibility that other “PKR-like” molecules may compensate for the absence of PKR (in PKR-deficient macrophages), and the recent evidence that the PKR−/− mice used in this study may be incomplete knockouts (47Baltzis D. Li S. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38364-38372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In summary, these studies have identified a novel mechanism by which viral infection and dsRNA stimulate the expression and release of IL-1 by macrophages. dsRNA or EMCV infection stimulates ERK activation and ERK participates in the transcriptional regulation of IL-1 expression by macrophages. PKR does not appear to be required for dsRNA-induced ERK activation or the transcriptional activation of IL-1 expression. The downstream targets of ERK that regulate IL-1 expression in response to dsRNA and virus infection have yet to be defined. One likely candidate is PU.1, a member of the ets family of transcription factors, and a transcription factor known to participate in the activation of IL-1 expression in response to LPS. In support of a role for PU.1 in the regulation of virus-induced IL-1 expression, we have recently shown by gel shift analysis that poly(IC) stimulates the DNA binding activity of PU.1 in macrophages in an U0126-sensitive manner. 2L. B. Maggi and J. A. Corbett, unpublished observations. Additional transcription factors also participate in the regulation of IL-1 expression in response to dsRNA. Inhibitors of NF-κB have been shown to prevent dsRNA-induced IL-1 expression and release by mouse macrophages (9Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, interferon regulatory factor-4 in combination with PU.1 has been shown to synergistically activate the human IL-1 reporter by interacting at the distal PU.1 consensus binding element (32Marecki S. Riendeau C.J. Liang M.D. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 48Marecki S. Fenton M.J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 33: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Importantly, this transcriptional regulation of antiviral response genes following viral infection or treatment with dsRNA appears to be selective. We show that dsRNA-stimulated iNOS expression is not sensitive to inhibitors of ERK, while ERK inhibition prevents virus and dsRNA-stimulated IL-1 expression and release. Recently, we have identified a role for the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) in the regulation of dsRNA and EMCV-induced iNOS expression, and the role of iPLA2 in this antiviral response appears to be selective for iNOS as inhibitors of this phospholipase fail to modulate IL-1 expression in response to dsRNA (49Maggi L.B. Moran J.M. Scarim A.L. Ford D.A. Yoon J.W. Howat J.M. Buller R.M.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38449-38455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study we have not examined the upstream molecules that activate ERK; however, it is likely that the recently described receptor for dsRNA, TLR3 mediates ERK activation (50Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that activation of the antiviral responses is cell type selective and that the pathways that regulate specific antiviral responses may be selective for individual target genes or cellular responses.

https://openalex.org/W1981957327,"beta-Catenin is an intracellular multifunctional protein. In complex with the transmembrane adhesive receptor E-cadherin, it becomes plasma membrane-associated and mediates intercellular adhesion. A cytosolic pool of beta-catenin interacts with DNA-binding proteins and participates in signal transduction. To reveal the possible cross-talk between these two pools, we studied whether beta-catenin is exchanged between its free and cadherin-bound states. We found that pulse-labeled beta-catenin replaces the beta-catenin bound to the cell surface prebiotinylated E-cadherin immediately after synthesis. Approximately 25% of all pulse-labeled beta-catenin destined for E-cadherin associates with this protein via this mechanism. The rest of the newly synthesized beta-catenin arrives at the plasma membrane in a complex with the E-cadherin precursor. Immediately after arrival, this beta-catenin pool is transferred to the prebiotinylated E-cadherin. beta-Catenin released from E-cadherin may participate in new exchange cycles. This beta-catenin exchange is strongly affected in cells that contain mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC. This process may contribute significantly to both cell-cell adhesion and beta-catenin-dependent signaling."

The CDFs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) bind to a LIFR·gp130 receptor complex to activate Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways. Little is known about how these differentiation factors suppress noradrenergic properties. We used sympathetic neurons and SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells to investigate CDF down-regulation of the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH). LIF and CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 but not p38 or Jun N-terminal kinases in both cell types. Preventing ERK activation with PD98059 blocked CNTF suppression of DBH protein in sympathetic neurons but did not prevent the loss of DBH mRNA. CNTF decreased transcription of a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and this was also ERK-independent. Cytokine inhibition of DBH promoter activity did not require a silencer element but was prevented by overexpression of the transcriptional activator Phox2a. Inhibiting ERK activation increased basal DBH transcription in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and DBH mRNA in sympathetic neurons. Transfection of Phox2a into PD98059-treated M17 cells resulted in a synergistic increase in DBH promoter activity compared with Phox2a or PD98059 alone. These data suggest that CDFs down-regulate DBH protein via an ERK-dependent pathway but inhibit DBH gene expression through an ERK-independent pathway.

The developmental and injury-induced cholinergic differentiation factors that have been characterized to date are related to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The interleukin-6 cytokine family includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1, oncostatin M, and a sweat gland-derived differentiation factor. All interleukin-6 family members share the common signaling receptor gp130. Interleukin-6 uses a gp130 homodimer, whereas all other family members activate a gp130·LIFR heterodimer (3Baumann H.

Several IL-6 family members require an additional receptor subunit for cytokine binding, but signal transduction occurs through the gp130·LIFR complexes. Binding of these cytokines to their receptors induces dimerization of receptor subunits and activation of Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak1/Jak2 and Tyk2), which are constitutively associated with the receptors (9Stahl N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6376-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation by Jaks, STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to cytokine-responsive elements to induce gene transcription. Mitogen-activated protein kinases are serine/threonine kinases that exist in modules containing a three-kinase cascade. There are a least three classes of MAPKs activated in separate modules: ERKs, c-Jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs), and p38s (18Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers G.T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar). Each of these types of kinases can be activated by IL-6-related cytokines in different cell types. The induction of cholinergic and peptidergic properties in sympathetic neurons requires STAT activation and can be modified by stimulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (19Symes A. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to our knowledge of the signaling mechanisms that induce peptidergic properties, little is known about the mechanisms that suppress noradrenergic function. To identify the signaling pathways important for the loss of norepinephrine, we investigated the regulation of dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine. DBH is suppressed by cholinergic differentiation factors both in vivo (20Landis S.C. Siegel R.E. Schwab M. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and in vitro (21Cervini R. Berrard S. Bejanin S. Mallet J. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1346-1348PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as STATs typically induce transcription, we hypothesized that the suppression of DBH occurred primarily through a Ras/MAPK pathway. We investigated the role of MAPKs in cytokine-induced down-regulation of DBH mRNA and protein in sympathetic neurons. In addition, we examined cytokine regulation of DBH promoter activity in SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells. In both cell types we found that ERK1 and -2 were activated by LIF and CNTF, whereas p38 and JNKs were not. Surprisingly, preventing ERK activation blocked suppression of DBH protein but not the decrease in DBH mRNA or promoter activity. The chronic absence of ERK activity elevated basal DBH transcription and mRNA, suggesting that ERK inhibits basal DBH transcription but does not mediate the cytokine suppression of DBH mRNA.

Cells were preplated for 1–2 h to deplete non-neuronal cells and plated onto 96-well BioCoat plates or poly-l-lysine/laminin-coated plates at a density of 1000–2000 cells per well. Neurons were cultured in L-15 complete supplemented with 50 ng/ml NGF, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Prior to any treatments, neurons were maintained for 2 days in the antimitotic agents fluorodeoxyuridine and uridine (10 μm each) to further deplete non-neuronal cells. SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in 5% CO2.

A time course identified 15 min as the peak activity for LIF-activated phospho-ERK 1/2. Therefore, cytokines were added at the indicated concentration for 15 min.

Membranes were blocked in TBST (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk, and incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibodies against phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, or phospho-ERK 1/2, diluted 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies (diluted 1:5000 in TBST/5% nonfat milk) and washed with TBST, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Blots were stripped for 1 h at room temperature in stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.7% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol), followed by extensive washing in TBST. Phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK blots were re-assayed for phospho-ERK, while phospho-ERK blots were reincubated with a total ERK1/2 or ERK2 antibody (diluted 1:1000) in TBST/5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive bands visualized by chemiluminescence. Sympathetic neurons were treated 5–8 days with 50 or 100 ng/ml CNTF, with or without PD98059, as indicated in the figure legends. PD98059 was added 30 min prior to adding CNTF. PD98059 was added every other day, and media were replaced every 3–4 days. Cells were rinsed with PBS, and protein extracts were collected on ice in ERK lysis buffer. 5–10 μg of protein was diluted 1:2 with sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, sized-fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk/TBST, incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-DBH (diluted 1:1,000 in TBST/5% milk), washed, and incubated 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:10,000 in TBST/5% milk), and immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Band intensity was recorded by a −40 °C charge-coupled device camera, or Kodak X-Omat film, and analyzed using LabWorks software (UVP, Upland, CA). To quantify DBH protein levels, the band density obtained for DBH was normalized to the protein in that sample. An arbitrary value of 1 was assigned to the DBH value obtained in untreated control cultures. Total and mean band densities gave similar results. DNA used for transfection was purified using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit. M17 cells were plated at a density of 2–2.5 × 105 cells per well in six-well plates and immediately treated with cytokines and MEK inhibitors as described. 48 h after treatment/plating, media were removed, and cells were transfected by the CaPO4 method as previously described (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar, 26Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each cell was transfected with 1 μg of 394DBH-Luc, 1 μg of 232DBH-Luc, 1 μg of CyRE:VIP-Luc, or 1 μg of pGL3 basic, with 100 ng of pRL-null as a control for transfection efficiency, and 1 μg of pCMV-GFP DNA to bring the total to ∼2 μg. After a 4-h incubation with DNA, cells were shocked with 10% glycerol/PBS, washed with PBS, and put back into culture media containing cytokines and MEK inhibitors. Firefly luciferase activity from DBH-Luc or CyRE:VIP-Luc and Renilla luciferase activity from the pRL-null internal control were determined 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the Renillaluciferase values. Neurons were plated onto 12-mm round Biocoat coverslips in 24-well plates. After 2 days NGF was decreased from 50 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml and cells were treated with cytokines as described in the figure legend. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, and 29.5 mm sodium phosphate monobasic, pH 7.4. Cells were washed in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed in PBS and blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min and double-labeled with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 and mouse anti-ERK 2 diluted 1:100 in blocking solution. Proteins were visualized with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 diluted 1:300 and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Digital images were treated identically in Photoshop 6.0, so that the differences in immunofluorescence seen in the figure reflect actual changes within the cell. RNA and reverse transcription (RT) reactions were generated from individual wells of sympathetic neurons using the Cells-to-cDNA II kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. An RT-negative control was included for each set of cells to control for genomic DNA contamination. PCR was performed with the LightCycler-FastStart SYBR Green I PCR amplification kit in the Roche Applied Science LightCycler. For the PCR amplification, 2 μl of RT reactions was used in a total volume of 20 μl. Controls lacking template were included to determine the level of primer dimer formation and/or contamination. Each 20-μl reaction included 2.0 mmMgCl2 for GAPDH or 3 mm MgCl2 for DBH, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 2 μl of DNA Master. The intron-spanning rat GAPDH primers generate a 238-bp fragment (27Comer A.M. Gibbons H.M. Qi J. Kawai Y. Win J. Lipski J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protocol. 1999; 4: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar): 5′-CCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC and 3′-GCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC. The mouse DBH primers generate a 211-bp fragment: 5′-AAGGTGGTTACTGTGCTCGC and 3′-CACACATCTCCTCCAAGATTCC. GAPDH PCR parameters: denaturing at 94 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 0 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. DBH PCR parameters: denaturing at 94 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 0 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. The temperature transition rate was 20 °C/s. One fluorescence reading was taken after each cycle at the end of the 72 °C elongation time. Fluorescence was plotted as a function of cycle number, to determine when reactions were in the linear phase of amplification. To confirm that only specific PCR products were generated, a melt analysis was carried out to determine the specific Tm for each amplification product. Standard curves for DBH and GAPDH were generated by performing individual cells-to-cDNA reactions on known amounts of cells, ranging from 500 to 4000. A slope was generated from the standard curve PCR amplifications and unknown samples were compared with the known standard values. Values for DBH were normalized to GAPDH from the same sample. Analysis of variance was carried out using GraphPad Prism 3.0. The Dunnett post hoc test was used to compare treatments to the control, and Tukey's post hoc test to compare all conditions. LIF and CNTF activate Ras in cultured sympathetic neurons (28Schwarzschild M.A. Dauer W.T. Lewis S.E. Hamill L.K. Fink J.S. Hyman S.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and these cytokines can cause the activation of ERK, p38, and/or JNK MAPKs in different cell types (29Li W.Q. Dehnade F. Zafarullah M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3491-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Faris M. Ensoli B. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G. Nguyen A. Wang S. Nel A.E. AIDS. 1996; 10: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is not known which MAPKs are activated by LIF and CNTF in sympathetic neurons. In the absence of NGF, CNTF activates ERK1 and -2 in these cells (31Virdee K. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2159-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but NGF stimulates sustained activation of ERK1/2 (32Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that CNTF has little affect on ERK activity in the presence of NGF. Because suppression of DBH occurs over several days and the neurons must be maintained in NGF, we first tested whether LIF or CNTF stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in addition to that caused by NGF. A time course revealed that cytokines induced transient ERK phosphorylation that peaked between 10 and 15 min (data not shown). Treatment with either cytokine induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained using serum-free Opti-MEM, but subsequent experiments were carried out in the presence of serum. To determine if these cytokines also activated p38 or JNKs in sympathetic neurons, cells were stimulated for 15 min with LIF (10 ng/ml) or 1 h with anisomycin (10 μg/ml), a cell-permeable activator of p38 and JNK, as a positive control. LIF did not stimulate phosphorylation of either p38 (Fig. 1 B) or JNK (Fig.1 C). The lack of p38 or JNK phosphorylation was not due to a lack of cytokine activity, because all blots were stripped and reblotted with a phospho-ERK antibody, confirming that LIF had induced ERK phosphorylation. A total ERK 2 antibody was used on the same blots to confirm equivalent protein loading and transfer. Total ERK was used to control for protein loading, because total p38 levels were very low in these cells (data not shown and Ref. 33Eilers A. Whitfield J. Babij C. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that LIF and CNTF stimulated phosphorylation of ERK. To determine if phospho-ERK remained in the cytoplasm or translocated to the nucleus, neurons were treated for varying times with CNTF, and total and phospho-ERK were visualized by double-label immunofluorescence. CNTF-induced ERK phosphorylation was visible in both the neurites and in the cell soma within 15 min. Although some nuclear phospho-ERK was visible, widespread translocation of phospho-ERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was not observed up to 2 h after treatment (Fig. 2). To test whether ERKs were required for the LIF- or CNTF-mediated down-regulation of DBH protein, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was used to prevent phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2. 20 μmPD98059 was sufficient to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK induced by exposure to 100 ng/ml CNTF (Fig.3 A). Neurons were treated for 5–8 days with 100 ng/ml LIF or CNTF, with or without 20 μm PD98059. DBH levels were assessed by immunoblot analysis and normalized to total protein. Addition of PD98059 elevated basal levels of DBH and blocked the suppression of DBH by cytokines (Fig. 3, B and C). LIF and CNTF also decrease DBH mRNA in sympathetic neurons (21Cervini R. Berrard S. Bejanin S. Mallet J. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1346-1348PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these cytokines inhibit transcription of the DBH gene. To determine if this occurred, reporter assays were carried out with the DBH promoter in SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells (M17 cells). These cells express DBH mRNA (34Kim C.H. Kim H.S. Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6507-6518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as well as the receptor subunits required for LIF and CNTF signaling, 2S. Dziennis and B. Habecker, unpublished observations. suggesting that they are a suitable model for these studies. LIF stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but caused no detectable phosphorylation of p38 or JNKs in M17 cells (Fig. 4), indicating that LIF activated the same MAPK pathways in these cells as in sympathetic neurons. To determine if LIF or CNTF inhibited DBH transcription, M17 cells were treated for 2 days with cytokines and then transfected with a reporter construct containing the proximal 394 bp of the rat DBH promoter driving firefly luciferase (394DBH-Luc) (26Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with either LIF or CNTF resulted in decreased DBH promoter activity (Fig.5 A). As a positive control for cytokine treatments and cell viability, cells were transfected with a cytokine-responsive VIP promoter construct (CyRE:VIP-Luc) (35Symes A.J. Rao M.S. Lewis S.E. Landis S.C. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). VIP promoter activity was stimulated by the same treatments that inhibited DBH promoter activity (Fig. 5 B), indicating that cytokines did not disrupt cell viability or cause nonspecific suppression of transcription.Figure 5Cytokines decrease DBH transcription.M17 cells were grown in control medium or in medium containing 10 ng/ml LIF. After a two-day pretreatment, cells were transfected with 1 μg of 394DBH-Luc or the backbone vector pGL3-Luc (A) or 1 μg of CyRE:VIP-Luc (B) and 100 ng of pRL-null as an internal control. Luciferase activities were determined 48 h after transfection, and firefly luciferase was normalized toRenilla luciferase. Data are expressed as -fold induction and are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples. Experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. A, DBH promoter (394DBH-Luc) activity was decreased by LIF and CNTF pretreatment, but the vector alone control was unchanged. B, the cytokine response element from the VIP promoter (CyRE:VIP-Luc) was stimulated by LIF and CNTF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cytokines could suppress DBH transcription by inducing a repressor or by decreasing a transcriptional activator. The 394-bp rat DBH promoter construct used in this study contains a silencer region and several positive regulatory elements. The silencer region binds a suppressor protein, and induction of this repressor is one way that differentiation factors could inhibit DBH gene expression (26Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnani L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ishiguro H. Kim K.S. Joh T.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Afar R. Silverman R. Aguanno A. Albert V.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test whether induction or activation of a repressor protein was required for LIF down-regulation of DBH transcription, M17 cells were pretreated with LIF and then transfected with a 232-bp DBH-Luc construct lacking the silencer region. LIF decreased DBH promoter activity to the same extent in the presence or absence of the suppressor binding site (Fig.6 A). This suggests that cytokines inhibit DBH transcription through suppression of a transcriptional activator rather than induction of a transcriptional repressor. The homeodomain proteins Phox2a/Arix and Phox2b/NBPhox are required for basal expression o"

https://openalex.org/W2095218567,"2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), a compound found in cooked meat, is a mammary gland carcinogen in rats. Comparative genomic hybridization of PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas revealed loss in the centromeric region of 2q, a region known to carry the mammary carcinoma susceptibility 1 (Mcs1) gene and several other genes relevant to carcinogenesis. Allelic imbalance, specifically microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity, was examined in mammary gland carcinomas induced by PhIP in Sprague-Dawley (SD)xWistar Furth F1 hybrid rats. In a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay with 34 microsatellite markers coinciding to 2q11-2q16, nine markers revealed allelic imbalance. The frequency of imbalance in the tumors varied from 10 to 100% depending on the specific marker. However, none of the markers coinciding with the Mcs1 gene locus showed allelic imbalance, suggesting that alterations at this locus were not associated with PhIP-induced rat mammary gland cancer. The expression of several genes physically mapped to 2q11-2q16 and potentially involved in carcinogenesis including Ccnb (cyclin B1), Ccnh (cyclin H), Rasa (Ras GAP), Rasgrf2, Pi3kr1 (p85alpha), and Il6st (gp130) was also examined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) across a large bank of PhIP-induced SD rat mammary gland carcinomas. By quantitative real-time PCR, the mRNA expression of Rasa, Pi3kr1, Ccnh, and Il6st in carcinomas was, respectively, 22-, 20-, three- and threefold higher in carcinomas than in control mammary gland tissues (P<0.05, Student's t-test). A statistically sixfold lower expression of Rasgrf2 was detected in carcinomas whereas no significant change in Ccnb1 expression was observed. The findings from quantitative real-time PCR were confirmed by IHC for each gene. In addition, the proliferation index in mammary gland carcinomas as assessed by PCNA was found to correlate with the overexpression of Cyclin H by IHC analysis (P<0.05, Spearman Rank Order Correlation). The findings from the current study implicate molecular alterations in the proximal region of 2q in PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas."
